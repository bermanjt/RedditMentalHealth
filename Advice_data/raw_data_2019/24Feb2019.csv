0,"My sister has never been diagnosed with any kind of anxiety or mental disorder. However, she has always stressed excessively about every little thing, been socially challenged and as a result had MAJOR tantrums almost every day of her childhood (I mean swearing, spitting, door slamming - extreme sport level tantrums on the daily). 

If you don't believe me, she has been diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) by the Royal Melbourne Children's Hospital, which she now visits regularly to deal with the issue, literally because her level of stress uses so much energy. CFS is commonly seen in elite athletes because they push their bodies so far. So now, if she does too much e.g. she took a school trip to Europe and was sick with flu-like symptoms for a week after. She often gets sick, on a smaller scale after doing things like rollerskating, shopping for a day or if she's worrying about a school project that's due. Anyway, so that's sort of the result of the high level of stress she places herself under because she worries about every tiny thing. (She literally has to carry and sip Gatorade EVERYWHERE she goes, or else she can't stand up without feeling faint.)

She's definitely always had some sort of anxiety from the beginning. Luckily for her and my mother, she had me - her fraternal twin sister to help her settle into primary school. Even then, whilst me and my brother were fairly happy to go off to school, my mum had to peel my sister off her leg on the first day of school (which was 'a bit of a business' my mother said). After that, she could only get my sister to go to school by dropping us off through the drive thru where we all just had to get out, if she walked us in my sister would cling to her and refuse to go. It was the same if my mum tried to come to school sports days, my sister would find her, cling to her and refuse to do anything. If my mum didn't come, she would just do it.

So I guess she was able to go to primary school because she had me to just follow around until she settled in enough to be on her own.  In year 8 she had decided to go to a boarding school about 1.5 hours away (she'd come home on weekends), where they did a lot of Agriculture and horse riding which really appealed to her. My parents were able to drop her off, but they received a call that night, she was crying and asking them to pick her up - this is a year 8 student. The school was really good, a few of the older girls took looked after her, showed her around and she last the next two days until Friday. Then as arranged, she caught the bus home for the weekend. Monday came, she was supposed to catch the bus back to the school but she simply refused. Short of dragging her out of the car kicking and screaming and clawing, there was no way she was going back. So my mum called the school she'd attended from Prep-Year 7 and they were able to re-enroll her.

So the next day, she had to go back to a school where she'd told everyone she was leaving and then had to explain why she was suddenly back. I was even shocked to see her back. The next year I changed schools, I was nervous but I stuck it out, made friends and settled in no real worries.

In year 10, my sister tried to change schools again, this time from the private school we had both attended, to the local public school which was much bigger and had a lot more options.

This time, she told everyone she was leaving, bought her uniforms and everything, same as last time. She lasted two hours (which was still just the orientation, classes hadn't even started) before she went to the office feeling unwell and once again, called my mum crying. My mum had to go and pick her up, by the next day she was once again enrolled in our original school. 

It must have been very embarrassing for her to have to return the same school, not once but twice after bagging out the school and saying she going to leave. Surely for any normal person it would be easier to stick out a new school then have to face the embarrassment of returning to you old one? But the stress and worry of going to a new school literally made her feel sick and she had to turn back.

Now, a few years later she graduated from school having attended the same school for 13 years save a few days and had grand plans for attending a university on the Sunshine coast more than halfway across the country. She would have to fly to get there or even just to visit home. She enrolled in her course, paid the deposit for accommodation and then pulled out. 

She quickly changed her plans to attend University in Melbourne, where she frequently visited the hospital and knew the CBD quite well - in fact she quite likes the city. She got into College with my cousin, who she is friends with and packed all her things in the car, told everyone she knew she was going to university and IH College. Then my parents drove her down to Melbourne and she had a look around, got back in the car and refused to get out - like a child. My Aunt and her youngest child who my sister really likes, talked to her and the college people talked to her, explained that they would help her with everything, she didn't have to worry. Both my aunt and my mum offered to stay the night and help her. But in the end, there was no forcing her to do anything and she returned home, having given it less of a go then even the other two schools she'd tried.

I think she has major separation anxiety from my mum. She gets jealous when my mum pays too much attention to anyone else, when my grandparents were sick and my mum had to look after them, my sister became horrible and jealous  and complained about how my mum should be spending more time with her. I remember one time we went rollerskating and my sister was just starting to move along a bit but my mum was talking to a little girl with down syndrome who was quite sociable and my sister said 'shes not even watching', this is a 17 year old complaining that her mum isn't watching her rollerskating. 

I don't know what to do, if she can't even move to University in a city she knows and likes, with her cousin in the same college and everyone helping her, how will she ever do anything? And it's not like she never really wanted to do it, I know she really does, she's just talks herself into believing she can't.

How can I help her? She can't talk to anyone, she just chuck's a tantrum if you try to have a real conversation or address any of these issues she says 'get out!' 'just leave me alone!' over and over and over until you finally give up. She has no real friends who can help, when most kids were going on Schoolies (I went on a 3 week camping trip with my friends) she went to the beach with my parents. She didn't even have friends to go on a trip with when she graduated school. In many ways, my mum is her only and best friend. But she's also horrible to my mum says things like 'No one likes you' 'I wish you were dead'. She tells me often to 'go kill myself'. She threatens both me and my mum 'If you don't go away, I will stab you'. Neither of us are particularly scared of her, she's too sick and weak to even pose a physical threat. But considering how dependent she is on my mum, she's quite horrible - my mum also just needs a fucking break if I'm honest, but my sister worries too much to leave.

I'm also worried my sister can't socialise, she's never even been to a party, how's she going to find a boyfriend or have a family? Is she going to be 40 and living with me because she has no one?

How can I help her worry less and go to Uni, like I know she wants to so she can have the life she wants and one of her own?",24Feb2019,1
1,"I have ulcerative colitis (UC). For those unaware, I’ve been told it’s similar to Crohn’s disease. I am frequently horribly nauseous out of nowhere, on bad days I have to make frequent restroom trips (for vomit or otherwise), and I’m frequently in pain. I don’t talk about it with my friends a lot, I guess because I wanna keep an image of being reliably sturdy, but I mentioned it in a group chat today and it gave me some doubts. Is it really that bad or am I just playing this up in my head for attention or something? I hate people that, like, abuse certain aspects about themselves/their status for attention/pity, and that’s not the kind of person I want to be. When I’m sick I feel very bad, so I don’t THINK I’m playing it up, but I don’t know if I’d know if I was playing it up if it was subconscious, you know what I mean?

7,"Hello there! I'm a senior in high school (female). At my high school, seniors are allowed to leave school during the month of May if they agree to undertake some sort of project of their own design and present it in June. 

Problem is, I have only a vauge idea what my project should be and I have a proposal due on Friday if I want to participate. 

I'd like my project to be based around sports and physical fitness. I love being active even though I am physically unremarkable. My gym teachers loved me. I'd like to work, somehow, on my physical abilities. For reference, I run a 10:00 mile, can do 80 crunches, 20 pushups, and can do 29 ""laps"" on the 20 meter pacer test. My ideas so far have been:

-Training so that my school fitness tests (the numbers you see above) to get them to levels more appropriate to my age

-Complete 1000 pushups!

-Train myself to become the ultimate dodgeball player (my throwing arm and dodging skills are weak!)

-Train myself to become a beastly triathlete

-Training myself in certain aspects of several sports: throwing a spiral football, shooting a three pointer, running a 9:30 mile, shooting a layup, and developing a killer dodgeball throw.

8,"So I graduated with my Masters last May and have kind of been stuck for a lack of a better word ever since. Right after graduation I had to move back with my parents who live in a small town not too far from my university. I did not have much of a choice financially since I was in the beginning of my job search and I am on a medication that is obscenely expensive without insurance and as long as I am either unemployed or just have a part-time job I have to live with them to keep my coverage. My plan was to take some time away from academia for my mental health and work in another sector until I was ready to go for my Ph.D. and I assumed that with a Masters I wouldn't have a problem finding a job. Nearly a year and 1000 applications later I still am stuck at home and am without a full time job. That is not to say I have been doing nothing though, I started writing for a local newspaper on a volunteer basis and have a part time remote job writing for a travel app but they give assignments an average of once a month so they don't keep me too busy, but so far I have not been able to make it past the initial interview for most places and the ones that did turned out to be MLMs or just outright scams upon further investigation. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have asperger's syndrome but am very high functioning so it didn't impact me a lot near the end of college. I did well in my program, was generally a stereotypical type A personality and had a great social life when I wasn't working on my homework or research. I'm beginning to think I'm missing something about interviewing or the whole job application process in general and just not figuring out what. Not to sound arrogant but on paper anyway I am a decent candidate, between my GPA, graduate degree, prestigious internship in DC, and published writing I thought that would help but so far it has not. Living in this small town with my parents has killed my social life as well. Every once in a while I have been able to see my friends from college and that has been wonderful but I have been lucky to do that once a month. Most everyone I was friends with in high school has moved away and I cannot until I get a full time position so I can afford my medication. I have tried meeting new people in my hometown by visiting different churches but the demographics kind of skew there towards people much older than me so I haven't had much in common with them and to my knowledge there just aren't any places where people in their 20s can meet. Even the most popular bar in town was shut down years ago because someone was murdered there. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have noticed the last few weeks a general apathy creeping in towards my job search. I usually fill out an absolute minimum of five per day and I have noticed lately I have been just doing that and then playing video games and watching Netflix to kill time. (I saw last night I have over 500 hours in Crusader Kings II alone, most of that since after graduation) It doesn't help that for the last couple months I have dreaded getting up because I didn't want to work on job applications anymore. Thankfully my parents are extremely understanding because of the situation with my insurance and medication and have been great and very encouraging but there is only so much longer I can stay on their plan. Plus I don't want to live with them forever and even if I did, I definitely don't want everything I did in college to be for nothing. Has anyone else been in this position or one similar? I feel like I'm stuck and I don't know what to do to fix it. ",24Feb2019,3
10,"So my upstairs neighbors has been extremely noisy over a year and a half now, and I've sent eleven noise complaints so far, but they are only getting worse. The landlord has laid a carpet in their apartment, and ever since the noise got worse and at this point the landlord doesn't even reply to my mails. The family above is a family of five with young children. The youngest one is around five or six years old.

Earlier I could actually ignore it to a point, but now they have actually started with stomping around, yelling and such at 22:00 and sometimes even 23:30, and it's keeping me from going to bed at a reasonable time.

After about the first three noise complaints I sent to them they actually confronted me and practically threatened me with the ""If you don't like the noise you can just move.""

11,"Long story short, I have an intolerance to soy. I won't die but I will have terrible stomach cramps and usually diarrhea.  Sometimes vomiting and migraines.

One of my co-workers recently offered to bring me back lunch. Since I have multiple intolerances, I specifically told her what I wanted. She said No problem. I knew something was off with the sandwich when I tasted it but I was hungry so I ate it, thinking maybe it was seasoned differently or something. Well, didn't take too much longer until I had to keep running to the bathroom back and forth. 

&amp;#x200B;

I immediately wondered if I had salmonella poisoning  and asked my co-worker if she was having any bad reactions to her meal. She was really surprised to hear that I thought I had salmonella poisoning. I was feeling so bad that I decided I wouldn't be able to last the next two hours of work. When I told her I was going home because I felt sick, she confessed that she hadn't gotten me what I had wanted because it had real meat and she had recently decided to go vegan. And so she'd ordered vegan for me as well. She said she was sorry I was sick but that she thought she was in the right and couldn't imagine why I felt bad. Her face fell when I told her about my intolerances, esp to Soy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think she felt bad but that doesn't excuse the fact that I felt terrible for hours, betrayed, and missed two hours of work. I haven't really spoken to her in a week. What would you do?

Tldr: I accidentally let my friends dog out and thought it was not a big deal, but now he's understandably pissed off and I want to reconcile.

Hey everyone,

Yesterday i made a pretty big mistake. I was hanging around my friends house and we were going out for a school project. He owns a pet dog, and when I was leaving the door open for him the dog took the opportunity to escape. At the time, I thought this was funny (I'm not a dog owner and don't interact with them much, so I didn't realize until later how severe the situation was) but the dog ran out on the street and almost got ran over by a car. It took about 5 minutes to catch the dog, and my friend didnt seem too angry at me at that point, and i thought the incident would be forgotten and I would remember to close the door next time.

Unfortunately, since after I left his place, my friend has been refusing to talk to me. He's told me that my reaction was ""fucked up"" and that i couldn't make up for what I had done. I've tried to apologize already. I AM genuinely sorry. However, i admit that I've made the same mistake for his dog before, about a year ago- then, his dog just ran around the yard and was taken back into the house within a few seconds, so I never thought much of it.

I understand the mistake i made. As i said before, it took some time before i realized why letting the dog out was a massive mistake, but I get why he thinks my reaction was unacceptable now.

My question is: what can I do to repair this relationship? I'm going to apologize to him in person very soon, but aside from that he's a very close friend of mine and I want to make sure he understands I'm truly sorry.

14,"I'm a full time college student, I already work one job but the hours are inconsistent. Its the type of job where I'll 40 hours one week and then won't work for 3 weeks in a row. I've been applying to a lot of places lately, and a minimum wage mall job offered me a position so I accepted, the job is an hour+ long bus ride away since I don't have a car, there is a restaurant across the street from me offering me the same pay, though the interview is tomorrow, so idk if I will get the job necessarily.

I already agreed to the mall job, I was iffy on the job from the start since the manger interviewing me tried to get me into going to his seminar at 9am the next morning, and when I said maybe and seemed hesitant, he backtracked and cut the pay from the original amount we discussed in the first interview from $9, to $8 an hour. I looked it up and learned it was actually a Pyramid Scheme that he runs as a side business. 

If I get the restaurant job I'll most likely try to quit the mall job, how do I turn it down or quit politely without having to directly talk to anybody in person, I'm okay with calling. The issue is the first interview was with a senior worker there who was super nice to me, and basically begged me to work there because she said they we're so understaffed.

Over a month ago, i ordered a wii with assorted controllers (including 1 guitar hero guitar) and games from someone off of depop. The post included pictures of all items in full, minus some of the games. I was tracking its progress until i noticed it had been stuck in transit for about 2 weeks. I submitted a search request with very specific item descriptions and some time later it seemed to be on its way as previously intended. However, the package that i finally received was literally just a guitar hero guitar base, not even with the neck. Thats all that was in the box. Maybe it's also worth noting that the box was oddly patched in places and in bad condition. The label on the package had all of the correct information for the both of us... it even was labeled 20 pounds, when it clearly was not, at least not upon arrival ...

There's a chance that I was scammed, but given the original weight and picture proof/rating system, and my naivety, i want to believe that something else couldve happened. The whole transit thing and weird box make me feel sketched out.

28,"**TL;DR AT THE END**

This past week, my girlfriend of 3.5 years broke up with me. It was completely unexpected and I am still processing what has happened. She just finished moving the rest of her things out of my apartment yesterday, and it feels so quite, empty, and alone. 

She gave me multiple reasons for leaving me: she has figured out that she's bisexual and doesn't want to be limited to a monogamous relationship where she feels restricted, she realized that she doesn't like living with just one person and feels like she needs her own space to decorate, and because she didn't think it was fair to me that while I only thought about her in a romantic way, she was considering other people. And most of all, she said that all of this is happening because of me.

When I first met her, she was a broken person with no self-esteem headed down a self-destructive path. She thought that nobody could love her or want to be with her in a long-term relationship, and I decided to prove her wrong. I felt connected to her soul and we understood each other so well. We struggled with a lot of the same issues, and she was not used to being with somebody who truly loved her and was not trying to take advantage or be abusive. 

Over the years, I helped her lose weight and take control of her physical/mental health, realize that she is a beautiful person inside and outside, and that she deserves all of the love and affection that she receives. She said that I changed her life in a positive way more than anybody else, that she wouldn't be at a top school or doing what she loves without my encouragement and assistance, and that she wouldn't feel proud of who and what she is. And because of all this and everything I've done for her, she believes that she is strong enough to be without me and ready to come out as bisexual to her friends and family. 

We departed on very positive terms, but I was not prepared for this at all. We were together for 3.5 years, lived together for 6 months, and I truly loved being with her and existing alongside of her. It appears that she didn't feel the same way, but living with her was the best thing that has ever happened to me. I opened my home up to her and welcomed her to make any changes that would make her feel welcome and comfortable. But none of it mattered in the end, and she broke up with me this past week. 

Now, let me say that I am not angry with her and I understand her reasoning for no longer wanting to be with me, but I don't know how to deal with it. It all happened so quickly, and right after we had a very sweet and pleasant Valentine's day together. She even signed onto my 2019-2020 lease earlier this month, and now since she's gone I am forced to keep the apartment for the rest of the year, and I was mostly keeping it for her. My apartment feels so empty, quiet, and alone without her. It is so difficult to sleep in my bed without her warm body beside me. Cuddling and touching is probably one of the most important aspects of a relationship to me, and we were very touchy-feely with each other. I went from hugging and cuddling with my girlfriend 10+ times each day to zero within a single night. And it just feels so horrible. 

So, aside from that extremely long post, my main questions are **where should I go from here? How do I deal with the shock and depression?** I will not be in a long-term relationship for a long time, but I am very tempted to look for casual relationships right away just so I have somebody to cuddle with and hug. **Is it appropriate or even healthy to go looking for company?** I live in a college town and graduated last year, so nearly all of my friends have left. I was just keeping the apartment to split with her since it is so close to campus, but now all of her things are gone and I'm stuck in it alone for the next year. **Has anybody dealt with a similar situation?** 

If you made it to this point, thank you for reading this extremely long and probably rambling post. I am just in shock, lonely, and depressed. I feel antsy because I have nobody to hug or cuddle. **How should I move forward?** I appreciate any and all comments/questions!

*TL;DR 
Girlfriend of 3.5 years left me after realizing she is bi, wants to explore other people sexually, and doesn't want to live with me. Came as a total shock to me and even though I am not angry with her, I have no idea what to do. I just want to cuddle and hug somebody, which is extremely crucial for me, and I don't know if it's healthy or appropriate to search for casual relationships to fill such a devastating void.* ",24Feb2019,2

Me: I’m male, and in my twenties, full time employed, and I live alone. No girlfriend. 

I live in a duplex with a shared wall. 

My neighbors: 20’s, married and going through a higher level of college than most.

# Story:

So up until January to be honest I did not give the slightest care about what my neighbors were doing, or how loud they were (except playing music obnoxiously loud past 11PM). I could usually sleep through them closing doors, banging around, the norm.

In the nicest way possible…I just didn’t really care about them…Yeah they are over there, they seem like nice people…aaand that’s pretty much all I ever thought of them.

So, last month on a weekend, they banged a door closed so loudly it woke me up…grrr whatever I try and flip over and go back to sleep. 

I’m just about back asleep when I get awoken again to the sounds of them having sex…. It was quiet (HVAC Wasn’t on) and I could hear *everything*…. keep in mind…I wasn’t at this time TRYING to.

I’m sure I will get ripped in the comments for this…. but as a 20 something year old male, who’s been single for 8+ years…. Hearing it was pretty damn hot. 

I should also mention that I believe the head of our beds but up against one another with the wall separating them…. I never noticed nor cared until after hearing them.

# Important bits:

So immediately following this day, the next few evenings and mornings, I notice that I’m listening pretty hard to hear if I can hear anything from their side…. every little noise I’m like “Is that sex? What’s that? Etc.” Week or so goes by and I hear them do it again, and I start listening even harder every single night / morning.

Fast forward a few months and you guessed it, it’s gotten **really** bad. After the second or 3rd time hearing them have sex, I noticed that if I’m sitting in bed trying to go to sleep, and I hear them banging doors closed, etc--That I start shaking **REALLY** bad like I’m nervous?? My heart starts racing really bad too.

Needless to say, I have absolutely been on their sleep schedule because of this and it has been **KILLING** me (College sleep schedule VS me getting up at 5AM...so maybe 4-5 hours a night)

This has gotten out of hand and very unhealthy very fast. I just want to go back to not giving a crap what my neighbors are doing.

I can’t wear earplugs, because my work may call at any moment and I have to be able to hear that.

I’ve got a noise maker on my physical alarm clock but it’s not loud enough to drown out the bass of them talking loudly or closing doors.

I don’t really want to go talk to them…. what the hell am I going to say? “Can you have sex quieter” – I’d rather die.

# The Why:

I don’t know **WHY** I keep doing this either…it is very much involuntary. I’ll get in bed thinking “screw them I don’t care tonight I’m going straight to sleep” and then the moment they make a sound I’m like “ohh ohh what’s that”.  :(

# TL;DR

**TL;DR I overheard my neighbors having sex, and now I’m obsessed with trying to hear if they are doing it every single night. I’ve tried stopping but it’s almost like an involuntary thing now…It’s super unhealthy my body keeps shaking nightly and my heart races until they finally stop making noise.**",24Feb2019,4
30,"Hey,

So I'm having to deal with a heart-wrenching situation that I feel is destroying me internally as it stands. I'll make a TL;DR at the bottom, but I think the context is important

Here's some context to my situation:

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 21 Y/O student who is currently living with my GF (20), we go to the same university. It's her parents apartment (They own a lot of apartment lets, they let GF have one for a reduced price). We started dating for about 5 years now (we met in secondary school) and we have a lot of history. From going to Amsterdam to visiting concerts with eachother and genuinely enjoying eachothers company.

However, I've began to feel my feelings for her fade, we've not really done anything together in a long time, we don't really do anything in the bedroom anymore and generally I feel like we've lost touch with eachother in many ways.

Here comes the part that's destroying me though.

I have a friend online who I've known for just shy of a year now, she (24) is someone I confide in with things, sometimes even more than my girlfriend. We're such good friends that she even revealed to me that she was M2F trans and apparently I was one of two people she'd told about this.

We joke about, play videogames and chat a lot, we know eachother so well, even though we've never met.

To put it simply, I've fallen for her, she's been here for me more than my gf has recently and generally I feel as we are more compatible.

The big issues me breaking it off with my girlfriend is that she'd go absolutely mental, she's got a temper on her and I imagine it wouldn't end in a civil way (she's never abused me in any way, just to clarify), and that i would probably lose a lot of my belongings, as well as my only place to live. The new apple of my eye lives in Yorkshire (I live in Kent). but I'm afraid she'd reject my advances, and that things could go terribly wrong

I'm not sure what else I can include that'll be of substance, but I think that's the general jist of everything.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice? I honestly have no idea what to do, should I try to fix my relationship? Should I just man up and see if my new love interest is interested in me at all? I'd be interested in anyone's similar experiences. This situation is breaking me down.

31,"Started at a vape shop almost 2 years ago. Said I would only be pulling 30-40 hour weeks. I've never had a week under 50 hours. 

So, a month ago my boss tells me he's going to Egypt for a week. A month later and he's still not back. He's got his brother here ""helping me"" but he's as dumb as a box of rocks. I have to go behind him and fix everything. Makes my job 3x harder. Literally hinders me more than helps me.  

He gets a day off a week, the guy that runs our other store gets a day off a week. I've worked a month solid without a day off. I don't get breaks. I don't get lunch. I barely have time to take a piss or go take a dump. I'm fucking exhausted. 

I've asked numerous times for one of them to work one day for me and they both have an excuse as to why they can't. Every  single week they have an excuse. I'd literally sell my soul for a day off. I'm pulling no less than 80 hours a week and these assholes won't give me a day off.  My boss has already told his brother to work for me tomorrow and he keeps saying no. I'm very seriously thinking of just not opening the store tomorrow. Either that or just 'forgetting' to order a lot of stuff. Because when I say he dumped this store on me, I mean everything got dumped on me. Ordering. Payments. All of it. I am very underqualified for this position and barely have any idea what I'm doing. I am so over worked and overwhelmed. I need a break.  Is there legally anything I can do? I mean, breaks and lunch are required in the state I live in. ",24Feb2019,6

I met this girl about a month ago and I had a huge crush on her and we ended up kissing pretty recently (which I regretted) and since then she’s been hinting that she wants to start dating but I’m really conflicted because I don’t want to just end up breaking up.

I’ve always been interested in it, and she has several tattoos pertaining to loa. I’m considering getting a tattoo similar to one of hers, but a few people have told me that I shouldn’t, because it would be cultural appropriation. 

I personally don’t view it that way, because it’s not like I just found the symbols and thought they were pretty enough to get tattooed on my body. I have a deep respect for the religion and practice, and feel like I have a personal connection to it because of my relationship with my aunt. But I wanted others’ opinions before proceeding.

The problem is, whenever I do the homework (one class doesn't even give homework) I get super overwhelmed sometimes. It got so bad today I stopped studying with my mind going one thousand miles an hour. My eyelid has started to twitch for the first time ever. I keep thinking about doing drugs (like Xanax) although that would be a mistake. I heard people just forget months/years on it... I figure, maybe I take Xanax and voila, I will have graduated (which is dumb). There's a pharmacy not far from my campus, so maybe I could get other drugs there...

I have friends that are taking over the max workload, tons of clubs etc. I've been told I have the easiest schedule, and I think I do have an easy schedule, but it's overwhelming sometimes. I can't help but figure people are staring at me when I go outside to eat, etc. I think that none of my pants really fit correctly around the crouch so I'm weirding everyone out.

I went to DC Douglas's Erotic Fanfic reading with a friend. I felt extremely uncomfortable during the whole thing but stayed out the whole thing for her. In short without details the room where I was located wreaked of sex and I wanted to leave but was told that it was not a panel that you just up and leave out of. She gave me every chance to not go through with the panel all the way up to the door. I pressed through because I was committed to do it. I stuck with it I wanted to be with her not just because I wanted to support her as a friend but I also have a bad history with Anime Cons and people inappropriately touching others (that's a whole thing on the side)  


She noticed that I was extremely uncomfortable and tried to comfort me all the way through, the whole car ride back was us talking it out like adults and having a mutual understanding of why it went down like it did. I still can't shake the unease of the event and she is constantly blaming herself for me feeling the way I am.  


It's been a week after the convention and overall I had a good time but that panel just fucked me in such a way that I can't shake off. I decided to drink tonight, relatively responsibly\*.  I feel like because of my own reaction to it and trying to get over it is fucking with the friendship to where we are both in constant stress.

49,"Hi guys need some advice, going through a lot of fucked up shit right now with a group of people you can read my previous posts on what exactly the issue is, but I’m posting here for some more advice.

All my life I have struggled with depression, anxiety and confidence issues. My councillor person thinks I can’t see any worth in myself which I can agree with.

Anyway this led to me using substances and mainly alcohol to deal with it. Making countless mistakes while drinking I got arrested a few times but no trouble with the police atm. I’ve self harmed tried to overdose multiple times while sober and while drunk. The main thing is I gain a lot of confidence when I was drunk this led to people I have issues with messaging me and when I’m drunk I think I’m the big man and say threatening things back too them.

I’m not drinking anymore and not using substances. But I can’t leave the house or anything due to what I’ve said to these people.  I deleted social media but they still contact me through my number. They’ve started targeting my friends now and I’m loosing them. I know I’ve caused this. I can’t go to work anymore because I fear for my safety. I live in a small area so everyone knows everyone this makes it a lot worse. I know I will hold a massive beating if they see me, I’m skinny as fuck always been bullied and I know I’d lose a fight instantly if these situations happened.

It’s not like I can go to the police either because of the things I’ve said back to them.

I can’t leave the area I live in either due to the fact 95% of my family are here so there’s basically no where else too go. I can’t start gym or anything either due to the fear I will get hurt. I know I shouldn’t have gobbed off and started this shit but I’ve made a big mistake i now have to live with. I’m honestly running out of options I can’t keep living in fear. I’m thinking about taking some Xanax and drinking then just either give myself to the people who want to beat me or just manage to kill myself but successfully this time.

Any advice helps I doubt there’s much anybody could say. I appreciate any help and comments I get. Thank you ",24Feb2019,3
51,"So for some backstory, me and this girl “dated” when i was very immature 3 years ago, i broke up with her, then she got into a relationship with a friend of mine about 2 years later. That was that. We began talking as friends about 6 months ago, and she always came to me with her relationship problems. 2 months passed by and they broke up. I had feelings for this girl ever since i met her and they never went away, so since they just broke up, we started to talk in a relationship way again.

We started to talk in a relationship way again in October, and a month went by and it was amazing, a million times better than before. I thought everything was all good and well, but i had to find out through her best friend that her and my friend never really split, and they were still together. She tells me they are broken up, everything else points to that being untrue. My dumbass is deeply in love with her so i always ignore all of it, hoping they actually break up and we could get into a relationship. We regularly hang out once or twice a week, cuddle and do all of the relationship type stuff, but then i know deep down they arent breaking up so it hurts my heart. It’s hurt my heart every day since about mid-November, but she is the only thing that makes me happy so i’ve stuck with it.

 Im stuck here, she claims im not a second option but how could i NOT feel that way, we make all of these plans for the future and she insists on them not being together, but i know they regularly hang out as well, i just don’t bring it up because she then gets mad and i don’t want that. What the fuck do i do? Im too attached to just up and leave, but i’ve gotten hurt by this EVERY day for the past 3 months. Help me.

54,"I have some very intelligent friends who believe in some stuff that there is simply no backing for. For instance, I got into an argument online (I know, I know) with two friends who insisted that putting lemon in your water did wonders for your health (eg. contributed to weight loss, bolstered your immune system, can treat headaches, etc.) I responded by saying that was a myth and there was no evidence that it could do any of those things. Both these friends insisted that it cured their stomachaches and they read similar accounts online. I explained the placebo effect to them and why you would see some confirmation bias in anecdotal reports on web forums about stuff like this. They got offended and claimed that I was insulting their intelligence by suggesting that what they experienced was placebo, which makes no sense because everybody, even intelligent people, is vulnerable to the placebo effect. I feel like the *real* patronizing thing to do would be to just nod my head while they kept sharing falsehoods without expecting better of them. They are more than intelligent enough to grasp this stuff. Plus, health is kinda a big thing of mine. Exercising, sleeping well, and eating well got me out of a pretty deep depression and I think a lot of other people could be similarly helped if *good* health info was easier to get a hold of and analyze. People sharing nonsense ""facts"" muddies the water with that.

I feel like I was perfectly polite during this conversation. I really don't know how I could have been *more* polite while still calling them out on this. I wasn't calling names or swearing or anything. I was just saying they were probably incorrect and here is why, and here is why it is important not to take anecdotal evidence too seriously. If lemon water cured their stomachaches, there's no reason they shouldn't keep doing it. It's just good to be careful and skeptical about the information we consume online. I was literally begging them to prove me wrong. I desperately want them to tell me if I *am* wrong.

I still got accused of attacking them and insulting their intelligence. I'm perfectly happy to consider the idea that I'm the asshole here, especially since this has happened to me before, a lot. However, as of right now it just looks to me like it is socially acceptable to say any bullshit idea (eg. ""My horoscope said..."", ""Apple cider vinegar will cure your cancer,"" ""My psychic said..."") with zero backing, while it is socially unacceptable (and apparently I'm the asshole) to respond with ""Well, your horoscope/psychic is probably not giving you a whole lot of real information because...."", no matter how politely you say it.

What am I doing wrong? If someone says I'm being mean for doing that, is there a socially acceptable way to ask ""Hey, why is it okay for you to share this belief of yours without any reason for believing it but it's not okay for me to share mine that it doesn't actually hold any water?"" Or is there a politer way to have the conversation before it even gets to that point? If I'm the asshole here, please let me know!

**TLDR: I feel like it is socially acceptable for someone to share a completely bogus belief without backing but it's not socially acceptable to do anything other than totally go along with it and treat them like a child. What am I doing wrong? Am I the asshole here?**",24Feb2019,2
55,"Two nights ago I went out to a club with my partner and my best friend. 
A bit of background: I use to be an alcoholic and despite how much I drank I’ve never once blacked out and forgotten an entire night, so I do believe this is part of the problem.

Anyway, I had two drinks at home before leaving, and had maybe 3-4 drinks at the bar. Everything was great, I wasn’t feeling too messy but my last memory was being on the dance floor and dropping my drink. I remember the loud thud and the smash but after that, that’s it. 

The rest of this story is from what I’ve been told by my partner and best friend. We went to another club and they decided we needed to go because I wasn’t able to stand properly. When we left the club I apparently had gotten extremely paranoid and kept telling them someone knows where we live. Within a span of 20 minutes (nearly an hour after my last drink) I completely deteriorated and could barely stand up. Luckily there was an ambulance pulled over nearby and I was put inside but would not stop telling them I thought I was dying. My eyes would not open though. 
Spent about an hour at the hospital before I kept insisting I wanted to leave, so they let me go?????
My partner helped me outside, he said he was going to get some water so he left me with my friend and when he came back I was down the road picking flowers and my friend was freaking out because I kept telling her people know where we live. 

I can’t get this out of my head, I feel like I’ve come so far from my old ways and now this nightmare happens and I’m back to my old self.

I [F26] live at home with my mother and two younger sisters, [F23] and [F19]. Recently, my husband [M29] moved in after working abroad for a year.

My mother [F50] is disabled, as am I, and I am her main carer. One sister [F23] is not working, she has depression and has been off sick for a year. My other sister [F19] is studying part time. My husband is working a very demanding 60 hour job.

My sisters do absolutely nothing to help in the house, and I am left to clear up after them. The most they do is occasionally take out the bins or clear up after dinner. When my mother is too ill, which is often, I’m cooking, cleaning, washing dishes, washing clothes, doing the shopping, paying the bills and walking the dog almost entirely on my own, while dealing with my own health problems. 

I’ve recently been offered a job 200 miles away, it’s great pay and my husband would be able to find something less demanding, but I honestly don’t know if I should take it. If I leave, my sisters will continue to do nothing and my mothers health will get worse. She’ll force herself to do everything instead of making her daughters do it. 

I’ve spoken to her about it, telling her she needs to be more tough on them but it makes her extremely angry with me, saying that I’m telling her how to parent and I have no right to tell my sisters what to do. Talking to my sisters just causes a huge argument and my mother telling me that I should “keep my mouth shut” and “I’m just on a power trip.” All I want to do is help but she won’t accept it. 

I don’t know what to do, I’m absolutely sick of arguing with her and my sisters about how little they help, and the thought of leaving when things are this bad makes me feel so guilty.",24Feb2019,1

Feelings came back full force recently. And for the past few days I've been feeling like shit. Friends reached out and tried to comfort me. I reached out to try and talk to them. But I still feel so alone and detached from where I am.

I don't even know if this makes sense. I just want to know if anyone else has felt this way if there's a way to get out of this mindset. I just want to feel comfortable being me and being where I am.",24Feb2019,4
61," We’ve dated for 3 years, broke up last April 2018. Never met until last November and met again several times this month (even met last Friday) in bars around her university. When we met the first few times, we were cool with each other, kinda like seeing your old friend. After some time, I realized I still like (love?) her. Forgot to mention I was really awkward and she would often make the atmosphere light to talk to me. Even recognized some of my motives on texts and responded back. Not until I made a move on her last Valentine’s, she gave me the cold shoulder and acted strange after that. I initially thought it was because of me being late on her, but a few days passed and she’s still playing the game of ignoring me.   

This is where it all came in – I realized she has changed a lot. From us used to fighting about my smoking before to her actually smoking now. She also got extra wild in partying and drinking too, never would have been the old her as the girl I loved before would know if she has been doing too much. And the list goes on. 

I feel like I only like her now because the memories I have of her are those I had when we were still together. If I were to meet her now, I don’t think I’d still have the same spark 3 years ago. I don’t know what do. I still have this part in me that misses her, but every time I get to think of all the extra effort I have to go through to know her again – it just tires me. And apart from all that, I’m afraid she’d reject me because of who she is now. She just became way too different and above my league. Maybe I need to keep up before chasing someone back from the past who has developed and flourished. ",24Feb2019,1
62,"I'm 18 and I've been questioning if I'm a narcissist or not and it's making me incredibly worried.

The ""traits"" I have that worry me is that I do have a desire TO BE SOMETHING in my life. For example I've been working on music the past few years and would love to have it as a career. I would love to hear that many people like my music. Isn't that a sign of wanting admiration?

I've been in a depressed state with diagnosed health anxiety for awhile and recently wanted to better myself. But I'm afraid that the 'bettering' of myself will lead to narcissism as well. Like if I become overconfident in myself. I currently don't look at myself above average at all, but I'm afraid that it will change if I better myself. 

I have never really cried after a movie but these Japanese commercials have pretty often got me to tears. 

I also fear of rejection and only once asked a girl out because of it. I'm getting a bit better with it though after getting constructive criticism from my music.

I'm constantly questioning myself if I am narcissistic or not because of my will to be successful in the music business. How do I know if I'm going to far with my want for admiration, my want to better myself and etc?",24Feb2019,1

65,"I vividly remember being molested at the age of 5, and I know it was happening before then too.

My earliest memories with my dad are showering with him and touching each other's penises. I know that can be normal exploration in a way, and I don't remember it vividly, which is why I don't say age 3 instead of 5. 

When I was 5, he had everyone (himself, me, and my brother one year younger) run around nude and perform sex acts on each other, and it really screwed me up. My brother and me voluntarily did it again and again as small children without him directing us to. I don't want to go into TMI, but we got caught doing even more disturbing things at our mom's house and were severely punished.

I'm pretty sure it made my brother into an actual pedophile (attracted to kids). There were times when we were in our teens and babysitting small girls for our mom's many partners/friends and he'd do something sexual around them like expose himself. I'd call him out and tell on him, but my mom would just stop talking to the parent if they complained too much. I got in a lot of trouble and was told to not make a big deal out of it because the girl would tell by herself if she cared.

My brother is now a fiance to a woman and has a bio daughter and two step kids with her. She started telling people in their small town that he molested her 4 year old daughter from a previous relationship. My mom claims it's BS, but I know it's probably the truth from what I've seen of him. For whatever reason, she stayed with him and still wants to marry him. 

I feel I should go to the police. My dad is never around children alone, but I'm still very angry at what he did and want him to see jail time for how much he's hurt me from that one night. 

My brother on the other hand is living with two little girls and an 8 year old boy who looks up to him. 

I have no evidence other than hearsay and events that happened 20 years ago. This could just back fire and get me jailed for defamation ",24Feb2019,1

I think God set things up for me to return. My last day at work was a snow day, we got administrative leave and I wasn’t able to clean out my desk. I went to the new job the following two days and had plans to get lunch with my old boss on Saturday and clean out my desk then. So I talked to her and she said she would like to have me come back, but she has to talk to her supervisor on Monday and she will let me know. 

My brain was frazzled and racing so fast trying to contemplate everything and make this decision. Both are good jobs so I will be happy either way, but I just knew in my heart I’d be happier at my previous job. 

I feel awful that I’m bailing on my new employer. This is uncharacteristically of me as I usually follow through with everything. When they hired me I set a start date, but had to push it back two weeks. They agreed. And now after two days I may quit. At least they didn’t haven’t spend too much time on training me but I’ve really held them up in their hiring process and feel terrible about it. 

I like to make everyone happy and am not great at doing things for myself, but I think this short but awkward time will be worth it in the end. I’m not the first person to quit a job, it sucks but they will move on and in a year will hardly even remember me.

My basic standards include: No drinking, no smoking, no vaping, no drugs, is not a hoe, not a bitch, and does not have a bad personality. She must also not be dumb, not be overweight/obese, not force ideologies down my throat, not have an annoying voice, and not have STIs. 

To me, these seem extremely reasonable. But as I get older and older, these types of girls don't exist. 

Literally every girl I know does/has two of those traits/characteristics. Not so much the STIs, but definitely the other traits. I am relentless in finding a chick that fits all of those standards, but it seems that it is becoming impossible the older I get.

That's when I took my leave from him and bounced. He said he'd come back to see me and I told him I'd be sure to duck.

I went to a new school last year and I got very close to a few people. I quickly became best friends (school only) with one of them since we had so much in common. Same with another one. We had lots of fun times. Sadly, I had a fight with my best friend after he told us how I need to change and telling me what to do.

I was pissed off and blocked him and later unblocked him. He then mentioned something about me getting fat and I got really mad at him and swore at him than blocked him. We then ""rekindled"" our friendship. I was acting kind of rude still and on the first day of the new school year. He was rude. Along with another friend.

The other friend I was really nice too and we only had one fight (and a not very serious one we). He then became my bully. (its been about 5ish weeks since this has started) I tried to talk things out but he just swore at me and blocked me.

After that, he started really pissing me off and I snapped and tried to beat him up. I only ended up grabbing him before a mutual friend broke us up. I went to coordinator and he stopped bullying me because he could be suspended.

While this was going on my best friend started spreading rumours that simply were not true. I told him to unblock me and we could try to talk things out but he refused. I still wanna sort things out and I need some advice about how to...

Does anyone know how to sort the situation out or become friends with both or one of them or even just advice to help me feel better and forget it? Any advice would be appreciated thanks!",24Feb2019,1

A bit of background first. I'm in HS, and last November I changed my phone's lock screen to a crusader as a meme for No Nut November and it has been like that ever since. Anyways, the other day a girl checked the time on my phone and saw my background. This conversation followed:

Her: why do you have a crusader as your phone background?

Me: it was a meme for November. 

Her: but it isn't November anymore.

Me: yeah but I don't have any reason to change it, plus I don't have any good pics.

It's not fun, I sometimes end-up heading home depressed about being alone when the places I go re full of people with friends, I also often feel very self-conscious about what others may be thinking about me. At my usual bar I just sit there alone on my phone and have a drink or two then go home, I do this too regularly so some staff remember my drink - also recently I've gotten it into my head they think I'm a sex worker, no evidence of this but it's jut my anxiety. 

It's not often I get approached or someone tries to talk to me, but if they do I feel kind of pathetic as they ask if I'm alone in a tone that makes me think they pity me. People see it as pathetic to be alone, occasionally they may ask if I would like to join them but it feels patronizing, I don't particularly want to join them because as much as I hate being alone I'm sure I'm not good company as I've been socially isolated so long I'm totally socially incompetent.

And we talked again, not as much as before but every moment we’re together I can’t express how much loved it, this only added to those minor feelings that we’re hiding and waiting to be forgotten and brought straight back up. 

Going into the 3rd year, we were placed back into the same class and that only further increased my feelings for her. We talked more than ever, we started going out together with a specific group of friends in class, that group soon became smaller to only consisting of me, her and another close friend of ours. We went out considerably a lot that year, the three of us. Me and her, we only grew closer, we talk and texted each other, the text went from regular texts to daily texts, a few months before the end of that year, we started getting into calls sometimes. Something to clarify up to this point is, we’ve discussed and she’s aware of me still having feelings for her and they were only growing. Our relationship also kept getting closer and our texts turned daily so did our calls. These calls now last for an hour to two hours, sometimes we’d leave each other on the phone while we sleep, other time we’d watch old movies or anime together online. The most we’ve done was when we wanted to go travel, both of us would wake up at ungodly hours and talk to each other and call. 

The year ended pretty nicely and I loved every moment of it. Come this year, entering the 4th year, we are no longer in the same class and both of us were very much sad about it, but we stayed in contact, we still text everyday, call every night. At this point, we both text each other good mornings and good night everyday, she’d ask me every night what time I was getting back so she could call me. A little bit into January, i asked her. She was hesitant but agreed to us dating. It didn’t last, it ended just about 2 days into it, she couldn’t commit. I’m not going to get into why but all he reasons are valid and I accept them. Something to keep in mind is, this would be our last year, I’ve known her for this long and I know she doesn’t do well with exams, and this year just happen to be our most important exam and we’ll be graduating afterwards. This were weird but we talked and everything went back to normal, we texted and called but a lot happened and things got complicated but it always gets fixed. A few weeks back we went out together and that day, it was almost like a date, we held hands, she hugged me throughout the day, kissed me on the cheeks and then the lips later. I thought maybe she might have wanted to be in a relationship but the exam is a problem so I thought maybe I’d wait till after and ask her once more. But last night, we somehow got on the topic of all this. She told me, we should stop being so intimate with each other or at least have boundaries, when asked why, she said because she felt like it was only leading me on, and that she doesn’t want to do that knowing she doesn’t share the same romantic feeling with me. She told me she does all this because she likes it, she likes that I care about her and how much I love her. She likes holding my hands, being clingy around me and being spoilt. But she didn’t have any romantic feelings for me. That was what she said. That hurt me a lot, I asked her if I would still have a shot at being with her after the exams were over, she said she wouldn’t mind giving it a go. But then something came up and she somewhat backed out and told me I shouldn’t ask after the exams. I asked what what if I did, she just said she’ll consider, she won’t give me any promises and that I shouldn’t be hopeful. 

Now I’m just lost. How can you like being with someone and basically do everything someone dating would do, enjoy that but not want to date said person. I still love her regardless, I still want to ask her after the exams. What can I do now, I’ve got about 9 months until the exams are over. Any advice is welcomed. Whether it’s about how I can make it work 9 months later. All I want is at least to have a shot at it. Last night she seemed like she was also considering it but was just waiting for that 9 months to come up. But now she seems very much not interested anymore. ",24Feb2019,1
100,"So, I was dumb enough to click on a link in an email that was sent to me stating that my apple ID had been disabled. I've been dealing with several of my online accounts being compromised in the past week, so when I saw this email, I clicked the link to set things right. I was sent to a site that stated that my apple ID was not secure. Before I clicked the verify account link (I'm on my android phone at this point still by the way), I decided to see if I could check my account info on my old iPhone through the app store. I was not able to see my account and it also took me to a link to log in. So, I went ahead and started to to regain my account on my phone. I typed in my name and password then started to input all my info such as name, birthdate, address, phone number, there was a line for social security number. At that point I stopped typing, cleared all info and closed the page.

&amp;#x200B;

I then called apple support and they told me  that there was nothing wrong with my account. So I decided to reset my apple password. I had already activated two-step verification on my apple ID previously. I also did the same and changed passwords on several of my accounts last week that were compromised. I started to look up what to do when you click the link of a phishing email. I cleared browser data on my android phone and took both my old iphone and android off the internet. I did not clear browser data on my iPhone yet, because the browser is offline. I clicked the email link on both devices by the way. I am considering wiping both devices with a factory reset. I would rather not do that though. Is there any software that can run a scan for malware on a phone? If I decide to wipe my devices with a factory reset, I would like to at least back up my photos first. Can I safely hook up said devices to a computer without compromising them as well? I am not sure what I can do now to protect my information. Any advice for me? Any help is greatly appreciated. Thank you. ",24Feb2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, a girl and I ended things, she called me ""Meh"", made jokes about my feelings to my face, and showed a lack of empathy while I was trying to talk to her to fix things eg: she would cut me off and say ""I like my hair this way"". I got the point, I tried to let go.  The things that were said really broke my trust and gave me a negative perception of who she is, any kindness that was shown seemed to be a front.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue now, is that my best friend is now dating her sister and I have to see her a lot.  I tired to be nice and ignore whatever past we had. Whenever I spoke to her, she would give me a disgusted look, and give me one answer replies. 

&amp;#x200B;

My dilemma is it has been a year since this has happened, and the way I was treated still bothers me. I have a very hard time trusting people in the first place. What I decided to do was to put up a wall because it is difficult for me to unsee the unemphatic and dismissive treatment  I received.

 The way I always looked at it is, if someone wrongs you there isn't anything wrong with placing a wall. What is bothering me is I'm not sure if I'm being immature or too unforgiving.

115,"So I guess here's the situation, I wake up everyday just feeling neutral. Really no happiness (Except a few things I'll cover) in my life nor do I feel really bad (Again except for a few things I'll cover). 
  
* I guess for some context on my life, I live with my parents still; I'm 19. Not in a relationship; Not pursuing one, have to work on myself first before I consider looking for one. Not in college currently; Taking a pause on a semester, resuming in fall. Not employed; I have my first job interview coming up on Monday. Those two things are the primary source of my happiness. I'm looking forward to be working and getting back into school; I got my acceptance letter for my new college last week.   
  
  * Bit unsure if I'll get the job, it's my first interview and I'll find some way to mess it up for sure. My dad also worked really hard to set it up for me, I'm afraid I'll fail him. Underlying that, the owner is sort of desperate for a worker but I talked to him on the phone; He hung up on me after I introduced myself to confirm I was coming in for the interview.. I think he was shouting at some of his employees (A possible red flag?). Seemed generally distracted, was a very short conversation if one at all.   
  
* Some secondary sources (Tied with primary honestly though, I wouldn't say these are ranked in any way. Just a way to keep track of them) include my family, two solid friend groups and a separate friend I rely on for a lot for guidance/advice; She is much more experienced with life than me.   
  
  * Aside from my family, I talk to both friend groups and my separate friend purely online; It's possible for me to meet up with them (Except the separate friend, she lives too far away lol), I've never hung out with them before so I feel like an outsider to them just about. Also don't have my license, would have to get that first ideally so I don't have my mom driving me lmao. I feel for them, cracking some jokes about hanging out as a base would be good. Then start talking about it seriously. Thing is, they drink/smoke weed which I have no interest in. I guess I could be the sober one haha.  
  
On the flip side for the ""bad"" things include:    
  
* I feel like I'm losing connection with my separate friend. I know she's older and has more going on in her life, she's married and has kids. Was in the hospital and needed some time to focus on that. I understood completely and gave her the space she needed. Talked to her a few times in that span because there were some really important things I needed guidance for. All of our conversations there were really good, no different than before.   
  
  * It's been a while (1-2 weeks) since her approximated time to get back in the groove of life. I don't know how to read our one conversation in that span, which was about 6 or 7 days ago. She was really helpful and gave me so much advice, again like nothing was different. She explained she still wasn't feeling 100% yet and that working on yourself was an everyday thing. I just don't know how to interpret that. I do feel selfish and guilty for messaging her; In addition, I messaged her a couple of times after that conversation to get a new conversation going but to no avail. She pointed out some things about myself (My personality) that she noticed and I took it to heart. It wasn't in a rude way, text can be a bit finicky but I trust her so much now, she got me through all my mental issues I was facing. So I spent those 6 or 7 days working on just that. I want so badly to tell her how once she pointed that out, I took it very seriously and I spent time working on it. That I changed it and I'm back to being nearly 100% happy and content with myself. I ultimately feel the best solution to re-establishing that connection is to ask to renew the friendship. I just don't know. I feel selfish and guilty for wanting to maintain it, I don't think she expected such a long term deal. But then my mind is also saying, give her some more time, she does have a hectic life.   
  

* Outside of that, the minor bad things kind of tie into what I mentioned above. I don't get out of my house (Though that's being fixed I suppose), my friends feel sort of distant, it's hard to stay motivated, I feel like I'm just wasting my life (Not in a major way, not to the point of a mental problem. Nor do I feel like an utter loser. I have a mostly clear head, I have ways to ground myself).   
  
I know there's a lot to dig through, if there's something you feel you can give advice for, feel free. If you need additional context, I may give some (I may have a limit on something).

117,"I am 16 and my little brother is 11. I haven't seen him in almost a year. The last time I saw him I told him goodbye so I could go into, what I hoped to be, a better life. My mother had ruined me for the better part of fifteen years. She was an alcoholic who neglected her job as a mother and pushed it off onto anyone who would take it. Which at one point was my older sister who became what was like a mom to me when she was 12. For even longer it was babysitters who would lock my sister and I outside for as long as they pleased so we wouldn't wake up their baby when we were 5/6. Sometimes the doors weren't opened until two in the morning and sometimes we wouldn't eat all day. Not much would change when I would go back to my mother's house when she had time for us.

Last year it felt like I had lost everything. I had to abruptly move the night before Easter. A few days later I found out that my mom was addicted to meth and the sister who was the closest thing I had to trust in the world was getting emancipated six months before she turned eighteen because she couldn't take it anymore. I had to live with my aunt for the last four months of my freshman year (grade 9) in high school. I lost my family, my home, my friends who were so confused and didn't know what was going on, and then my town when I had to move two states away even after I sat on the floor begging my dad to just give me the summer to say goodbye to my friends. 

I never knew what it was like to have normal parents so it took a long time to realize what was going on was wrong. I didn't have friends until well into middle school. I shouldn't have been allowed to drink in third grade or know how to mix drinks in 2nd. I shouldn't have cried myself to sleep that many times only to be lulled away with the drunken sounds of my mother telling me to ""shut the fuck up!"" and ""stop being such a whiny baby"". I couldn't tell my dad because he had been in and out of jail from the day I was born until around third grade when he moved away where the static-y sound of his voice was as close as I would get with him for a few years. Even when the CPS workers made their rounds because I couldn't say a word about the drinking, or yelling, or fighting, or babysitters because kids have to love their mothers, right?

I left the state with my younger sister, my older sister stayed emancipated and free, my older brother had joined the military years prior, but my little brother? He had been passed off to his dad who had been my step father for almost a decade before my mother had ruined him. He drinks as much as she and gambles as much as he drinks. He is no longer the man who told me not to be afraid when I had nightmares and my mother was binge drinking once again.

My little brother bounces between living in hotels and a trailer in the yard of my mother's friend. My little brother is the sweetest boy you will ever meet who dreamed of being an Olympic athlete and a NFL football player. He is the boy who would play board games with me when all I wanted to do was die because of my mom. I would beg God to let me die and I don't even believe in God. I didn't eat or sleep and he would let me play video games with him regardless of mascara that would be smeared and the tears that haven't vacated.

I don't want my little brother to look at the world like I did. I don't want him to scream 'I wish I was dead' and then be met with 'I wish you were too'. I don't want the little boy that would race me to get Popsicles to have the light drain from his eyes when he has to get his license just to pick up my mother drunk at a bar. Or to get grounded when he refused. I don't want him to have to pull her drunken body off the stairs and then be told he is gross, and worthless, and stupid.

Please, I don't know what to do. I don't live in the same state as him. My mother technically didn't lose parental rights so it's up to his dad, but he shouldn't live their with her for any longer than he has to. My mother has been investigated by CPS four-ish times and only one time has anything happened. Please, please, please. Please just tell me what to do because I don't want this precious kid with big dreams learn to hate life. I want him to have someone care for him, but I am so scared of what will happen if he ends up in the foster system. Please, I am begging tell me how to save my little brother.",24Feb2019,3

My husband injured his back about 2 years ago. He was let go from his job because of it. After numerous MRIs and tests, he has been diagnosed with two slipped discs and a pars defect. 

After getting treatment, finally about 4 months ago the pain subsided and he was able to start working out again (which he loves to do). But just recently he had another injury with the same pain and symptoms so it looks like we are back to square one again. Drs say this will most likely be an ongoing thing throughout his life. 

At this stage, he is homebound and can't get out as I take the car to work everyday (even so, he can't drive because of the back and leg pain). We are both introverts and don't really have any friends and
he can't take care of the house like he used to either.

I feel terrible for him. Being at home, alone  everyday in pain and for so long is really getting to him.

121,"This is going to be long, but it's the accumulation of my entire childhood and much of my adult life. Skip to PART 2 if you're impatient. 

PART 1
To give a holistic view of the situation, I believe it is necessary for me to begin with my childhood. I am the third daughter of a violent marriage. My mother was very imbalanced and very violent. Terrible tantrums of thrown lamps and attempting stabbings we're fairly common in our house. My father was abusive in a more conniving way. He kept it all a secret, repeatedly telling us ""family first"" and that we don't talk about family matters with other ppl.

Of us three girls, the eldest and I were aquesent and people pleasing. My middle sister, though, was very opinionated which would have been fine except my mother had a hair trigger temper. Another thing you need to know is my mother favored me heavily and openly. She would tell me I was her ""only hope"" and go to unnecessary ends to spoil me or keep my father from spanking me. To balance this out with her violent tendencies, she would take her anger at me out on my middle sister sometimes. I don't think was too often because it was rare I ever disobeyed, but it set a tone for my middle sister. She would tell me, ""I remember when you weren't around. I was the favorite."" (Which is a lie. She's only two years older than me. I'll explain that too)
Thus my middle sister became an antogonist to me, torturing and teasing me as often as possible....all the while developing a strange protective possessiveness of me. 

Fast forward to my early twenties through a tumultuous upbringing. We, girls, somehow managed to come out of the household not doing drugs, addicted to alcohol and all had graduated from high school. 

I had been suppressed my entire childhood and did not know how to take care of myself. I looked for guidance anywhere. So my middle sister took charge as she was apt to do. I moved out with her and was slave to her whims whether it was a new diet or political opinion. I was her reliable minion. When I disagreed I hid it. Out of the guilt of our mothers violence toward her I thought the best thing to do would be to support her. But she was developing strange behavior and could not keep friends. She had a bad falling out with our eldest sister. We know now, she probably has borderline personality disorder. 


Fast forward another few years. I'm attempting to hold onto my relationship with my middle sister despite the slow realization that I'm being manipulated and used for her benefit. It was unknowing on her part. She just assumes that I needed to agree and support her completely....an idea which I have stupidly been feeding over the years. I'm in constant confusion between my two sisters. My eldest warning me of my middle and the middle vilifying and defaming the elder. 

I, finally, come to the conclusion that my middle sister is not healthy for me. I begin to distance myself. One day she comes to the mother in law suite I was then living in. She begins asking why I'm not spending enough time with her. I give generic answers of I'm busy and such not to rile her. Also, know that my middle sister has had this magic hold on me. She perceptive and vicious. Whenever I had ever attempted to stand up to her she would tear me down emotionally before threatening to break my laptops and kick me out of the house. At this point....I'm frustrated, but thoroughly terrified of her. 

PART 2
Essentially, she begins to talk poorly of my elder sister whom I love dearly and I refused to agree. She starts screaming and yelling so I begin to leave. I get to the base of the stairs and I hear her throw my computer tower across the living room. So I grab my phone so I can record her psychotic tantrum and start back up the stairs. That desktop was an expensive gift from my brother in-law. She comes around the corner and at the top of the stairs punches me in the face. This makes me stumble and fall/slide down the stairs. She came behind me and puts me in a headlock. She's squeezing and I'm panicking. I don't know how to get out of a headlock and I can feel my throat being mashed shut. Air can't get through and I start to see stars and my vision got blurry. She yelled, ""ARE YOU GOING TO LISTEN TO ME?""

I've never feared for my life before and it feels silly thinking back on it, but in that moment I thought she was trying to kill me. I was tapping out and trying to nod. Anything for a breath of air. Fucking anything. She finally lets go. I cough and sit for one second... then bolt. I ran toward the door swinging it open barely making it through as she slammed it shut on my arm trying to pull me back in. 

Turns out I'm still clenching my phone and in my panic call her husband. She's chasing me screaming that she hopes I get raped and other such fun things. As soon as she realizes I'm on the phone with her husband her threats and screams stop. He tells me he's hurrying home in confusion and panic. He hangs up and I'm now holding a pace just enough to keep her from catching up with me. I lower the phone. She bolts and me screaming again. So I get her husband back on the phone and it stops again. 

After all this I decide not to call the police because I care and respect her husband who is an ex officer and pleads with me not to call the police. I move out the next day. My brother in law told me he had to keep her from coming back into my suite. 

It's been a year and a half since then. She's pregnant. 

Abuse is a cyclical thing. My worry is that she will be secretly abusive to her children. My eldest sister thinks I need to make an effort be around because things would have been so different for us if we had someone ""in the family"" to tell that we were being abused. But I have decided not to be a part of her life....

So I've decided to ask my middle sister if she wants me to be around. Whether it's a yes or no, I'm going to ask we speak about what happened. I have the strong feeling she will justify what's she done. The truth has always been her plaything. That's what's really difficult. My middle sister isn't lying. She believes everything she says because she has twisted the truth to her benefit. I've seen it dozens of times before and so I dread it. It reminds me of when I was of a weaker constitution and my reality felt warped by her confidence. 

TL;DR 
My sisters and I grew up physically and emotionally abused. My sister punched and tried to strangle me as an adult. She's pregnant and I don't know if I'm supposed to try to be a part of her and her child's life as a preventative measure of more abuse. ",24Feb2019,1

Just as a side note, we both are in high school so there is a competition for colleges. Definitely.

Anyways, we both have the title of co-presidents, which I feel is unfair because I do a lot more than her. I'm creative, have a good eye, and determined. She is just there for...humor? I guess. To be honest, (and sorry if this sounds bad) everything she is doing, I can easily do. And, it would be more impressive/easier because I am doing it by myself. Also, I don't even think she is passionate about the cause, because she is saying ""she just wants to get into college.""

I like where our organization is going, but I just wish I had started this myself. I'm getting a little annoyed that she gets full credit for everything I am doing.

I don't know if I should talk to her. My family says that I should. But I just am a little nervous about ruining things between us. Although, right now, I don't appreciate her very much right now (because of other things) so I don't want to get too aggressive. I also don't want to let her walk over me. What should I do?

I struggle to make friends and to be accepted, my parents are divorced and my mother comes from a very social family, as my 2 brothers who are also very social. I have talked with both my parents and they said that if i was autistic they would've told me.
The problem comes because today after dinner with some of my step-father's friends i went to sleep and they started talking about me, my relation with my class and some weird stuff about me like:
Why i don't like kissing people ( I am from a very socially warm country )
How i am as i said very socially awkward
And my interest in history, geography and politics.
The way they talked was IMO like talking about somebody with some kind of mental problem. I heard my mother said ""he's kind of autistic"" I asked my brother about this and he said he didn't hear it, which is false as he was there too

As some of you may know, you can see what pictures and comments the people you follow on Instagram like. Well I stumbled upon it the other day and saw this person had liked and commented on some photos of male models. A lot of photos. Some were hash-tagged with multiple lgbtq references

I’m not worried or judging if this person is bisexual or gay, I’m worried that he’s not out to his family and doesn’t realize that his likes and comments are public (at least to his followers) I’m also worried if I warn him he could panic and it could cause damage as well.

I may be overreacting and it could be common knowledge among those closer to him, but I’m not sure. There is nothing else on his Instagram, or other social media platforms, that would make me think this is common knowledge.

I’ve been a fan of writing since my teens and I think I have some chops at it but I’m really uncommitted and shitty and producing any final works. I have no portfolio and if any actual editor and writer saw what I have they would call it crap ASAP. I have no problem with that but the idea of going into something like writing feels from the gut like a good/bad idea - there is one side saying you have no money and the odds are severely against you as I’m also in the middle of nowhere location wise.

The other part within me is saying - you’ve never gone all in and if you did, maybe something would come from it.

The other path is coding. I have lots of ideas and concepts for websites, apps, and the idea of bringing it to life fills me with motivation but the catch is that I’m not good at it. I’ve been stuck on python mainly cause I’ve given up numerous times but I wanna try one last time and if I give up again- time to move on. I don’t wanna be just a idea guy- I actually want to create what I want. Plus if I get good at it , the slightly higher chance is there that it can turn into a career and highly beneficial skill regardless. One part of my gut is saying it’s tooo late to start over again at 21- all ur coder buddies started at like 13. The other part of me believes the apps and games I wanna build would really help make others day better and that thought is really fulfilling.

At the time, I was a mess. I drank heavily and abused drugs. I would call this person late at night, wasted, and they would come pick me up and take me to their home.  

This went on for awhile. Eventually we became intimate. Physically and emotionally. This person made me feel safe in a way I hadn’t before. I loved them before I knew what love was. 

My childhood was awful. I was abused and lived in a broken home with a single alcoholic parent who’d ultimately commit suicide and I’d find her body. I had severe depression and anxiety, undiagnosed and untreated at the time. I self medicated. I was a mess. But he made me feel safe. So I latched on, and have lingered.

We’ve gone back and forth for years. Periods of minimal contact and then periods of closeness where we are closer to each other than anyone else. 

I have since grown and changed much as a person. I have medication for my issues. I am the best I’ve ever been. 

I would give anything to be with this person. I want to marry them. I love them more than I have ever loved anyone else. I cant see my future without them in it. But they don’t want this with me, but they do want my friendship knowing full well what I want from the situation. 

Being their friend is a struggle because I crave their touch, and the closer we get the harder it is to just be their friend.

141,"TLDR: My toddler niece is getting on in years and the only adult males in her life are her great uncle (older male who is dealing father time himself) and me (lives in another state). Am I obligated to fill in the gap that the deadbeat dad left? 

Straight to the point for this one:
My oldest sister had her first kid by a guy who doesn't seem the least bit interested in being involved with her.
I left my hometown a little more than a year ago to join r/navy
Haven't seen a lot of family because of this and since a recent return to homeport I've learned some new info about the going's on since I left; one of the things that stick out the most is that my sister has a kid now and she's adjusting to single parenthood. 
My sister is a nice girl but a bit of a stupid whore-ish fuck at some times. She's had a kid by some no-name who wasn't ready to be a father. The ""father"":
-Did not see the birth of his child
-lives in the same city or at least the same county.
-works at least a part time job
-has never met ANY of my family and none of us know even him by name
-can get f**ked
When I ask her about why she hasn't put him through the child support system, the response is always something like, ""oh, they take too long to get back to me"", or, ""it's a lot of paper work and time involved"".
Normally I'd shrug this off but up until some months ago my
sister lost her apt and moved backed in with mom (who assumes full-time working/grandmother/babysitting duties) and mom AND sister have started asking me to send them some of my E-1 money. No problem for now but will this became a regular habit? I would love to help out when I can; but am gonna be a primary breadwinner for a family member I will barely see?
I will see them all in a few weeks for the first time in a long time and I intend to at least bring some of this up to my sister face-to-face but I'm not sure what will come after that.

144,"So I have two friends from elementary school, Annie and Mary. Annie and I never moved away from our hometown and Mary moved several hours away. We were pretty good friends up until we left high school.

After about a decade of none of us really being in contact we started talking again.
We're on a group text, Mary's been up to visit us several times and Annie and I have gone on vacation together at Mary's a few times.

Well Mary was due to move back to our town and we were all super excited. We had plans for girl's nights, movie dates, lunches, all that good stuff.

Well, Mary's been back since August and we've only gotten together a handful of times. It's been because Annie is never available, or when we do make plans she'll change her availability until we have to scrap the plans entirely. We're on a group text and Mary and I have noticed that Annie never initiates conversation, and she'll take several hours to respond when one of us does, even thought she's on her phone posting to Facebook.

So Mary and I have been trying to figure out why Annie's dropped us. Is it because she has a kid and we don't? We just don't know. We've noticed that she's also started posting all these filtered pictures of herself, that do not look like her in reality, she's started getting glamour nails, and she's always on a fad diet. She's obsessed with losing weight. This is new behavior. She also has all these dear friends that she's never mentioned before. Mary and I have made a point to introduce our friends from outside the group, because we want share our lives basically. 

So Mary and I went out with a third childhood friend last night. Annie's reluctance to hang out came up and Joyce mentioned that Annie had posted how excited she was to be going out last night on Facebook. But I hadn't seen any mention of it on her page. Mary and I checked from our phones and we couldn't see any mention of plans on Annie's page, but Joyce showed us her phone and there were several instances where Annie had mentioned going out with friends- she had just blocked it from Mary and I seeing.

So Mary has just decided to wash her hands of Annie. She's pissed and hurt. They were super good friends growing up. I'd just let Annie fall by the wayside too, except we have a class together twice a week. We always spend the break visiting.

So I see her again on Monday and I don't know what to do- should I 

A) Act normal

B) Just be cool towards her and not visit anymore

Or C) confront her?

Once again I find myself resulting to nobody but reddit (the best advice I could get)

So, my mother and I have a close relationship, although we are thousands of miles away from each other, we somehow manage to speak everyday through video calls.

Yes, we are close. BUT, I don’t know how to feel about this. Yes, I have love for my mother however don’t appreciate the state of the relationship.

A few years ago, I was open about my depression (along with everything going on in my life) to my mother, and I can finally say I’m at a much happier place. To this day, she asks questions about my friends, personal questions. Always likes to ask where I’m going, what I’m doing.. etc. 
To be perfectly clear, I know mothers tend to ask these questions, however I ain’t no child no more, which is why this triggers me slightly. 

The situation would be improved simply by speaking to her less often, let’s say.. once every other day. Yet I know she wouldn’t like that as she texts me every morning to speak. I spoke to some of my close friends about the subject, yet somehow I’m the only person caught in this loop.

 So my girlfriend whom I do love is actively making me uncomfortable. 
 She told me a while back that she’s interested in a a polygamous relationship and I was not for it; she let it go. The thing is she’s been... trying to prove something? I guess?
 She’s been showing me images of her friends online and describing them as, “My wife!”, “My husband!”, “So hot!”, “So, so pretty!”, and “So attractive I’ve turned straight.”
 She does it jokingly of course but it just makes me super uncomfortable every time. When I’ve brought this up in the past she’s talked about a time I showed an image of a artist/model I thought was pretty and I adored their art.
 I know for a fact she wouldn’t/couldn’t cheat. She has many issues with people in her past that just couldn’t lead into her cheating on me.
 Or so I thought. She mentioned that her friend’s girlfriend was mad at her for how she was talking with her friend. She said “I love you” to her friend online; I don’t know what to do.
 She wouldn’t actively cheat so I don’t know if she knows what she’s doing. 

 What can I tell her? She’s pretty dependent and has some issues with depression, and I’m the person she talks to about it so she won’t have someone to talk to.

TLDR; My girlfriend is making me uncomfortable by accidentally(?) flirting with her friends. She has self image issues and I don’t to do anything drastic.

157,"Hi, this is a problem which at times really interferes with my daily life but I can't think of any solution, would be curious to hear what you guys think.

Here's the set-up: I am heavily introverted, not necessarily shy but lacking in social skills because I spend so much time alone. I can function in social situations but they make me incredibly anxious at times, very rarely to the point where I can't control the anxiety. Why is this important? Well, spending so much time on the sidelines observing people has made me acutely aware of the fact that style trumps substance any day. What you say isn't half as important as how you say it. When I try to convince people of something, I need to have them already be partly convinced of it or have very well thought out arguments. Likewise, it seems like people with persuasive powers only need for the people listening *not* to already be convinced of some alternative views and make sure to sound impressive while doing the convincing.

So, here's my problem: I feel like being sufficiently well-informed on a wide array of topics and being able to fluently parse sly argumentation on the fly is equivalent to a full-time job. You need to develop an understanding of how things work and learn to read sources critically to minimize the chances of encountering bad information, you need to hone your critical thinking and reasoning skills through constant practice. 

I'm willing to put in the work, but I just don't have the time. I have my own specialist field of study and elaborate hobbies besides, so I choose to shut myself off from information entirely. I only read the Associated Press on occasion, I stay away from anything political on Reddit, and the only non-fiction I read is opinionated writing regarding my area of study which I am (more) qualified to put into context. Likewise, I don't trust what anybody says without first doing my own research. The problem is I don't trust the people doing the research either, unless it is something reasonably immune to political manipulation. Researching is hard work and I am not confident in my ability to arrive at the right conclusions on my own.

Being so poorly read makes me more gullible and susceptible to sabotage, I don't want to adopt fringe views and I don't want to become a mouthpiece for a government-sponsored disinformation campaign. I don't want to become a person who knows a lot of things but doesn't understand them. It just seems to me like everybody is being manipulated by something or someone at all times.

160,"For the last few weeks a series of inexplicable events have been sort of looming over me.

Nothing big, and its probably a large amount of coincidences, but ill start by listing a few of them. 

Essentially, this all started when i moved back home to my dads house a few weeks ago

I noticed this when i saw the same car with the same license plate pass me on the road oncoming 5 times with no discernable way for it to have gotten there, although confused, i moved on relatively quickly. After that things started to take a strange turn. 

I go on nightly walks, and a few days after event 1 i was walking as i usually do, and streetlights starting turning off as i walked past them (keep in mind that these lights have been on consistantly without fail every night since ive ever been here, and i know without a doubt they arent motion sensing)

Freaked out, i made a Beeline to my home, and as i walked up to the door, i passed my bedroom window, and saw my light turn on by itself. 

I was home alone. 

I saw a man, leave his home on a walk a few days after that. Walk down his drive way, to his mailbox and reach into it, to grab a cellphone which began ringing immediately, after which he answered it and started talking rather quietly. He was moving his hands as he talked to imply expression before pointing at me, after which he hung up and then placed the phone in an envelope he got out of his pocket, and then put it into the mailbox again with the flag up. 

Ive noticed every single night, when i go out to smoke a cigarette, that a car rounds the corner going pretty fast, pulls to the side of the road, and almost stops in the same exact spot, before speeding off again for no discernable reason. 

There have been countless other events, but things reached a climax when i was at a thrift store earlier today and i found the family bible that had been lost when i was a kid almost 13 years ago. All the pictures were still in it. All the notes. Nothing was missing. 

We lost that bible in a completely different state over a decade ago. 

Im starting to get really tripped out, 

I feel like things are being put into motion around me and i dont know what to pay attention to, and what not to pay attention to. 

Any advice??",24Feb2019,1

I plan on being courteous and chivalrous either way, but I was Jw if there’s clues I should be looking for, before, during, or after, the “date” so I can know a bit about what she might be thinking it is.
  
I guess I **am** open to it being something other than platonic. When I asked her I didn’t think she’d be open to that and just wanted to be better friends with her, but I’m open to be being more if it works out, or she’s taking it another way.

162,"Hello everyone!

I have three boys, that are 24, 22, and 18. They are all very different and I'm very worried about them and could use some unbiased advice.

My 24 year old recently graduated college. He is looking to go into law enforcement and currently has three firearms that he's needed for jobs he's had doing security work. I'm quite worried about him especially because he's seemingly cut off contact with all of us despite living in the house. 

He comes and goes at odd hours. He always eats out, and puts a sign on his door that says ""leave me alone"". Sometimes I go in and his room is a mess. Pizza boxes, weights, dirty laundry everywhere, etc. Whenever we speak to him, he always says ""Hey"" and keeps walking. He's very anti-social and seemingly gets very upset at what appear to be ordinary day to day things like ""Do you want to go out for dinner"" and especially when his brother (22) talks to him. 

My 18 year old is currently a senior in highschool. He's quite gifted academically and has a lot of options for college, and I fear this has taken a severe toll on him because of the pressure we've put on him to focus on school. He spends long hours (most of his non-school time) on his Desktop and Gaming Headset on. He doesn't have many friends, and is very shy when he's not around his family. Lately his brother (22) has taken him to the gym, convinced him he should get a job and this has helped his confidence I think now that he's gotten out of the house. He's currently looking to get his first part time job.

Both my 18 year old and 24 year old have never had real responsibility as far as chores and the like go. I always thought that they should just focus on school and that my husband and I would take care of the rest. And now, their rooms have both become horribly dirty and they always say they will clean up, but don't. 

And last but not least, my 22 year old. He's very different from my other sons in most ways. He's the tallest, very confident, and incredibly witty and sharp and this manifests itself in strange ways. When he was 14, he received a scholarship to go to a boarding school in another state to play basketball. Every summer he came home much taller, and with much social growth. Then, he went on to play basketball in college, and then after a few horrendous surgeries came home after 2 years. He was out of school for a long while, and then my husband found out that my son had gotten into Web Development and was running multiple websites that he had built from scratch that he worked on full time. He recently agreed he would go back to school and work simultaneously. It was a total shocker.

His attitude also shifted, where he would speak to us openly about his political and theological views. He single handedly put three of his cousins and his aunt/uncle on his back and they left our religion because of what he told them. He's currently working on my husband and I and literally debating us and our local Preacher in our living room 1 vs 3, and honestly I think he's convincing me that what we believe is wrong.

He also openly calls out his older brother(24) on being anti social and avoiding the family, and it has a bad effect where older brother gets very angry about it, which is unusual because he usually says nothing about any topic. 

I just miss who my son was before he left home. He would always listen to me and everything that his father and I told him, and now he's all grown up. I don't know where all the time went but my kids are suddenly grown up and. He's now looking to move out while my 18 year old is on the fence about where college will be and my 24 year old I'm uncertain of. 

Anyways, please let me know what you think. I'm worried about my sons and their futures! Thanks

163,"The only friends I have are 2 people I went to high school with (we all graduated together). We stay in touch via groupchat on FB. Sometimes in a group chat nobody will respond to you. It's been happening to me a LOT recently. 

My friends have other circles of support. One has work friends, the other has friends from our high school and their college. While I'm very happy for them, when they're absent, I have nobody. Literally nobody else to call my friend. Nobody else to talk to or hang out with. They've both been absent for quite some time. Sometimes I think to myself ""Why are they even friends with me? It's evident I'm replaceable"".

The people I work with are middle aged moms, they don't want to be friends with a 20 year old. It's been very, very hard for me to make friends at the community college I attend - either nobody likes me or nobody gives a shit to know me. 

I don't know if my negative thoughts are getting the better of me. I know my friends aren't making me feel this way on purpose (at least... I think so) and I just want to not care. I want to be okay that I have nobody in this world to love and cherish and appreciate except myself.

He and his friends would tell me about how I looked emo (not that there’s anything wrong with that), that I was fat, that I was ugly etc. That went one for a year or so, I would cry a lot during this time because of the bullying.

I came back during the middle of January. At the start of February she seemed to become more distant everyday. I guess until she finally says she doesn’t want to be with me.

170,"I work in a work study program at my college, in which I work for someone at the school in order to gain scholarship money. 

My 'boss' has apparently come to the conclusion that she does not want me in the program anymore, and has decided the best course of action is to lead a smear campaign against me. She has previously threatened to fire me several times for what I can hardly even call minor infractions, and I have tried several times to understand where all this anger is coming from, as she has sent me several emails completely over reacting to things, but i can never seem to get through to her. 

But today, my god, today all hell broke loose.

I came into work and immediately she was acting extremely passive-aggressive towards me. She would not talk to me and acted as if I was not there. She was telling other workers there to train me in several tasks, even though I have literally been working there for seven months. SHE ACTUALLY BELIEVES THAT I HAVE NEVER WORKED THERE A DAY IN MY LIFE. She called me out in front of everyone, saying that I am lazy and make excuses to get out of work, which I can maybe understand where she is coming from. But then she claimed that I have never actually done anything there other than sit on my phone, and that I have never actually done any work. I was extremely confused by this notion, as I have literally worked with her several times, and I'm am never there on my phone, and if I never did any work then I would have been kicked out of the program long ago. 

But when I tried to refute this, she implied that I was lying about all of it and continued to spout absolute bullshit, saying that I had yelled at staff, that I purposely left out some cheese to poison workers, and a ton of other things that she has never confronted me about before and clearly just made up to either get a rise out of me or defamate me in front of my coworkers.

After thinking this over I have realized that this behavior is absolutely unacceptable, but I am afraid to take any course of action against it, as she has made it very clear that she will fire me unless I grovel at her feet. If I do get fired I have no guarantee of getting work in another department, especially in the middle of the semester, and obvious very possibly lose my scholarship, all because she is an immature asshole on a power trip. Since this is a college, there isn't a typical business structure and I'm not even sure if there is someone higher up I could report her to. I would absolutely love to get her fired because in any other situation this would behavior would not be acceptable, but right now I am walking on eggshells just trying to make it through the semester. This all has caused me insane amounts of stress and I am really considering just dropping out of the program and getting student loans just so I never have to work with this woman again.

176,"There's a story time here followed by some questions to see what I can do to avoid this sort of situation.

&amp;#x200B;

For context I'm a 5'1"" (156cm) 25 year old woman who has been living on my own for 3.5 years, and lived abroad for 2 years before that (coming home for the summers). I ran a house painting business for most of the last 3 years and was responsible for generating leads, converting them into estimates and booking the jobs. I also did the hiring and training of all employees. I feel very confident about myself and my abilities so no real issues there.

&amp;#x200B;

However, today my friend and I were at a Home Show in our city which is basically a bunch of companies showing off their products and services. We see this guy (in his 50's) set up without any obvious branding, but something that reads 4 nights, 3 days at (nearby expensive skii town). So obviously we are very interested and head over.

&amp;#x200B;

The first thing the he says to us though is ""This is a timeshare and not for you girls.""

That kills the mood a bit for us, but I ask ""Oh, why is that?""

To which he responds that we have to be 25. My friend is 22 (extremely mature person, having to basically raise her younger sibling since she was 7 and such) and she goes for a nice response of ""I guess I'll take that as a compliment then""

At the same time I ask him ""You don't think we look like we could be 25?""

I didn't let on to the fact that I am 25 as I didn't want to openly be ""You're wrong!"" But I wanted to probe in to him a bit more because of his rude attitude right off the bat.

He continues on that we aren't the type of people he is looking for. I ask him to elaborate further. He says there are certain requirements like being able to clear 100K/year. I'm not making that much, but my partner and I together make over that.

I tell him ""I could be making that much."" To which he scoffs and goes ""Come on, really? Don't play with me, don't waste my time.""

At this point I am absolutely livid. Being spoken down to as a child and dismissed that why? So demeaning! 

I decide that he isn't worth my breath arguing as he would not believe me no matter what I say. As my friend and I are leaving I shot back at him ""Well, I will tell my parents not to come here!""

&amp;#x200B;

Now the thing bugging me at the back of my mind is, is it my fault he assumed I was way younger than 25? Is he just an asshole who assumed ""little girls"" aren't worth his time?

&amp;#x200B;

I've been told before that in order to automatically get more respect from others I need to dress myself up more. As in wear make up (I've been a painter for 3 years, that quickly flies out of the window), and dress better. My general style is more for connivence or comfort and is generally: nice jeans (not paint covered), smart shoes that I can stand in for 8 hours and not have aching feet, a nice shirt (no graphic tee's) and a sweater or jacket for warmth.

&amp;#x200B;

The only way I can see to ""improve"" my look is to look more expensive, maybe have my nails done, have eyelash extensions, wear expensive brands and jewelry etc.

What do you all think?

So if I'm feeling the vibes at a bar and see some females that are easy on the eyes, I'll definitely dance and Bob my head and slowly see if they wanna dance with me 😂. 

But if I go to a bar and I'm not feeling it, I'ma just chill and sip on a beer because there's no reason to waste my mental energy on something that has to come naturally.

Basically I'm in a situation where Im already talking to someone I like but I'm still single so I'm not exactly super thirsty aiming to get a female from the bar back to my place for the night.  My goal is to go out and vibe with chicks and go back home when I leave.

My friend on the other hand literally is on this mission to bring back chicks to his place Everytime he goes out.  He expects me to act the way I do when I'm vibing Everytime we go out, where he cock blocked me with him acting thirsty and eager rather than vibing with the 4 girls I had taking turns dancing with me (long story short, he went real close to one of the girls and said something in her ear and she stopped dancing, said something to her friends and they left)

He wants me to be the ""super cool looking friend"" and the super cool me only comes naturally 😂.  Other gripes I have is that I like I my personal space, if it's too loud to hear each other don't be up in my ear every two seconds trying to talk to me bro, it actually feels really gay when a dudes up in your space and a bar with bumping music and girls everywhere isn't exactly the time for ""bro talk time"" bro.  Like I'm just tryna vibe to the music while I'm drunk, not talk the whole time man.

When I'm not vibing, I go into chilling mode, which is self explanatory.  Chill, drink beer, find a comfy seat and chill.  He follows me trying to get me into vibing mode all up in my ear and it's like DUDE GET OUTA MY SPACE AND GO GET THE GIRLS YOU WANT YOURSELF.  Ive told him go get the girls you want so bad and I'll just chill here.  Then it becomes my fault he can't get a girl back to the crib.

Also, I have a friend, who used to go through similar issues, that I would hang out with a lot. We somehow became a little distanced for unknown reasons. We became less close friends and more casual friends. Skip a couple months, and he started to get much better (I know for a fact I had nothing to do with this). Recently though, we've started hanging out a lot more. And just a couple days ago, he went through his first depressive episode in a while. For him though, I hadn't connected the dots.

The cause of this post is that another friend of mine and I were jokingly teasing each other, but I think I might have accidentally pushed a couple more buttons than I wanted to and it quickly became a more serious conversation. He pointed out to me that anytime I hang out with someone, they immediately start getting depressed and that he sincerely thinks that I'm doing something wrong, but he doesn't know what. He's known to be very straightforward and honest, and rarely let's his emotions take the best of him. So this leads me to believe he's right.

I'm sorry if I'm missing important information to really help with my situation but I just really needed this out there. If you have questions though, I'll answer. ",24Feb2019,1

I'm 19 and female

So this is my first year, second semester at community college after graduating high school last year. Since about sophomore year of high school my work skills have been declining, but I still managed to pass all my classes with a B or  A, and an occasional C. Then senior year of high school happened, I ditched class quite often, I decided not to go to any four year universities and go to a CC, and I barely passed my classes (but I did graduate). Then I started community college. After about a month I was barely going to any of my classes (just when I had tests), I had dropped 3/5 of them (general ed. and college planning classes) due to not liking the professors and attendance, and I never did any homework. I ended up only completing 4/13 attempted credits and I barley passed my one class with a C. I told myself it was because I didn't like the classes and my schedule, and next semester I'd do better. 

So then next semester started, I took more online classes, and I picked classes I thought I'd like. Well, now it's week 4, and I just skipped a week of classes. I am behind in every class and have no motivation to even do the homework or figure out what I've missed. I don't know what to do. I'm so overwhelmed and I hate myself for getting into this position, but at the same time I don't even care.

You could contribute these bad habits to my lack of sleep from my current relationship, which a lot of my problems seem to stem from (not in a bad way). I met my boyfriend while I was in high school and he was an international student, and we've been together for over 2 years. He currently lives and goes to school in China, and in order to talk to him I have to stay up very late and get about 1-4 (5 if I'm lucky) hours of sleep every night. This has become the most important thing to me, and spending time with him is far more important to me than school. I don't want to sound cliche or naive, but I am in love with him and can see myself with him for the rest of my life.

I also don't think I'm a complete dead-beat. I have a job I've been at for 6 months where I work about 25 hours a week, and rarely miss shifts. It's easy for me to get up and go to work, or get some sleep because I have work in the morning, but I can never do this with school. Work is important to me because it equals money, which equals being able to travel and see my boyfriend. School just equals nothing... Another reason I may not like going to school is because I am completely lost on what I want to do. I think I want to do something with science, biology specifically, and becoming a nurse was my original goal, but I just don't know anymore. 

Now here's the major problem:

Before I was in a long distance relationship, I had wanted to move to Europe but it was basically a dream. Now it seems possible because my boyfriend will be going to university somewhere in Europe in 2 years (he is from France). He doesn't know exactly where, but I am starting to base my life decisions on me moving there in around 2 years with him. This bothers me because I know I shouldn't base important decisions like this on other people, but at the same time I can justify it with it being something that I want to do as well, not just something for him. So if I move to Europe, what's the point of finishing community college in America where it's unlikely the credits will be accepted at a school in Europe? What's the point of becoming a nurse in America if I might not live here in a few years? Everything is just so uncertain and it's hard to find the motivation to do anything right now because I have no real life plan. My current (very *very* **very** loose) plan is: take next year off as a gap year, work full time to save money, try and get into a college in Europe (most likely Germany or Netherlands), hope I can get in, then move there with my boyfriend and finish school there. I have done not enough research on any of this and don't know if it's even possible for me, but why not? 

I just don't know what to do. I am asking for advice but this was also very cathartic for me to type out and get off my chest. Anything you have to say is welcome. ",24Feb2019,1
195,"A little background, sorry for formatting I’m on mobile. 

My mom isn’t the tidiest person in the world and growing up, me and my little sister thought it was totally normal to leave stuff laying at your ass and just attend to it when it’s a really big mess. 
I also cope with bipolar that favors depression, anxiety BPD, and endometriosis that gives me crippling pain most days  

Fast forward to now: I’ve moved out and I’m living with my partner who knows all this and is really understanding but I’d also understandably getting tired of living in a pig sty (compared to how they keep the house before I moved in, it doesn’t look like something you’d see on Hoarders but it’s definitely messier since I moved in)

198,"Disclaimer: this is going to be a long one so sorry but this is really important to me but if you want the full details here I go:

I(14 M) been best friends with D(14 M) since middle school. He was always someone I could trust and turn to vent out my feelings. We’ve been through a lot like him having surgery and the crutches he had for a miserable 6 months, biking around town just being the rebellious preteens we were, summer camps, and just making jokes. D was quiet but always showed his true colors around me. I liked him for that and I think he genuinely liked me too.

Fast forward to freshmen year of High school. Things have changed. D and I don’t have many classes together and he seems to have made some new friends(who were more popular than the both of us). At first, I was happy for him. I struck up some conversation with these new friends but they brushed me off or just stopped talking to me. They gave me that glare like I was inferior or something. However, they loved talking to D. 

Granted, I’ve never really been the extrovert in school. I’m a bit geeky for math and history and short as well as generally unattractive(I’m Asian and 5 foot 4). D is of mixed ancestry and athletic and admittedly handsomer. He is also an excellent swimmer who has qualified for national meets. 

I noticed the changes slowly. D kept talking about girls being hot. I mean this is normal for all teens, but he would go out of his way to talk to them. He stopped meeting me before school to talk to some cheerleader chick and said he would do track only if there was a hot girl there at all times. No problem, I thought. I mean, I would too i guess. D also started being less straight forward with me than usual. I’d ask him a serious question and he’d be like “IDK” or just turn away in silence. Sometimes I would interject myself into a conversation with him and a popular person just to fit in. D would just ignore me and continue, which wasn’t like him to do. Before long, D started getting invited to events because of his connections to the populars. He’d been chosen to do an event in the class assembly(basically a school pride event). 

One night, I just couldn’t take it anymore. I opened up snap geo maps and saw he was in a popular girls house with a bunch of other populars. I immediately got jealous. D was posting pics of him with a girl on his story like he was bragging about it. He usually never posted on his story. He sent a total of 5 snaps at this house, which was irregular(he barely used social media). The next days, I asked him about his interactions with the populars and he just shrugged and did that same vague behavior again. He doesn’t text me anymore and doesnt start conversations anymore(I have to start them). 

At this point I have a dilemma. I see 4 options here:

-I will continue to be his friend or at least try to. I mean I don’t think he hates me but I guess he doesn’t have time for me anymore. However, this option will make me depressed and make me feel unwanted(he is my best friend in the world after all).

-I should tell him how I feel. I think this option would be awkward and I could face backlash if he tells his popular friends. He doesn’t seem to want to listen to me seriously anyway.

-if you can’t beat em join em is what my late grandpa would say. I could try to infiltrate the populars just as D did. However, I don’t have the charisma or the courage and might get shot down miserably. I have already set my reputation as the nerdy Asian who has good grades. I want to be myself and not try too hard though. 

-I will stop being his friend. This one hurts the most. I’ve known him for years. I feel like we can fix this somehow.


At this point telling him how I fell sounds the best. I don’t know though. I’m going to ask you guys. I’ll keep you guys updated.

200,"Hi there,

I have a sleep disorder (idiopathic hypersomnolence) which took several years  and 5 sleep studies to verify, since we all assumed I was just a “burnt out student”. The studies were able to rule out Sleep  Apnea, restless leg syndrome, narcolepsy, etc. 
 This basically means I have excessive sleepiness without a known cause. I have medications to stay awake, but I have to actually wake up in order to take them! I also never, ever feel rested. Sleeping does not improve how I feel. If I don’t have alarms or someone to wake me up, I easily sleep 18-20 hours. 


Anyways, I now find myself facing my 4th year of vet school. There will be on-call shifts... and for the life of me I cannot currently wake up to my phone. I am seeking any advice you may have about training your body to become sensitive to alarms/noises and to wake up consistently from these noises. I’ve fought for decades with this problem and have been brought to tears many times because sheer willpower hasn’t been enough. I’m disciplined and willing to do the hard work; I don’t quit on a strategy after a few weeks. Yet for medical reasons I keep failing. I need a new strategy. 


I get in to an **EXTREMELY** deep sleep and require many alarms, placed all around my room, to *HOPEFULLY* wake up on time. These aren’t enough, and are inconsistent at best. I often sleep through them all. 


Some strategies I’ve tried: 


1) My various alarms: One is the “sonic boom” alarm clock, complete with bed shaker. I’ve got old-school style alarm clocks (battery operated) that are loud AF because they literally ring their own bells. These I place across my room so I’m forced to walk over to turn them off. I often find that I sleep right through the noise, OR I’ve walked over to the alarms, turned them off, and returned to bed _without_ waking up. 
(Will find myself asleep on top of the covers, or just on the floor near the alarms) 



2) I also have my phone, with many alarms. I’ve tried various apps (needing to complete puzzles or something in order to stop the alarms, for example). I’ve used apps that track your sleep cycles to try and wake you up at times when you’re “light” too. No such luck. I’ve found strange and terrifying sounds to use for alarms, and sometimes they’ll work for a day at most, other times they don’t work at all. I often just sleep right through any phone alarms and don’t realize they went off. 



3) I’ve been doing my best to keep a consistent bedtime/wake up time. I can control the going to bed aspect, but when I’m asleep I cannot control responding to my alarms :(  even if I accomplished this part, it doesn’t address the “needing to wake up from a phone call” issue. 



4) I avoid screens as much as possible before bed. I’ve got blue light blockers on my phone and my laptop that kick in 2-3 hours before my bedtime. 



5) I often drink a ton of fluids in the hours before bed, to hopefully have to pee badly enough that the stimulation from that combined with the alarms might get me to wake up. This helps on the odd occasion but won’t be helpful for on-call. 



6) I have a bedtime routine. Granted I don’t need assistance FALLING asleep since I do that easily... but I was hoping this would help my sleep be more restful and thus maybe I could wake up better. 



7) I have a morning routine too, in the hopes that I could train my body to respond to things before my brain caught up. I have a glass of water beside one of my alarms on my desk. I drink that the instant I’m “awake” enough to realize I’m standing there. I also exercise first thing in the morning, if I can get up. 



8) caffeine: again, I don’t have issues falling asleep, but in the hopes of improving sleep qualify I only have coffee in the morning hours. Green tea in the afternoon. Nothing caffeinated after about 3pm.  


9) various medications (usually supplements, I work with a naturopath) to just try and help a little. I don’t know if anything has made a dent in my ability to wake up, but they’ve helped me feel a bit better overall. Magnesium bisglycinate is an example. 



That’s all I can think of - but this has been going on so long and I’ve spoken to several doctors about it over the years that I’m fairly certain there are some other strategies I’ve tried and stopped in the past that I probably forgot to mention here. 

If anyone has advice, I’m all ears. Thanks for reading. ",24Feb2019,1
201,"i (F) live in a dorm with 5 other girls, all in my major. all 6 of us share 2 showers, which usually has no issue with timing etc as we all usually take showers at varying times and never have to wait. with that, we all have our personal preferences with which shower we use. there are 2 other girls who use the same shower i use. since only 3 of us use the shower, we have no problem leaving our shower stuff in the shower as long as it doesn’t get in the way. i always put my stuff in the corner and my razor where only i know where it is (on a ledge where the other girls can’t see - i’m the tallest one here). last semester, my body soap was going at a faster rate than i was using. i thought maybe i was just using too much and didn’t think anything. fast forward to after christmas break - none of us were there for almost a month. i noticed early january that my razor was moved, the moisture strips were peeled off, and there was hair all in it. i know at that time i hadn’t used it in quite a while. whenever i use it, i always wash it off for a while and make sure there’s no hairs in it. upon noticing, i threw it away and made sure to not keep any razors in the shower, just in my room. this week, i noticed my soap had been used, a lot. after last semester with the soap, i changed to a more masculine scent (i have no problem smelling “manly” but according to the other soaps in the bathroom, they don’t want to smell manly). last time i showered, i had about half a bottle left. i made sure it wasn’t tipped over, so none leaked out. i went back to take a shower the other day and noticed that there was about a quarter or less of soap in there. after my shower, i took ALL my shower products (shampoo, soap, loofah, etc) and my other things such as dish soap and sponges and now store it in my room. what can i do to prevent this happening in the future? it’s going to be a pain to take my shower stuff from my room to the shower but if i need to, then i will.

I texted him after our meeting to clarify what’s going on between us. 

Me: So our little convo was pretty much just to have closure, right?

Him: I think we were happy to catch up. Or I was at least. I don't think we talked about anything touchy. 

Me: Okay. Just making sure it wasn’t for anything more than just saying cool to see ya and then parting ways

Him: Well I would be willing to talk about that stuff but not over text because things can easily be confused etc.


Me: I’m just clarifying that it was a convo to kind of close a chapter on our lives of us being together and to see how we have grown and to let go of like resentment and guilt by discussing things calmly. At least it did that for me. I feel closure and at peace now.

Him: Well I do feel more at peace now and it was clear that resentment and ill will had decreased but we didn’t necessarily talk about that stuff directly is what Im saying. I have been thinking about how nice of a conversation it was and that it was healthy for both of us. I would be willing and wanting to talk in the future. I appreciate you very much and only hope the best for you too of course.

203,"This is a huge rambly mess. I'm writing this coming down from a breakdown, sorry

I have two main groups of friends, the people who I'm closest with. One group is three people I've grown up with and gone to school with. The other is a two people I've known online for like, 7 years now.

This happened gradually, I first started noticing around this time last year, but they all seem to be distancing themselves from me. At first it was small things that built up. My irl friends suddenly became very flaky, I would make plans with them (sometimes weeks in advance later on as I thought maybe I was just being insensitive to their schedules) and they end up cancelling or telling me later that they forgot. They hang out with each other often, though, and mention it. There have been times where one says he'll come visit me, and then later someone else in our friend group invites him over and he cancels with me to go see them, for example.

In our group chat, they see my messages and don't respond to them. Someone else will post something as if I had never sent anything at all, and the others will reply to that. They also don't dm me or answer my dms, but they'll send screenshots of them dming each other sometimes. It's like I'm not even there. It's like this with my online friends too, for some reason.

I've brought this up with them. I started asking around September if they were mad at me or something, or if I was being annoying. They assured me I wasn't. My irl friends didn't seem to understand why I was upset. They kept saying they don't understand why I have an issue, like, as if they were acting normally. But they aren't? It wasn't like this before? but when they talk to me about it it sounds like I'm just crazy, like I'm the only one noticing and I'm the only one getting upset, apparently over no reason. It wasn't a big deal to them.

I started questioning myself, I was so scared and insecure and I still am that's why I'm posting this. I don't know if this is just normal and I'm being stupid about it because everyone else is treating me like this is normal. I've never been clingy with my friends but I'm just so lonely, I never see them, it feels like I can't rely on them anymore because they never give me the time of day. They haven't asked me how I am lately like they used to, they don't listen to me when I try to talk to them, they just talk about how stressed they are about x thing. But I keep thinking ""I'm the only one who's upset, so I'M the problem, not them""

I had a breakdown at some point and I cried in front of two of my irl friends when I saw them for the first time in weeks. I told them I felt like they were ignoring me on purpose and that I felt like they didn't care about me anymore. They seemed so baffled, wondering why I thought that. They told me that they didn't know what I was so upset about but they would try to fix it. I brought it up w my online friends and they apologized and said they'd talk to me more.

Neither situations have changed. I've been ignored and rejected by my friends for so, so long. I don't know why I let this happen for as long as I did. I kept thinking I was being selfish for wanting to talk to them because they had stuff going on that they were dealing with, things they were stressed about. That they would tell me about. But I was stressed too, and I wanted to talk to them about it too, but they wouldn't give me the time of day. I felt like I was being selfish and I just needed to give them more time. And I let it go on after I brought it up, because they told me nothing was wrong and I thought i was just making it all up in my head, that this was normal, because every time I bring it up they all act so surprised.

I've been ignored and rejected by my friends for so long that I'm scared to talk to them. It's fucked up my self esteem, I constantly feel worthless. My depressive episodes have gotten worse and my suicidal thoughts came back, and it doesn't feel like I have anyone to turn to. I have no one else other than them. I've been trying to make new friends, but it's difficult, because I live in a really small town, it's difficult for me to get to the city (an hour away) to mingle with new people. I've tried talking to people online too, but, my self-esteem is so fucked up and i'm so terrified about simple conversations, when I never was before. I don't know how to talk to people because I'm expecting rejection.

I'm sorry that this is so long. I just, don't know if I'm making this all up in my head or not. I need an outsiders perspective because all of my friends are acting like I'm blowing this out of proportion and making it a big deal when it's not or something. I feel so stupid. I don't know what to do. I have no idea what's real. Is this a problem, or am I just being paranoid and sensitive?",24Feb2019,1

205,"I usually don't post anything personal online but I need to hear other people's opinion on this matter. Ever since I graduated middle school in 2016, I've been going to an online high school where everyday I did my work on the family computer. The reason I wanted to go to an online school was because I didn't enjoy going to a physical school. I have social anxiety so I always got extremely anxious about the thought of talking to other people and I even felt stomach pains so I used that excuse to be absent that day. Since I would miss many days, my grades weren't exactly the best nor where they the worst. I've been this way since as far as I could remember. It was too difficult for me to make any friends. Even when the other students would offer to be my friend I would refuse because I know I would push them away and never speak to them because of my anxiety. I managed to make one friend from elementary school till middle school but we weren't super close where I could freely speak my true feelings. Ever since I graduated we don't talk anymore except a few occasions because my mom and his mom are good friends. 

I know that it's not normal that my he was my only friend even though I'm a girl so that might've created a few borders. I feel as though he doesn't want to talk to me anymore. Maybe he found friends better than me so I don't blame him for not wanting to hang out. I think it's best that I shouldn't visit his house anymore for the purpose of meeting him. I'm done with talking about my background, I'll get to the point.  Recently my sister who is my closest friend, kept saying that I should go to a physical high school since she's a freshman and she really enjoys it. She says I need to actually talk to other students and interact with a real teacher and not a screen. She says that high school is like a Persona game which is a video game series where the main focus is forming close bonds with others and high school life. If it was so easy to go back to a real high school I would've done it by now. I would like to make friends but at the same time I get extremely anxious just by the thought of meeting strangers and forced to talk to them. I really don't want to feel that feeling again, it's much more simpler to work behind a screen. What if I end up like how I was back in middle school? Isolated and wanting to go back home. I ask of anyone reading to give me advice on what decision I should make. It's not an easy one for me. Thanks for hearing me out.",24Feb2019,2

207,"I actually have no idea of how to start this post. My story begins on November of 2018, just after my last day of high school senior year I traveled to the capital of my country to compete on the physics Olympiad, it went extremely well and I got podium. The last day after the ceremony one of the teachers talk to me about competing at the IPhO( International Physics Olympiad) but as I was going to graduate from high school a few weeks later I""ll have to postpone my entrance to uni, it was my dream since I was a sophomore so I instantaneously said a big yes. I was accepted at a super top school here (had a great score at my SAT–equivalent exam and also crushed the admission test) so I had to ask the university to postpone my enrollment and they said it was okay as long as I sent them my degree certificate the thing is the day I got that email I was super busy in training (I have to compete for my place in the IPhO team) and they gave me less than 24 hours to send it so I just couldn't send it in time and lost my place at uni and if that was not enough they have a policy for this cases and it says I get sanctioned (it is a public school) and can not participate in the admission process until the second semester of 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

All this have really destroyed all my plans, I have studied almost daily since I was a sophomore because all my life I have dreamed of escaping this place (I live in a small city and the uni is at the capital). I already sent emails to the school and tried some legal actions but they have not even replayed replied them, yesterday I sent the last one asking for a response as the inscriptions for the semester I want to enter close on Wednesday. Honestly I have real chances of making it to the team but if I do not have a uni before  turning 18 (in two months) I will have to go to the military and surely my girlfriend will dump me as soon as she gets to know I will be all that time out of uni (she is already at the capital) it also makes me feel like shit as I know it is completely my fault to not have sent the certificate on time. I just can not express how much I hate being at this shitty town and I don't even know if my parents will make enroll into a local university after I come from the army.

I have never felt this lost in my whole life and If the uni does not give me a favorable answer soon am pretty sure I will just enter into depression.",24Feb2019,1
208,"It's a bit of a story, but here goes. I enjoy craft beer, and have a favorite bar. I've ran into this girl occasionally and we generally get along, joke, etc. 

Yesterday I ran into her again, and we started talking. She mentioned that she was single as of a couple weeks ago. She also mentioned she found me attractive. We sat and talked for almost 4 hours, just her and I. And at the end of it, I failed to get her phone number as I'd like to see her again. Even as friends. 

But I don't know her last name so I can't look her up on Facebook. But I do know her first name and where she works. 

I was thinking on Monday, calling her office and asking her out, but I think that comes across as creepy? I'm very outgoing, but when it comes to relationship type talks I get very shy. Even the bartender asked why I didn't get her number as we both seemed to enjoy each other. 

So, Reddit advice givers, do I call her office on Monday, or wait til next Friday and hope she shows up? ",24Feb2019,3
209,So literally only 3-4 days ago I broke up with my girlfriend and she was completely devastated saying she didn’t want to lose me etc. but we ended on good terms and decided to stay friends. But today she asked if we could just fuck whenever. I said I didn’t know but my dick doing the talking I kinda said sure in other ways. It seems like She pretty much has just become dick crazy. I told her I would only do it if there was no stings attached and I could literally still talk to whatever girls I wanted. Then she brought up that she was gonna fuck a bunch of dudes too which I’m not down with being one of the dudes that is just passing her around. Then she switched it up and said it would only possibly be one dude. I brought up the idea of a threesome which would be amazing lol. She said she would be down for that.

210,"The title basically explains it, my friend Lily is super religious and “against gay people pushing their beliefs onto others” I introduced them to my other friend Naomi who they didn’t know was a lesbian until recently. Lily was pissed when she found out and had badmouthed Naomi to the rest of our friends for a few days now calling her all sorts of insulting things. She made a group chat excluding Naomi from it and is telling us that she doesn’t want to have her part of our friend group anymore. She says that a part of the reason she doesn’t want her hanging out with us is because Naomi had said that I was really pretty and Lily interpreted that as her trying to make a move on me. I don’t see it that way at all, in fact I take that as a compliment. In my opinion Lily is being a hypocrite by trying to push her own beliefs. I’m really torn about what I should do, the rest of our friends haven’t responded to her message yet so I have no idea how they might react or who’s side they might take.

211,"So tonight was kinda weird. Showed up at this party and a ton of ppl were there, had a lot to drink, then the parade started and I went with a group to the front of this one big house that used to be the SPOT, but now it’s basically a middle-high school loading zone, but the police don’t go there. Then I started getting groped by this guy from a different school and I told him to stop but he didn’t. So I was about to punch him, but then I saw my friend (28M) across the street.

Now we’ve been trying to get together again and catch up on a lot of stuff for like 2 months now but the timing has always been off. We both made excuses and we’ve both done things to fuck up the relationship we have a bit, but lately I made a huge mistake by sending him this email rly late at night and it made him very angry. Ever since, we’ve been trying to avoid the topic and pretend it didn’t happen, but we both know what happened. 

Anyways so I text him and ask where he is so we can meet up. Then I see him walking with this girl and I freak out, I’m not thinking straight or walking straight, and I overreact and overthink and I get mad at him. I decide to walk past them and pretend I don’t see them, then I text back that I know exactly when they are but I wasn’t going to talk to him. He later says he thinks he saw me and I tell him I’m at the park now, I couldn’t keep walking alone or else I’d get arrested (2 kids got DUIs, both walked alone). I waited for him for 15 minutes and he didn’t show, he later said he was driving his drunk friends home.

All I wanted to do was to hang out with him and catch up and sort things out while we had time and get to meet his friends who I’m sure are super chill but I didn’t. I looked behind me while I was walking in front of him and I saw that he had left the girl and was looking for me, and I should have called out to him because I realized then I was overreacting, but I decided not to. 

Later he said he wa sorry he couldn’t make it work. I didnt tell him the real reason I didn’t call out to him bc it sounds stupid, we aren’t even dating.

Idk what to do because every time onenofus wantsnto meet up the othe flakes our or something else is going on that’s inconvenient, but we both want to make this work, how can it work?

So after that I met up with some old friends (20+) and we went to this guy’s house. Had a few drinks, then we were supposed to go to another party but the car couldn’t fit us all. I decided to leave bc I needed to get back to my car, but I had to call this dude (18M) to get me.

So this guy has kids in his car. He tells me to ‘behave’ but I talk anyways because I’m not thinking straight. He texts me later after he drops me off and says he’s super pissed that he ‘trusted’ me or whatever and put his neck on the line and that I should have behaved but idk how that would even work, it’s just a ride and kids don’t understand shit especially when they’re absorbed in their iPads, and I didn’t even say anything that inappropri. I show the text messages to the party and a lot of ppl gets riled up in a drunken riot and calling him a piece of shit. Some people tell me he’s being manipulative, one guy volunteered to beat him up. But orettt much everyone agreed that he was being a huge dick trying to control my actions even though he knows I can’t.

Should I feel at fault for this?

Turns out a few of the people at my school that I thought I hated/were disappointing are actually pretty cool. Saw a couple people from my AP classes after hours and it was hilarious but awkward at the same time. I love how this one guy (19M)’s party in particular was filled with good vibes and everyone was having a great time, it really brought out the best in all of us and he’s a real one. Hope he has all the best things in life because he really deserves it. Plus his little bro (15M) is sooo cute like adorable and they both deserve the best.

TL;DR: My Mardi Gras night didn’t go so well and I need help with several things: relationship with this guy, groping (what should I have done?), weird driver.

I'm sorry, please try and look past it.  Another thing that should be stated, is that I'm a virgin. That's important to the story, so make fun of me all you want idrc. 

          Lately I have been casually trading pics with this girl, kind of exiting as I'm not really the type to get into that kind of stuff. Anyway the girl isn't exactly attractive, in fact she's probably about a 3/10. She recently said that we could do the ol' monster mash, and I got very exited and happily accepted. But what I forgot about, is that I recently fell deeply, and whole heartedly in love with my best friend. She is easily an 11/10 and we are completely compatible. If I wait about a year and a half I will have the chance to ask her out, and I already know she's down to be the sheath to my meat sword, so late in our projected relationship, that would definitely happen. 
    
            This is where I come to crossroads. On one hand, I smash and dash, and can tell my friends I lost my virginity. On the other hand, I get into a meaningful relationship and have a wonderful first time with the girl of my dreams. You can tell I've gotten to a new low, asking people on Reddit which girl I should sleep with, but I really really need some help here.

216,"We are four college age females living together in a house. We all started out pretty good friends and decided to be roommates, this is our second year together. We all have our own bedrooms. Over the past few months my roommates have been doing small things to break my trust in them. Like breaking my stuff and not telling me/not taking care of it, ignoring my requests when using my stuff, setting my plants on fire, moving my things (I have come to the understanding that if I leave it in the public area I can't be too upset if someone moves it). Most recently I have noticed things in my room being out of place or missing. I have always had a nanny cam and they knew this, but I wasn't using it until recently when things were out of place in my private room. Since I put it back up I have noticed quite often they will snoop in my room, although I haven't seen them take anything. I have also caught them talking behind my back (which was something we agreed we wouldn't do if we had a negative feeling about each other as with a previous roommate it turned it into us against her). They have also lately been more deliberate to point out my mistakes and pick fights about miniscule things with me, and a lot of what I over heard them talking bout me is minuscule things, like my plant in the corner (it has been there for 2 years) now all of a suddenly bothers them. It's usually one brings something up and eggs on the other to agree and then they both continue with an extra negative comment.

   So I have this friend, (Possibly..) His name is uh, Jack. And jack was a friend since the beginning of school, and we’ve been talking and laughing since. Another girl, named er, Sophie. She was one too, until she was so rude to me and others I stopped hanging out with her. Well, this affected my relationship towards Jack. Last week, (Wednesday) We we’re talking to each other, while Sophie really wasn’t caught up on us. 
  And so on Friday, after advisory was over. (He doesn’t sit next to me, even when I do, he moves.

    Being that one emotional person inside, I think that he doesn’t wanna talk to me. So when I step outside he goes talk to Sophie. Ironic thing is that they don’t even have the same class, (1stfloorvs3rd;we were on the second) 
     But we have the same schedule, though. He completely ignores me the whole day. And talks to Sophie.

219,"My dad was born when my grandmother was in high school. He didn't know until well into adulthood that my grandpa is not his biological father, but rather adopted my dad when he was 5 and my grandpa and grandma married. My grandmother has a lot of mental health issues and he had a terrible childhood. We don't really talk about or acknowledge the fact that my grandpa isn't my biological grandfather. I don't really have much of a relationship with him. 

My mom told me that my grandmother claims she married my dad's bio father. I figured she was lying, since she lies a lot about various things, as a result of her severe mental illness. However, on a whim tonight I decided to take another look, and I found it. I found scanned copies of the marriage and divorce certificates and all the details line up. 

I feel a strange joy, and a strange grief. I've been googling, I found that his second son has inherited his father's business and is very active on social media. He seems like a cool guy and he looks so much like my dad, it's eerie. I may tell my mom that I found him (my parents are divorced and don't talk, they really hate each other so she wouldn't say anything to him). My dad has always seemed to have zero interest in finding out who his father is. I really want to know more but I know I shouldn't open a can of worms. I may just sort of watch the son's social media from afar, and allow that to be the only connection I have to my genetic relatives. I know they aren't truly family, but I feel a connection to them. I have no idea what to do or think or feel. Do his other son's even know that my dad exists? Do they care? Would I just cause issues by contacting them??? Do I just sit on this information?

220,"My understanding of morality is predicated on the conclusion that morality is relative and derived from empathy and our ingrained wiring as humans. I would argue that empathy and the resulting basic morality that is common amongst most humans: killing is wrong, inflicting pain is wrong, etc has been a good thing from an evolutionary standpoint. It has curbed selfish behavior and is key to our ability to cooperate which in itself has been key to the creation of human civilization. However the knowledge we have built up through the generations has given us the tools of science we need to self examine to some extent. I would consider myself an empathetic person, I have my own personal beliefs based on my experiences and undoubtedly those surrounding me who have influenced me. However with my understanding that morality and indeed most of our incentives for pleasure is a construct built to further our species I cannot help but feel like a puppet. My emotions lead me to actions that many might consider good, however if my emotions are just the expression of genetic predispositions then are they worthwhile? At the same time these emotions are necessary to the human experience; a purely logical being would have no purpose as it would not have any goals to use logic to achieve. I’m stuck then bound to emotions, morality, and even my other base motivations that are at their core baseless. I have rejected the idea of a god in the man made sense because I know there is no evidence for it despite the idea of a god being comforting. However I’m not a machine I can’t simply shut off my baseless instinctual motivations and morality. And even if I did I would only achieve a less abstracted version of purposelessness.

221,"This is a shitty situation all around.

So I work with my best friend, who is technical my supervisor now. Company has been alluding to possibly cutting our department, one of our team members left, it's not a great situation for any of us.

I don't know if it's JUST the stress of work, but we also live together, and despite the occasional minor annoyance, we've never really ""argued"". But lately, it's started to feel like there's some brewing animosity between us -- even I'm guilty, and I'm not quite sure why. Things that shouldn't bother me do, and things that should bother me feel like I get insanely angry (for instance, when they invite people over and don't tell me, or they gave a key to one of their friends that I've only just met, I was fuming mad when I found out).

Now, here's where things get serious.

Last week, as we're leaving work  he gets caught up texting someone. He mentions it's a woman he met playing basketball, they're just sending jokes back and forth. Considering my friend flirts with women as his default setting (and to be fair, he's rarely if ever the one who instigates it, and his wife is well aware of him being naturally flirty), I don't think MUCH of it, but something just struck me as odd about it. I don't remember if it's that night or the next, but he goes out to play again (pretty common, he's in several leagues, usually playing every week night). I go to bed, but hear the garage unusually late, like 1pm. My recollection is muddy, but I just remember waking up, hearing him and his wife yelling. I don't remember what I even heard, I just remember thinking it sounded like she was accusing him of cheating and he was getting pissed off, but admittedly I can't here THAT well in my room, I mostly just registered loud voices.

Anyways, a few days later he invites two friends for basketball over, a guy and this woman he was texting. His wife was home, I was asleep when they all got in, but when I woke up they had all stayed the night. She seemed a nice enough person (we pretty much all spent the day together as it was a snow day).

Well tonight, he and his wife leave separately, and he comes back shortly after. Thinking it's just him, I walk out to the kitchen just to grab something to eat, when I see my friend and his basketball friend, both ""dressed up"", while she's cooking.

Something about it just REALLY gave me a bad vibe.

So here's the thing... My friend has cheated before. Of the four serious relationships I know, he cheated in two of them. The first time nearly ruined his life (long story, but it was BAD, we thought he was going to kill himself in the aftermath). I have zero doubt whatsoever that he loves his wife. Like, wouldn't hesitate to step in front of a train. But I also know he has a wandering eye, and him and his wife have had counseling on and off again (which is none of my business, I just mention it because they're clearly working on their relationship).

Because I live with both him and his wife, I feel like I'm in a super weird position. Yet because we've really been getting into heated arguments lately, I don't feel like I could even *attempt* to talk to him about what's going on. I mean, yes, it's super awkward to feel like I'm spectating the worst possible outcome of any relationship (although again, I suppose it's none of my business). But I also worry that if my friend DOES cheat, he's going to throw away everything he's spent his entire life trying to build. Like... If he DID cheat (and I don't necessarily think he has, so much as I worry he may be heading in that direction), and it came out, his entire *world* would crumble around him.

This is a highly unusual situation, and I just don't really know what I should do. I mean, I sort of feel like it's none of my business, it's not my place to be interjecting in whatever he and his wife are going through, and given the already high tension between us, it might be better to just stick my head in the sand. I've got my own shit to deal with, after all.

But then I also wonder if maybe a good friend *would* step in and try to help him see what he might be risking? Hell, could it be that tension between him and I might even contribute to the idea, if he feels like he doesn't have anyone in his corner?

I don't know. This has just really been weighing on me lately, and particularly today.",24Feb2019,1

225,"Little bit about myself, I'm 35 years old, I became sober when I was 21, never did the AA steps until recently \[which I will get into in a bit\]. Still sober today though but it's painful.

&amp;#x200B;

I was an EMT that worked in remote industrial areas for 4.5 years, I worked for 3 ambulance services before that, one was volunteer and is still a reference for me and I worked there for a year and a half and saw some very bad calls including a death of an 11 year old, so I know I could do the job. The other 2, sad to say it basically fired me and told me to seek experience elsewhere, some of it was just that I was a slow learner, other parts of it I got screwed over. Patients were never harmed though, I even talked to one of the guys I worked with at one place about 6 months ago and he told me that it was bullshit what happened to me, anyways. That spiraled me over the edge and I tried to kill myself then. I don't think I actually wanted to die though cause once I realized what I did I said ""shit"". I tried to get into nursing afterward but couldn't get the grades required to get into it. I was tired, defeated, and burnt out and that's when I wanted to go work the industrial sector as an EMT, and for a time I absolutely loved it.

In 2017 I came off my anti depressants because I wanted to have ""better sex"" with this woman on vacation. I only tapered for a week and was on them for almost 10 years. I feel like it was a blessing in disguise though. I fucking hate anti depressants now. I feel like they fogged my cognition, made me fat, and made me sexually dysfunctional, catatonic, less engaged, less awareness etc. I lost almost 40 pounds when I came off them, anyways I hit an emotional bottom because I was spending 8 hours a day on tinder and dating sites and on my 34th birthday my dad suggested I try going back to AA since I Never finished the steps. So I got a sponsor and did them all sober and I began the change into a new person.

When I went back to my job for the last 6 months until I got laid off in November, after doing the steps I realized I only did that job because I wanted to make as much money as possible and do nothing all day \[cause that's what the job is 99.9% of the time\] and I realized that job wasn't for who I am meant to be as a person. I wanted a more meaningful life and one where I was home in my own bed every night \[The job makes me work out of town\]. I set myself up in a job that was ultimately the loneliest job I could do and it was very painful the last 6 months at that job realizing that at my age I could have worked towards something more wholesome.

I had been seeing a therapist at the hospital and she referred me to a mental health day hospital program but during the course of working out of town I started upgrading a math course to try and get into nursing again \[cause that's the only logical thing I could see myself doing\] and doing it while in this mental health day hospital is fucking hard. But I still pushed myself to do it regardless because I am getting older and I want to get this shit done and hopefully get into nursing but I am honestly terrified that if I fail at this again like I did back in 2012 and 2013 that I don't know what it will do to my psyche. My brain felt so inflamed and hot at the back of my head today and using the mental health skills I've been learning at the hospital wasn't working

What should I do if I don't get the grades I need? What would you do in my situation? Being at the hospital every day just reinforces my want to be a nurse. The way my brain is working lately with my thoughts is if I don't get into a nursing program in the next couple years that I will just off myself because I am tired of having everything go wrong in my life all the time. I'm single \[by choice now but that's a whole other story\], I am not close with my family, I'm one of those types of people that has tons of acquaintances but very little actual friends, I am not doing well and I feel like this dumb course is the one strand of hope I have to get something meaningful out of my life and I don't even seem able to handle it. Not to mention, if I see friends that I went to EMT school with post on Facebook about their jobs in the city they got which I wasn't able to get I default to wanting to die more. ",24Feb2019,2
226,"When I was 19, I was arrested while homeless after being found with a bunch of pills. I got off with a misdemeanor but had to serve a sentence of jail time and rehab.

I got out, and moved in with my mom after a year. I’m 23 now. Got back together with my ex who kept doing drugs with me. We both couldn’t hold jobs.

I’m sober now. I’m dating a girl who is fantastic. She’s going to be a nurse, has her own apartment and is helping me get my GED. I’m excited! I even cut ties with everyone I know who deals drugs/does drugs.

I can’t help but feel like I threw my life away, though. I’m not working right now; I don’t even know where to start as I have a criminal history and my employment history is dodgy at best.

228,"I’m 30 years old, female, I live in the US. I work for a call center company and my client is a tax preparation software. This is the time of the year that we call business critical because this is usually the only time of the year customers call in. I do not take phone calls anymore, unless enough people call off of work in one day, I am the person who listens to phone calls for quality assurance and coaches phone agents who need to improve. I am also known as “floor support” because phone agents reach out to me for help with their calls.

I started this job on 8/27/18 after being hired on 8/1. Before that I didn’t work since 1/27/17. I had a baby on 10/19/15 and from there my life went downhill. I was depressed, anxious, emotional and suicidal. I lost three jobs within months of each other. I decided to go to the hospital on 1/30/17 and was on medication ever since.

Even though I was on medication so my depression, suicidal thoughts and emotions were under control, my anxiety skyrocketed. I didn’t want to work and couldn’t figure how to anyway. I couldn’t figure out how to make a resume, apply for a job or show up to an interview. Things I could easily do long before I just couldn’t anymore.

In June 2018 I started on an anxiety medication and everything was 100%. I moved to another city on 7/9/18 and was hired for my current job on 8/1/18. As you can tell by the dates, I have been doing really well at my job to already be promoted. I actually ended up getting my current position in October after only a month on the phones. I’m that good. This job is an amazing match for me and I’m so happy.

The part that sucks is this:
I’m supposed to get my medication mailed to me since my work hours are during the same hours the pharmacy is open. But on the day I expected to get them they never came (Last friday). I had to wait until my lunch break on the day they were open to call them. By that time I had miss one day of my meds. I found out that my insurance coverage was terminated. My son and I were on medicaid because for so long I was without a job and even with one I cannot afford to purchase insurance. I called the medicaid office and was told that I lost my medical due to not providing my proof of income. But from what I found on the website, I had submitted it! I was floored. I had even updated my new address and phone number on the website yet the agent on the phone did not see any of that. I decided to renew my benefits by starting all over again, submitting everything even things I knew they had for years, and filling out the long form if the application.

It took me until Wednesday to finish it and we were so busy at work this week that I could not call in to do the “interview” (they basically ask you all the same questions from the application but I guess it is to prove you aren’t lying or something, honestly I do not see the point of having both an app and an interview if it’s all the same questions) until this Friday. The woman who did my interview did not have much patience with me. By that time I was  5 or 6 days without my meds. Without them I cannot understand or remember things well if I don’t focus and read over things to check them. I could barely hear this woman with all the noise in her background and she kept talking away from the phone. I would have to tell her several times to repeat herself or that I didn’t understand her. She got frustrated with ME and started yelling at me. I stopped her right there, explained that I’m mentally ill and she should know that with her job she would have to deal with all types of people and she needed to be patient with me. (Remember, at my job I am the person who would have pulled this agent off of the phone and coached them on how unprofessional they were being with the customer.) She said she understood but once again after I had to ask her to repeat another question because she was speaking away from the mic, she snapped at me again. I started crying and told her to nevermind, I would do the interview with someone else and hung up. She called me back. I was pissed because in my job you do not call a customer back when they request to not speak to you anymore. She was still yelling at me and being mean! I let my emotions get the best of me because I am off of meds and yelled back at her. I couldn’t help it. Her manager got on the phone with me and told me I needed to calm down or I would have to speak to someone else. I told her that that’s what I wanted in the first place because her agent was bullying me. So then the manager back-tracked and said the agent would help me and be nice now. Anyway, finally I was able to finish the application and the lady told me that I didn’t qualify for the medicaid services anymore. I tried to ask her what I should do but she said she didn’t know. I don’t think she did it right and I applied for an appeal.

After that incident on Friday and how I’ve been feeling all weekend, I just do not think I can go back to work in this condition. I do not think I should even go to work until I get medicated again. I’m starting to feel like I did before I started the anxiety medication. I’m also scared because this is the only job I’ve had in a long time where I’m actually good at it and don’t just fake it all. I probably won’t get another job like it and I’m pretty sure my boss will just fire me as soon as I tell her all of this. Is there a way to tell her so she won’t? Am I basically screwed? I just don’t know if my boss will accept that or what. I don’t know how to tell her all of this. What should I do?",24Feb2019,3

233,"This is my first time using reddit so sorry in advance if I make any mistakes. Also sorry if this is long and unorganized. 

&amp;#x200B;

So recently I heard from a friend that this girl (girl=F) talks shit behind my back constantly about how she doesn't understand why I'm friends with ""Her"" friend group because apparently I'm too stupid for them. F has done similar things before where she will ask me why am I so stupid or constantly joke about how much she hates me or want me to leave right in front of me, but I always took it as a joke plus no-one else seems to actually think that I'm stupid. FYI I love to entertain people and I sort of have this persona of being super self-centered, not having basic common knowledge and being extremely stupid in certain situations. This fake persona adds a lot of fun to the people around me and everyone knows that it's just an act expect for two person, F and another friend (M) The difference is M wouldn't just straight up tell me that I'm too stupid nor does she think she's too good to be friends with someone that isn't smart. 

I always thought that F and I are friends but over the screenshots my friend sent me she said ""How tf are you friends with \[My name\] she's so stupid and retarted "" and many other things about me being too stupid to be in AP math (I'm in grade 11 and I'm currently doing grade 12 AP math because I put a lot of time and effort into it+I actually enjoy math lmao) and then preceded to assume that my dad paid to get me into AP math. For the record F thinks she's smarter than the whole school despite literally everyone else in our friend group having much higher marks and/or is doing courses way above their level. F on the other hand does regular grade 11 courses and gets average marks (not saying average is bad but in this case she's really just average.) Everyone kind of just ignores what she says as she will somehow make herself better using her twisted logic. There's a lot more problem with F that I'm not even going to mention but we always just thought her parents were the cause of this. (Her parents are a little sexist and to be fair F isn't really treated well compared to her brother) I'm not the first person to be annoyed by F as many of my friend complains to me about her. I actually heard that F hates me from a conversation about how the guy was so done with F. 

The problem is am I in the wrong here for not making it clear enough to F that every time I act stupid its a god damn joke. should I just confront F? Sorry if this came off as more of a rant than asking for advice but Im so pissed at F right now I can't think. ",24Feb2019,2
234,"I (21M) am in my 3rd year of college and have been dating someone (21F) for 6 months now and while that's been great, my heart occasionally tells me it wants something it can't have: Another girl (also 21) who lives 250 miles away back in my hometown.

I'm doing 5 years of college because of my major requiring so many classes so even if I wanted to move back home after college that's 2 years from now. She's eventually going to transfer to another school once she's done at community college which could be this year or next year. I'm not about to break up with my current girlfriend though because I love her and is you know, in the same town as me. I do plan on applying to a university less than an hour from my hometown for a credential after I graduate (taken or single) so I'd be relatively in the area.

For some context: On breaks I usually meet with her for coffee to catch up (we don't really text unless we're responding to each other on social media). She's also entertained the idea of visiting before but I don't think she's that serious about it. It's just a little odd to me, she offered support when my dad died, she remembers my birthday, she makes the effort to still talk to me even though I didn't talk to her much until after high school. Not once has there been any mention of feelings so for all I know she could just be a good friend and see nothing more than that.

My girlfriend and I met freshman year of college but didn't start dating until right before junior year. Before we became official we were best friends. Since we're in the same major we have many classes in common and are able to see each other throughout the day otherwise we'd never really get an opportunity. It helps that we live in the same apartment too. As not good as it sounds I really wouldn't have it any other way because honestly we know it wouldn't have worked otherwise. We're not perfect people but our relationship is going just fine with no real problems.

I'm happy, I just have this strange hang up on thinking what the other situation is like and if I'd be happier not. These feelings come and go but with each new wave it gets harder to shake it. I'm afraid to talk to my girlfriend about it because while she might appreciate the honesty, it's just not the thing you want to hear.

I can absolutely understand that. 
I'm somehow emotionally involved with him. I haven't gotten into any relationship since the age of 15, because of my fear of heartbreaks.
With this man, however, I feel at ease. And as much as I can understand what he has gone through, I'm also scared for myself. What if I end up breaking my heart again? Isn't it better to be selfish and emotionally detach myself from him? 

As much as he claims he's neutral, he does behave in a way that shows he's interested, but really scared. I'm afraid he'll never be able to show his true feelings for me. And we'll just end up drifting apart.

I'm worried that if I do however detach myself from him, it would only lead him to nowhere. He really means a lot to me. I want him to be happy for the rest of his life.

So I’m a junior in high school, and have never been in a  super serious relationship. And there’s this really awesome girl I’ve known for 2 years now, and talked to pretty consistently but never for super long amounts of time. But recently, I’ve been talking to her a lot. If we were calling or talking irl instead of texting, I’d estimate 3+ hours a day, for the last week or so. We talk a lot, but this week has been when we really started to open up with each other and talk all the time. She is super nice, pretty, and sometimes flirty, but she says that she told me that she doesn’t date anymore (it came up in a weird convo, I haven’t asked her out yet).  And even though she says that, the way she talks to me makes me feel like she might want to date me, but I don’t want to have her say no and ruin our friendship.

TL;DR 
Talking to a girl a lot who says she is done dating, even though she is sending me mixed messages and has started being flirty with me lately.

I'm not going to ever have kids.
No family -- no close family, no siblings, no family reunions.
Not dating anyone-- and not planning on dating anytime soon
Not sure if I'll ever get married... or if I even want to
No pets-- can't have pets where I am, and can't afford 'em anyway
Can't really travel anytime in the near future (health / finances)
Autistic and rarely find fulfillment from socializing/friends/etc.
No cool career to look forward to, but I get by with my jobs :)
I've been reading a lot on my field to learn and eventually find a better job/career
Dropped out of college with &lt;1 semester left for many reasons
Hobbies just aren't satisfying enough to me these days. I work ~60 hours to to afford basic bills (already living cheap in a pricey city, making low wages, have to use Uber since I cannot ever drive &amp; there's no bus/walkable city paths to get to jobs, etc.). Mentioning work since I just don't have the energy or time after work to be able to pursue many hobbies. I watch movies sometimes, read, and things like that though sometimes. Those hobbies just aren't filling the emptiness in my heart from having no family/etc.
Eventually going to move to a city with a bus or sidewalks so I can actually go places... but can't afford to move for 1+ year
I have like one local friend who lives across town. I'm not looking to meet new friends. I have to Uber everywhere I go since I cannot drive and live in the suburbs (no bus, &amp; not a walkable suburb). I also just don't have the desire to meet friends. I'm not ""bored""-- just want something fulfilling in my life. I rarely find fulfillment from other people (I""m autistic, introverted, etc.). It's expensive to have friends or try to meet people since I have to Uber to go anywhere (literally not a walkable suburb... extremely rare pedestrians &amp; several recent pedestrian deaths nearby in the news). So, yeah, Uber = meeting up with friends is expensive.
Planning to move in 1+ year (probably ~14 months until I can afford to move &amp; find a job in a walkable/bus-filled city)
I know these are relatively mild problems, but after many rough years with tons of loss and tragedies, I can't find anything in the near future to look forward to. I've been shopping too much online to have something to look forward to, and I want something more in life. I'll probably eventually go back to college, but autistic burnout and finances made it not a good time to finish school right now.

246,"Getting something out of the way:

First post here, thought about posting it to r/askreddit but I wasn't sure to sure and felt this fit more. If it's not in the spirit of the board and needs to be moved/deleted that's fine. It's also late so forgive me for a wall of text and any typos, I'll try to proofread and make it eye friendly.

&amp;#x200B;

So, starting off. I've worked multiple jobs over the past 7 years in retail/food ranging from cashier to shift manager, did a few retail assistant manager spots and a temporary store manager position. My last two jobs have asked me to come back (one as General manager. I'm very confident in my ability to work and manage but there is a good reason I've left).

&amp;#x200B;

Getting to what I'm trying to ask is, **with my experience why don't I get call backs**? I'm focusing on college and pursuing another career right now, so I'm trying to find something ""chill"" like a cashier/entry level position. (No offence to anyone, I have worked very high paced cashier spots before but the places I'm applying to aren't those)

&amp;#x200B;

As well, every place I have ever worked does not call references. I've never been called as a reference for someone either (a lot of people use me as theirs) but that being said a lot of my managers have quit/left the company over the years. Last GM left after I left, the job before that my GM &amp; AM were let go and before that my SM quit (which is why I was doing the temporary SM for a while). That's my past 4 years of work, I can't say I really keep in touch with anyone of them truthfully as we all had business relationships. Would that be a problem?

&amp;#x200B;

Actually getting into the interview portion: what do I wear? One of my jobs (assistant manager at a clothing store) I was wearing a dress shirt and slacks, nothing too fancy. I got the job but learned I was the butt of the joke (in a nice way, they were all good people) because I was ""overdressed"". So, what do I wear? Should I just go for it and dress the same way every time no matter if it's a minimum wage position or a management position?

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, (I promise) how do you handle interview questions? Do not take this as arrogance, I know how hard I work and how I work compared to other people but ""Tell me a time you went above and beyond at your job"" ?? Literally everyday I do 110% my work ethic and how people view me are very important to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;dr: Why don't I get call backs? My past management team has quit/been let go and I don't use them as references, can this hurt me? How do I dress for an interview? Is there really such a thing as being over qualified? With my work background and applying for an entry level spot does it seem like I'm lying on my resume or what?",24Feb2019,1

252,"Hey all. I’m sad and need somewhere to vent I suppose as well as maybe get some advice along the way. 

My ex fiancé and I got engaged Dec 2017. The year of 2018 we broke up about 5 times because I caught him messaging other girls basically. 

How it went: he was messaging one of his exes pretty much the month we got engaged up until I found out and one of the conversations was him promising her he would break up with me depending on if his favorite hockey game won or lost a specific game. Another time was me finding out he got some girls number when he went on a trip for work to Canada and telling her he would have to cook dinner for her next time he was in town. A third time I caught him messaging another ex and within the messages he said if he knew his password to his old phone he would still be looking at her naked pictures. There were about two other incidents as well. 

He is a very very sociable person so he would always tell me he didn’t realize he was flirting and he was just being sociable and the people would mistake it for flirting. He would beg and plead and convince me that he would never do it again. Typing it all out, I know you all are probably calling me an idiot for staying with him and forgiving him so many times. Also typing it out, I know. But love is crazy and love seriously makes you blind. 

So, in about November we got back together  once again after he convinced me it was all in the past. We took a trip to Canada, had a very very good time and all was good. About two weeks after our trip I just had this feeling about how I would never be able to trust him. I was always worried when we weren’t together that he was talking to someone else so I decided to break it off for good. I loved him more than I loved anything and anyone in my entire life but I was driving myself crazy staying with him. I broke up with him, he opposed and it was a very long week of him convincing me to take him back. I left for South Dakota for Christmas to go back home without him and got very very drunk. The next day. I asked him to come visit me because I was weak and i missed him. He did. When he arrived, we told each other we never wanted to be apart again, we planned to see a therapist to work through all of this, and looked each other in the eyes saying we were meant to be. 
Three days later, we are back home in MN. I go out with a friend and the next morning I text him I had a wonderful time but I was a little worried he had someone over while I was gone (my insecurities getting in the way). I’m not sure why, but after I had said that he basically said he had a revelation that I would never trust him, and HE decided to end it. 

This devastated me because only days prior we poured out our hearts to one another saying we weren’t meant to be and would work through all of this together. I had given my heart back to him. Unfortunately, he wouldn’t budge. 

January came (about 7 days after the break up) and we didn’t spend New Years together. I was so depressed about the break up I did not even celebrate while he went out with a coworker of ours. Throughout all of January, I was extremely depressed. I had never been lower in my life. He seemed to be doing fine, going out with friends all the time and sleeping at his buddies a lot more often. He would be very adamant about not getting back together and so by trying to move on, I started talking to this guy. My ex found out one night because a message popped up on my iPad and he FREAKED out saying I was moving on too fast. I took this as a sign he still wanted to be together so I stopped talking to the guy. I would hang on to us still being together because many of the days, he would come back to our apartment and hang out with me all night and always ask if I was talking or seeing anyone. He would flirt with me consistently which made me believe there was a chance. We ended up having sex a few times as well eventually throughout the month. 

One night, I had come home from work at about 10:30. We had been texting/flirting all day and he said he wanted to watch a movie with me after work. I agreed because I wanted to spend time with him. We watched the movie, and I said I was going to bed and he asked if I wanted to sleep with him on the couch. This was the first time he proposed us sleeping in the same place together so I was excited and said okay. We were cuddling, one thing led to the other, and we had sex. Afterwards, he asked if he could have his pillow back and I was very confused and said “I thought you wanted me to sleep with you?” He said, “I mean you can if you want to.”. I was offended because I felt used so I went to my own bed. I stayed up for about 20 minutes because I figured he would come to apologize but he never did. I went back to where he was and he was sleeping, no remorse. It was at this moment I thought something was fishy, so I grabbed his phone and started going through it. 

It turns out. The coworker he went to the New Year’s Eve party with.. he had fucked that night, and they started a relationship. They had been together that entire month of January, as girlfriend and boyfriend.. and he had been leading me on this entire time and not letting me move on myself. All the sleepovers he was having with his “buddy” were really with her. They even went on a trip, got a hotel and basically had sex that entire weekend I thought he was with a friend. The best part? All three of us work in the same building. So not only do I get to see him every day. But also her on the days she works. 



So that’s the background story. And basically. It fucked me up in the head. It hurts so fucking bad. They are together even now and he just threw me away like garbage. How am I supposed to move on from that? How am I supposed to live out my every day life seeing him every day knowing he’s happy with the girl he cheated on me with? It’s so hard. 

My friends were and have been my rock throughout this. I started seeing a therapist which has helped a lot too. Now that it’s about a month past all of it, I’m starting to feel like I’m beating a dead horse when I feel sad about it to my friends even though they never act inconvenienced when I do.  

I absolutely know I’m better off and I deserve better, I know I do. But I can’t just stop loving this person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with as quick as he could. I still love him. A lot. I want to move on so bad. Why do I have to be the one to suffer. What can I do to make this hurt go away?",24Feb2019,1
254,"So my boyfriend and I rent an apartment with another couple. We are all close in age and have long standing relationships. He's 19, I'm 22, the other girl is 21, and her boyfriend is 24.
Today they messaged us in the group chat saying my boyfriend shouldn't walk around without a shirt on because it makes the other girl uncomfortable.
While I feel that she should have the right to feel completely comfortable in her own home, I also feel that to ask a guy to wear a shirt in HIS own apartment is kind of silly. I would understand if it was him walking around in his underwear, but it's just a matter of him being shirtless. And they only ever see each other in passing like when she walks by him in the living room and he's watching TV. He told them he does it because it's hot and doesn't want to blast the AC and I totally get that. I also made the point that well, he's a guy. If we went to the beach or pool together that's how he'd be dressed, and her boyfriend said to me that if thats the case I could just walk around in my bra and panties.
The other girl is an only child and I grew up with my dad and three brothers so I guess to me, shirtless guys aren't that big of a deal. Really I feel like she's being a bit dramatic and it's made things really awkward.
I don't know, I just to hear what other people thought.
In your opinion, should my boyfriend just deal with it and wear a shirt unless he's in his room, or should she just learn what it's like to live with guys?",24Feb2019,1

Yesterday my best friend mentioned that she was going out with a friend to the shopping centre, and then the mall.

She didn’t mention any other names so I had assumed that it would be a 1 on 1 type hangout. Fair enough.

I asked if I can go and she went to ask the main girl that she was going with (who started the whole thing). The main girl said no, because we “weren’t close”. Okay, fair enough. She moved schools and wanted to spend her time with her closer friends. Even though I went to this girl’s birthday and we generally got along well.

My best friend said “they’ll give you a hug on Monday”. Ouch. Okay? That felt like a pitiful way of saying “sorry we don’t care about you.”, but I kept my mouth shut. At the time I didn’t question the use of “they”, but I stayed quiet.

Today I go in insta and check the story, I see they went out in a group of seven? And with a friend that isn’t even that close (as far as I know) to the main girl?

I’m really really hurt by this? I hang out with these guys every single day of school except the main girl, because she moved schools, and I feel that I was pushed aside like trash?

This feeling honestly sucks and I’m worried that I’ve overreacted, even though I didn’t express any of my feelings.

I messaged the girl who posted it on her story and she said that she was sorry that I couldn’t come (?). So I asked her about it and she said, word for word, “cause the 7 of us like normal. Next time maybe!”

When I asked her about the 7 of us thing she said “as in year seven”, which makes no sense.

Its either “cause the year seven us like normal” (?)

Or “the seven of us like normal” as in im a fuckin weirdo.

I can never seem to focus on anything when I’m at home. If I’m watching a show or movie, I’ll get distracted and go on my phone. If I’m doing homework or reading, I can’t go more than 20 minutes without going on my phone.

259,"I've been ghosted a lot these past few years. I was in college for most of them, and if I were to guess, it's probably been eight. That was the first two semesters, though, after that I stopped trying to make friends at all. No one at that school seemed to want to make friends.

For reasons I can't even begin to fathom, I tried making a friend my last semester. We get, or at least got, along really well, hung out a few times even though I'm now graduated. I really thought this time was different. And just when it seemed we were getting to be good friends, it's happened all over again... I ask if they want to hang, they're busy. I ask again a few weeks later, still busy. Not to busy to talk, when I initiate, but too busy to do anything else. I know *exactly* what that means, and this time I'm not sad, I'm angry. Partly at them, partly at myself.

Am I allowed to just confront them and ask if it's over? I feel like asking a person what's really going on is rude these days, because it's just normal to do that to people over tech, and people tell me if other people want to be left alone, you better damn well respect that. Those eight times previous, I would cut both my arms off just to know where I stand, even if it's a ""fuck off, we were never friends"". At least that's honest.

She had posted on her Instagram story “ask me anything”

After a while this guy texted her, he said things along the line 

“What do you see in its-tru? He’s a beta and has a tiny cock”

“So when are you going to break up with that virgin n-word its-tru?”

“What would you do if I killed him?”

“What would you do though cutie? You’re way too good for him”

My girlfriend then asks him who he is and he said he’s pussy for not showing his face (he’s on an alt)

“Someone who deserves you way more than him and it’s to conceal my identity”

“So you won’t know who killed your its-tru”

I don’t want you, I’m taken is what my girlfriend responded with, he then said 

“If I can’t have you then neither can that testicle”

“Watch it cutie Bronx ain’t the cleanest streets”

“No funny though you’re good babe, don’t get scared I don’t want a hottie like you to be stressed”

“You’re not the one who should be worried”

“Your man should though” 

Now all this is whatever but what really got to me was -

“Bye though, I want to fill you with my fatass cock”

So asides from him threatening to kill me the fact that he said that shit to my wonderful girlfriend got me pissed.

I am verbally abusive and emotionally abusive. I say the worst things ever to the person I care about the most. Terrible things.

I am self-centered and incredibly insecure with a giant ego. I think I have Narcissistic characteristics if not some well-disguised sociopathic tendencies. I have constant negative self-talk that feeds a volatility that is hard to control after a certain point.

I have been in therapy on and off since 2013 and a lot in the past year or two. I have called suicide hotlines, religious counselors, licensed therapists, and have a best friend who is a psychologist and wonderful friend. I cannot control my anger.

277,"I was hired mid November and given a pretty good pay for what that position was. There was another person in my team and we handled all of the admin stuff of this one aspect of what the company does. I worked 10-6 Sunday through Thursday. LOVED my job. 

Fast forward to now. She's quit and I understand why. Since she left, I haven't had a day off since mid January. I hit overtime on Friday because I'm scheduled 9 hours a day. My boss seems to think that because I'm scheduled fewer hours on the weekend its the same as having off days, yet I can't take care of ANYTHING. I can't see my family as they live over an hour away, I can't take my car in for repairs, I don't want to hang out with friends even when I'm not working because 1) I'm too exhausted and 2) I'm ""on call"". I'm fitting 16 hours of daily work in to 9 and its stressing me the hell out. 

I've tried expressing that I need help and feel overwhelmed several times but my boss isn't listening to me. He's hired additional help for a similar department so now there's 4 people in that department (2 when I started)  vs the 1 in mine. He's made it clear that I'm not getting help. 

This new responsibility didn't come with a raise, didn't come with anything. In fact, even though I run every aspect of this department now and my former teammate was called the coordinator, I was told I'm NOT the coordinator by my boss but he will tell everyone else in the building that I am. He will state ""ask your coordinator, that's why they make the big bucks"". I make a couple dollars more than a White Castle employee.

282,"I posted earlier from my laptop and the formatting got all messed up so that it shows up on a phone as an unbroken wall of text. Nobody wants to read that. So here's a novel about how I'm the fucking worst.
My (31m) girlfriend (25f) of four years just broke up with me. As soon as it's feasible, she'll probably cut all contact. We both struggle with anxiety and panic attacks, I have depression, she has bipolar and seasonal affective disorder. The winters here are hard.
I bit off more than I could chew from the beginning, but I guess I thought I could ""man up"" and be the one to help her deal with some problems in her life. Everything I promised to do turned out to be harder than I could have imagined. The more time passed, the more impossible it all seemed and it created distance between us. 
I fell back into old coping mechanisms. See, I do this thing where I don't really reach out to people, get overwhelmed, and go looking for a dopamine fix, usually in the form of sneaky sexual behavior. Chat rooms, porn, Tinder, creeping on Fetlife... It takes a lot of forms. The fact that I grew up conservative and Catholic has a lot to do with this as well. I've been doing this in one way or another since my teens and no one has known. I've gotten very good at lying. 
After she caught me the first time (Tinder) I promised to be honest with her from then on, but before long I convinced myself the relationship couldn't recover and I got back into chat rooms. She caught me again. 
Then I was flirting with someone behind her back. She caught me. Then I tried to save her birthday when plans fell through and ended up ruining it to the point of her not even wanting to see me that night even though we were living together. While she was out I reached out on social media for anyone to talk to. The girl I'd been flirting with hit me up and the interaction was sincere and supportive but I said too much. She saw the texts about a month later. That's when we broke up the first time. Haven't really spoken to the other girl since. I got into therapy and started trying to suck less.
In each of these cases, what I did isn't even the problem. We had an open relationship. The problem is I hid stuff, lied about it, lied about lying, and let the whole thing turn into a screaming match for hours with me trying all these wild manipulation tactics before finally coming clean.
While we were broken up I got into a car accident. She (girlfriend) was the first person I called because I didn't know who else to reach out to. No one was hurt but my car was totaled. She still helped me find a new one, despite everything I'd put her through. 
We got back together but it was rocky. Lots of fighting. We kept it going until about a month ago. See, her best friend had posted nudes somewhere, I went looking for them, and I found them. I didn't say anything about it. She (girlfriend) knew I was hiding something and looked through my history. She confronted me without telling me what she knew. I lied. She dropped the bomb. We broke up, sort of. Still living together through all this, but we each have a room.
Sidenote: How fucking creepy is it that you can see someone's history from one device on another device?
I deleted some stuff from further back in my history after that, because it had to do with seeking elsewhere for internet fantasy versions of things we both wanted in our relationship. I guess I thought it was unattainable by then because I had fucked up so much. But she kinda left the door open on us getting back together so I figured if I cleaned that stuff up just in case I could be totally honest about everything going forward.
We did get back together. We decided to take a weekend trip together to try and reconnect. On the drive there last night she confronted me about deleting my history. I denied it at first, but then she accused me of doing it multiple times and I really only did it once, which I eventually admitted, but the other times... She said she had proof. I still don't know what proof she means and she won't tell me, but this has got me feeling like I've totally lost my mind. Like... I believe her, but I swear to god I don't remember and that freaks me out because I don't even know what I would have deleted. She understandably thinks I'm full of shit. 
We were supposed to be gone until Sunday night. We spent last night at the hotel (by the way, I fucked up the reservation. She wanted a room with a bath tub and I couldn't even get that right). We fought more this morning, checked out early, and drove back without doing anything. Not even dinner last night, not even breakfast this morning. And she said she didn't want to be around me, but at the same time the trip is another broken promise now.
On the drive back she told me how so many friends have stopped hanging out with her because she's stayed with me. There were a couple I knew about but I had no concept of how far the ripples went. Her family is toxic. She has no one. No job, still no license. We're in the same apartment for now. I don't know if -I- can stay because our roommates know and probably hate me, but at least I have the means to land on my feet. She doesn't, and she has nowhere to go. I never wanted things to be this way but this is where my actions have led. I'm scared for her. I still love her. I thought I could be better for her. She hates me and wishes she never met me. She believes I'm a sociopath. She might be right. I ruined her life. This weekend was my last shot to start to redeem myself and I fucking blew it. I feel terrible. And what's the deal with my memory? I've always been super forgetful but this is scary.

I'm here because I'm not really close to anyone. No one I know is going to hear all this and still want anything to do with me. I don't know what to do.",24Feb2019,1
283,"It basically says it all in the title. I feel like my family is actually making me depressed because of their actions, and lack thereof. Apologies for the formatting I'm on mobile. 
I'm 18, fresh into a full time undergraduate degree at university, playing club sports, and I have a part time job that I use to finance most of my stuff.
I recently graduated high school and was the top achiever in my grade, I got all A's and as a result I got a 20k scholarship to go to the best university in my country, this meant that my varsity fees would be less than what I paid for high school. However my mom didn't seem happy with it, my faculty caps scholarships at 20k but the maximum my uni gives out is 40k, she made a snide remark about how I should have worked harder to get the 40k bursary--they only give those out to med school and the businesses faculties because their fees are a lot higher than the humanities faculty because of the extra resources they need for those degrees and the availability of more sponsors. Obviously I was upset by my mom's comment because I worked my ass off, got zero sleep and did the best in my school, got a scholarship but it still didn't seem to be enough to please her. 
Health issues, I guess, of mine are never seen to properly. My mom didn't take me to get the HPV vaccine that all girls should get, she hasn't even taken me to a gynae ever. I have really atrocious acne and acne scarring and they haven't even tried to address that, I don't even get acne specific face wash unless I buy it which is what I've resorted to doing. My top incisors are skew, the degree of skewness has worsened over the years and drastically done so since my wisdom teeth have grown in. I haven't even been to a dentist in about three years. It isn't like we can't afford to fix these things or do them, we have medical. 
My sister bullies me for my appearance, she's 14, which makes me so insecure. I already have a massive insecurity about not being good enough for anyone thanks to my mom now my sisters bullying me, if I say anything back to her I either get hit by her or screamed at by my parents because I need to be more mature because I'm the older one. My mom constantly tells me how ungrateful I am, despite me financing 3/4 of my lifestyle. I also share a room with my sister, and she is the most messy person I know, my room constantly looks like a warzone thanks to my sisters clothes and other things being strewn across the floor, this doesn't help me at all because I'm supposed to work and study in that room and it's constantly a mess or has my sister watching movies on her laptop without headphones. She also has her boyfriend over constantly on weekends so I get no peace and quiet then, they stay up late watching series when I'm trying to sleep.
Another thing that frustrates me is that my sister is messy as hell, but never cleans. I always sweep the house, tidy the living room, dust the bookshelf, do laundry etc. I'm home the least of all my family yet I'm the one cleaning their messes. I also get forced to do dishes on nights I wasn't home for dinner, or after a three night build up of dishes when it was supposed to be my sisters turn. It is not pleasant. 
My boyfriends family is in the same financial bracket as mine but his family has more expenses as his sisters in a university in a different city so obviously her fees are more than double mine, but they still got both their kids braces, and took them to get their medical checkups whether it be for the dentist or the doctor. He and his family are shocked at how I'm treated and have actually taken pity on me: when I needed to buy a laptop for uni his mom upgraded hers and just gave it toe for free despite my offering to pay for it. She did this because my family flat out refused to buy me one, even if it was 2nd hand, despite it literally being a university requirement because a lot of my text books are e-books and I need Microsoft word for almost all of my projects and assignments, the only reason my sister has a laptop is because she got it last year when she started school because her school is paperless and uses Google classroom and Google apps for most of their activities.
I'm struggling to be happy in my home environment because my family makes me feel like I'm not enough, I have no privacy at home, I'm treated like the house maid, my university course work load is a lot but I still have to juggle everything else at home before I even start my work. I feel like I'm depressed because I literally always want to cry when I think of my family or when I'm home and it's taking its toll on my mental health in all aspects of my life. 
How can I try reason with them to take me to the dentist/gynae and how to be just better parents, it's not like we can't afford things they're just reluctant to spend money on me because, in my view, they expect me to get other people to sponsor me, despite me doing this since grade 8 and my sister almost failing her grades and never getting a bursary ever.

284,"hey guys im a 12 year old male, my name is josh, and im scared, my parents have been fighting a lot recently ( i have never had perants that had fought ) they said they wanted to break up and my step dad wants to leave. and if he does ( he is our main way to pay the bills, my mum cant work because she is injured ) we will have to move out, we just moved in to a house we rented out to some people, but we had to move back because it was too expensive at the old house, so they wanted 6 weeks free rent ( around 4000 AUD ) while we also had to pay for rent, so we gave it to them, they put us in debt. we got back and they destroyed the place, wrecked carpets, stolen stuff, dog hair everywhere, mum's old plants she left there, destroyed. all that got us deeper in debt, and now the old tenants want to take us to court for 500 AUD, what do i do?",24Feb2019,904
286,"i can remember being depressed since about the time i was 14. it has gotten progressively worse over the years (i'm 26 now) and while i'm not an immediate danger to myself i've always somehow known that eventually i'm going to kill myself. the past few years my outlook on life has gotten so bleak that basically nothing makes me happy and i every night i go to bed hoping that i don't wake up in the morning.

it seems like i'm going to be stuck working 40+ hours a week to survive for the rest of my life and i don't think i can make it past 30 if that's what my life is going to be. i have literally never had a job that i've remotely enjoyed and i can't think of a single thing that i would actually enjoy doing for a career. literally anything i can think of would still feel like work, because it's something that i have to do every day. sometimes when i'm feeling my absolute worst and thinking about killing myself, i consider going to the hospital to stay in the psych ward, but doing that would be time away from being able to work and only make my financial situation worse. i am always going to be stuck living paycheck to paycheck. financial stress is eventually going to be the death of me.

right now i am barely able to pay my rent and utilities and months behind on other things and things just keep piling up. i've had to borrow money from my parents, and honestly they don't really have the money to lend. i borrowed money to pay this month's rent and promised to pay it back weeks ago and haven't been able to. i'm worried about making rent next month and won't be able to borrow from them this time. my rent is a little high, but pretty much around average for where i live. i could try to move, but i live with friends now and i don't think i could handle living alone or with strangers. i literally can't work any harder than i already do. i am at my limit and ready to collapse.

i am physically and mentally exhausted all the time. i don't know why or what it is but for years i'm tired no matter how much i sleep. i've talked to a few doctors about it but they never seem too concerned. i work through it because i have no choice if i want to survive but outside of work i'm too exhausted to leave the house or do anything that i used to enjoy. i've tried, but i haven't really played video games in years. i barely play guitar or even listen to music often anymore. sometimes i can get myself to watch an episode of a tv show but i usually can't focus long enough to watch a movie.

i've never had any interest in college or any type of education after high school. people have suggested looking into some type of classes but i don't think that i would manage to do well. i absolutely hated high school and put the bare minimum effort in and barely got by. i know i wouldn't be able to put in the effort it takes and i feel like i would just end up with student loans i can't pay. i literally can't handle any more debt. at night, sometimes i remember all the bills i have, and all the money i've borrowed from my parents and i can't sleep.

another thing i have to constantly worry about is that if i make too much money, i will lose my good health insurance (i am a type 1 diabetic) and i can't afford to pay for health insurance out of pocket, or the co-pays i would have on my insulin and diabetic supplies.

i was seeing a therapist a few months ago, but my health insurance would only approve a set amount of sessions in a sixth month period and eventually those ran out. i think i can try to see a therapist again in the next month or two. while i was seeing my last therapist, i talked to her about the stress of bills and having to work and how it felt hopeless and she told me that these are things everyone has to deal with, and explained that she was trying to normalize it, so that maybe it didn't feel so overwhelming, but it just made me feel like there will literally never be an escape and things will never get better.

i don't know what to do. i've lost friends because i'm so depressed. a big reason my last relationship ended was because my partner couldn't deal with me being so depressed all the time and i don't blame them. i feel like there's not an answer to this. all people tell me is that it gets better, but i don't know if i can last until then when i am this miserable. people say that money can't buy happiness but it would literally solve almost all of my problems.

as terrible as it is, for so long i've desperately wished someone i love would tell me they understand how hopeless this is and they'd understand if i killed myself. for so long i have felt like the only reason i am still alive is so that i don't hurt people that are close to me. i do not want to be here anymore. i don't know what to do.",24Feb2019,3

I was driving home in Memphis around 30 minutes ago (~2am) when a man in a black hood sprung up from the sunroof of the car in front of me and open fired on a nearby yellow house with some sort of assault rifle. He shot off about a dozen rounds and then dropped back into the car before driving off. I happened to be driving about 100 feet behind them at the time, and just watched until it was over. After they drove off, I stopped to tell a cop what happened and then drove home. 

I don't think I froze out of fear. I didn't feel anything. It felt like I was watching something on TV honestly. Is that a normal reaction? Should I have immediately U-turned and noped out?

Last year while I was doing a field exercise for the army she went to a party, when she knows I don’t like her going alone, got drunk and made out with two girls and a guy. She also let the guy finger her, she says being drunk is sort of an excuse to act out and be with other people. 
    Later on in the month she got drunk again and had a guy sexually assault her. At least she says she was sexually assaulted, I believe she had sex with him and felt bad for it and wanted to get it off her chest and tell me. Yesterday I found out after she was possibly sexually assaulted she was in the car with him and two of her girl friends a couple of days later and they played a game where she had to get naked. 
    A month later she kissed a guy one night and the next morning she told me it never even happened. A week after that she told me she had feelings for him and we broke up. Fast forward two months and we get back together and now a year later I can’t help but resent her and feel disgusted about the way she acted. She brings up every once in awhile about how she had sex with so-and-so, she did this, and did that.  
    So, I want our relationship to work out but I don’t see myself getting past my disgust. She is several years younger and it may be a maturity issue. And she was raised pretty roughly and it may an issue of that, I hold morality and integrity very highly and she seems to not.

301," 

Alright so here is the breakdown of the situation.

I am currently the resident care coordinator for an assisted living facility. The job title might as well be, you do everything and we pay you just enough to make you question whether you should quit or not but I digress. I have been in this position for two years come April.

My main purpose though is to provide monthly and daily schedules for the CNA's and LPN's to ensure that facility has enough staff each day in the most cost effective way. With 120+ employee's, it is a pretty small operation and navigating the schedule is relatively easy unless its the holidays. ( Screw you Christmas)

Here is the main problem. I am the only one that is doing this at the facility and I am on call 24/7 365. Every insane call out, every single stupid emergency flows through me like a river. It is my responsibility solely to fill any call out or no call no show immediately or I have to report and fill the shift myself. Like right now I have been at the facility since 11pm due to two CNA's being no call no shows and no one is willing to work on a Saturday night. This occurrence usually happens at least once a week and my day turns from working 6a-3p in the office and on call at home to working 6a-3p to 11p-3p the next day while still being on call for scheduling issues for the rest of the day till the end of time.

I have put up with this due to salary offered to me upon hire and the potential of being promoted into the HR manager position. Being a young screw up I waited way to long to get an education and am finally on the verge of completing my bachelors degree ( In healthcare administration) at 30. This salary has allowed me and my wife to crawl out of debt and establish a healthy savings at the cost of my sanity and every single friendship I have ever valued.

Now my boss has dangled in front of me this HR manager position for 6 months, stating that its all in the works and will be a reality soon and to continue to hold on. After two months I saw through the smoke and now do not even bother to pursue the conversation anymore as I know they are running me in circles and haven't even bothered to post my position to find a replacement. ( Like anyone sane would take this trap)

So here is the delima. Where I live the job market isn't the greatest. There are tons of Java Juices and Starbucks jobs available, but actual jobs that will propel my life forward are far and few between. I fret constantly that if I put in my 30 day notice I will not be able to find a position that pays remotely close to this and will be stuck working minimum wage for a long period of time, destroying any progress I have made in the past two years. I also wonder to if that HR manager position is real and if I am being inpatient and the 6 months waiting period is not that unrealistic. So what say you Reddit, am I being a pretentious child in the office and should tighten my boot straps and continue to battle through or should I take the deep plunge into the unknown.

Also, anyone else have any experience doing scheduling in the healthcare setting. I would love to hear if your staff is as ridiculous as mine.",24Feb2019,2

306,"So, just a bit about me first. Im 20 years old. And i am very depressed with very low self esteem. And my current life consists of video games and working crazy hours to try and support my sick mother and my younger siblings. And the video gaming was done mostly pretty much solo. So i had pretty much no human interactions outside of work(which werent usually pleasent). But then i met this lesbian couple on a game i was playing and we became friends. And these girls seemed to like me alot. Which made me like them alot. But i didn't really understand why they liked me. And i was scared that they would find other friends and abandon me. So i got really needy i guess. And would need reassurance i guess. And the one girl started to get really annoyed with me. But i guess i talked my way back into their good favor. Cause they eventually asked me to come visit them.(they live about 9 hours away from me.)  They even let me stay in their home. Even though we have only known eachother a few months. And i am also a large black male. And they fairly small women and they live alone. So i initially go excited. And was like yeah. Im special to them or whatever. And i guess thats how i should've felt. But then i got there and everything was really great after my nerves got out of the way ( i puked twice on the way there) but on like the 4th day the one girl was at work. And i was sitting next to the other girl. And she starts showing me all her old xbox friends. And starts sending messages to some of them. And to me it was like she was trying to show me that i wasnt that special. So i got upset and i packed up and left. She asked me what was wrong. But i was too ashamed to tell her. So i just left. But a few miles down the road i had car trouble. No big deal as i am a mechanic. But it was the middle of the night and no parts store was open. So i swallowed my pride and sent her a message explaining myself and asked if i could come back. And she thankfully said yes. And said that i could talk to her about anything. And so i asked if we could talk when i got back to her house. She said yeah. But i got there. And it took awhile to build up the courage to ask her to talk in person. But when i finally did. One of her old xbox friends asked her to play and she said yeah. And so we played with him. And i got really pissy i guess cause i was sitting there waiting to open up to this friend. And this other friend was in the way. Someone i saw as competition and a threat to my place as her friend. And we played pretty mjch all night. And then i went to bed. And woke up in a better mood excited to talk to her. But her girlfriend woke up and left for work. And i waited like 4 hours on her couch for her to come out. I then send her a message asking if she wants me to go home now. And saying that i wanted to try and talk with her. And she said that i lost the righg to talk when i was an asshole all night. And she wohldnt even come out to say goodbye to me. And said i wasnt worth all this drama. And this made me histerical and i basically begged. And she said no. So i had a 9 hour drive home with tears in my eyes and anxiety in my chest the whole 9 hours. I then got home. And waited like a day. And aplogized for everything. And all she said was ""its fine"" and i asked if she still wanted to speak with me. And she said she wouldnt have replied if she didnt want to. But it is obvious that i have fucked this up.

What would you do in this situation? All I want to do is message her &amp; give her the proof &amp; details, I don’t want this girl to have to find this out the hard way.

310,"This is my advice account.

My sisters and I aren't the closest, they like me enough but i want them to be able to confide in me into their teenage years. I want them to be able to trust me and tell me things that are happening with them (drugs, school, relationships even sex). I want them to be informed and make self-confident, smart decisions on those things about life. I want them to be able to talk to me about guys/girls they're seeing; what kind of drugs they're taking and how to be safe with them. I also want them to be able to call me when they need a ride home when they drank too much or are too high; I want to be their safety net from our parents and be their frontline of defense. What are some ways to earn their trust and be able to talk to them freely about these types of subjects.

Tldr: How do I earn my younger siblings trust?

P.S. I am about a decade and a half older than my younger sisters, I've done plenty of drugs/done the sex thing, I'm trying to share my experience/wisdom. It's not that I have lost their trust in the past, it's just that I don't have it where I would like them with me - safe and secure.

312,So I’m a college student just outside Chicago. I’m home this weekend a few stages away to visit family and such. I took an AMTRAK train here and I have tickets to take it back as well. The problem is that the train will bring me to downtown Chicago right smack dab in the middle of the city. Then I usually would walk a few blocks and get on the L and ride for 45 minutes then walk a few more blocks to get to campus. Not a problem right? Yeah except my train is getting delayed because of a winter storm and the time I’m getting back to Chicago keeps getting later and later. I’m all by myself and I’ll have to get from downtown to campus all alone at what’s looking to be midnight or later. I’m 18 and not very strong or large. I’m really really nervous. Should I take the L? Is an Uber okay? Someone told me I should take a taxi but I’ve never done that before. I have pepper spray but I’ve already had a few bad encounters while being out late at night with friends but I’ll be completely alone. I have no family there and only other girlfriends my age. Please help me! ,24Feb2019,1
313,"So I hang out with this group of friends pretty much everyday online (all males). People say I'm a lot like a guy myself and we're all pretty chill with each other. We basically only talk online despite going to the same school. In school, I hang out with another group of friends (almost all girls) and again we're all chill with each other. I'm going to refer to my online group of friends as FA and the other FB.

Recently, one person from FA started to talk to me a lot during school. I found this kind of odd until I noticed everytime he's gone up to me, I'm beside one the my friends from FB who he happens to like. I quickly realized what he was trying to do so I asked him to make sure, and sure enough, he was using me to make her jealous. Now, I don't really mind it that much but it also felt kinda bad to know that the only reason he was talking to me wasn't even for me. (No, I do not like anyone from FA romantically). 

There was another situation similar to this. Another person from FA started following me around a lot. I already knew it was because of one of my friends from FA was with me. He would strike up a conversation with me and even pretend to like me, which I think is a dumb idea if he's trying to get with someone else considering the person he likes is not the most confident.

Normally I dont give a crap about it but even after I help them (if it's even helping) they dont seem to appreciate me. Maybe it's because we're good friends but I cant always take their insults head first. Words dont affect me much but I really dont appreciate it when they insult my family. And not the ""I banged your mom lol"" kind of stuff. It's the ""I can see now why your dad left you"" or the ""at least my mom isnt as bad as yours"" kind of stuff. These kinds of messages come from just one person from FA and he happens to be the one coming to me, asking me all sorts of things about my friend from FB.

Its not that I dont want them to be together, but I want the girl from FB to be happy. And I'm sure he would treat her well but maybe I'm also meddling with their business too much. Not to mention that I dont like the guy a lot either. Should I help him out and possibly get them together or just stay out of it? And is it ok for me to be upset at them for using me? I've always been someone who is careful around people and I dont like this feeling of being someone who is around to be used

314,"I'm in my early twenties.  Approximately a month ago, I started talking to this girl via an online dating app.   It was great.  We exchanged numbers, really hit it off- the conversation was unending and intense.  She was only in town for a week, and was going back to the city she worked in.  We couldn't meet while she was here, and then she went back. 
Since she has been there, the conversation has been dull.  She doesn't reply anymore, never initiates conversation, stops replying randomly and is rather cold. The intensity which was there earlier, died in a matter of days. It's not the same since she's been there. 
For me, I fell madly for her. I can't stop thinking about her.  I don't fancy other women any more.  I barely open dating apps and become somewhat aloof if I meet another girl. She is constantly playing on my mind. I know, it's wrong.  It wasn't meant to be.

316,"My girl was out of town this week, so I was out drinking alone at a bar when I got talking to some guy. We talked about life, jobs, our girls etc. But I knew he was attracted to me.

Long story short, he asked if he could suck my dick. Now I'm a horny guy, normally have sex 3+ times a day with my gf, but at this point I hadn't had anything (not even masturbated) for a few days, so drunk me kind of just went along with it. 

He took me outside and put me in his mouth. I couldn't get hard and felt sick whilst he was doing it. After about twenty seconds I stopped him and left. 

I'm not gay, and I don't see myself as bi-sexual. I've never been attracted to men and this experience has definitely shown  me I'll never do anything like that again (I sort of feel violated even though I wasn't forced to do this). I think maybe I did it as a self-destructive thing? I lost my job a few weeks ago and have been a bit depressed since, drinking a lot etc.

320,"So me (32) and bf (32) have been together for a year now, last year I started to gradually move with him. I like him, he's smart, has his own business, is a bit reserved (I'm coming from a 5-year relationship that came down crushing and at the beginning I felt I need something not very promising), and we gradually became very close.

The thing is, he lives in a two store apartment with his brother, who came years ago and just stayed. Brother (28) works for him too.

At some point I felt a bit uneasy with the situation - I can't walk around with less clothing without being alert whether he's coming home. I feel like we're students living as flatmates. On the other hand I can't say much, except accept the situation, because I can't move anywhere else at the moment except for my mother's place (I'm renting out my place, which I own but it's very small).

Bf is very wealthy, brother has money too (unlike me, I'm in a bit of a work crisis and I'm currently freelancing with no steady income). It's not an issue of money. 

The thing is, it's rather a problem of Bf not wanting to let go Brother to live on his own, or make decisions on his own, because Brother used to be unstable and had panic attacks. Now he's much better, but at the age of 28 is yet to live alone or have a serious relationship. 

I started bringing it up last year (can't remember when) and noticed whenever we talked about serious topics that are an issue he shuts down or starts yelling. But then he takes action eventually, in his own way. What he did after months of me hinting the issue is he accidentally found out that the flat a few floors below is being sold by a bank because of neighbours not paying the mortgage. He bid for and bought the flat just recently. He plans to move his brother there.

Now I have a few issues with that, one minor thing that bugs me, the second is an actual issue.

First, Bf is moving his relatives as he pleases, without letting them learn to make decisions. Brother is once again moved as Bf pleases.

Second, legally there are options for the family with the mortgage a few stores below. They are already disputing the purchase (turns out they own a lot of money). They will most probably explore all legal loopholes in the next 5-6 months before moving out. I'm stuck in this situation for at least that long.

This morning I, and I'm not proud of it, let a few words slip through, that I'm not sure if I'll be able to endure this situation for months ahead and I'll just leave Bf. He got really enraged and simultaneously shut down about the topic. His main argument is *He's Already Doing Things* and I should not complain. My issue is he's doing things his way and not asking Brother or myself. At some point he also asked me, ""What do you want me to do?!"" and then yelled so his brother can hear him *""Brother gather up your stuff""*. Which enraged me, because he's trying to turn him against me. He often says I hate his brother, and that's completely not true - I just don't want to live with him, I actually like talking with him.


I'm kind of annoyed me as I type it - I have zero issues with Brother - he's totally fine to live here and pay no rent. I would probably act the same way, because nobody is making me take responsibility and it's easy. 

I have an issue with Bf who isn't making him move. Bf is also not growing up and deciding to have something closer to a family with another woman. Which scares me, because I'm very familiar with relationships where everything is great until there's a serious topic and then one side doesn't want to talk about it, in a very aggressive way.

Anyway, this got too long. What should I do, thoughts? ",24Feb2019,1
322,"I began smoking weed about 4+ years ago. It escalated to daily use \~3 years ago; I justified it because it did help me to recover from depression (appetite boost + helped me kick insomnia) and anxiety (helped me become more social even when I wasn’t high).

I smoke all day, every day; I use it as an excuse to avoid other things; it’s making me more paranoid/anxious than anything else; I’m spending too much money on it.

323,"Hi everyone ,

This is going to be the first time I’m going to be this honest on the Internet so here it goes, and english is not my native tongue so bear with me please.

I’m a 22 year old guy from Istanbul, Turkey currently studying in Ottawa ,Canada studying Computer Science.During my high school and elementary school years I wanted to study in Us and more preferably in Canada and I was able to achieve that trough hard study and dedication and all that bs. I got science projects done got my grades high and was able to get accepted to many Universities such as UCLA and other ivy league schools and Couple of Universities in Canada. But because i only got scholar ship from Canadian Universities I went to Canada. 

My family, back then was a middle class , money was always tight but we were getting by. I was educated in private school since my mom worked there. My family was always great cannot ask for a better one. Loving , supportive overall great people. I was bullied a lot as a child because i was overweight and all that stuff and i had close to zero social life because dreams i wanted to achieve took all of my time. Before I started university my parents jobs got a lot better and money stop being a problem anymore thanks to one of our properties sold for a lot of money.So my parent were able to support me trough University. 

Now fast forwarding to my UC life. I always thought that countries such as US and Canada were literal Utopia meanwhile i thought where i lived was Average and leaving this average country behind i can become more get more money be happy and live a better life. 

Well , I was wrong and homesickness become a huge problem for me. I realized things people said about US , Canada were not as realistic as i taught it was and I realized I had things pretty good back at home and decided i wanted to go back. But even though my parents are great they are still a stereotypical asian/middle eastern parents who wanted me to get a degree for something ""acceptable "". So i decided to major in Comp Sci, game development. So during my first year i was miserable and gained 60 pounds (i was already a little overweight ) in 8 months and failed 9 of my 10 classes. I ended up having a gastric bypass surgery since the weight i gained almost gave me a liver failure so that was my ""fun"" summer.Fast racking to end of my first year I told my parents that i wanted to comeback and they said no and that i started a journey and i should end it. Before i went back i was literally crying my ass out and begging them to not let me get on a plane but i ended up getting on a plane. For a while i accepted my fate and studied to get my grades up and i was successfully but during this time because  of the stress i found out i started to develop vitiligo and got spots all over my face and body.To fix this my family spent thousand of dollars and i gave up my entire summer (again) to at least try to control it. .During all this time i developed insomnia because i pay full international student fee which is like 40000$ per year and i started to worry about ""money"" , my health and fear of disappointing them and thinking if all of this university things is worth it because i realized academic success and making a lot more money does not make me happy.Moreover i realized gaming industry is not as fancy and fun as it seems so i lost all interest on that (i do realize most of these things are my fault because i didn’t researched well enough) and here I am still studying (still got 2 years to finish) but i am miserable got 0 motivation to study, depressed my spots are coming back, hate my major and my life overall not in a good shape and literally in purgatory.During this time i found my real passion of writing novels , screenplays and comics. I want to pursue those but school takes all of my time. I talked my parents about this and after spending a lot of time trying to fix me they become more openminded saying thing like your well being is more important for us than a degree and my mom going as far as saying ‘’ just  get a degree from a shittiest / easiest major your school has to offer and come home"" and telling me money is not a problem and that we will figure something out. 

I got a lot of projects on my mind and want to do them in my home country and i just want to drop out. Not sure how to go about this and what to do and stuck. Any advice?",24Feb2019,2

In the 3 years we’ve worked together he’s become my go to, my bff at work. He’s flirted with me, teased me, complimented me on appearance and work ethic, he’s gotten me coffee a bunch and I’ve reciprocated all of this in the same way. We have a great connection and get along well, joke laugh and know a lot about one another’s personal lives. We text from time to time outside of work. We go out of our way to help the other. He’s told me he trusts me and he even hugged me and we do this closed hand high five. I’d be lost without him, which is so needy sounding. But we don’t do anything outside of work. We live a good distance apart and it would be effort (worth it I think) to arrange an actual date. 
I really have tried to fight these feelings. I’ve tried to date other men outside of this place. But there’s no one like him. He’s sweet he’s generous and he gets me. 
We’ve never talked about dating. He’s said some ambiguous things lately that could mean something or nothing more than that he cares about me. I truly value this friendship for what it is and am about to take my feelings I have for him “to the grave.” 
Or i was going to. Until he winked at me yesterday when he said hello. I’m horrible at flirting. Google isn’t helpful. I’m trying to be myself since the wink. Tried to joke a little, complimented his hat, but again I’m horrible at flirting. I’m much better at being blunt. I’ve sworn off relationships and I’m pretty sure he has too. I’ve sworn off making a move on any guy no matter what women can do nowadays as empowered beings that we are.

My class is wanting to go on a end of year school trip and for this we need to raise money so we hosted a school dance. The dance lasted till like 23:30 after which i called my dad to come pick me up beacouse i live a bit far from the school. I found out dave invited a few friends to stay at his house (but not me) after which another kid in the group ryan asked me if i was going to come over. 

I was very confused because i was never invited or anything. When i asked if dave could wait with me at the bus stop (where my dad will pick me up) to wait he said sure we were walking out of the school premises and im talking to him then some people look at me like im a freak i look to my right and hes not there. But i see him run far down and i gotta say that really sucked for me. He never even said goodbye. 

I jumped in my dads car and we went home.

335,"I don't know where to write about this, so I am just gonna post it here.

From the very early stages of my life, I was very smart, I was the top of my class without making an effort - big fish small pond - so I felt like an outcast and I even sometimes I did something illegal just to be fit in, my neighborhood was poor and you know the drill.

But I had one good friend that I could call my buddy, but then when I was 10 years old his family moved away and never heard from him again.

In my high school I had numerous acquaintance, but no true friend, until my last years I had what you can call a ""best friend""

We both got to the same college ""Medicine"" but he soon made friends with a bunch of fuckboys until someday a girl framed me with some stupid drama that got me in trouble with those fuckboys, and to my greatest shock my ""best friend"" sided with them, and that event made me really depressed for like 2 years. I was just attending classes and returning home, zero social life.

In my 4th year in college I had a new friend and again we became best friends, and at the same time I met a girl and life became good and I was thinking life is good.

That is until graduation, I proposed to my girl but she rejected me, and said this was never serious, I was totally devastated and got in fight with her, how the hell a relationship lasting 3 years is not serious??

Needless to say I was depressed again, but at least I had my best friend, right?

But after graduation we applied to different hospitals and now we barely see each other, because we are extremely busy, and he is engaged to be married, so yea you can see why we rarely see each other now.

Also I forgot to mention that my family is super religious but I am a closeted atheist, and I am sure if I told them they would disown me - yeah they are THAT religious - so I feel very distant even to my own family.

So now I feel extremely lonely, my life is basically work and sleep, nothing more, and I am feeling I am spiraling into deep depression.

Also that relationship with my ex made me feel so anxious and unwanted that I can never trust any girl again, and even though some lovely girls sometimes flirt with me, I never flirt back, I keep remembering those feelings I had with my ex.

338,"So I (16M) know her (16F) quite a while now. We only see each other in school and I wouldn’t be really good friends with her, probably still an acquaintance I guess. Anyway I’ve talked to her a few times and I’ve always got on with her tbh.

Anyway there’s two instances that happened which I don’t how I should interpret I guess 

1) I was walking by her down the hall and she said my name as I walked by her. Before I even had a chance to react, she had come up to me and put her hand on my shoulder before telling me what she wanted me to know. 

I wouldn’t have considered her to be a very touchy/feely person so this is why it struck me. 

2. Another day, she had constantly noticed me looking at her during class. I saw her when I was leaving school later that day and said hi. She smiled and said hi back but she said it in a kind of nervous/awkward but happy tone. 

She’s normally a real confident person and I’d never previously seen her act nervous around me until that point. It made me paranoid cause I was thinking that she figured out the reason why I was looking at her lmao. 

Are either of those events something more meaningful than I originally thought or am I just overthinking it? ",24Feb2019,1
339,"Its my second year in a swiss school and i have a best friend ill call him dave he used to be and still is in a friend group that has 3 other people.

Since im friends with dave i basically joined this group but now we are 5 people which makes it uneven. Right now i feel like i am the third wheel when we the teachers put us in groups often im the one left alone. And it kinda sucks.

My class is wanting to go on a end of year school trip and for this we need to raise money so we hosted a school dance. The dance lasted till like 23:30 after which i called my dad to come pick me up beacouse i live a bit far from the school. I found out dave invited a few friends to stay at his house (but not me) after which another kid in the group ryan asked me if i was going to come over. 

I was very confused because i was never invited or anything. When i asked if dave could wait with me at the bus stop (where my dad will pick me up) to wait he said sure we were walking out of the school premises and im talking to him then some people look at me like im a freak i look to my right and hes not there. But i see him run far down and i gotta say that really sucked for me. He never even said goodbye. 

I jumped in my dads car and we went home.

Now this isnt the first time this has happend its just at school im not friends with many who speak proper english like me he is among the few who do and when i speak italian it feels like im not able to make a proper conversation so losing him would be kinda shit for me.

But at the same time sometimes staying around him also makes me feel shit. 

I didnt know who to talk to about this so i came to reddit hopefully looking for advice or some help on what to do. Btw i am (15m) and my friend is (14m) to the reason i stayed behind a year because i needed to get better in italian and german.",24Feb2019,1
340,"**Short form at bottom 

Hello, I’m sorry to sound cheesy but I’ve been living with boyfriend since the first second I met him over a year ago now. We have our own place together and have our final big move coming up in a month or so to his hometown. 

Every time I see him there’s a huge rush of emotions and I still get this insane fluttery feeling similar to anxiety but a nice feeling not panicked. Anyways, I’m off today only and just found out he called in sick to work. 

Right now he’s laying beside me on the couch talking to his brother and playing video games as usual while I endlessly scroll through Reddit and binge Legends of Pokémon. The more I hear and see him the more I just feel happy and filled with love. 

I’m looking for advice on how to make today as special as I can for him from small to big things we can do at home free or of low cost to show him I appreciate him more than I already do. 

Basically I’d like to see what other people do that maybe I could try since I love making him happy. I already did the dishes as always when I woke up and made us some coffee and plan on either taking him to my moms for dinner today or making him one of my own along with peanut butter cookies. 

I’m sorry if this isn’t the right subreddit or type of advice to request here, I’m a first time poster here but have been lurking quite some time and think the community is very wholesome. 

Thank you to all of you for your time and any responses I may get.

346,"Hi all,

To give some background on this - I'm from Europe and travelled to Vegas for a convention last week.

It was my first ever trip to the US (let alone Vegas) I had been there a few days meeting Americans in mostly social settings and I had a fantastic time, I've never known a country to be so welcoming. 

On the Wednesday night I sat at a blackjack table next too a beautiful, blonde American girl. We started to talking, having a laugh getting to know each other and decided to cut our losses and head to the bar. 

Queue a night of heavy drinking, lots of kissing and dancing and at the end of the night we said our goodbyes. Not to see each other again.

Now I'm back in Europe and all I can do is think about her and it's killing me. 

I know we will never see each other again and I guess it was what it was - a bit of fun.

I just needed to vent and share my thoughts in the hope someone can offer some advice.

348,"I'm in high school. Recently, several of my friends have been hanging out without me a lot, and I haven't understood why. They've been acting normally in person, in fact I've actually been closer with them than ever before, but they've just been making plans without me behind my back.

Around a week ago, I found out why. They've been hanging out and drinking, and they know I don't do that, so they haven't been inviting me. To clarify a bit, these friends are all very responsible, intelligent, 4.0+ GPA students.

They told me that that's what they've been doing, and amicably offered to invite me next time. This is something that I've been really struggling with. Should I try it? I've always been strongly against underage drinking, but now I'm questioning that. Realistically, all of the adults I know have drunk alcohol plenty in their lives, and these friends of mine have and are still doing perfectly fine. 

I want to hang out with my friends, and have fun, and be able to relax. I've been so stressed out recently, it would be a nice break.

However, I'm worried about what it will do to me. I've never had alcohol before, and I don't know what long-term negative effects it could have on me. Will it permanently damage my mental acuity?

I've tried, but I can't really talk to my girlfriend about this dilemma because she's very against it, so she just has a one-sided stance on it. I know about all the facts and statistics on drinking, and all about ""just saying no,"" etc., but all of that really does nothing to help me decide what to do. These are my friends, and I trust them and I know that they are good people. They aren't pressuring me or anything.

350,"Hopefully this won’t be too too long. So my mom smokes pot, could care less about that. What I DO care about is that she buys it from my best friend. Now in different circumstances this wouldn’t bother me, but my friend is blatantly addicted to it. I know there is an argument that you can’t be addicted to pot blah blah blah. The only reason I say addicted is because she cannot go a single day without it. She constantly is smoking it. She also has a kid. Now I am not 100% sure she drives high, with or without her kid in the car, but it’s probable that she does. My mom and I had an entire discussion about how this isn’t okay and if she gets caught what is going to happen to her daughter. Yet the next day I find out that my mom is buying from her, and what does she think she is going to do with that money? Buy more pot, duh. She has a boyfriend who mostly provides for them, she lives in an apartment at her parents house, she really doesn’t have bills to pay, she is completely irresponsible with her money. My mom and I got Into it pretty bad last night because of this. My mom cannot seem to grasp how I find this wildly inappropriate, stupid, and irresponsible for both of them. My moms excuse was that she doesn’t know anyone else to get it from, that it isn’t my business, that she can do whatever she wants, and that I don’t know that she’s using it to buy more. 

Am I wrong for being so angry and hurt by this? How do I even approach my mom about this again (because right now we aren’t really on speaking terms)?

TL/DR: My mom is buying pot from my best friend and is further enabling her dependency. 


**there is much more to this story about her dependency and her issues, but this isn’t really about her.

357,"I’m currently a JR [21] CS major and honestly... idk if I want to go through with it.. I keep being told that the classes I’m taking aren’t going to be anything like the work environment and I essentially just got to go through it before I can just relax/code stress free.

I’m technically not even on track to graduate in the 4 years for this field and I feel like it’d be a waste of my scholarships if I were to drop my major because I’m so far in! I did close to all my gen-Eds and this is like the 30% mark in terms of me taking my CS courses right now. I don’t hate the classes but I don’t necessarily love them like I expected to. I enjoyed the first couple of courses I took but now it’s starting to get to “Do I really need to know this for my job? If so idk if this is what I wanted to sign up for..” 
I love talking to people! I was thinking about switching to business management or something but again, I feel like I’d be throwing away the past year because if I were to switch my major, many of the classes won’t go towards the other degree.

Ik I sound completely stupid for saying this but, it also has a lot more math than what I though it was going to have.. I’d feel like a hypocrite leaving it as well because I’ve used a computer DAILY since like the 1st grade even though I didn’t start coding til freshman year of college. I don’t find coding strenuous and I actually find it interesting due to the different possibilities but idk what the real job is going to be like! There’s so many variables in terms of switching bouncing around my head rn and it’s been like this for the past half year.

Like I said above I don’t have any loans due to scholarship which I’m prone to losing due to gpa reasons which is because of the math courses I did horrible in but in terms of the CS courses I only got a D in data structures due to the exams but I got 85-90s on the coding projects.

I don’t know what I should do. I don’t want to feel like a failure which I do just thinking about switching and I also wanted financial security for my future family and my mother in general.
I like the idea of working with computers but now that I’m seeing the nitty gritty I’m like FUCCCKKKK. My GPA is to shit, I won’t lie and say I study all the time because I don’t (which is know is a big issue but if I had to come up with an excuse it’s because whenever I do begin to read the textbooks {one of them is cs math} I swear I begin to get tired...), I’m on academic probation n scholarship probation. Idk if me getting tired while reading the textbook is a sign because when I read the textbook that’s strictly about CS low low level coding it doesn’t happen.

I guess my questions being would be, should I switch? Is anyone reading this a CS graduate and can tell me how the real world is? If I were to switch to business management would I still be able to find a comfortable job and not worry about paying for things in the future?
I know CS is really big rn since everything is computerized and I wanted to keep up with societal changes but idk! Should I force myself to learn something that may be so detrimental in our near future? There’s so many questions I want to ask but they all go towards, Will I fuck myself over if I leave this area of study.. do I roll with the punches or learn to take a fall and get back up with a new field..

Summary:
21yr old jr studying CS but not sure if it’s for me anymore. Wanting to switch to Business management but worried about financial n job security after I graduate. Even though I enjoy talking to people and making sure things are being ran properly more than the mathematical background in CS that has been constantly thrown in my face in the past year. Started with CS because I wanted to organize the background of an application essentially whether it was security, GUIs or data structures.
What should I do?

360,"So quick a description of me... 
I'm married in my 20s and im stationed overseas. We're about to move back to the states so I started putting up things of mine for sale online, all of these things are like headphones, games, army boots (army boots are not cheap)... just a bunch of personal stuff. It's a lot of recreational items and just personal stuff. 
I sold a tactical back pack today that I liked for airsoft/work. 
I brought home the money and starts an argument with me about why I dont want to share the money for us moving, then she starts going off about how I'm selfish. This really made me mad. I'm simply trying to liquidate some stuff that I bought a while ago and put it towards some other stuff. Ultimately it really won't benefit us with me selling all of my personal belongings to refurbish a house. We already have a lot of money saved for that very reason and we're going to sell most of the furniture that we already have. She's saying ""we're married and everything that's yours is mine and what's mine is yours"". My first thought is, ""really? You didn't buy  my airsoft gun for me five years ago, bought a bunch of parts and put work into it to modify it"". 
The whole ""well, we're married so it's my money too"" argument seems kinda bung to me. Obviously our furniture would go towards that. I kinda feel like she just wants me to share because the only thing she wants to sell is some perfume. 
I just wanted a second opinion, I feel like it's unfair to to label me as selfish because I want to keep the earnings of things that are mine. ",24Feb2019,1

Last two years have been rough on me. My fiance and I had our very first apartment, but we ended up losing it and getting evicted due to both of us losing our jobs,mine due to getting laid off and hers due to a near death experience. She lives with her parents, and I live with my mom. I was in a near fatal car accident the later part of last year and had an issue with my knee where I had to learn to walk again earlier last year, so I haven't worked much these past two years.

I have my GED. I've done some college when I was 18, but wasn't as focused as I should of been and stopped going. I'd like to go back to college, but I owe them around $3,500 dollars that they said they need before I could take classes again. I'd like an office job. 9-5. Make maybe $30,000 a year starting off. I don't know exactly what this degree or exact job title would be however.

I'm currently around $10,000 in debt between my eviction, college, and medical bills. I just recently got a job at a call center part time making around 10$ an hour, hopefully moving up to full time once they have a position open.

I honestly just don't know where to start to achieve my goals or who someone could be to help me lay out steps. I feel like I just live day to day. Don't see a future at this point.

370,"So my friend suggested going to a theme park an hour to an hour and a half away. It was entirely her idea, I’m quite indifferent as to whether we go or not. As for the driving thing:

a) I’ve always given her petrol money. More than enough for the petrol she’d be using. 

b) My friend is aware that I have an anxiety disorder and take medication for it. She’s also aware that driving causes me a great deal of stress. 

c) I’ve been involved in a couple of near misses, including a near-head on collision with a van whilst I was still learning. 

d) Anxiety aside, I’m just not that enthusiastic about driving. I was lackadaisical about getting my licence and waited about 6 months before applying to get my permit. I’m doing the same with applying for the next level of provisional licence. It’s just not a priority for me right now. I also don’t understand the people who say that they prefer driving because they’re more “engaged”. Really? Engaged in what exactly? Staring at the car behind you whilst merging? Staring at the zebra crossing? I don’t get it. Why not be “engaged” in an assignment whilst on the train and be productive? 

e) It’s cheaper to get the train for me. I’m a student who decided to pay their fees in instalments rather than take a student loan (realistic to do in my country but not easy). The train costs me $2 on a student card in peak hour for an hour long trip (one way). Comparatively, petrol might cost around $10 one way to where my friend wants to go. 

f) She suggested the location, yet expects me to drive?? I never consented to going there (again, she’s aware of my condition and has even seen me take meds for it when the teachers gave me them on school camp). She made a snide comment last time we went out like “ugh! Why do I always have to drive?” (She wasn’t driving at the time, her parents were). 

g) I drive to the things she plans sometimes. I don’t expect her to pick me up. I drive myself and meet her there. That’s happened a lot now, but only for local things. I’m fine with meeting her at a restaurant or café anyway, and it’s cheaper than going to a theme park. Also, I hate having passengers in my car as I’m afraid of what would happen if I had an accident. 

Am I being unreasonable here? I’d definitely drive if I chose the location, or alternatively, I’d take public transport to wherever my friend chose. I suppose I could give driving a go though, however every time we have tried to go somewhere we don’t know the way to, it’s ended in a fight. What do you guys think I should do?

I do have feelings for him, but im not good at relationships i think, i feel uncomfortable with caring act from him (hugging, holding hands, feeding me, texts saying he misses me loves me, picking up from school,..). I feel like im good on my own, i dont need anybody to help me doing something i can do alone. Im a 17 girl, this is my first romantic relationship.
I feel so uncomfortable and want to break up, but I know he loves me a lot and it would be hard for him to accept that i break up with him after a quite short time. This is not just about me, i think it is unfair for him if he is the only one who is trying, he always sweet things and receives nothing.

372,"Okay fellas, long ass story comin right to you so I made this account on instagram .... right and it was an account ripping the piss of this girl in my year called Toni who is a straight up B***

(Ok so .... story time Tonis fucked up family... tonis maw suffers from depression and some other mental health issue, Tonis dad is in jail (for raping someone don’t know if that’s 100% true but from what I heard in like year 2Toni stays with her gran who’s an alcoholic and her family are like in extreme debt or some shit like that, Toni is a massive B**** everyone hates her, toni once sent really cleavage showin /Booby pics to Callum tombs/Murray honestly can’t mind what Callum, more certain it’s Tombs though, who screenshotted then she cried about to Rachelle L in s2 English Toni went to this thing (not sure if she still goes tho bc it was in like s2/3) called ‘healthy n happy’ which is like a support group for children who have family issues (even look it up if u don’t believe me and basically that’s all I know about Toni n her messed up life/ family, like in s1-s2 she mad this gal cry a lot (cant mind who) because she’s a B****. She bullied her constantly n shit, Like there’s nothing properly wrong with Toni, she’s just had a shitty upbringing and She’s a massive c*** who everyone hates!!! ) 

Right and there’s another account similar to that and the admins are boys in the year above they made a “bawdeep of clungeville” account where they rip the piss of the people in their year (s6) in Scotland so the highest year in high school I am in s5, the second highest year in High school (S1 is first year of Highschool and you start that at age 12/13 S6 is the final year where you graduate from high school and you finnish that at age 17/18) and so I was anonymous with the Toni account and the admins of bawdeep were trying to figure us out... 

Right then I revealed myself on my real insta account to one of the admins William, because I fucking LIKED HIM. That I was running the Toni account and we spoke for about a month he promised he wouldn’t tell “bawdeep of clungevill” who I was RIGHT.... then the next day they were like we know who u are they guessed correctly so I was like William WTF U SNAKEY WEE SHITE. but he said that another admin Connor worked out it, because I liked a few of their posts from my main insta, then I smoked bud with Williams friend and he was like William had denied it was me, and I was like omg who the fuck do I believe... because William could’ve Snaked, or Williams friend that I smoked with could be lying... long story short I asked William out he said no(in the nicest way possible) then I found out he was gay... then 4 months down the line we had sex . In conclusion I had sex with a gay guy that I liked who was in denial oh and he’s under 6 feet so yea

384,"Im not really sure of how to start, im going to try and make a long story as short as I can. The more details the better I suppose?

Im struggling with some anxiety around a friend I have that I really enjoy her company, but some of her behaviors towards me have changed the more we have interacted with each other.

We have been co-workers for ~5 years, and have never had any arguments or issues but somewhat recently she was promoted, which moved her into a position where we now more frequently work in closer quarters. I try to be social at work and cognizant of other people's lives (I don't want to be selfish), so in moments of silence I try to strike up conversations when workloads are lighter. 

As it turned out, she lives only a few blocks away from me, has a son, and shared some fairly similar interests. As I learned more about her I started feeling more fond of her, and we found ourselves frequently telling jokes and just generally enjoying each other's company. I also found out she had some problems with her car that were emerging that someone had quoted her astronomical prices to repair, and since in a previous job I had done general service and maintenance on cars, I happily offered to do repairs for her at just the cost of parts. She accepted, I linked her to a website to buy what she needed, and one weekend she dropped her car off at my house to do the repairs (it was a simple brake job).

This spitballed into; I found more things wrong with the car that concerned me for her and her son's safety. After she picked up the car I disclosed the other problems I found, and she told me she trusted me and we scheduled another day to address the other problems to which I repaired the car and everything has been fine ever since.

Something to share about myself, I tend to get *a little* obsessive over friendships. I am aware of this, so I do my best to be cognizant about it and keep my distance after I spend time with someone. I haven't made many friends in the past, most so acquaintances or business contacts, and I try to keep those two parts of my life segregated. Think of it kind of like the movie ""I Love you, Man."" As a result, my current girlfriend has been trying to encourage me to spend more time with other people outside of work, because it has caused me some mild depression and made my anxiety a bit worse.

In the past few months, my friendship with this co-worker has only grown, we now share work calendars on our smart phones to make it easier to co-ordinate time to get together outside of work (and we have done a few double dates to, which I enjoyed). Well, somewhat recently my girlfriend had a mishap with her car and ran into a curb, it was all stuff I was able to fix but I had to order parts that took ~4-5 days to get, and had to drop it off at my friend's shop to have an Alignment done afterwards, she was car-less for about a week. 

I offered my car to her to drive, and asked my friend/colleague if she would be okay with car-pooling since our schedules synced up relatively frequently; there even was a day she offered to drive me to work on her day off. After the car was fixed, the snow storms started happening (we live in the North East). Since I live so close I offered to come plow the snow on her driveway whenever it needed it, free of charge (I actually enjoy shoveling snow, its good exercise and helps me think about various things/problems). I have gotten to a point where I have openly told her if she or her son needed anything, that I am always willing to go out of my way to help out. 

Everything seemingly was going great! I have never had a friendship with someone I could trust, be open with, not feel judged, I can bond with her son (I am terrible with kids, so this is just a life skill I need). But recently, I had some stress to deal with, the transmission my truck is starting to let go, and its absolutely not work fixing. When I am stressed I tend to wear it on my shoulders, and I openly discuss it with people I care about, so for the past few weeks I have been talking about it with my friend/colleague, expressed concerns with purchasing a new(er) car, and just generally keep an open dialogue about it (she also knows I am a car enthusiast). 

Now... I feel like she is distancing herself from me. Admittedly I have been stressed, and she is very in tune with this and asks what is bothering me whenever I seem to be wearing it on my shoulder. I have had a couple of hard days at work, had to sit down with my management team and vent some frustrations with them (they are all really awesome, so this by no means is a bad thing). In passing discussed my new friendship with them, and ever since I can feel some tension or distance from my new friend. She doesn't seem to seek me out as much any more, our conversations at work seem more oriented just towards work and not personal life, and she offered recently to get me some CBD oil to help with my anxiety (since she uses it too), but has been putting off going to her resource for it (she gets a discount from where she buys it from). 

I do suffer from some paranoia, I over think things quite frequently, so I just try to tell myself I am over thinking it, and that she has a life of her own, so my needs will take a back seat to her own. But a voice in my head that keeps triggering me is that she stopped updating her work schedule on our shared calendar. We download our schedules from our employer, so it auto populates in our calendar app, but we both have to log into a secured website to do it, so its automated but at the start of every week we have to log in and download the next posted schedule (which is multiple weeks in advance). Normally, she is diligent about updating it the day it posts, but that hasn't happened in two weeks. So, now im wondering if she intentionally made a different calendar to not share her works schedule with me, because she is trying to distance herself from me, and I can't quite work out why it is. She is a very open and blunt person, so if someone wrongs her or does something to make her unhappy, she *will* tell them (in my experience). So far, I haven't heard a single thing, and its really bumming me out. On the other side of the fence, we sometimes swap work shifts, so this makes it much more difficult to find out if there is an open spot when I need to change my schedule around for whatever reason. 

One voice in my head says ""it is what it is, if she just wants to remain colleagues then there is nothing you can do about it."" the other voice is telling me ""ask her about it, if you can trust her then she will be honest with you about how she feels."" and the last voice says ""she might think something negative about it, or might take it the wrong way and see it as obsession."" Which I am the most afraid of. 

I guess my fear comes from the fact that I am a male and she is a female, and im afraid that she thinks I am attracted to her simply because of how much effort I put into the friendship, which I can openly say is absolutely not true. I find comfort in talking to women over men because at a young age my parents divorced, my mother gained custody of me, and my dad became (and really always was) a passive father, he only really came into the picture when he was “scheduled” to or when it was convenient for him, as a result I never found myself confiding in men as much as I do women. I have some male friends that I get along with, but I fear as though I am bit more sensitive then they are, so I have a hard time getting to a certain trust level with men then I do with woman (I know, this is kind of a problem). 

What is my best approach to this problem? Should I just ignore these thoughts and let things be, not bring up the work schedule thing or express my concerns about her distance? Or should I casually just bring up that I noticed her calendar isn’t updating? ",24Feb2019,1
385,"Ok so let me give some context first. I am 12 years old and I go to a middle school in New Jersey. I have always had problems with teachers in my school for not liking me for literally no reason at all but this is something else. My story is insane. I don't think many people will believe me for this, but I swear to you everything I say in this post is 100% true and I am stuck and I don't know what I want to do. My story doesn't start off crazy but it will soon. My story starts off like this. I got bored one day and decided to make a random song on the internet. I wanted to make something similar to what Lil Barnacle does so that's exactly what I did. I spent 3 hours writing lyrics for the song and I put a video of Roblox Thanos doing the Orange Justice (Yes, I know) and I put them together. However, the beginning of the song literally opens up with big bold text that says the song is very offensive and sensitive people should not listen to this. I knew that people would get offended listening to it so I thought adding a disclaimer would be a good idea. Remember that. I uploaded the song to my Youtube channel and saved the video as an mp4. All of my friends thought it was funny and it became an inside joke within our friend group. I only told 3 students in my school that were not directly tied to my friend group to watch it. Keep this in mind.  Eventually one of the students at my school shared it with another school and the students in there thought it was funny. Then THOSE kids at the school shared it to another school near us and the kids there ALSO found it funny. I decided to make another song after my first one since many people were telling me too and I enjoyed writing the first one. I wrote the second song and recorded it. I also did the same thing by adding in a disclaimer that told you to click off the video if you get easily offended. I uploaded the song again. Boom. All of my friends and the people in my school thought it was funny. I use Discord a lot to talk with my friends as my phone broke and I don't have any other way of messaging them. One day, me and two of my friends (called Asshole1 and Asshole 2, AH1 and AH2 for short) get into an argument over Discord and to make a long story short, I decided I would not talk to them. Those two would constantly mock me and make fun of me at school. I told them to stop multiple times and they wouldn't. My other friend saw this (we'll call him GF, good friend for short) and stopped talking to those 2 after what they were doing to me. Eventually it got so bad that I couldn't go to lunch and sit down without having AH1 and AH2 get their entire table to chant names at me and mock me. At one point, one of the kids got a whole bunch of students to come around me and start mocking me. At that point. I couldn't take it. I got out of my seat and walked over and got my backpack. The lunch aids were asking me what I was doing and the only thing I could say was that I'm going to the principal. The principal was not there that day (He was sick or something) So I had to talk to a counselor. We'll call her Counselor 1. I was walking in the halls to go talk to someone when GF comes up behind me and starts walking with me to counselor 1's office. We go there and we tell her EVERYTHING. How AH1 and AH2  have been basically bullying me and getting other students to join in and how they will not stop. Counselor 1 was very supportive and immediately told the superintendent of the situation. We went back to class.  Everything was basically fine afterwards. AH1 got called up to the office and the superintendent talked to him and told him to stop. Which SURPRISE, he didn't. AH1 and AH2 then decided to get back at me for ""getting in trouble"" (they AH1 didn't even get into trouble he was just told to stop talking to me) they go up to the superintendent the next day and show them my song, and hundreds of discord messages that we had. I'm not gonna lie, my friend group is very dark. We like dark comedy  and we say some pretty offensive stuff. AH1 screenshot almost everything that I ever said about the school that was mean and showed the superintendent. The school downloaded his phone so they could get my song. AH1 and AH2 eventually came back to class. The school eventually informs the Police Station and gets the Lt. to come over to the school and ""investigate"" what happened. She deemed that the discord messages were harrasment towards the school (especially one thing I sent involving a school aid) and that the song was also harassment.   That same night, the Lt. came to my house at 7 and showed my mom pictures of me and my friends conversations on Discord and also she played the song TO MY MOM. They saved the video as an mp4 onto the Lt.'s phone so she had it. The video literally started off with the disclaimer that told you NOT TO WATCH THE VIDEO IF YOU GET EASILY OFFENDED. She played only the second song (I guess she doesn't know about the first one) and tells my mom about how I am going around the school telling everyone to watch the video and how I'm offending all of the students in my school with this song...

&amp;#x200B;

**BULLSHIT**

&amp;#x200B;

I mentioned before that I only told 3 students in my school that I was very good friends with but weren't in my friend group. Those 3 are literally the only people I told to watch it. She also told my mom that I'm offending the people in my school with this song which is another lie. Everyone in my school was very supportive of me and they all wanted me to continue making more because they were FUNNY. I even put a disclaimer to not watch the video if you get offended easily. Why would anyone watch a video that literally opens up with a disclaimer saying this song is offensive and to not watch if your sensitive get OFFENDED WHEN THEY ARE LITERALLY TOLD TO NOT WATCH IF YOUR GOING TO GET OFFENDED. It made literally no sense. She also told my mom that the song was harassment and needed to be taken off YouTube or serious things would happen. This was another lie because how could the song be harassment if it wasn't directed towards anyone? The song never said anybody's name or location, any incident involving the school, anybody's personal information, I never made any threats on the song or said anything about killing people. I don't understand why the school had to get involved. Why does something I do out of school matter when it doesn't involve the school or any body in it? The Lt. then said that I would need to come into the Police Department and film a interview about what I did. She said that the situation will not end after she leaves my house and that this will continue. Eventually she comes into my room with my mom and forces me to delete my videos. She literally would not leave my house until I deleted them. Which I did. My mom told her that she would make sure I don't do anything wrong and that she will keep an eye on me. My mom and her schedule and appointment for me to go to the police station and be interviewed about what I did. After she left my mom told me how I'm getting in trouble for no reason and that there was literally a disclaimer in the video to not watch it. My mom also thought the video was funny and she enjoyed it. I got very very mad at this entire situation. I decided that night I was going to kill myself. I couldn't take any of this anymore. I messaged my best friend (we'll call him GF2.) and told him that I was killing myself. If it wasn't for him I would not  be writing this right now. He called the cops and they came to my house. I was transferred to a hospital then transferred to another one a few days later. I stayed there for about a week and finally came back home. Apparently the entire school found out I was suicidal and basically the entire thing was dropped. Until I found out that while I was in the hospital, the Lt. called LITERALLY EVERYBODY ASSOCIATED WITH ME IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM and told them to give the police department any information they have on me and what I do in my life. There were about 15 or so kids called. Yes. 15. I told my mom and I broke down because basically every parent in my friend group hates me now. She is trying to literally ruin my life and she told everyone to not talk to me because I'm "" a bad influence"". My mom was PISSED. We decided to just wait things out and see what happens. 3 weeks after I got out of the hospital, The Lt. called another one of my friend's parents asking if they have any information about me and what I do , and if they do have anything, to report it to them immediately. She even told them that it was still ""an open case"" I was furious. I went up to the school the next day about ant talked to another counselor. (A different counselor from the one before.) I told her how the school and police station are just trying to ruin my life by this point and that I couldn't take it anymore. She told me that I needed to take responsibility for my actions and deal with it. I understand what I said in the discord messages were wrong, I get that. The song makes absolutely NO SENSE, and for the police station to go and tell my friend's parents to have their kids stop talking to me was disgusting. The counselor told me that I will be called into the police station and asked for what's been going on in some time in the future. I don't know what to do anymore and it sucks. I really just want to kill myself by this point because I can't deal with all the stress that's been going on. I know I'm a dick and this story probably doesn't make any sense but I really need some advice. I don't know what I want to do in my life and it's painful. Please help me.

386,"Well, currently I'm stuck in Mexico at a resort.

My father decided he was going to take just me and him to Mexico for my 24th birthday which is this week.

We were drinking heavily, so I'm not clear on everything that happened earlier in the day, but for some reason my father and I were yelling at each other, and I told him I was gay, I've never told anyone that, and it's something that I've struggled with for as long as I've remembered, mostly because I still dont know for certain if I am.

But anyways I remember crying my face off for a few hours and then falling asleep.

I woke up to him fighting and yelling with the security outside the room. I threw him in the room, and told him ""sit down and shut the fuck up"" which he wouldn't. Then he kept trying to leave the room which forced me to pin him down.  He then started biting me and punching me in the face to which I punched him back, blood everywhere. The security knocked on the door and the took him to resort jail to just get him away from me.

Then I was feeling very strange so installed grindr and met up with a fellow for my first time ever, and I didnt really like it. So now my mom and my best friends think I'm gay and I'm kinda stuck with all this by myself in Mexico until friday.

Earlier yesterday we were drinking very heavily so I kinda had a 4 hours of lost time, but I remember  telling him I'm gay, which is something that I shouldn't have said to him yet, because I am still unsure if I'm gay. So he leaves the room while I fell asleep sobbing, I remember calling my Mom and telling my best friend what had happened.

So hours later I wake up to him screaming and yelling in the hall way, ready to fight some people and the security guards, so I opened the door and threw him in the room and told him to sit there and shut the fuck up. So he kept trying to leave the room so I pinned him down, so he bit me and started throwing punches. So I hit him back and he started bleeding bad, the hotel security knocked on the door so I let them in to take him to hotel jail for the night. They told me I'll be charged for the mess in the room.

So in a haze I download grindr and meet up with a fellow, for my first time, and I didnt really like it. So now basically my whole family knows I'm (maybe) gay and I'm stuck in Mexico with my dad and this information.

tldr; told my dad I am gay, when I didn't know if I was, got in a fight with him about something else, and I dont know what to do now.",24Feb2019,1

Ok so let me give some context first. I am 12 years old and I go to a middle school in New Jersey. I have always had problems with teachers in my school for not liking me for literally no reason at all but this is something else. My story is insane. I don't think many people will believe me for this, but I swear to you everything I say in this post is 100% true and I am stuck and I don't know what I want to do. My story doesn't start off crazy but it will soon. My story starts off like this. I got bored one day and decided to make a random song on the internet. I wanted to make something similar to what Lil Barnacle does so that's exactly what I did. I spent 3 hours writing lyrics for the song and I put a video of Roblox Thanos doing the Orange Justice (Yes, I know) and I put them together. However, the beginning of the song literally opens up with big bold text that says the song is very offensive and sensitive people should not listen to this. I knew that people would get offended listening to it so I thought adding a disclaimer would be a good idea. Remember that. I uploaded the song to my Youtube channel and saved the video as an mp4. All of my friends thought it was funny and it became an inside joke within our friend group. I only told 3 students in my school that were not directly tied to my friend group to watch it. Keep this in mind. Eventually one of the students at my school shared it with another school and the students in there thought it was funny. Then THOSE kids at the school shared it to another school near us and the kids there ALSO found it funny. I decided to make another song after my first one since many people were telling me too and I enjoyed writing the first one. I wrote the second song and recorded it. I also did the same thing by adding in a disclaimer that told you to click off the video if you get easily offended. I uploaded the song again. Boom. All of my friends and the people in my school thought it was funny. I use Discord a lot to talk with my friends as my phone broke and I don't have any other way of messaging them. One day, me and two of my friends (called Asshole1 and Asshole 2, AH1 and AH2 for short) get into an argument over Discord and to make a long story short, I decided I would not talk to them. Those two would constantly mock me and make fun of me at school. I told them to stop multiple times and they wouldn't. My other friend saw this (we'll call him GF, good friend for short) and stopped talking to those 2 after what they were doing to me. Eventually it got so bad that I couldn't go to lunch and sit down without having AH1 and AH2 get their entire table to chant names at me and mock me. At one point, one of the kids got a whole bunch of students to come around me and start mocking me. At that point. I couldn't take it. I got out of my seat and walked over and got my backpack. The lunch aids were asking me what I was doing and the only thing I could say was that I'm going to the principal. The principal was not there that day (He was sick or something) So I had to talk to a counselor. We'll call her Counselor 1. I was walking in the halls to go talk to someone when GF comes up behind me and starts walking with me to counselor 1's office. We go there and we tell her EVERYTHING. How AH1 and AH2 have been basically bullying me and getting other students to join in and how they will not stop. Counselor 1 was very supportive and immediately told the superintendent of the situation. We went back to class. Everything was basically fine afterwards. AH1 got called up to the office and the superintendent talked to him and told him to stop. Which SURPRISE, he didn't. AH1 and AH2 then decided to get back at me for ""getting in trouble"" (they AH1 didn't even get into trouble he was just told to stop talking to me) they go up to the superintendent the next day and show them my song, and hundreds of discord messages that we had. I'm not gonna lie, my friend group is very dark. We like dark comedy and we say some pretty offensive stuff. AH1 screenshot almost everything that I ever said about the school that was mean and showed the superintendent. The school downloaded his phone so they could get my song. AH1 and AH2 eventually came back to class. The school eventually informs the Police Station and gets the Lt. to come over to the school and ""investigate"" what happened. She deemed that the discord messages were harrasment towards the school (especially one thing I sent involving a school aid) and that the song was also harassment. That same night, the Lt. came to my house at 7 and showed my mom pictures of me and my friends conversations on Discord and also she played the song TO MY MOM. They saved the video as an mp4 onto the Lt.'s phone so she had it. The video literally started off with the disclaimer that told you NOT TO WATCH THE VIDEO IF YOU GET EASILY OFFENDED. She played only the second song (I guess she doesn't know about the first one) and tells my mom about how I am going around the school telling everyone to watch the video and how I'm offending all of the students in my school with this song...

**BULLSHIT**

I mentioned before that I only told 3 students in my school that I was very good friends with but weren't in my friend group. Those 3 are literally the only people I told to watch it. She also told my mom that I'm offending the people in my school with this song which is another lie. Everyone in my school was very supportive of me and they all wanted me to continue making more because they were FUNNY. I even put a disclaimer to not watch the video if you get offended easily. Why would anyone watch a video that literally opens up with a disclaimer saying this song is offensive and to not watch if your sensitive get OFFENDED WHEN THEY ARE LITERALLY TOLD TO NOT WATCH IF YOUR GOING TO GET OFFENDED. It made literally no sense. She also told my mom that the song was harassment and needed to be taken off YouTube or serious things would happen. This was another lie because how could the song be harassment if it wasn't directed towards anyone? The song never said anybody's name or location, any incident involving the school, anybody's personal information, I never made any threats on the song or said anything about killing people. I don't understand why the school had to get involved. Why does something I do out of school matter when it doesn't involve the school or any body in it? The Lt. then said that I would need to come into the Police Department and film a interview about what I did. She said that the situation will not end after she leaves my house and that this will continue. Eventually she comes into my room with my mom and forces me to delete my videos. She literally would not leave my house until I deleted them. Which I did. My mom told her that she would make sure I don't do anything wrong and that she will keep an eye on me. My mom and her schedule and appointment for me to go to the police station and be interviewed about what I did. After she left my mom told me how I'm getting in trouble for no reason and that there was literally a disclaimer in the video to not watch it. My mom also thought the video was funny and she enjoyed it. I got very very mad at this entire situation. I decided that night I was going to kill myself. I couldn't take any of this anymore. I messaged my best friend (we'll call him GF2.) and told him that I was killing myself. If it wasn't for him I would not be writing this right now. He called the cops and they came to my house. I was transferred to a hospital then transferred to another one a few days later. I stayed there for about a week and finally came back home. Apparently the entire school found out I was suicidal and basically the entire thing was dropped. Until I found out that while I was in the hospital, the Lt. called LITERALLY EVERYBODY ASSOCIATED WITH ME IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM and told them to give the police department any information they have on me and what I do in my life. There were about 15 or so kids called. Yes. 15. I told my mom and I broke down because basically every parent in my friend group hates me now. She is trying to literally ruin my life and she told everyone to not talk to me because I'm "" a bad influence"". My mom was PISSED. We decided to just wait things out and see what happens. 3 weeks after I got out of the hospital, The Lt. called another one of my friend's parents asking if they have any information about me and what I do , and if they do have anything, to report it to them immediately. She even told them that it was still ""an open case"" I was furious. I went up to the school the next day about ant talked to another counselor. (A different counselor from the one before.) I told her how the school and police station are just trying to ruin my life by this point and that I couldn't take it anymore. She told me that I needed to take responsibility for my actions and deal with it. I understand what I said in the discord messages were wrong, I get that. The song makes absolutely NO SENSE, and for the police station to go and tell my friend's parents to have their kids stop talking to me was disgusting. The counselor told me that I will be called into the police station and asked for what's been going on in some time in the future. I don't know what to do anymore and it sucks. I really just want to kill myself by this point because I can't deal with all the stress that's been going on. I know I'm a dick and this story probably doesn't make any sense but I really need some advice. I don't know what I want to do in my life and it's painful. Please help me.",24Feb2019,0
391," I am looking for arguments for either of the options or advice/things I need to think through. The last few months, I tried thinking of this as systematically//logically as possible, but I just can't. And it's almost time for me to submit a decision.

&amp;#x200B;

\*Context\*

I live with my parents currently. At the beginning of university, it wasn't that bad. But after four years of undergrad, I think I'm starting to outgrow my parents.

They're traditional and strict (EX: require permission when I go out for the day, need to know my hourly schedule, control over where I work, etc.), but they provided for my family, you know? Putting food on the table, taking care of me and my sibling.

The environment is getting pretty tense, especially since we've been having money problems lately.

I also commute an hour and a half everyday to go to school. Add another hour and a half to get back home. I'm pretty sick of the commute and having to pack everything I need in a bag is becoming difficult on my back (I currently carry my stuff in a small luggage bag, but it's winter here and the wheels don't really work in the snow).

That being said, I think I'm ready to live alone, perhaps get my own apartment. I know it sounds cliché or unnecessary, but I need my own space. I just need to be alone. I'm tired of pretending to be a different person or want different things just to keep them happy and I really need the freedom to explore. And I'm more than willing to work to achieve this.

It can be something small and simple, but I want something that's mine.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**

\*Here's the dilemma\*:

I recently got into two law schools, (A) one in an expensive city that has a prestigious reputation, the other (B) in my hometown, where I've been living all my life and is seen as academically average.

&amp;#x200B;

\*If I choose A\*

\- I will get in a massive amount of debt, about $200,000. I haven't gone to the bank yet to see if I'd be approved, but will do so this month. I have applied for scholarships, still waiting to hear back.

\- Like, this is seriously a lot of debt. I don't know how I'll be able to pay it back. I looked at the average salary for my area, in the kind of law I want to practice vs the cost of living and it doesn't look to good. Plus, my parents might have to cosign for me and I don't want any more money troubles.

\- Returning home after my degree is still a possibility: I may return back home after because I live in a federal capital that has some articling opportunities. But the city I'd be living in may also have cool articling opportunities. Just a possibility.

&amp;#x200B;

\*If I choose B\*

\- I have enough saved over the years to pay for tuition. I'm trying to convince them to let me get an apartment I would pay for myself, so at least I would be in downtown and wouldn't have to commute as much. This would also allow me my own space. But they're not going for it, so I'll likely keep living with them and I don't know if I can handle that.

\- They are literally the only things that would keep me in this city. I'm not really close to anyone (which is why I'm asking reddit). My ""friends"" have all moved away last year, since they were years older than me. But I don't know if I'll have the freedom to build my own life if I stay here for the next four years.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for anything here: arguments for/against and option, things that I need to think through or haven't thought of yet, personal experiences. Anything that will help me make this decision.

Thank you for taking the time to answer.",24Feb2019,3
393,"Iv been helping my mother sort through paperwork today and we discovered this at the back of a cupboard with some of my younger siblings things: https://imgur.com/gallery/gFdoQxW

394,"I’m f(16) and like many Christians- am struggling a lot with how to explain my views to my friends without offending them. 

I obviously have no issue with people being part of the LGBTQ+ community, have no right to stop anyone being who they are and will fully support them and their equality as people. However, as my beliefs consider (the acts) wrong, I would struggle to be involved in a parade where they celebrate it in it’s entirety

(For example: my atheist friends could feel uncomfortable coming to a religious parade because they disagree with some parts even though they support religious people’s equality etc.)

They have brought it up and assume I am fine with it, so I’m not sure how to put this out to my friends without coming across as homophobic. 

Any advice from both religious/non religious perspectives would be really helpful.

396,I am hoping someone can help me on here. I just had a bathroom remodel. My main concern is the tub/shower that we just had tiled by a general contractor on our area. I noticed today that there is a noticeably wet line around where the tub meets the grout on the shower as well as the grout outside of the shower wall. Is this normal? We waited about a week before we used the shower and this is the first time using it and 10 hours later it is still dark.

399,"So the title is pretty self explanatory. My grandma passed away in December, and it was devastating for my whole family. We were all very close but none more so than my Mum. They were best friends, talked every single day and my grandmas passing was very sudden 

For the few weeks after my grandma died, my mum went abroad to attend the funeral and be with her family - now she’s home but the last few months have been hard. Often when I see her she just randomly cries and says she misses her mother. The other day she was telling me how she misses how my grandma used to always make her laugh and was always there to talk to. I listen of course, and I’m still sad about my grandma’s passing - but I’m not sure if I should be trying to actively talk to mum about it or just listen when she needs someone. Or maybe I don’t encourage it so she’s not stewing in the sadness. 

I’m just sad seeing my mum so sad to be honest. My wife said to just listen when she needs to talk, but I feel like it’s been months now and this grief is still right at the surface of everything. Should I recommend a therapist to help? I don’t know how to help her. ",24Feb2019,0
400,"I’m 21 and I’m a junior in college, studying Psychology and Criminal Justice. I just transferred to a 4-year-school from a community college where I graduated with a 3.8 GPA in Psychology. This is my second semester at the 4-year-college (I started in the fall) and it’s not going as well as I hoped. I got a C and B in two classes in the fall semester and I just had my first exam in one of my classes for this semester where I didn’t do so well, either, which I’m confused about because I studied hard and felt very confident during the test. I’m going to meet with the professor to go over the score (fingers crossed that something messed up) but I don’t even know what to do right now. I was hoping to go to graduate school but if my grades continue to be horrible, I’m afraid that I won’t get in. I’ve never been this bad in school before and I feel so bad about myself.

At this point, I just want to finish this semester and the fall semester (my last semester) and just get my bachelors degree. But I’m wondering what jobs I can get if I graduate with a bachelors degree with a major in Psychology and a minor in Criminal Justice. 

I’m just depressed and I have another exam on Tuesday but I have no desire to even study after finding out my other grade. I just don’t understand. Do grades really matter in college?

403,"Literally made an account just to ask this because I don’t know where else to go. I’ve been dating a guy for two years, and we live together. Over the past year or so, he’s really struggled with drug addiction (benzos mainly, but a lot of other things as well), and has come to me multiple times saying he wants to quit but always ends up getting dragged back in. BF is was also diagnosed bipolar about 8/10 months ago, and blames that and some bad-influence friends for his addiction. Because of his problems, he hasn’t kept a job in several months, and his family and I support him. 

A couple of weeks ago, BF’s best friend shows up at our house wasted and saying he can’t go home to his girlfriend because she’s pissed. He does a couple of lines of coke in my kitchen, then tells me that he’s not going to say specifically, but that BF has “theoretically” been cheating on me for months. One person BF fucked was the friend’s girlfriend, another was some girl he met at a job who had drugs. BF admitted that night that he had tried to have sex with the work friend, but it was mainly her going for him, and that it wasn’t good and they had to stop because he couldn’t get hard. He also admitted that he had let the work friend believe he liked her so that she would give him drugs for free. The friend who spilled the beans left, but told me that BF was far from telling the truth. 

Next day, the friend messages me on FB, saying he had screenshots of texts that BF had sent to his (friend’s) girlfriend, and tons of video, audio, and photo evidence to show that BF had been fucking around. He sends me the screenshots and a couple of stills from a video, and it all looks like BF. I confronted BF about the situation, and he swears he was only with friend’s girlfriend twice, on friend’s urging and because he was being bribed with drugs to participate in some fantasy friend’s girlfriend had. The friend again said BF is not telling the truth. BF insists that I stop contacting the friend, and block the friend and his girlfriend. 

BF and I are still together tenuously, mostly because of our living arrangements, and he’s stopped using drugs, to my knowledge. But flash forward to yesterday, and I woke up to a friend request from the coworker girl with the drugs. BF, again, tells me just to block her because anything she has to say is a lie fed to her by the friend that started everything. 

Obviously I’m extremely wary and suspicious at this point. I want to talk to the friend and the coworker because they apparently have information about events that are being kept secret from me, but BF says I need to trust him and believe that there’s nothing else he’s hiding. My argument is that if there’s nothing left for them to tell me, then why can’t I get their side of the story? It seems like a no harm no foul, but BF gets very defensive if I mention wanting to talk to these people. 

I don’t know what to do, honestly. If everything that happened is as BF told me and it really was purely drug-fueled, I can forgive him as long as he gets help and I can see real changes in his problematic behavior. If the drug friends know something I don’t, though, I need to talk to them and find out what’s going on. I don’t want to make a decision that’s going to uproot my whole life until I have all the facts. My friends and family are urging me to kick BF out, but his friends and family (who I trust deeply and who wouldn’t want me to stay in a situation where I’m being hurt) are insistent that BF genuinely cares for me and just made a horrible mistake. 

If anyone has any idea of how I should proceed, it’d be very appreciated. I figured this would be a good way to get unbiased opinions. ",24Feb2019,1

412,"They tested me on emotional intelligence,  resilience, and how I adapt to change. It was my first day, my manager wasn't there so a bunch of people dumped their assessments on me to do. My name was saved with the data and they still own it. I was an intern, so I don't think I should have had to take them. 

I apparently am very conservative (probably a bad thing to be in a world that emphasizes innovative), have low resilience and low emotional intelligence. Seeing the low scores was really scary and it was even more embarrassing that a bunch of people, my new coworkers, viewed them after. I feel like mental health is a very personal thing and it haunted me. No one formally debriefed me on any of the assessments, which it is in their own policy that they are supposed to. In fact, you are supposed to be a psychologist to administer them, again, which is in their policy.

During the internship, I was very neglected. I wasn't trusted with any real work, I was barely given anything to do. For the first month, no one invited me out to lunch so that on the rare times they did later, I was so nervous I couldn't speak, which made me look even dumber. Having it in the back of my head that there was something wrong with me made me even feel even worse. The girl who was supposed to work with me openly hated me, cut me off whenever I tried to speak, so I became mute and scared to ask for help or work. Because I spent so many hours with nothing to do, I fixated on the results of the tests and all the times in my life I demonstrated low resilience or emotional intelligence and how my unsuccessful internship was proving the results right.

I do have anxiety - I'm sure I'm not a very resilient person - and I don't think have the best emotional intelligence, but considering I have a lot of strong friendships and care about people pretty deeply, and I'm generally easy to get along in work and school contexts, I don't think it should have been as low as the assessment scored me. Because I'm not confident and I'm hard on myself, I feel reluctant to rate myself highly, and I'm sure the assessments are built to assume people tend to rate themselves higher than accurate. It still feels bad to get those results.

I'm mad my name is on that data, and I'm mad that I'm still questioning if there's something wrong with me to get such low scores. When my internship ended and I went back to school, I was so much less confident than I was before. I struggle to talk to my friends. And all this anxiety proves to me that they were right, that my resilience is low. I feel unemployable and unlikeable. 

They did not even do an exit interview with me even though they were supposed to. I was that neglected. I really wanted to keep them feedback about how harmful the experience was and how they shouldn't throw assessments on people without any instruction, informed consent, or debriefing. I take mental health seriously and I feel that such assessments should be done at a mental health facility, not given to an intern at a workplace, and certainly the results should not be shared with new coworkers, or any coworkers.

413,"Hello everybody,

My situation may be kinda cliche but still want your advice/opinion on this, whatever it may be.

About a week ago, I was with a bunch of close friends, hanging out at a local club. One of the hottest girls in our school decided she would join us with a mutual friend. She decided to stay with us even after her friend left which seemed odd. They (girls) usually never do that. This girl made the first move on me by the end of the night, which was  pretty late. I mean, she apparently waited the entire freaking night for me to do something but to no avail since guys are kind of braindead in that sense, they just don't get the hint I guess. 

Anyway, by the end of the night, we were having this deep conversation outside the club and she just goes in for the kiss, out of the blue. I was drunk so memory is kinda shaky, but after that I just kept going and we were kissing for a while. We later went back home and slept together. Next day we stayed in bed together cuddling and stuff for most of the day. She left after that cause she had work to do.

I have known this girl for around 2 years, we are in the same class. Despite being friends, I never thought there would be anything between us, despite her acting over-friendly on some occasions. I know that very recently, she was in a long-term, shaky relationship before me. I feel like she really loved the guy before despite him not giving a shit which really hurt her. (The fact that she loved somebody before is bothering me more than it should, is this normal?)

I wanna ask you all, are these all a sign of her just being horny, or is it that she may really like me after all?

Here is what happened: 

I had an appointment at this dentist office in the afternoon. I was running a bit late. So I called the office telling the lady who answered my phone,” I will be about 10 minutes late. Is that ok?” She said,”It’s totally ok. It’s perfect.” also telling me : she will meet me in a moment with very nice and sweet tones. When I got there, ran to their office, the front door was locked. I can’t open it. 

Through the glass door, I saw only one lady sitting in the front desk (there was nobody else in the room). She looked up, then did a hand gesture to shoo me, then looked down at her table. I was confused and shocked. I didn’t understand what was going on. I knocked the door. But the lady just ignored me. I called their phone number again and again. I was so confused, I thought there must be some mistakes and probably the lady who answered my phone wasn’t this one.

I called 4 times while standing in the front, waiting for 15-20 minutes, nobody answered. By this time, I was calm down and I saw their phone number on the front door: the same number I called. I realized the front desk lady must be the one answered my phone earlier and refusing answered it now. I knocked door again. The lady finally glared at me with a very cold look on her face. Then she went to somewhere behind the desk and didn’t show up again. I left with all the questions.

Do you think she’s a sociopath? What can I do? 

Should I call local police? Where can I make this complain to?

Any advices are welcomed and thank you for reading. ",24Feb2019,0
416,"In september i borrowed my boyfriend around 160€ naively thinking he will return it to as soon as possible. I told him not to stress too much and that he doens't have to pay me back the full amount, but like smaller amounts of money over a longer time span because I am aware that's a lot to pay back at once for a student.

I once reminded him about it in december and he acted like he was feeling really bad about it, and that he'll try to pay me back 40€/month. That obviously did not happen and it is february now!!!!

He acts like he's always broke but at the same time he regularly goes out for meals with his friends (which I don't do) or keeps buying new video games and obvioulsy I am pissed! I have an important exam in a week and I can't focus because he's going to the cinema tonight (quick 20€) without having payed me back a single cent.

it is a lot of money to me and I trusted him that I wouldn't have to remind him all the time, but I am too f-ing polite and nice to keep reminding him anyway and I don't know how to handle this situation so I'm curious if any of you have any suggestions for me on how to handle this.

417,"So I deal with anxiety and inevitably let my problems mount until they make me 20x more anxious, which needless to say, makes everything worse. Last year after filing my taxes I found out I owed like 700 dollars, and haven’t payed a dime back since. I never contacted payroll to get more taken out each paycheck, and I’ve been to nervous to even file this year. My therapist said I should get an accountant and start to take care of it. Has anyone else dealt with this, and is there any advice anyone could give me? I don’t even know where to start. I’ve gotten a few phone calls from people claiming to work for the IRS, but I’m almost positive they were scam calls. This was mostly during the summer or late spring, I think. I got one letter from the IRS that was kind of threatening, but that’s about it.

He is a 25/m and I’m a 25/f. 

What should I think of these texts between my ex and I? We met last week to talk and talked till five am. 

He wanted to meet in person so I couldn’t record our convo. I asked if he had posted on reddit about his gf and how much he loved her and felt bad for fucking me when first dating her. He denied this. He lies a lot tho. He said he did not want to have a phone call with me so he couldn’t record our convo or anything for his gf to find out. 

For like seven hours we chatted and he said he’d like to talk more. The thing is. He has a gf. He told me that he didn’t appreciate me enough when we dated and that his life is fine except for his gf and that they haven’t grown together like he hoped they would. He said that he doesn’t see a great future with them unless big changes are made. He’s said this about his gf for over a year even before they started to date. 

I texted him after our meeting to clarify what’s going on between us.

I am a high school senior. I did pretty well in school. I have something like a 3.7 GPA (unweighted) and a 29 ACT. I decided to go to community college. I am very scared that I am making the wrong decision. I understand that I am probably missing out on a lot of debt, but I feel I could been accepted by some schools. 

Here are the things I am worried most about:

(1.) I am pursuing a two-year engineering degree. I am worried about credits transferring and wasting a lot of time.

(2.) I am sort of worried about my home life. I am starting to wonder if moving out would have been better for me in the long run

(3.) I have an amazing girlfriend, but it looks like we're going to end up at different schools. That being said, I still want to try my hardest to make things work. I am a year older than her so she'll still be at the high school. (Note: I am living at home next year.)

Then I relocated the money I had saved up. It was 100 euros. Today I looked at the place I hid the money and found none. I don't know when this happened since I don't regularly check up on it. Las time I checked maybe was a month ago. Mind you, I hadn't told her that I had money so I don't know how she figured it out. She must go through the entirety of my room when she can, because she is at home all time and I'm not.

Sometime during later, the box disappeared with all it's contents. I mentioned this to my mother and she pretended she knew nothing about it and even conjured up a theory, that because my drawer is so messy, when she was taking the trash out of there (paper, plastic from packages) she might have accidentally taken the box with the trash and thrown it out, since it was so small. I smelled  bullshit but she was drunk when she rummaged through there, and I really had no explanation for it.

439,"so, here's the story

i'm a US student doing his MA in archaeology in England. even though i said i'd do some travelling, i haven't travelled since December since i hate travelling alone and my friends and i haven't found a good time to travel since i got back from my winter break. if i'm not doing stuff related to school, such as getting stuff for my dissertation together, or if i'm not going out into town with my friends or hanging out in the shared kitchen in my flat, i'm usually in my room. knowing this, my parents (my uncle and aunt who raised me) decided to give me an ultimatum: show them in two weeks how much travelling or work i can get done, or they'll keep me from coming back to England for the summer term. the reason is that they figure i shouldn't have to pay both tuition and housing payments if i'm not making the most of my time (with housing being the cheaper of the two). add to that the fact that my car is currently in the shop and repairs will cost me $1700, and i'm looking at between $4000-3200 in my account by the end of the year

one issue is that i need to be able to have easy access to resources for my dissertation, which is important because i'm doing a theory paper on something that as far as i can tell is rather obscure. however, my parents are completely disregarding that both i and my dissertation supervisor are saying that i need to stay here. they said that i could easily skype or email conference my dissertation supervisor and that i can get all the materials i need online or through interlibrary loans. they also want me to get a part time job during the summer so i can have some more money to make a down payment on either my first apartment or my first house, but that means that i'll have less time and energy to work on my dissertation

another issue is that, aside from my brothers and sisters who all live in other states, the only friends i currently have live over here in England. if i take up this part time job in the States, i don't think i'll be hanging out with any of my coworkers due to the fact that they're working and i'm busy. my parents want me to have human interaction, but i feel they're ignoring the fact that i need to be able to have non-professional human interaction, which i'd have over here. i'll be more lonely in the US than over here, where if i wanted to visit friends i could easily take a train and travel to see them

to be fair to them, where we live currently we have few friends. we recently moved a year ago, but my aunt has no friends (due to the people she used to do stuff with being backstabbing bitches) and my uncle only has two friends that i know of. what's worse, my uncle is working an absolutely shitty job where both of his bosses harass him and chastise him for doing his work properly. if anything, i'd say they're trying to pull all the tricks in the book to try to get me to come home and keep them company. hell, they asked me if i wanted to come home this past Saturday for two weeks, even though they knew i had a counselling appointment on Monday, an appointment with my academic supervisor this coming thursday, AND a dissertation workshop the day after

At work everybody else thought that we are more than colleagues, especially (38M) and I, most likely because we are the only employees at our department -we are maintenance technicians- and usually we appear together to tackle the works assigned to us. The four of us were good colleagues but never friends, we went to the bar together, had dinner together, always with colleagues outside of our circle, we talk about football, basketball, UFC, politics, etc. but never about our families or relationships, we are not that close.

Later I was offered a better job at another company so accepted it and left, (32M) never stopped contacting me and whenever they are going out he invited me and I accepted most of the times.

Now let’s talk about (38M), he is shorter guy, ripped dude but not the most masculine looking if I might say, whenever we are working, his hands may touches mine or he put his hand on my shoulder, it’s normal, weirded me out a little as I don’t like to be touched but it’s the work nature sometimes.

He never mentioned anything, I even overheard him saying that he was catfished by a fat chick some years ago, the only thing that was, I would say little strange to me is that his hobbies are shopping for furniture and gardening, and that doesn’t indicate any thing I guess?

Anyway, today’s morning he texted me “let’s go out sometimes”, I thought he meant with the other dudes, I said “yeah just arrange with the others and text me”, he said “no, just you and me”, I didn’t respond for a few, he texted again “even better, why don’t you come to my place?” This really creeped me out and I am confused and don’t know what to do, I like him as a good colleague but I am not gay or attracted to men in anyway, what should I do?

If we dont text her back, she worries something has happened to us or our little girl. 

I love my partner and our little girl and our little family time so much and I hate spending precious family time on weekends with her. My partner would never admit it but it makes him super anxious and hes a different person around her. 

She comments on everything we do and definitely doesn't remember what it's like having a baby. 

I feel like I hold so much anger towards her and dread seeing her. I know it's not healthy and I wish i enjoyed her company but i just dont. 

Does anyone have any advice about this? Sometimes i wish there was a MIL subreddit for crazy stories about MILs. TIA",24Feb2019,6

I (F/21) have been on antidepressants for many years. Last year I was going through something that sent me spiralling. I turned to alcohol and often drank until blackout in order to forget my problems.

Throughout this time I became ‘involved’ with this guy (we’ll call him K). We had mutual friends, and were attracted to each other and ended up sleeping together.

Over the course of a couple of months, every time I was drunk in the area that K lived in, I would wake up in K’s bed. On a couple occasions I recall kissing him, before passing out. But it turns out we had sex multiple times. Once I found out from a friend that K picked me up from a bar, when I could barely stand, and had sex with me in his car.

I realised after that time that my drinking was unhealthy, and cut off contract with K. 

Fast forward to now, I’m in a loving relationship and have a better understanding of my triggers, and can now talk about my problems a lot better.

All these past events have been brought up again though as K now has a girlfriend, and she comes up on my Facebook a lot, so I thought I’d take a look. After a brief look at her profile, she posts A LOT about how much she loves him, and how she’s finally has a decent man and about doing the right thing and helping sexual assault victims. I don’t know what I’d call what happened between K and I, but I know it wasn’t right. It upsets me that she sees someone perfect when he might take advantage of that.

But I also worry that if I say something, it’ll ruin what they have - maybe K has found love, and is a better person.

I really just need advice on how to handle these thoughts, I can’t sleep. I keep wondering what’s the right thing.",24Feb2019,1

**So… you want to get your ex boyfriend back?**

One of the easiest ways you can win your ex boyfriend back is by simply using your cell phone and tapping a bunch of buttons.

Sound absurd? Well, it isn’t… I’ve coached thousands of women around the world to effectively **“Text Their Exes Back”…** even if they initially thought that it was impossible to ever rekindle any sort of romance with their ex boyfriend.

And  today, I’m about to give you some tips on how you can force your  boyfriend to come running back to you (and no, he’ll definitely have  absolutely no choice in the matter).

Ready?

This  is the first text you can send to get started (but don’t send these  text messages yet. At the end of the article, I’ll tell you exactly when  to send these texts, because when you send these messages is just as  important as what you send).

**Text #1 – The “I’m Ok” Text Message:**  
— *“Hey  \_\_\_\_\_, I just want to let you know that I’m 100% cool with the breakup  and I thought that it was a good idea. Hope we can still be friends.  Talk soon.”* —

This text message is  great because it conveys all the right messages. For one, you’re letting  him know that you were 100% okay with the breakup **(you need to make him think this right now)**.  By saying this, you’re pretty much saying to him that you don’t really  need him… and this will subconsciously drive him insane. By posing as  “just a friend” right now, you start planting my patented ‘Seduction  Seeds’ that will eventually cause him to start thinking about you in a  sexual way again… and win him back for good. More on this in a bit.

**Text #2 – The “No Communication” Text.**  
— *“You’re right. It’s best that we don’t talk right now, but I would like to be friends eventually.”* —

This  one is a little advanced and you need to know exactly when to send this  text… but again, you’re communicating to him that you don’t really need  to talk to him. In essence, you’re saying that you don’t really need  him to play any role in your life anymore. By doing this, you’ll send  the messsage that you do want to “move on”… and you’ll begin tricking  him into thinking that he actually lost you!

**Text #3 – The “Jealousy” Text.**  
— *“I think it was a great idea that we decided to start dating other people. I do just want to be friends right now!”* —

By  saying this, you’re telling him that you’re actually dating other  people right now… which will in turn make him jealous. This is a good  thing. By saying this, you’re sub-communicating to him that you’re  actually wanted by other guys. Remember, men are attracted to women that  are wanted by other guys, so by saying that you’re dating around  already, you’re pretty much saying that “it’s your loss, mister!”

Remember,  you can’t just simply send these texts to him and expect good results…  you need to have a plan of attack, and send these messages right when  he’s most likely to take them seriously… only then will he begin to feel  attraction for you and induce a “fear of loss” within him.

In  the free presentation below, I’ll show you exactly what you can do to  make your ex boyfriend want you again. No matter what your situation is —  or how badly you’ve messed up since the two of you broke up — I’ll be  able to give you a number of useful tips that you can apply immediately.

But  you better hurry up because this video won’t be online forever… demand  has been overwhelming and there’s no way I’ll be able to afford hosting  it online for much longer.

452,"Let's call my friend 'Dave'.

It dates back to when he was 13, he met a very friendly 26yo girl. According to him, he instantly fell in love with her. I'm assuming she must've seen him only as an adorable little kid. 

Fast forward to when he's 18, she's 31, he's desperately in love with her, and she's dating some other dude. Despite being with another dude, she occasionally flirts with Dave on text. Dave thinks they're both going to end up together. He wakes up at odd times like 3am to talk to her on the phone because that's when she returns from work. He spends lots &amp; lots of money on buying gifts for her. Fast fwd to finals for 12th grade, Dave fails in one of the subjects. I and our friends move onto university while Dave has to prepare for his retest next year. 

Fast forward 1 year, his retest is 20 days away. The girl just got engaged, despite this she still flirts with Dave at times.  Dave thinks they'll both still end up together. Dave has no job, and he's yet to start higher studies. He's thrown away his entire life and his passion (wanted to design video games) for this 1 girl who's been playing with him since 6 years. We've all tried to talk him out of it. I've spent several hours trying to explain how she sees him only as someone whom she can vent her emotions to. It makes me feel powerless knowing that I've been able to do nothing all these years, despite being his closest friend.

I come to find out they all talk bad about everyone. It was nothing I thought much about for a while then I woke up from a nap to hear them saying bad things about my gf at the time in the other room. I'm not a confrontational person so I just let it go. A week later my RA (residence advisor) came up to me and asked if we could have a meeting. He them told me that my roommates had all met up with him to say they felt like I wasn't holding my own in the cleaning. (I disagree with this as Im the only one who consistently does the dishes and takes out the trash) but I talked to them and they said they may want me out so their good friend could move in. At that point in the semester you can't change rooms so I stayed. The issue now is that ever since then all they do is ignore me, they will go into our common room see me and go to the other room and I can hear them just gossip about all of their friends. They scheme ways to get money from the rich one and if any of them are talking to a girl they treat her poorly.

I suffered from an extremely tough and harsh depression for about two years. Now, during this period of time, I started using drugs as a way to escape from reality and to be away from my problems, even if it was just for a couple of hours. Everything started with alcohol and cigarrettes, but it did not take me to long to start looking for stronger stuff, because I was looking to numb reality as much as I could.

&amp;#x200B;

I had some issues with marijuana during a couple of months, but, in the end, I ended up using cocaine. I developed a strong addiction to it, but, somehow, I was able to come out clean after a couple of months of cutting it off completely and dealing with the shittiest abstinence I have ever experienced in my life. Everything was fine until yesterday, when I relapsed.

&amp;#x200B;

I got my hands on 3 grams of cocaine (for those of you who are not very familiar with it, that is quite a lot of blow), and I found a community of people who also consume, and everyone was nice as hell. The issue is that I ended up doing about 2.5 Gs out of the three I had. I gathered enough strength and self determination to throw away the last .5 Gs, because I knew I would overdose if I kept going. I was close to reaching the point of ODing, but was lucky enough to be convinced by the guys in the chat to wait a little before taking in more lines. To finish with this, I am now on absolutely no sleep, my nose is bleeding due to the amount of coke I did, and I am like shit right now for breaking up my four month streak of bein sober. Now, I don't really know what to do with my life. Now that I have relapsed, it seems as if there was nothing else I can do or nothing else for me to strive for. What can I do now?",24Feb2019,3

461,"I will try to keep this brief to keep more people engaged and answer questions as they arise. 

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I are both 32 and own a home (two years into 30 year mortgage).

I have an extremely stable, extremely specialized career earning approx. $100k with a pension at age 55 that will net approximately $10k a month.

My wife has a career currently earning approximately $75k a year.

&amp;#x200B;

She is not happy where we currently live.  We do not have kids and are relatively comfortable in our lifestyle, however she does not like the state we live in (weather being a huge driving factor).  She has family that lives on the other side of the country and thinks she would he happier living there (near San Deigo, CA).  I have some family there as well and the family that remains nearest us now, are currently searching for where to retire, and are open to moving anywhere.

  
How do I even begin to consider making a move like this.  I love my job, it took me a while to get where I am today, and none of my schooling and professional experience will translate into any new job somewhere else.  I will likely have to start from scratch.  She has located an area where cost of living will be similar (not in San Diego, approximately 45 minutes away).

&amp;#x200B;

I floated the idea to her that if she can find something that pays 2x her current salary, I would consider (outlandish, and likely impossible). If she is very serious about this, what do I do?  Do I explain to her the importance of waiting it out until I am 55, or do I somehow start the process of seriously engaging in a conversation about how we could possibly make this happen.

Life dealt her with a band hand and our friendship took a blow in the last months of 2017 but we recovered and we were only working on making her comfortable after her breakup, but life had different plans. My dad was diagnosed with cancer and I failed my entrance exams to university so I was really disconnected from everyone and since our friendship wasn't already going well it almost went down to just once a week conversation. I didn't really like that and talked to her openly about it and she said she agreed and we agreed on talking more often to save our friendship ebbing away. Life didn't really want that, she lost her grandfather to age, someone in her life who she valued more than her parents due to reasons you might be able to guess. She slipped into complete depression after this. I hadn't seen her hit that low in her life but she did and I knew there was an imminent danger of our friendship ending but I didn't really want to end for I had found a family in her. So I tried my best to not let it end but it wasn't working. She had lost someone else who she had fought hard for all her life and she had lost all hopes of having a better life after her grandfather's death. All of this was just adding up to both us giving up on each other. Our talks had become really depressive by now and no matter how hard I tried to make her talk she wouldn't give me more than one word replies and a few descriptive ones at times and even though I try to keep myself cheerful through hard times this was triggering my depression too so I had to stop in between conversation at times to keep my anxiety and depression at bay. I had to look for replies to divert the conversation into something cheerful but that didn't help at all.

Just tired. Exhausted on the inside. I want out. So. Badly.

The HOW is the biggest question. So here's my question. I've been thinking of getting hold of some heroin and deliberately overdosing the shit out of myself. Seems like a nice enough, sure-fire way to go. How much should I look to get, and how (as in method of intake) should I do it? I'm not really a big drug user--have dabbled in the past, but heroin would definitely be brand spanking new to me. I don't want to screw it up and wind up brain damaged and on life support or something terrible like that.

Maybe I should be asking this in a drug subreddit or something, I dunno. Again, if I'm in the wrong place and anyone knows where to better direct this question I'd be grateful. PM me or something if, as a 'support group', you can't advise here in public. Thanks peeps.",24Feb2019,1

489,"I'm a 22 year old guy, I live at home, and I've never been in a relationship (furthest I've ever ""gotten"" with a girl is a meaningful hug). I don't mind spending time along and can successfully occupy myself with video games, my job, and online education, but I'm missing out on 90% of what gives life meaning. 

Reddit community, I need someone to love.

Obviously I'll never meet people I'm interested in if I don't do anything outside of the house, but I don't know where to start. I feel like I need to really know people before feeling comfortable being around them, and that's a problem when it comes to talking to strangers and meeting people. I'm sure I have to work more on myself, but I feel like that work will never be done. If I'm ""working on myself"" for the next 10 years, I'll have missed out on the prime of my life and it'll be getting very late to start a family. 

I think this might be a dumb question, and I might be venting a bit, but I have a strong desire to find someone who completes my life. My problem is that I don't know how to meet people! I'm realizing as I'm typing this that online dating might be the solution, but I've always felt like that's a last resort and I think it'd be hard to find find someone I have a connection with online.

Any help you can give me would be appreciated, but I  reality I just really needed an outlet to say all of this. Thanks for reading it and have a nice day!",24Feb2019,1
491,"Hi,

Starting about the beginning of this year, my Mom has developed an obsession with ""Respect"" and has a very skewed idea of what it means (I know this sounds bad coming from a teenager but hear me out) She says and does things that are designed to make me look like a villain, and does these things frequently. Her backup when I try to speak with her about it is always ""Maybe you should treat me with respect"" or ""You're not an adult."" I have a non-verbal learning disorder which makes it difficult for me to identify certain emotions, and also prevents me from understanding when I'm being disrespectful, and she knows this fact very well. I made a document to express some thoughts and feelings to her, and when I brought it up she refused to have the discussion and essentially is just evading me at all costs.

Here is a link with the list I mentioned. Is there any way for me to confront her without her running away from me?

501,"  

Hello!

This is a long story, so I will try to be as succinct as possible. I got an apartment with my friend last July. The general rule of not living with your friends definitely applies to us; we both have very different styles of living. I need a roommate that will help with cleaning, caring for our pets, and groceries. My roommate, conversely, often forgets to do any housework, is gone 4-5 times a week so I have to take care of her cat, and she’ll often eat my food without asking, or leave just a tiny bit left so she can say she didn’t eat it all (think 3 tablespoons of milk or the crumbs at the bottom of the bag of cereal.) My roommate is currently working full time, going to school full time at a school about a 45 minute drive to the east, and her boyfriend lives in a town about 45 minutes to our west. He almost never comes to our place (even though I’ve offered to go to my boyfriend’s over and over), so she always goes to him. 

Both my roommate and I suffer from a mix of depression and anxiety, and both of us are not doing well. My depression is spiraling out of control, and a good portion of that is coming from the stress of living with her. I get frustrated and angry that I have to do all the work around the house, I have to take care of her cat, she eats my food, and she’ll forget to do simple things like lock the door or turn off lights. Then I feel guilty and hate myself for getting mad at her about these things and I feel like I’m constantly being a complete bitch to her. My roommate’s anxiety is out of control because she’s trying to do 3 things at once, and isn’t doing anything to budget her time efficiently (aka she’ll ‘nap’ for 6 hours instead of doing homework). A couple of weeks ago she had a mental breakdown so she called in to work 2 days in a row and stayed at the friend’s house she’d been at when it happened for 2 days. 

This brings us to my current dilemma. My boyfriend and I are planning on moving in together. His lease is up at the end of March, and mine is up at the end of June. Originally, I had planned on staying at my current apartment until my lease was up at the end of June and he would move into our new place at the end of March. When we were looking at apartments, however, the only one we could find that we liked and could afford is on the opposite side of the city. It is also closer to both of my jobs. 

My roommate was not very happy for me when I told her I was moving in with my boyfriend several months ago (she had recently broken off a long term relationship and has a very skewed view of what a healthy relationship looks like b/c of her parents. She and her new boyfriend also mocked me and my boyfriend on Facebook in the comments when he made a mushy post about how he loved me, but that's a whole other story.) She has extreme abandonment issues that coincide with her anxiety, so obviously I was very anxious to tell her I am now considering moving in March. If my boyfriend and I move at the same time, we can split a U-Haul, I’ll be closer to both of my jobs, and now my cats won’t continue to bully her cat (which is a big problem we have. So much hissing.) My boyfriend and I had already come up with a plan where he is going to cover the rent of the new apartment for the first few months so I can keep paying my rent at my current place until my lease is up. I was very clear about this to my roommate when I first talked to her about my boyfriend and I getting our own place. 

I waited to tell my roommate that my boyfriend and I found a place until we signed the lease because I wanted to make sure everything was set in stone. I tried for about a week to find a time that she and I were both home and she wasn’t sleeping for me to talk to her about the possibility of me moving out early. There was only one day that she and I were home at the same time that week, and she fell asleep within an hour of me being home (during which time I was doing my workout and making dinner) so I gave up and decided to send her a message with my plans. I carefully drafted a message to her in which I told her that my boyfriend and I found a new place, and gave her a list of pros and cons to me moving out March 30 as opposed to when our lease is up at the end of June. The only con was that I wouldn’t be around to take care of her cat, and I didn’t want her to feel like I was abandoning her or didn't want to be her friend anymore. 

She freaked out. Apparently, she had this massive panic attack on campus, which is 100% why I was terrified to tell her. In my message I reiterated that I was definitely going to be paying the rent until the end of the lease, I would continue paying for her internet, and I was even still willing to pay my half of the utilities (which is about 10-11$ more a month). She refused to come home for 2 days while she “processed” what I proposed. I told her that if she really wanted me to stay, I would. 

When she finally came home, the first thing she said to me was “I really wish you wouldn't.” She doesn’t want me to move out because she’s not doing well mentally and doesn’t want to live alone. She also sees me wanting to move out early as a betrayal because I made a commitment when I signed our lease to live together for a year. I completely understand her logic, but I feel like I can’t continue putting my own mental health at risk to try to take care of hers. Further, I don’t know if it’s fair that I should have to put off my future, spend more money in moving and on my commute to work, because she doesn’t want to live alone. She also seems to not believe that I will continue to pay the rent once I’m gone, which is ridiculous because I was going to give her post-dated checks to pay for the rent, my name is still on the lease so my butt would be on the line regardless, and it’s an insult because I’m the one making sure our bills get paid and I have to remind her about our rent checks every month. My roommate also insinuated that my moving out early would mean that I’m throwing away our friendship, when all I’m trying to do is save it. We’re not friends anymore right now. We never see each other. When we do, she ends up falling asleep in her room, and we don’t ever hang out. I just want to go back to being friends, and I don’t think that will happen if I keep living here for 3 more months. I know I told her that I would stay if she wanted me to, but I honestly did not think she would ask me to. I honestly thought she would be happy; it’s not like I’ve been nice to her since we moved in. I’m constantly yelling at her about something she’s doing that’s annoying me. If I stay, I will definitely end up resenting her for it, but if I go, she will resent me and I might lose one of the few friends I have. 

Everything being said, I think that it would be best for my mental health if I moved out at the end of March. Plus, I think it would be best for her cat if she didn’t have to deal with my cats constantly bullying her (neither of us want kids, so our cats are essentially our kids. My cats are my #1 priority, so it’s also frustrating that she seems to be neglecting hers). I also am just really excited to move in with my boyfriend. I'm really in love with him, he's really good for my mental health, and I see a long and happy future for us. This is the first thing I've been excited about in a really long time. I just don’t know if I should put my own needs aside and stay to try to protect her mental health. I honestly have no idea what to do, and I need to figure it out fast. If I’m going to be moving in less than 6 weeks, I need to make plans now. 

What should I do??",24Feb2019,1

Fast forward a few weeks and she got me a signed poster of him and it is framed. I'm very thankful, but I just feel weird because I don't really care about it. It doesn't have much value for me.  Is it bad if I sell it? It is authentic.

504,"I love her with all of my being, and she loves me back, but she is having a meltdown about her career. She intended to graduate with a PhD and then get a nice job. However she can't seem to complete the work for the degree and failed all her job interviews. The little income she had vaporized. She has few contacts and doesn't network much at all.

So now she is in a panic about our marriage and has become convinced that a divorce will suddenly grant her everything she needs and allow her to apply for a job and get it anywhere. She used to be more open to many other career fields, maybe she can Teach? She knows Programming, she is a skilled Economist.

I'm to understand that not everyone gets a job straight out of college. But she is now focused on just one job title her degree could get, doesn't yet have that degree completed.

But what makes it hard is she has sequestered herself in her on-college apartment. (We were to move in just recently, but she wanted to stay near her contacts at school to improve her chances of getting a job). I keep asking her to take breaks, and let me help her, but it is no go. She even says she will be busy every weekend for months.

I don't quite know what is going on. She wants to be independent and strong and achieve her career, but she seems totally against letting her husband support her in her time of greatest need? And this might all be avoided if she wasn't in such a rush! How do I convince her to slow down and rely on me?

When i asked about her tight schedule last Tuesday she no longer wanted to work together, wants to work alone and stated she wanted to be alone. I asked if anything was wrong and she said no. So I complied and haven't spoken with her since Tuesday. Figured I'd give her a weekend to really focus on her work. But I want to rebreak the ice and help her.

506,"This person became internet famous/twitch streamer etc. and then got doxxed a while ago and 
had their address and stuff leaked, and probably got harassed a lot by trolls as a result.

So anyway, I was curious as to how doxxers can possibly find this stuff.
I started digging myself, and crap it's scary how easy it is.

So I just kept on digging and digging and finding even more stuff, I just couldn't stop because it was 
such an exhilarating rush finding clues, connecting dots and feeling like Sherlock Holmes.



They're internet famous and I was under their spell. (it's understandable)
I guess it started with noble intentions of just trying to help them delete stuff and 
protect them from all the doxxers/creepy stalkers, but in the 
process I basically became the full on creepy stalker myself that 
I was trying to defend against in order to find that stuff.



So anyway, safe to assume they'll want to delete some of this stuff and keep it private, based on the other stuff they also deleted, 
but I'm sure it can be handled better than just ""Oh, Hi there, here's some 
personal stuff I dug up by going through every single post and 
comment you made years ago, might wanna delete this one, 
this one, and this one here....but don't worry i'm really not a creepy stalker DERP DERP.""
Hopefully I can be more discreet and straight forward than this.


The Dox happened a while ago, so obviously it's not gonna be nice 
for them knowing that even now people are still digging 
through their stuff. But at the same time, they'll definitely appreciate the heads up that this info is still online.


My biggest fear is that the doxxers already found some of this 
stuff and used it to harass them, so the person
deleted the stuff they could find, and now i'm just finding the left over remnants of information they forgot about.


Inevitably, the message will have to be some variant of ""DERP DERP hey look i found this by reading through your entire accounts like only a stalker would do.""

Pennywise (Moneywise?), I think it will not be a problem. My parents are not rich, but the German government supports these things, with something called ""BAFÖG"". In addition to that, my grandparents invested especially for that into funds.

The problem rather is that I do not have a clue what to do. There are so many services, deals and conditions for sth. that I am more or less lost. What would you recommend me?

About two years ago I started a new job and met this girl who I absolutely fell inlove with. She's so beautiful and talented and kind. I was so nervous around her that I actually tried to avoid her for a long time. I always told myself that I shouldn't be with someone, I'm horrible at romance and I know I could never treat a woman right, especially one like her.
About four months ago she actually started talking to me and we just kept going from there and eventually we fell inlove. She told me she's been interested in me for a long time two, but she's been in a bad spot (can't get into specifics about it) that was keeping her from talking to me or anyone else for that matter. I was able to help her out of it and she's so much happier now. We're finally together but one issue has cropped up. She's really big on missing persons cases and I'm not really the biggest nut about them. I kinda pretended to be interested because it made her so happy to talk to someone about it. However today she called me out on it and it's made me feel like crap. She told me ""it's just a pipe dream to have a lover who was intrested"".

I will gladly answer a few of his questions if he's curious, but there's a reason why our boss has us on separate ends of the office, and if anything, I will end up doing some of his type of work later on, while he will never, ever be doing any of mine. He also insisted on adding me to the messenger even though we do not work together. 

I'm sorry if I am coming off as though I'm superior, but I'm not. Maybe he doesn't take me seriously because I'm a woman, or maybe he's thinking about development. Or maybe I'm a bit too introverted. But I'm pretty good at reading people and so I just think he's nosey and obnoxious. He's middle aged, by the way. How to tell him to back off, please?",24Feb2019,1
520,"There’s a TL;DR at the bottom. Sorry if this isn’t written well, I think this is only my second post on reddit. Also this is really long but I would really appreciate help. My mother and I are at a loss of what to do and it’s really effecting my family.

Me (20F), middle brother (22) and oldest brother (24) all still live at my parents house. My oldest brother has always been different. Me, my mom and my middle brother think he has high functioning Aspergers but my dad flat out refuses to believe there’s anything wrong with a son of his and will not have him get evaluated and get the help he clearly needs. 

Oldest brother has always struggled with adderall. Like, seriously addicted. He never left the house, stayed up all night playing video games raging on stimulants, lost a ton of weight, had zero relationship with any of us, didn’t eat, had thousands of dollars in dental bills because he never took care of himself, etc. The whole time of his addiction my dad was very hateful towards him, not supportive and didn’t help him in any way and a few times almost physically hit him because they could barely talk without fighting.

A couple of years ago my brother made a realization he didn’t like stimulants anymore and flushed his pills down the toilet, got a job which he excels in, his drivers license, his first girlfriend, gained weight, just really cleaned up his life and became close with my family again and me for the first time in my life.

He recently started going to school for electronic engineering, my dad convinced him to do it. Sure enough, he got an adderall prescription again. I know his girlfriend sometimes gives him adderall but he was really good at taking it sparingly around once a month. Now he’s taking it everyday again, going back to old habits completely. He’s lost a bunch of weight and is clearly struggling again but won’t talk to any of us about it. My mom and I think he’s overwhelmed by the class and doesn’t want to do it anymore, but if he drops out of the class he won’t get any love from my dad. Sadly, him taking this class is the only support and love my dad shows him. Otherwise they have no relationship except my dad looking down on him. And my brother knows this. My father blames him for everything and ridicules my mother when she says he needs help. My dad blames my oldest brothers behaviors on my mom and says she failed him as a parent and didn’t discipline him enough. He takes zero responsibility in his own parenting and says he’s now given up and wants nothing to do with parenting him anymore. He is in denial that my brother has a clear mental issue that is not getting recognized. My dad is becoming hateful and neglectful towards him again. 

It completely breaks my heart because my father is very loving towards me, his youngest and only daughter. I’m 34 weeks pregnant and he’s been there for me and so happy and excited for this baby, doing everything he can for me and my boyfriend. He’s also very loving and cherishes my middle brother, who is an even worse drug addict than my oldest brother. He stole 90 of my moms pain pills in less than a month last week, cleaning out the whole bottle. My mother and I found out after I got permission from my OB to take a couple when I had really bad migraine and kidney pain. I got my moms medicine bag and found that nothing was in it. He heard none of this from my dad (my dad was the first one we told) and within the same day my dad gave him some adderall. 

My dad completely enables middle brother and gives HIM adderall (I used to be prescribed adderall since I was 11 yrs old, when I found out I was pregnant I had a big bottle of 60 30mg pills that I gave to my mom to keep because I didn’t need them anymore. My dad gives them to middle brother and I suppose takes some for himself) even though middle brother has a vyvanse prescription he runs out of within a week every time. He steals all of our pills, he even would raid my room when I wasn’t home for Xanax pills I was prescribed for anxiety, leaving me with nothing to take when I would have panic attacks. We all have to hide our pills from him because he will without fail steal them the minute we leave the house. There’s much more he does but I don’t want this to be even longer than it already is. None of this phases my dad and he still treats middle brother like a prince.

It stresses me out a lot knowing my oldest brother is struggling so much and having clear favoritism shoved in his face everyday. It is very hard to be happy when I know he’s struggling and I have no idea how to help. I guess I don’t exactly know what advice I’m asking for, just how to handle this and how to help my brother. My family is refusing to go to counseling and will not take any steps to fix this. I’m scared my brother will end up hurting himself somehow. Please help..

TL;DR- my oldest brother is addicted to adderall and is neglected by my father, while my middle brother is a much worse drug addict that my dad fully enables. Seeing my oldest brother struggling is becoming too much for me and my mom and we don’t know how to help him. Scared he will end up hurting himself.",24Feb2019,2
521,"I was recently broken up with by a girl who is the closest to perfect that I’ve ever known. We didn’t date all that long, but I fell for her really quickly and really hard. She was everything I wanted in a girlfriend, and the happiest I’ve been was when we were together.

523,"To start I’m a 19 year old with a 1.5 year old son. I do NOT live in the home. My mom has been with this man let’s call him Jay for almost a year now as of March. In the beginning he seemed really cool but he really bothered me for reasons I couldn’t put a finger on. He got really close to her made it to the point she loved the dude and ever since caution went to the wind and abuse has been in the works. It started with my mom coming home with a bruise on her leg that he “knew was a hickey” so he punched her in the leg to cover the supposed hickey with a bunch of black bruises. Then my 17 yo brother ticked him off because his friend told him that Jay tried to buy drugs from him or asked where he could and my mom talk to Jay about it so Jay beat my brother up and spent a week in jail and MY MOM DIDN’T PRESS CHARGES AND SHE VISITED HIM FOUR TIMES. The Stockholm Syndrome is strong here you guys. She has threatened to leave him and he lashes out, he threatens her friends, he threatens to tell her work she smokes weed after she gets home, he threatens all kinds of shit. He does all the above all the time. He changed her Facebook password, he deletes people from her page, he got mad she spent two hours with my son and I at a sushi place and accused her of cheating on him in the middle of the restaurant. And many more things have happened. The man even told her he’s afraid to be around her because of what he might do. He’s completely psychotic. He believe it is a significant others right to have sex with his woman despite her saying no o being injured in any manner including canner of the vagina like my mother’s friend has(an actual conversation we had on MOTHERS DAY- which my mom paid for everyone’s meal and he just gave her this disgusting Cheshire look and did not even thank her)!!!

I'd worked it for a year at the time of quitting and it was my first proper job, because of my newness to the whole working thing I was a bit of a pushover and was delegated the shit jobs as a result, after a particularly bad shift I decided I was done here. I wrote my letter of resignation went to the bus station so I could head over to give it in.

This is where my latent social anxiety kicks in. I don't suffer heavily I'm actually quite an outgoing person but when I get nervous I tend to let the panic autopilot take over. Basically as the bus pulled up I just walked away and went to just hang out in town to quell my fear. My next shift rolls around and I just don't show I got a missed call from work and a text from one of my bosses on facebook, but that's it nothing from them since. (this was about 2 days ago) I know I've gone around this the wrong way but I just can't think of a way to rectify this. Any Ideas?

532,"Best friends for 3 years. Together for 2 years. She had schizophrenia and borderline.

She would also do pretty much everything other people said. She was so lonely, that she just wanted other people to finally like her. So she did a lot of stupid shit.

All her ""friends"" were junkies and just pretty much losers. Like 35 and jobless, still living with their parents. (We are 20)

3 months ago she broke up and I'm still worried about her. A few of her 35 year old male friends made it really obvious during the relationship that they are only interested in her sexually. They would like text her every few months just to ask if she still has a boyfriend and if she said yes they would ignore her for another 4 or 5 months.

So I never made this connection. But guess what is happening now ?

She is single now so they are interested. They are all junkies. She does almost everything to keep friends as friends. She is too naive to understand that they are only using her.

So guess who is now talking her into starting to take drugs so they can take advantage of her ? Besides that, the drugs will most likely make her schizophrenia way worse and fuck up her life, but these ""friends"" of course don't care about that. They only want to have sex with her.

I never was in a situation like this. I can't do anything to protect her. I have no power over her or the guys that will do that to her. I can't even contact her because she would just block me.

1.  Not aware of task or surrounding; not as 'focussed'
      As a child, I used to be pretty focussed on what J was doing and why, allowing me to get good results. Recently, I feel my attention span shortening and, as a result, my interests shifting to short term pleasures like binge watching, etc rather than books and learning. 

   I am constantly flitting between the future or the past, or some imagined scenario, leading both my work and personal life to worsen.


2. Obnoxiousness
     I have always been slightly eccentric and specific about rules, but have recently noted a meteoric rise in the number of negative comments and corrections I am making at work. I but into conversations that have nothing to do with me and end up hurt or hurting others.


3. Unable to focus on my goals
     I am constantly distracted by work that will not help me reach my goals. And as soon as I try to take up a task that will, I immediately face a chasm, sort of a force that holds me back or lowers my motivation. 

4. Procrastinating self work
     i am good when working with others and jump into action pretty quickly, but where I need to answer to myself and work alone, I keep putting off things and procrastinating. 


Advise on how I can work to address any of the above issues would be much appreciated.

  I am depressed because my life is devoid of all substance. I have a girlfriend, who loves me very much. She depends on me too, for happiness. I have a dog and cat. Their love requires that you feed them and take them out so much that you base your fucking existence around it. But I have no friends. My best friend since 8th grade has shunned me from existence because I guess he wants to be an adult and move on with life. I am the phase that’s over and done with. Consequently, since he’s the control freak of the pack, none of his friends want to hang out with me any more. I’m the undesirable. Not even my girlfriend feels like my friend. She feels more like a responsibility. I can’t fail her. She gets mad and frustrated every time I’m down. Which I can completely understand. She gets depressed because she feels like she isn’t pretty enough for me. The nightmare reality is, I have a hard time finding myself genuinely attracted to her. I always tell her she’s beautiful though.
     Porn is the only thing that really makes me feel alive for about 30 seconds of my day. I’m addicted to it. Not because I’m horny, but because I’m horny and lonely as fuck.
    I’m trying to go back to school. I’m trying to get a job at Lowe’s so I can pay for my bullshit existence. I’m even trying to become a writer. A dream I can never let go of. 
    Sometimes I wonder if it’s my relationship that’s subconsciously fucking my mind.  I feel like I can’t break up with my girlfriend for the following reasons. 1. I depend on her, and she depends on me. 2. We love each-other. I truly love and care for her. Does she sweep me off my feet? No. 3. It will literally kill her. If I break up with her, there’s a solid chance she will try to kill herself. 4. One day I feel like I can’t live without her, and the next I feel like i need to get away. 5. It might kill me, and I might live to regret it for the rest of my days. 6. I enjoy spending time with her. 
      I know existence is meaningful. I believe in God and I’ve been researching a lot of DMT experiences lately. I know life is more than this. But I can’t help feeling trapped in my own dull pinpoint existence. 
At this point I’ve tried everything. And no, I can’t afford talk therapy. I’m on antidepressants too. They worked for a while but these are issues with life, not depression without cause. Anything you guys say to try to help is appreciated. Thanks for reading.",24Feb2019,1

549,"For backstory, my mother left me at a public plaza with no warning when I was 18. Since then every time I try to forgive and move past she keeps hurting me. I went NC after she attacked me for my abortion. I live with my abusive inlaws.

Yesterday my SO and I were eating out. I was running out of battery and needed to have a photo, so I sent it to him and tried to get him to open his messages and see if he got it. To my surprise, he kept turning the phone, hiding it from my view and refusing to show me the messages. He said ""sometimes I need to be able to surprise you"" and hugged me telling me he could never be attracted to anyone else. Okay, fine. I don't get cheating vibes from him...plus for some reason my mind instantly jumped to my NM. Fine, maybe he's trying to bring me back with her because he's seen me cry my heart out wishing I had a mother to turn to. F'd up, but I can live with that.

That night I found his phone unlocked and snooped while he slept. To my shock, I found the following messages between him and her:

NM: Hello!
BF: Hello :)
NM: It's good that we're in contact again
BF: Yes
BF: I hope to see you soon
NM: Yes, me too
NM: I hope sometime in the week
NM: It's been a while since we were going to get together, since before that thing with my mother in law
BF: Yes, I'd like to talk to you in person too but alone, I hope you don't mind
NM: Of course, I understand. I don't mind.
NM: There's a café nearby so I don't have to worry too much about (my younger sister)
BF: Well we'll see on that day
NM: Hey I have some good news for you, that makes me very happy :)
BF: ?
NM: The lump I had on my breast didn't need surgery 🌷
NM: I finally got a doctor, praise God

NM: Thank you (BF), my daughters are so little and they need me 💕 it's my privilege to be with them
BF: Yes I know
NM: Well I have to run for (other younger sister), I'll send you a kiss and we'll stay in contact 😘🤗
BF: All right take care
BF: See you
BF: Let me know
BF: Hey hehehe can I ask you something. If you don't mind? Hehehe 😅 as I told you everything got deleted off my phone and I can't see anything on your profile, and it's been a while since I saw you. Would you send me a photo of yourself? :)
BF: To put on your contact :) or would you take a photo of yourself as you are now hehehe 😅 It doesn't matter
BF: Or if you can't it doesn't matter
BF: Nestriel doesn't have any of you anymore :/
NM: Oki, I'll send you one. But take care of me eh?
NM: You send me one too to put on your contact. :)
BF: ;) of course
NM: *sends pic*
BF: 😱😜☺😃
BF: Whoa hehe
BF: I'm on my way to work
NM: ?
BF: Good night later when I can I'll send you one of mine
NM: All right 🤗😘
BF: Take care
NM: Take care, God bless you 🙋
BF: Thanks we'll keep in touch
NM: Didn't you like my photo? ;)
BF: Yes you're very photogenic.
NM: :) Thanks.

That was all. He consistently used the formal way of saying ""you"", vs she using the informal way, if that makes a difference? (I translated from Spanish). The photo was just one of her face, nothing inappropriate. He did not contact her again after that, and did not send one of his own.

Later he asked me if I would consider reinitiating contact with my NMom, if she were to seek me out. I said no.

I told him this morning, that I couldn't stop thinking about what he said. I told him that no, I want nothing to do with my mother. I asked him straight up if he was talking to her and he denied it.

I ran outside to the old football court to have a good cry and called my grandma bawling. She's the only family I have and she lives half a world away. My fiance came running frantically, asking why I didn't tell him where I'd gone. We live in a dangerous area so he's always super careful of me. He held me as I cried. I told him it was because I can't take living with his abusive mother. He told me he always does her bidding to try and get her to focus on him and leave me alone, and it works. He said he will always love and protect me and that he is working hard to try to get us out of here. I didn't say anything more but he kept asking if I was angry at him, if I still wanted to be with him and if I believed him. Saying that he's been with me two years and nobody else would want a balding overweight guy like him. That I'm beautiful and he'll always love me. That he thought my mother is still family, even after all she's done, and that he could tell I needed a mother in my life...that she'll regret her actions one day. I told him not to speak of her and he agreed and apologized saying there is no reason for either of us to stay in contact with her. It wasn't a half assed apology either, it sounded sincere. I know that he feels the same about his mother, that one day she will stop berating him and love him. I did not tell him I'd seen the messages.

His manner towards me hasn't changed. He is as careful and loving of me as he's ever been. Unless I'm going with a friend, he'll drop whatever he's doing to accompany me to wherever I'm going, because he is afraid for me to be alone in such a dangerous city. When I leave work and he is at work and can't accompany me, he calls me to make sure I'm OK. On his days off he goes to my work to pick me up and bring me back. He's always checking on my mental and physical well being, making sure I eat despite my anxiety, helping me to care for my multiple pets. He doesn't talk to other girls, hardly even looks at much hotter girls than I when we're out. He doesn't drink, doesn't party, hardly leaves the house when I'm not there, except to buy food and litter for our dogs and cats. But he is talking to my mother, and the tone of it just seems too...friendly to me. Am I crazy?

My mother is prone to oversharing. He was the first to realize I needed to go NC and he would tell me she kept inviting him out for coffee (which I saw) and he kept letting her down easy (which I also saw). He was angry she would lie about me and try to make him believe the lies...I live with him, she doesn't soooo that backfired.

Even now, that I've seen the messages...Somehow something still doesn't feel right. Like there's something I'm missing. Like...I can tell he cares. I am going to contact my boss and let her know the situation (she is also a friend of mine) so that she will let me off on the day they meet, and I can show up and listen in incognito. But in the meantime I'm in an agony of indecision. 

What's your take on this? Please give me your honest opinion and don't just say he's bad...I need to know what exactly is going on here and why...Almost three years together and we have plans to get married, he's always protecting me...I feel...Loved. In a way I never did with my mother. She would say she loved me but I knew she didn't really mean it. With my bf I feel like a person, not an annoyance or inconvenience. When I don't have a job he will unquestioningly pay for anything I need and always be on the lookout for my health even before his own, and never bring it up. He tells me to take anything I need. But when it's money I earned, he always asks before taking any. He always helps with housework without me having to ask him, we make such a good team. I love him, I do, but I don't know how, or if, to bring this up. I'll feel awful if he's just saying whatever to avoid confrontation, or if he has some specific reason for it, and I go in guns blazing.

The messages are from day before yesterday, no contact since. He does not have her number added in contacts.

551,"I'm a pretty agreeable guy. And I usually get along with everyone I meet. Those I don't connect well with I disassociate myself at the very beginning. I'm a sophomore in college and I live in an apartment with 3 friends. Two of them I was very close with at the beginning of the year, the third one we're on good terms and friendly with each other. At first I thought the four of us would get along quite well since we have the same standards for cleanliness, we like to go out to eat or cook dinner together, we share similar interests. And overall I'd say we're pretty good as roommates go.

Our policies on coexisting are good. We respect each other's space, property, we keep a good noise level at night, etc. But I'm starting to understand the whole ""you never truly know someone unless you live with them"". At first I thought they meant like, whether they do the dishes or take out the trash. But I realized it's also personality.

The two friends I'm close with are gradually rubbing at me the wrong way. They're both White; I'm Korean/Japanese. I'm pretty white-washed but my culture and upbringing was a mix of both Asian and American. My mother raised me with a focus on allowing me to learn from my own mistakes, but also making sure I develop proper social graces, etiquette, mannerisms and how to conduct myself in public and whatnot, which I'm thankful for. Admittedly I'm mildly uptight. I'm not a complete goody goody though; I can loosen up and have a good time.

Here are a few things that currently have been causing a buildup of resentment towards my housemates, but there are way more:
- They made fun of me for eating an instant noodle snack saying that it's stupid to eat uncooked noodles (having never seen any asian snacks in their life). Even though it was clearly a snack intended to be eaten that way.
- When we went out to eat, I said ""we'll go dutch"" and one of the two looked at me like they've never heard of that saying before and that it's not ""normal"".
- I was mocked at for wanting to take a picture with the group one night out. And it wasn't because they didn't want pictures taken of them, but rather they said, ""why would you take pictures if you're never going to look at them?"" not understanding that I just wanted a keepsake for sentimental values.

I can agree to disagree, and I'm very compromising. But it's not that they don't agree with my life but rather they make fun of me because of it. One time when I cooked curry for the house, I like to dip my rice into the curry, whereas the other way to eat it is to mix it all together, and they called me weird for that. It's the calling me weird part that bothers me.

Anyway, I can feel resentment building up inside me towards them due to their insensitivity. To them, the things I do/my demeanor/my behavior is abnormal, and that normal people don't act like that. What's even more annoying is that one of them is undergoing gender transformation and is getting really uptight about how we should address them in public and what is considered rude or dehumanizing and stuff. Yet they're constantly making fun of me for the way I live and the way I am.

I went to bed last night with all the bad things they've said to me echoing in my head. I kept trying to tell myself they're not malicious people and they're just memeing around, and to just loosen up. But I can't anymore. It's starting to be very hurtful. Spring semester ends in about 2 months so I can stay with them a little longer. But how do I get rid of this indignation inside me? I dislike grudges and negative feelings towards people. I like them, I feel like they mean well and that they're just having a good time. And while I can call them out for being an asshole sometimes, I don't want to because I don't want to damage the friendship we already have. They're good housemates, but sometimes they don't realize when they're hitting a nerve. Am I being too sensitive or are they in the wrong? I don't know. But I just want to get rid of these feelings I have for them. I respect them and understand that they have their own problems and hardships in life. And we really do get along. Cracks are just starting to form though, and idk if I'm the one overreacting or if they're the ones crossing the line.",24Feb2019,1
552,"I (f23) work at a group home for intellectually impaired adults. A coworker of mine (m25) who I almost slept with once after a breakup, drunk (luckily, a friend helped me out and stopped me) and my boss’ daughter-in-law (f32) are banging. 

Dude doesn’t know that I know, because he made her promise not to tell anyone. So of course, she bragged to me about it. 

I’m so bothered... because the guy always talks about banging married chicks, and although I’m not his parent, I’ve chastised him for it before. And the married woman? She apparently just cheats on her partners all the time. So... 🤷‍♀️

But I’m “friends” with them, at least at work. I have no respect for either of these people, but we’re “friends.” I genuinely like talking to the married woman, although I hate what she’s doing. Dude is a complete ass, though. 

It’s just... knowing about it had made work awkward as hell. Especially if the three of us are talking to our BOSS. Fucking weird. 

Ugh... what do I do? Nothing? Just... pretend I never heard it? I haven’t told anyone, I don’t think it’s my place to do so anyway. But I’m also terrible and sort of hope that people find out. I know the dude would be particularly upset if he knew she told me, because he has a crush on me (I’m in a relationship though, and the only chance this gross nasty dude ever had with me was when I was drunk and heartbroken... and it wouldn’t have happened again).

554,"Basically, there's this infamous scammer from the UK with a 22+ year track record who claims to have a biologically impossible medical condition for which there's no medical literature on. She deleted her Reddit account after she got called out by a bunch of people who pointed out how ridiculous her alleged condition was. r/subredditdrama captured it nicely - https://reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/a83gbv/outbreak_in_mfwtk_when_a_woman_who_is_allergic_to/

Before her account was deleted, she was spamming Reddit with her scam.

She has dozens of aliases, ranging from a 50 year old woman to a 19 year old girl.. All of her aliases are from the UK. She has been doing this for 22+ years and gullible news websites constantly run articles on her, which gives her an opportunity to receive ''donations'' for this ultra rare medicine from Sweden since ''thieves'' keep breaking into her house to steal just the medicine and nothing else. Her family have boasted about receiving donations for her when she was a child. I always can tell whether one of these aliases is her since the story is 100% the same, and she ALWAYS includes this little contradiction which debunks her claim outright.

Her latest scamming tactic is that she's now apparently wrote a book all about herself and her fake condition that she's now looking to publish to draw in more money.

What makes her more of a dick is the fact she's using the name of a real condition, but her symptoms and etiology are completely fantastical and not how the real condition works as pointed out by other Redditors in the thread I linked to.

She also names an immunologist as diagnosing her, but this immunologist never worked at the hospital she claims to have went to, nor did this immunologist write up anything about her nobel prize worthy 'condition'.",24Feb2019,1

One of my friends does art in his free time. It's mainly pencil drawings. He posts a new drawing around twice a month some of these are really good high-quality drawing and some are quick looking sketches or just ok drawings. He recently ""drew"" 2 very high-quality pictures of Clint Eastwood and posted them on Instagram. He said he drew it because he knows this old man and his wife's favorite movie was the good the bad and the ugly. The old man's wife passed away and he drew the picture for him and is gonna frame it and give it for free. I thought it was really cool and nice of him to do that and so did my other friends. I then reverse google searched the image call it the cynic in me but this was way better than all his previous work. The image came up on a deviant art account from 3 years ago with only 50 followers. IDK if this old man exists. I then started investigating his other works. Some images he drew around half of them and the ones he drew are still decent but not as good as the stolen ones. He has also given framed laminated birthday presents of stolen work. I don't think he sold any stolen work but he has definitely given it out for free under the impression it is his. He also does sell his art but from what I know the ones he sold are his own drawings and you can pay him to draw something.

561,"I currently work for a very famous, reputable company with great chances to progress. However, I’m currently stuck in a part of the company doing an awful, boring, stressful customer service job. I’ve hit a glass ceiling in my specific department and the only choice I’m left with is to quit or stick it out until I can progress (I’ve already been knocked back for one promotion, although I received only positive feedback from my interview). 

My father is a self-employed stone mason / labourer and earns in a week what I earn in a month. He has spoken to me and said that as I’m still young by manual labourer standards (21), he really encourages me to get into the trade now, and he says that within a few years I could be a qualified bricklayer making big $$$. 

However, this would make such a change from my current job, that, despite it being awful, is very comfortable (good salary by customer service standards and I’ve got lots of experience in customer service so know what I’m doing). 

Quitting and working for my Dad would be a huge change - no salary (paid hourly), exhausting, tough work, would be starting from scratch. But on the other hand - consistent Monday - Friday job instead of the hectic schedule I have, I wouldn’t have to deal with customers any longer, and in a few years I could have the experience and qualifications needed to earn much more money than my current office job. 

What should I do? This has been eating me up for the past month and I’m so lost in my life right now. The stress and anxiety that’s crushing me daily while I’m stuck in my current job is awful, but I know that if I stuck it out for just a bit longer I can progress in the company.

562,"I'm 19 and live with my mum. She is my only friend, and I'm not exaggerating. So when I have problem or am upset and need to talk, she is my only option. Except she usually just makes things worse. 

Today for example, I wake up already in a bad mood. Stuff from yesterday, bad dreams, headache, you know small things that just build up the stress. Then, going on reddit, someone has called me a name over a differing opinion. Its nothing, It happens all the time to everyone, but for some reason, waking up to being called these horrible things is what pushed me from just stressed mode to crying mode. So I go to my mum. 
Her response is to just rant about the issue I had commented on, going on and on in her angry way saying how I was right and I should have tore into them blah blah. 

I dont get into debates like that, I hate it, I avoid it, because debating on a subreddit with some stranger is pointless? Anyway, I tell her, this isn't helping. You're upsetting me more by getting angry. She keeps going. This happens twice more.
Finally, i can get in a word and tell her, I'm not upset about that, I dont care about that, its x,y and z and I just need you to comfort me because I'm not having a good day.
'So you're crying because you got called a name??' she says, rolling her eyes. 

And she just leaves. Because her idea of comforting is just business as usual and God forbid she ever ends up coddling an emotional snowflake. So I go back to my room, now upset because once again I'm reminded that this dysfunctional human is the only person I have to talk to.

So I watch this girl for the whole night and managed to take a picture of her and send it to my parents who say it's definitely 100% not her and also how they're concerned out I can possibly mix these two women up.

572,"For a bit of background, my immediate family is from Philadelphia originally. My mom and dad were married for almost 14 years when it was found out that my dad cheated on my mom for almost 7 years of this relationship. My mom made it known she wanted full custody of me and my two siblings, but would give up everything else. My dad went to live with his parents and became very physically, emotionally, and sexually abusive towards my two sisters and I. 

Currently, it’s been over 7 years since we last saw or heard from him. We moved states to live with our grandparents and take care of them. 

My mom still searches my dads name on fb, talks about how much of a POS he is, and just continues to rehash old wounds. My middle sister thinks she is “enlightened “ about the entire experience because she forgave him. However, she still texts him and proceeds to tell my mom, making my mom upset and getting the cycle going again. The youngest sister has come out as trans, but I suspect it’s more of a deflection so she doesn’t have to rehash the memories since she got the worst of the sexual abuse. 

I know I’m not perfect and have flaws/ issues that stem from this time in my life. I’m just actively trying to move forward and carve my own path. My father made it very known he didn’t want me, my siblings, or my mother in his life and that’s ok with me. 

I don’t know how to get them to stop reopening these wounds since they all refuse to go to therapy and all refuse to not talk about it. I just find it draining to keep talking about it, but not do anything to fix the problem. Any advice?

573,Argggh. This annoys me. It mainly happens with family. But also happens with friends. I just don’t like the whole banter thing. I like to tease sometimes but literally not as a regular thing. Me and my gf do it but I feel like it’s more of a mutual thing. I wouldn’t consider myself as being “bullied”. It’s not even like the words hurt me. My sister is very bossy and domineering and probably more so to me because she’s my sister. She is a leader socially and is very successful. I am definitely not successful and not much of a people person. I can handle my sister occasionally taking the piss although her words can seem a bit harsh sometimes. She can also feel like she constantly knows what’s best for me or just act like I’m some sort of “annoying little brother”. It’s mainly my brother in law who I don’t like taking the mick. I don’t really feel comfortable around him for some reason like he’s not intimidating but although he’s been with my sister for over 10 years I don’t feel like we’re particularly close. We do get on though. But sometimes he’ll take the mick and I just have nothing to say back to him. Like I don’t feel comfortable taking the piss out of him because I don’t feel close to him. I would happily tease my sister but again I don’t really have anything funny or insulting to say. Me and my sister will often tease other family members behind their back but when it comes to me all the jokes seem to be directed at me. Or they make out like I’m useless or pathetic but in a light hearted way. It just annoys me the cheekiness of their behaviour. The words don’t often hurt me but it’s like why me?

I mainly meet on a 1 to 1 basis and there’s no particular banter but when there’s 3-4+ the jokes can start or I’ll at least feel excluded in one way or another.

574," 

I had recently had a mutual breakup with my girlfriend of over 5 years. We have been consistently fighting about her personal finances as both herself and her family have always been bad at saving money.

I work in finance and have always been very good at saving money and being future oriented. My girlfriend has always been the person to look for short term happiness whether it be spending a lot eating our or just not having much consideration for where her money goes.

When she graduated from undergraduate she had a 9 month hiatus before going to Chiropractic in which I had talked to her about creating a budget plan that would help her save at least enough to cover some housing for her first year and other surprise expenses such as her car which had just recently broke down. After 9 months she ended up with next to no money saved and doesn’t pay any bills as she lived at home.

It has been a constant fight and I realize that I’m a bit on the extreme side of things when it comes to saving but she has not made what looks like a legitimate effort to try and save and be more prudent with her spending/money. It really sucks because she is an amazing women in every other way. She’s the most supportive and loving person I know and a strong Christian who has helped me consistently with my own faith. I don’t feel like I made the wrong decision to have a mutual breakup but I still fear that I may have made a mistake. She truly is an amazing person in every other regard but I feel like the financial stresses of her being around $250k in debt is a scary burden that would fall on me if we ever got married.

I’m afraid because her parents have had such a terrible marriage and are currently trying to work things out as the mom is/was a cereal cheater. My girlfriend has similar traits to her mom which scares me even more since I cannot stand her mom and would never want to be married to someone like that.

There’s also the concern that I may have become a jaded finance person who has lost touch of what’s important in life. I remember telling my dad I wanted to be a psychologist for most of my life but was often told that they don’t make money and that I would regret the decision. I hope I wasn’t projecting what my father had told me to my girlfriend.

575,"For the past 3 months I've been looking after a dog (3/4 y/o) of a couple I barely know.  The dog was a suprise gift (?!?) to his girlfriend. I've never met her because shortly after the dog was born she went on a trip to her home country and left the dog with her bf. Before she left, the dog got very little training. Because the bf had (and still has) no idea of dogs and barely finds time to look after him, he never trained him, didn't exercise with him and he even fed him human food all the time. As I recently found out the dog was soon after she left handed to someone in his family who treated the dog very badly and perhaps even hurt him. After the bf had the dog back he apparently asked me - a somewhat stranger - to look after the dog. I love dogs and agreed although it was a bit strange how much he trusted me with this. I soon realised how anxious the dog is towards people and other dogs because of his barking and shaking. He has problems eating dog food now and he fails to understand even simple rules at all. As time progressed I began to understand why this is. She came back from her trip but he shortly after that asked me again if I could look after the dogs. I thought he'd be at my place for a week or something but a few days ago I found out that his gf decided to go to England for an inturnship for 6 months. 

I've always felt like they don't have enough time and patience to look after a dog because they both work and live at home with parents that have no idea of dogs and are either allergic to them or just not a fan. Also I'm not sure how good their relationship is atm. Since I know that she will be away for another 6 months and realised that the people around treat the dog not as he should be treated and are not willing to train him I feel very bad for him and think it would be best to find him a new home. I told this to the bf who mentioned that his gf said something similar before she left. But he is not willing to give the dog away. He thinks he'll work it out... I don't know what to do now because I can't just let this dog go knowing that they don't take care of him but I can't convince him to give to dog away because he's too self-centered. Man...  this dog needs a loving home and not chaos on a daily :(.  (Btw. I can't talk to her because he won't give me her number.. ) What would you do? Thanks!",24Feb2019,1

577,"I (24 M)graduated with a degree in Finance &amp; Accounting. I never knew exactly what I wanted to do with it, but I ended up pursuing the CPA route per some advice from one of my professors. I did a couple Tax internships for a regional accounting firm during college. I didn’t mind the work but loved the firm and the people/culture, so I accepted an offer to start full-time in their tax dept. after I finished my 150 credit hours (needed to sit for CPA Exam). 

This past summer, I finished my 150 credit hours and passed the CPA Exam. A couple months before I started full-time in the fall, the Audit Director called and asked if I would be willing to start off in the audit department. I jumped at the opportunity because I loved the firm and sort of wanted to switch to audit anyways (tax is not for everyone). 

Fast forward to now. I am almost through busy season with about 6 months experience. I do not like my job and it’s meticulous nature. I’m not interested in 70 hour weeks 3-4 months out of the year. I’m also not interested in private accounting. I don’t want to work in accounting if it’s not public and I want to get out of public accounting entirely. I would like to do something more geared towards finance (potentially real estate/commercial mortgage) or even sales (a little worried about salary/job security here).

Here are my issues:
1. If I leave public accounting now, I will forfeit earning my CPA. You need 4000 supervised hours working under a CPA to receive the designation, regardless of if you’ve passed the exam (which I have). I’m only roughly 1/4th of the way there. I put a lot of work in so it’d be nice to get it to have something to show for it.
2. If I leave now, I’m worried potential employers will think I am not going to be committed. Working a job for under a year and leaving could make it seem like I will do the same in my next job.
3. If I wait to get my CPA before leaving, I feel as if it will be a waste of a year and a half I could be using to gain experience in a new career. This is especially true if I’m not even going to necessarily use my CPA designation.

Does anyone have advice for me going forward? 

TL;DR: Graduated w degree in finance/acct. Went public accounting route, hate it. Want to switch career.",24Feb2019,1
578,"I've been working at this job since September of last year and have been a loyal employee since the beginning. I had some family troubles at home about a month ago and the owner of the store's daughter offered to help my girlfriend and I get back on our feet. We were staying with them for about a week and was never approached about having to repay them for anything. I was in fact told that I wouldn't have to give anything back other than do extra work outside of the store. While I was there, the owner's daughter bought a phone for me, took my girlfriend and I out to eat, gave me clothes and reassured me again that I wouldn't have to give anything back. Eventually, I left their place but I'm still doing work outside of the store for them without pay and am basically being forced to. I've been putting forth a lot of work for them and the company and they're not doing anything else for me since I left.

When she bought me the phone, I put some money towards it so she wouldn't have to cover the whole cost by herself but now she's getting a refund for it.

580,"So I’m getting frustrated with my husband. He keeps opening credit cards and running up balances on them. If I had to guess I’d say he owes about $5,000. I am very debt averse.

Recently, although I shouldn’t have, we put a $1,300 plane ticket on my credit card for his sister to come to Florida from Argentina for 6 months on a visa. I was sick at the time and just wanted to get the stupid ticket booked so I booked it on my card. Afterwards I was upset because I thought about why on earth would a grown ass adult need us to do that for her? Supposedly she’ll be working in a nail salon and will pay us back but still.

My credit card balance stands at $1,793, and I’ll be paying off about $1,200 this month. It should be paid off by April.

My husband went out about six months ago and bought a $2,100 stereo by opening a Best Buy card. We are down now to a balance of $1,400. That was part of the $5,000 I estimated. 

We have joint bank accounts and my husband was also audited by the IRS so for the last 2 years our refund has gone to the IRS.

At what point do I throw in the towel with this? It’s hard because I only work part-time and I feel like there’s only so much I can say. But I don’t want us to get to the point where we’re only paying the mínimums on his debt.

581,"So about a year ago, my step dad passed down his 96 Pontiac Firebird. He handed it down after I made he effort to get my G1 (learners permit). The car has been sitting in our garage for 10 years. So as you could imagine, the car has issues. 

Being a pretty handy person and having knowledge on cars, I found the main issues. But from what he told me, there was just a bad fuel pump. That’s not the case. There’s a lot more that I found. For example, there’s a blown head gasket, bad power steering pump, back springs, bad brakes, oil leak, and a bunch of tiny things.

I’m only 18, I work full time, attend an online school. It doesn’t help that I make minimum wage. But the point is, I don’t have enough money to fix and maintain the car. Not to mention the insurance will be higher because it’s a sports car. The car itself won’t sell for a lot, I’d be lucky to get 1K. But I would be able to make more if I part the car, and sell the frame.

The thing is, he’s attached to the car. Left it sitting for 10 years, but he’s attached. I haven’t asked if I could sell it yet, because I know he’ll say no. I want to use the money I would get from the car, save money from work, and buy my own car. I just want a car that is cheap on insurance, and cheap to buy.

How should I tell him how I feel, and what I want to do with the car. I love he car, but I can’t afford to keep maintaining it, as it would for sure need more maintenance, and the parts for the car are expensive.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 \&amp;nbsp; 

&amp;#x200B;

My best friend for about the past year has become noticeably judgmental and rude- to myself and others. 

He talks behind others backs to me, he makes rude comments to myself and others, and has become very critical of my interests. For example, the other day I told him about how I started watching Umbrella Academy. I find the show a little dumb at times but really have enjoyed it. Instead of him saying the usual (or what was the usual)  ""Oh I will check it out"" or ""I don't really understand why people like it."" he started saying it was stupid for me and his other friends to watch it. 

&amp;#x200B;

 \&amp;nbsp;  

&amp;#x200B;

He also likes to judge my appearance, which I am insecure about and he knows that. He will say shit like anyone who likes me has low standards, or that my personality is unlikeable. He also sometimes snaps at people who disagree with him respectfully or something and gets really controlling. At first I thought he was just getting tired of me, but as I mentioned he also does it to other friends of his. 

&amp;#x200B;

 \&amp;nbsp; 

&amp;#x200B;

This also isn't the best friend I knew. He used to be kind and caring, and would listen to me ramble even if he wasn't into it. He would never say anything bad about me or others, hell he never even really insulted people he didn't like. He is starting to become a pretentious asshole. 

&amp;#x200B;

The hard part here is that hes pretty much my only actual friend, and I've been so close to him for so long. What do I do?

-Whenever I want to go somewhere to stay they try to guilt me into staying, like if I want to go to a friends I have to continuously ask until they say “go on to your friends I don’t care where you go anyway, I never get to see you and now you want to spend time with them?”

My life has been pretty wack since the start. Born with a  tumor, had it removed as a baby and it left a big ugly scar on my lower back. 

I was born in a poor family. My father was a drug addict and died when I was 15 due lung cancer. He was toxic and abusive. My mother has struggled with bipolar disorder and has been extremely emotionally abusive towards me since I was a little kid. No siblings. Growing up was tough, I had to survive my mothers behavior. Also struggling with back pain troubles my entire life.

Developed social anxiety and deep depression. Sat alone crying in my room until the age of 20. Met my boyfriend. He was my first kiss, first everything. We moved in together last year. He has been shady since the start. Secret meetups with other women and so on. But besides from this, he treats me right. 

The light in my life was my dog. I got her for my 8th birthday. She passed away a couple of weeks ago and it broke my soul. I don't want to be with my boyfriend anymore because he lies a lot and acts like it's all my mistake. He breaks me.

I don't have other family or friends. I am still in University but ruining my year. I never have the energy to follow classes. If I leave him - I am back to where I was.

A little back story if it helps, I tried attending online school back in like 2014-2015ish. I was taking some medical classes for Kaplan and was just having issues understanding my student loans so I looked into Kaplan and saw a bunch of people saying how Kaplan ripped them off, basically stealing their loans for a fake class/degree.

I realize now I made a mistake with how I dealt with this situation. 
Fast foward to now, I only have 1 bill in my name and have never had anything else to my name so my credit score is basically based off of this one bill and my student debt (I think, credit karma didn't show me anything about my bill) 
I get an email today from credit karma saying my score increased, I go look and it did, by 1. When I checked the changes it showed me my student loan amount had increased by like 18 bucks. Which confused me instantly. I don't understand why it would increase my score if my debt increased.

602," 

I'll try to keep this as short and sweet as possible, gonna post on a couple different subs to get different perspectives. I'm a 20 year old guy majoring in computer science and I'm halfway done with my degree. I came into college a psychology major but decided against it because I don't want to go through grad school and I realized now that my prospects of becoming a tenured professor are slim to none and I couldn't handle the debt and all of the hoops anyways. Since I gave up that dream, I was at a loss as to what to do since nothing else really interested me like psychology did. I considered nursing, but I decided against it, I don't want to deal with sick people or nasty shit (my sister has given me the horror stories). I considered teaching, but common core, insanely low wages, and all of the extra tacked on work that goes into being a teacher turned me off to the idea. I considered going into a lot of other degrees that I feel like I'd really, really love, like history, or english, or film / art, but none of those are practical and I come from a poor family so it's not really an option for me to waste my education on a liberal arts degree.

I decided to major in computer science and I absolutely fucking hate it. Don't get me wrong, I like computers (I built my own a few years ago), I find the internet fascinating, and I watched season 1 of Mr. Robot and thought it was kind of cool albeit a fight club ripoff (/s). But now as I take the classes, I'm starting to realize that I give absolutely zero shits about coding, I hate sitting down all day, I hate math, I hate algorithms, and if I have to stare at an IDE for the rest of my life I might actually blow my head off... But I'm at a loss as to what to do now. I'm already something like 10K in debt and if I don't graduate on time I'm looking at being more than 20K in debt for my bachelor's so I can't just major in some easy shit to say I have a degree because I somehow need to get a job to pay this off after this is all over. However, I'd literally rather go back to my old job at Walmart than have to program computers for the rest of eternity. I've found from working jobs in retail and in restaurants that I much more enjoy jobs that involve me actually doing things. I need a job that lets me move, work with a team, feel like I'm building or fixing something tangible, get into a flow state, and get my heart beating, unlike coding where it's just me sitting by myself, on my ass, under a fluorescent light bulb, cooking my eyes out staring at numbers, trying to make this impossibly complicated shit that I don't give a fuck about work somehow. It's unintuitive to me, I hate numbers, and most of my hobbies are sedentary (video games, painting, reading, guitar, etc.) so if I have to do a job that's incredibly inactive I'm probably going to end up a fatass neckbeard like all the other programmers I see around campus.

I've been thinking of switching to IT, since it's not as math-heavy and is more focused on the administrative, managerial, and hardware side of things as opposed to those people working on the ground floor making programs. I enjoy building and tinkering with computers so I think it'd be at least marginally up my alley compared to programming. I don't give a shit if it pays less, that's not what I'm here for, I'd be OK with just about any job that pays over 40K a year since I'm used to living on far less than that. I've also been thinking of just graduating, paying off my debts, and going into a trade. Whether it be welding, plumbing, electrician work, or what have you, I feel like even if it wouldn't be as ""cushy"" and ""nice"" as a desk job, it'd be more engaging, challenging, and fulfilling than being an office drone, at least for me. Not to mention, I play a lot of video games, so the idea of sitting in front of a computer for at least 40 hours a week kind of feels... wrong?

Any responses will be replied to and deeply appreciated. I need serious advice. I'm doing quite poorly in my classes and I'm not sure I can keep this up for much longer.

Do you ever wonder who put the hinkey in the hoopie? Who do you like better, Mr. Fuzzlemunchkins or William Shakespeare?  Who do you like better, Nicole Kidman or Fidel Castro?  Is your favorite letter seven? ... and on and on, with probably around 25 questions like that until I try to change the subject.  I usually answer the questions with ""I don't know"".  I think he's partially trying to be funny, partially trying to avoid awkward silences, and partly unable to think of other things.  If I change it to a normal subject he'll participate for a minute and then go back to his questions.

We're both 36 y/o males.  He has some undiagnosed mental disorder, probably Schizoaffective Disorder (doctors have been trying to diagnose him our whole lives).  He's fairly smart -- he's completed college but hasn't been able to hold job for 10+ years.  He lives with his parents, has a car, is on disability, and they also seem to give him around a $50 allowance a week to spend on eating out and buying supplies for his hiking hobby.  He wants to hang out every single weekend.  

I hadn't been in contact with him until about 2 years ago, and he aggressively pursued a close friendship (I know for a fact he's not gay).  We would text several times a day until maybe 6 months ago when it just got too much.  He still texts the same amount but I don't reply to most of them.

I don't know how to deal with it anymore.  I want to be his friend and be there for him, but it's just starting to make me angry with how often he texts, how often he wants to hang out whenever I'm not working, and how I feel guilty when I don't answer his texts or make up excuses for not hanging out.  I try to ignore most of them now.  I once tried to give him the hint by not answering for an entire month one time, but his mother asked my mother if there's something he said to me that offended me.  When I finally texted him ""hey what's up man"" the constant texting immediately resumed.  He's suicidal and if he hasn't seen me in person for a couple weeks he'll hug me and tell me how much he missed me.  I know it wouldn't be my fault if he killed himself (everyone says it's on them not on you) but in reality everyone knows it'd be devastating and lead to a life of self-questioning, ""what if I was a better friend"".

I don't know what to say or do that could help make the constant stream of random clingy texts abate.  It feels as though it's either ghost him completely or live the rest of my life constantly making excuses of why I can't hang out with him every single weekend.",24Feb2019,727
606,"Hey all!


So I'm a mid 20's former shy person. Instead of having fun in high school and college (commuter college btw), I played video games and stayed inside. Led to a great lack in social experience and a ton of frustration. Last few years I have been making a lot of progress. However I am still lacking experience in a lot of things, specifically dating and sex.


No luck with women for the longest time. Now I'm finally getting into the dating scene. I've had sex a few times, but, it was more of a transactional interaction. All I could see that I wanted in my life was a great girlfriend, and someone to want to have sex with me, for me.


So these last 2 weeks I've been on holiday (vacation), and kind of reached a few milestones. I'm doing decently with girls, and I've even slept with a woman who wanted to, just because she liked me. It's basically a lot of stuff that I've been wanting, finally happened. But here is the crux of the issue: I can't seem to fully appreciate it cause it's not exactly what I wanted (or maybe some other issue?)


The girl I slept with? It happened right after the other girls I wanted got distracted with other men. I know I sound like an asshole, I'm sorry. The girl I slept with is great! We have plans to meet up in the future, and she knows it was just about the fun. But goddam did I still find it frustrating to be turned down by the other women. I also hesitated when she wanted to kiss me in front of one of the other women I liked. I hated that I hesitated because I shouldn't have worried about the other girl.


In my next destination, I got burned by a bad pub crawl. Had a good thing going and it didn't end well. Even then, I still had fun and even accomplished something I've never actually really done. But the bad part is all I could concentrate on, not the great times and people I've met, but getting burned.


Usually when I had fun when I was still shy i would ignore the ugly and lie to myself that it was the best thing ever. I can't, I refuse to do that anymore. But I'm having problems navigating this.


Why am I all hung up on the bad? My reward centers should be flowing off the charts, but I feel kind of shitty (being sick and tired isn't helping). Is there a flaw in my thinking? Is my old reward path not working, and the stuff I thought I needed, isn't really what I needed. It's like i just found a black hole inside me that sucks the good out of what I've done. It's frustrating and a little scary. 

Thanks

607,"Basically, I asked him for a favor a few months back. In return all I got were pathetic attempts on his part at employing guile, lying and stalling. If he had just said no and explained why (assuming his reasoning for this is sensible), I would've understood. Instead, he kept trying to lead me on. I picked up on his machinations a while back, but the guy is still visibly under the impression that I'm unaware of them. Guess he isn't as bright as he thinks.

&amp;#x200B;

I know our friendship is a sinking ship at this point. I just want to know what caused this. The thing is, he keeps making up excuses to avoid hanging out with me (or at least I think he's making them up; it's getting harder by the day to believe a word he utters). I haven't even told him yet why I want to meet up with him, i.e. to clear up the cause for this rift between us.

&amp;#x200B;

What was the favor, you ask? To set me up with a girl from his SO's friend circle. He already managed to hook up (albeit with great effort) one of the less facially fortunate (as harsh as it may sound) guys in our group. And his ""pursonalitee"" ain't the best either (I've known him for 7-8 years). He also offered to help out two other guys from our circle, though this isn't the full extent of our company, it's just that those are the people he feels closest to himself, apparently. I'm not mad at him for prioritizing other people over me, I was however initially saddened by the fact he doesn't consider me a friend anymore, even though he hasn't admitted it. It wasn't always like this, we used to be good buds.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm far from perfect myself, but if my friend managed to pair that guy with a girl, then he could, without a doubt, set me up as well. Hell, one of my female cousins who just so happens to share the same class with my friend's SO, told me her classmates had found me good looking. She may be sugarcoating it a bit (or not, idk), but I have good reason to believe that at least some of the girls had taken a liking to me. It all comes down to my friend's reluctance to help me. I just want to know why. Did I go wrong somewhere? Did he grow weary of me? Or does he have some irrational problem with me?

&amp;#x200B;

I should mention my friend's demeanor took a turn for the worse shortly after he met his SO last summer. I know for a fact that his SO doesn't hold any ill will toward me, so I'm pretty sure she's not pitting him against me. The only plausible theory I could come up with is that he's trying to get back at me for doing better than him academically (I've always been somewhat of an overachiever). He's always been a slob with no aspirations in life and it wouldn't be too far-fetched to think his overzealous mother used to (or still does) rub our disparity in this area of life in his face. This has happened at least twice in the past, after all.",24Feb2019,0
608,"Just some background, around 2 weeks ago, my best friend was in a pissed off mood (idky) and pretty much went off on me for no reason the entire day. She just went off on me because i was the only one around (nitpicking, calling me names, etc.) Since then, we haven’t spoken a word to each other nearly at all (we sit next to each other in almost 3 classes). Anyways I’ve been expecting an apology because I felt that I didn’t do anything wrong but she still hasn’t apologized. We’ve been best friends for 3 years and at this point I think it’s kinda dumb to lose a friendship over something as stupid as this. If she won’t apologize, should I apologize (for no reason and even though I’m not in the wrong) just to save our friendship? ",24Feb2019,1

Yesterday, one of my 2 people were over at my house and I was tired as it was midnight. This friend suddenly tells me out of the blue that her boyfriend is coming and he’s bringing friends. At midnight too is that not too late? His friends come and start smoking in my room even though I’ve asked them to smoke in the bathroom instead! My friends look in my fridge and always asks me to make them food they don’t even bring anything to contribute!

GUYS:
Girls are typically fine if when you meet them you give them a quick once over. We expect to be checked out. I'll admit once in a while if a guy takes a little bit of a longer look I feel flattered. But when you check a girl out, please:
- Look up by the time we start talking. It's cliche but it's true, our eyes aren't in our tits.
- Don't say sorry if we seem to notice, you're just making it more awkward.
- Don't say ""You know, you're very pretty"", or anything along those lines. It's not flattering, it just ruins any chance for a normal conversation.
- Don't ask me about my outfit unless it's for another girl. I doubt you'll be stopping by Nordstrom Rack to pick out a pretty sundress for yourself any time soon.
- Don't tell me I look like someone else. There's only so many ways that can go and most of them end badly.

612,"She’ll be 49 in November (which I don’t consider too terribly old but she does). She’s always been very conscious of her appearance and how she presents herself. She’s given me tips growing up on how to prevent aging, how too look presentable, etc. She wasn’t very social in her younger years and gained quite a bit of weight after high school. 

I know it’s rooted in an unhealthy and insecure mindset, and while I would love to believe she can breeze through the process of changing that, I know better. I’m also aware that it’s not my job to do anything about it. But I still love her and I still care about how she feels. She’s a wonderful, hard-working, funny, kind, successful woman, but she’s always been hard on herself. 

So I’m wondering short-term and long-term what I can do to help. 

I have... one or two ideas. Nothing very good:

1. I was thinking of uh... paying someone attractive to... appropriately? Respectfully? Briefly flirt... with my mom. Which feels weird and gross but I know she would be gushing about it for days. I don’t know just grabbing a random hottie and slipping him $20. 

2. Maybe exercising with her? She’s always wanted to have a good fitness routine but she’s never been super motivated. I also think she tends to get frustrated with things that she’s not very good with so it would take a lot of pushing on my part to set it up but it might help.

3. Setting her up with my friends moms. She doesn’t have a ton of friends and I think it’d be good to help her build a network. 

4. Treating her to a spa day. This one would be tricky cause she’d be pissed at me for dropping cash on her. I could try lying and saying I won it in a contest or I have a friend who works at the spa but I’m terrible at lying and have a feeling it would blow up in my face quickly. 

5. Hanging out with her more. I get busy and tired easily and I want to respect her space but sometimes I think she is getting even less and less energy to socialize than I am, so maybe I should try a bit harder.

I’m not sure. Any ideas would be welcome. I love her to death and just want her to be happy. ",24Feb2019,1
613,"Hi,

In May my family is visiting my relatives in another country.

I want to avoid these people for a lot of reasons I won't go into, but to give some perspective they are incredibly racist, they are cruel to my mother and they constantly leech money off of the rest of our family. My parents are the type of people who love their family no matter who they are, so they turn a blind eye to their shitty behaviour. We are always miserable when we visit and they milk as much money as they can out of my parents. I don't want to be near them, but my parents are very controlling and want me to come. I would be missing school and other important things too if I were to go. 

If I were to stay back, I'm more than welcome to stay with my girlfriend and her family. A place to stay is not a problem.

Are there any excuses I could use (too busy at school, etc)? If that doesn't work, can I just flat out refuse to go because I'm almost an adult?

618,"Hi people of r/Advice,

A little bit if backstory: my sister has been mentally unstable since as long as I know. She emotionally and mentally abused me and my mother. Screaming day in day out for years (at least 8), swearing, manipulation, etc. etc. It took me 4 years of mental help to process it all, and I'm still not there yet. Now my sister has finally reveived help, but everything is still going at a snail's pace. (This is a very short TLDR :p)

So, Last week my sister handed me a piece of paper with 3 questions that would help her during the therapy she has finally started. 
The questions are the following: what do you like about me, what do you admire me for, what are my talents. 3 simple questions, yet I can't answer them without lying. In all truth I don't like anything about her. It makes me feel sick that I feel that way. I'm her brother. How can I not love her?

One of the girls asked to take a picture with me as the rest of the group whispered and laughed. I said no, but then everybody was like, “Wow!!!

It made me feel like shit. when he fell asleep I cried out of panic and guilt. This is my first time ever dating around and I just don’t know how to let him down.

When I talked to her tried to scare me or take a selfie with me. Stare at me every chance. She showered me with so much flattery and attention. But the thing is, she never left me alone. She began butting in intensely when I talk to other people, especially girls and she would just start laughing loudly, butt in respond ask questions. I made a joke about moving out of town and she had some issue with me she stopped talking to me. Her friend told me I hurt her feelings. She continued staring at me and stuff but not anywhere near as happy. Then when I was talking to another guy she started screaming at me out of nowhere and calling me names attacking me. Her best friend would look at her and say her name when I enter a room. The thing is she never stopped, when I ignored her she would continue giggle and say my name when I said something bad. Say my name when I talked about something bad. Continue trying to butt into my conversations. She just never left me alone and didnt stop flirting with me. Say my name like bossing me around when I talk about something bad. I would just talk about height and weight to someone else and she said ""Nobody else is as big as you"". Her Friend would go around finding information about me then tell her and she told me everything she heard. She just never stops flirting and just so aggressive and when I ignore or just don't do anything she continues. Its like she would reward me if I talk to her by flirting with me, waiting for me after class to scare me or selfies and all her compliments.

As I got older and saw her around she went to a place with a clear view staring at me. I saw her at her work and she did that. I went to her work once and she saw me said hi, was in one spot then moved to another that was a clear view she could see me in and I could see her and she stayed there the whole time and stared. Then I saw her in a car. I stared at her not knowing it was her because she was laughing loudly. She looked over at me she held eye contact and stared back at me, when I broke eye contact didn't stop and watched me leave. She did this when my mom was right next to me. I broke eye contact and didn't look back. She didn't like that. Months later her and her mom go back on my fb to remove their likes on a pic dedicated to my dads death. Her mom liked my dad and she obviously talked about me to them because she found out that my dad bought a motorcycle from hers. After that she had an attitude, I worked with her, she stared at me while putting on a jacket and didn't stop when caught and the supervisor said something and she was shocked.

Well now we go to the same college she saw me when shes walking into her class and I was leaving that class she was showing up on time and sat down stared at me when I wasn't looking for a few seconds. Now after seeing me shows up 30 minutes early walks by looking in at me then walks by many times like 4+ times stands in the doorway then waits outside. Nobody does this and everyone else in her class is not there. Everyone else waits in their car between classes. Her friend acts like I don't exist when she sees me around and only went up to talk to me once. Her friend got a boyfriend and he lived right next door to me, she never said hi or anything.

I am just frustrated and upset in general because she never stops flirting with me in general and does it aggressively and when I ignore just persists and then eventually lashes out at me and does bad stuff. Then has some issue over stuff then lashes out at me. She never stops and just perists, she lashes out has an attitude over something stupid and starts up again. I get uncomfortable and ignore, she gets upset, angry and lashes me out. She showered me with so much attention, flattery and compliments. Selfies but I just can't get space or a break and when I get uncomfortable and ignore her or show negative body language/ response she just throws a fit and lashes out doing bad stuff. She acted like a supporting friend and shows support for stuff but then gets mad and take it away lashing out over that stuff. She just feels like a flirty big sister and using that dynamic to her advantage pushing me around and in a way bullying me. I just feel discouraged because I feel like she is the only female friend I really ever had. Her and her friend. Her friend would find any excuse to be around me and offered me a ride when it's unnecessary. She might know I am autistic because she is known for having a short fuse blowing up at people and she doesn't treat me that way and been extra patient wouldn't care if I interrupted her, ask questions on topics I am fixated with, instantly believe stuff I say take my side on stories when she was upset with me. Gets upset with me and then gets over it. I am just heartbroken because she feels like the best female friend i ever had and will never have someone like her again. The best female friend I had but she bossed me around and kind've abused me and has been for years. I have been hurting for years. I want to be friends but the way she acts makes me not want anything to do with her but I do care about her and love her platonically.

TL;DR

I met a girl when I was younger she did stuff that's impossible to ignore to get my attention. She continued this stuff for years and flirts to the point it is uncomfortable and doesn't stop then has an issue when I get mad or uncomfortable and ignore her and she lashes out. She does things that are impossible to ignore and continues this into college. Showing up 30 minutes early to her class when I am in the class before, and walking by a lot and standing in the door, waiting outside. I have not felt comfortable by how she acts and have been ignoring her.

PS: I am autistic but on the high functioning end of the spectrum and not everyone knows",24Feb2019,0
635,"My parents went out of town for their 26th anniversary and put my brother and fiancé in charge of feeding the animals, cleaning and watching our 15 year old sister. He’s my twin and we are both 22. My dad gave him $250 for food. They are very conservative when it comes to illegal substances. They want their home to be a safe place. Despite knowing the rules, my brother invited a bunch of friends over one time while our parents were out of town and I could smell weed coming from the game room while our 15 year old sister was in the house. 

This time, I was upstairs when I heard my brother and his friend in his room. I could hear them coughing back and forth. I couldn’t smell anything but I know enough about vape pens. I knew my brother wasn’t sick and I’ve smoked weed plenty of times in high school so I am all too familiar with that type of coughing. I’ve also witnessed people who have smoked too much and puked. I heard his friend coughing too hard and I heard him puke. 

I’m certain without a doubt that they were getting high. 

I feel obligated to tell my parents that he violated their trust and broke the rules of their house. He brought illegal substances into the house with a 15 year old present again.

637,"I’m a 20 year old female, got out of my first relationship a few weeks ago. I spent time on tinder because I was curious, and thinking I was bi, decided to talk to have guys and girls. While I think the people I’ve talked to are nice and I really vibe with them, I just don’t think I could ever see myself being intimate with anyone that physically or emotionally (I’m away for school and never saw my boyfriend very often, nor did we text often). I’ve always kind of thought I was ace/aro potentially, but lately I’ve been wondering if there’s some other reason.
I guess for context about myself, I consider myself kind of an introvert, though pretty good with people (involved in classes, on campus, and do performance stuff). I sometimes think about sex and all, but the actuality of it can be kind of intimidating (I’ve never masturbated or had sex, and once walked past the sex toys in Spencer’s and just felt nauseus). I’m pretty goal-oriented and really value my own personal time as well. When I’m texting people, sometimes I just need time to go away for “me” time, and I have friends who do the same and we respect each others’ boundaries.
I’m not sure how to describe it. I’m considering going to a therapist (other than the campus therapist, I reeaally didn’t find her helpful), and I’m just wondering what other people think/if they’ve had similar experiences/the like.

F: best friend
C: crush
CF: crush's friend
One last thing, I'm 16 if that matters
 
 So there's this girl (C) in my group of friends that I liked a lot, we had a lot in common and it was just really easy to talk with her, I started catching feelings for her
 She didn't like me back, in fact she liked F who was dating CF. Everything was a mess but with a little time everything went back to normal, I still liked her thought and was quite... Upset? Sad? Mostly because of self-loathing issues that I've always dealt with, but kept repeating to myself that everything will eventually pass
 Ff to two weeks ago, CF breaks up with F 2 days before all 8 of us went camping. I asked him if he was ok, I was really worried, he tells me that I shouldn't worry, that everything was fine. Then he proceeds to ask me if I'm ok after what happened with C. I tell him that I was trying to get over it, but it was kind of hard and still needed some time. We went camping after that
 in one tent slept F, C, CF and me, and this is what happened:
 CF falls asleep, F and C slept hugging, I know it may sound stupid, but I couldn't take it, I got out of the tent, no questions asked, and spent the night outside. I was feeezing, but it was better than being there (I  know it sound dumb, but it wasn't, it was one of the shittiest nights I've ever had, I freezed outside but it was super awkward the thought of being there)
 I'm hurt, not by the fact that she likes him, that's totally normal, I'm hurt bc I opened up to my best friend about how I was feeling and he didn't even consider doing that would make me upset in any way, the next day I asked him ""you like her"" and he was ""lol maybe idk""
 I told 2 friends who slept on the other tent, they told me it was a total dick move, especially since they don't think he likes her back but did it because he's upset about breaking up with CF
 Am I being a whiny asshole for being mad at him? The problem isn't even about C, I'm offended, I always took all the bs he gave me bc ""that's what friends do"" but this is too much to me. Am I wrong?

Anyone have any advice, comments, concerns, or information regarding my intended major in relation to these schools???? 

Clemson- most expensive, close to my parents

N.C. State- more affordable, close to my parents, bothers me??? (idk why, I feel unsure when I picture myself here)

Kansas State- cheaper, my mom went here (opportunity for legacy scholarships), I'd have to drive 4 hours once a month to receive a special scalp treatment to treat my alopecia (all other schools are a more reasonable distance from specialists who administer the treatment), far away from family 

Delaware Valley- really small school (which means small classes for a personalized feel), expensive (but I got a 25,000 scholarship which makes it pretty comparable to other cheaper schools that I am looking at), My boyfriend goes here which is nice; however, I don't want to cheat myself out of a normal college experience because I was too busy sitting on the couch and watching Netflix with him..... , far away from family

Missouri State- affordable, far away from family, don't know much else because I have not been on a campus visit yet, though I had a really good feeling about this school as I was filling out my application

649,"We dated for 2 years from Jan 2016 to Feb 2018. We broke up for a lot of reasons, mainly incompatibility and distance (we entered college and moved away, now we live about 8 hours away from each other by car).  
  
The catalyst that caused the breakup was I began hanging out with a new group of friends and I hit it off very well with one of the guys in the group. I told my bf pretty immediately that I thought I was crushing, as I wanted to be transparent. He decided this was the final straw and broke up with me. I was devastated at first, but I knew it was for the best. Leading up to this, we had already been discussing how to breakup amicably, so it’s not like this was out of the blue.   
  
After this, we chatted about once a month. I began dating the guy from my friend group in the end of March. In August 2018, he told me he no longer had hard feelings towards me and was ok to pursue a friendship. He also expressed that he’s on Tinder and is generally moving on. We continued to chat once every two weeks or once a month. He hit me up and I hit him up. I wished him a happy birthday on his birthday in November, and he wished me a happy birthday on my birthday in the beginning of this month.  
  
I recently began playing Apex Legends, and I messaged him asking how he likes the game, since he’s a pretty avid gamer. He said he liked it, so I asked if he wants to play together (this would be the first time we did something together since we broke up). He asked why don’t I play with my friends if they play? I explained that only 2 of my friends played (but didn’t like it much) and that my BF plays (he told me that bringing up BF is not a problem and he occasionally asks about him, so don’t read too much into this). He responded saying “mkay then play with [BF] and [other ex-BF]” and then cut the conversation short.  
  
I’m not taking this well because this sounds like some serious salt. Neither of us had even mentioned my other ex, so I don’t get why he brought it up. I really don’t get the hostility towards me, as it’s been over a year since our breakup and my request wasn’t that crazy.  
  
I’m thinking he assumed that I want to play with him and BF at the same time, which isn’t true. But it leads me to thinking, what should I have done differently? Should I not have asked? Should I have specified that it’d be him, me, and a random playing?  
  
**TLDR:** Asked my ex (after being broken up for over 1 year) if he wants to play Apex with me and he said “mkay then play with [my current BF] and [my other ex-BF that hadn’t been mentioned in this convo]”. Wondering if asking him at all was a bad move.",24Feb2019,0

652,"A little more context to add to the title - I've been seeing a girl for only 4-5 weeks now. However things have gone pretty quickly, we've been out on a few dates, slept together, pretty much clearly like each other a lot and have some attachment there already (although, not to sound selfish, but I do think she is more attached than me at the moment). 

She had a boyfriend for 5 years before me. She broke up with him a year ago, but I know he wanted to get back with her and she'd sometimes meet up with him etc. Last week, as she was round my place, er ex was calling her non-stop, 30+ times. He then sent me a long Facebook message telling me to 'back off' his ex as they are 'trying to make things work'. However the girl told me she doesn't want anything to do with him and he just really wants her back, but she likes me and he never treated her well, etc etc.

I responded to him politely, as I'm not a dick, and I just said that I wouldn't refrain from seeing the girl if she wanted to see me, as she can make her own decisions and I need to respect that. 

Anyway. She's just told me that he's killed himself today. And honestly I feel guilty. This has all happened so suddenly. I didn't even know the girl 5 weeks ago and now I feel like I'm somewhat responsible for tipping a man over the edge and essentially contributed towards somebody's death.

The main advice I'm looking for here is somewhat vague. But essentially I have these questions, which any advice at all would be appreciated, as I feel really strange and unsure about things.

1. How the hell do I comfort her appropriately. I don't want to make her think I'm trying to be a replacement or say the wrong thing. How do I talk about her Ex, what do I say about the whole thing. So far I've comforted her pretty well but I'm worried about when the topic comes up again and again in conversation, how shall I handle it appropriately.
2. I'm really worried that if I think this isn't going to be something I want long term, it's incredibly hard to tell her that now considering the situation. Like I said, she is more attached than I am, so what happens if in a few weeks I really don't think it's going to work as a serious thing. I'd feel way too bad to let her down now. She really likes me.
3. Any generic advice considering this situation.

656,"Hello reddit I am a 23 year old who is currently studying medicine in India.I wanted to share with you an experience that has happened in my life recently and I want your advice on what I should do ahead.

It all started from my freshman year where I had to live in a flat with another fellow student(I shall call him X for now).At first he was nice and amiable,and since we were from the same city,I had a feeling that I finally got a friend that I could form a long contact with.But things started getting worse as time passed by.He started mentioning that I shouldnt have been his roommate in the first place and started pointing out faults in everything that I did.At first,I didnt care.I thought it was all part of our bonding up with the new roommate stuff and just laughed around whenever he ridiculed me.He always found opportunities to undermine my beliefs and thoughts,and at times where he could not succeed,he would bring a common friend of ours and make him talk to me about the same.For instance,I am a man strictly against alcohol and smoking,and he was intent on convincing me into doing the same.This debate between us rose to a point where he abruptly got up from his seat and smashed my alarm to prove his point.At that moment,I was really shook and had decided that getting away from him would be the right thing.But he then came back with all our friends and apologized and I finally gave in.

By the time of our 2nd professional year,I had a girl in my class(I shall call her Y for now)who I had a good friendship with.I was honest with her and always thought of her as a good friend with whom I can share my feelings with.She almost was like a sister to me(Being a single child I've always wanted someone of my age or near with whom I could talk my emotions out).And all this had come to the view of X.And he wanted to have a say in it.He called my parents and her parents in a drunken fit one night and had told them that we had eloped and were going to get married.Upon realising that he had said all of that the previous night,he changed the story to my friends that I was the one who had proposed the idea in the first place.

Since then,all girls (including Y for no fault of mine) have started forming this hostile environment around me,as though I am the one at fault.People with whom I could freely talk and laugh around with have slowly distanced themselves from me.All that I do nowadays is lead a lone life and the only people I talk to are my parents,who still constantly advise me to never have the thought of eloping.And while I have slowing slipped into a loner life,X was never blamed and he managed to gather more friends(for apparently bearing with a roommate like me)And all this really makes me feel sad.What should I do?",24Feb2019,1

658,"[WARNING: Long rant post 😩 sorry yall I suck at keeping things clean and concise]

I'm actually not sure what is the biggest issue to emphasize on or how to word all this...but I guess I should just start by telling what my dilemma is. 

I want to move out of my parent's home. I'm 19 years old so I'm a legal adult. Technically I can just leave, I do understand that of course. The problem is, my parents vehemently disagree with what I want to do.

My plan is to move out of state and live with my friend and her family. So I do have a place to go to, and money isn't really a big issue. The thing is, my parents don't know I still plan on doing this. They thought they squashed my dream and I gave up. I first told them it, when I was planning on going to college in that state. They told me it was a dumb idea  and I couldn't go. Which is ridiculous...tons of people go to college out of state. Since then I have let them think I gave up. Half a year has passed and I'm still at home, miserable. 

I guess the biggest issue is probably that I am spineless and I'm not knowledgable on adult life and responsibilities because my parents haven't taught me jack shit. 

I don't know how to tell them I'm still leaving. It's important to note we have never had a good relationship. We don't have one of those warm and fuzzy relationships in the slightest. I wouldn't say they're abusive, but I can tell you that in this house I do not feel happy, I have never been able to be myself, I don't feel like I can express any opinions because we are so drastically different especially in social/political opinions that they look down on me if I say that something they said was hateful or discriminatory or if I simply just express an opinion they don't agree with. My friends even hate my parents because of how they treat me and just because of how they are.

Do I tell them a month before I leave? A week? Do I even tell them at all, and just write a note for them to come home to? That just seems cruel. But I can't imagine continuing to be in this house after telling them, with the constant tension and them trying to change my mind or just telling me I'm stupid for doing this. 

Another problem I have with leaving is my car. This car is such a burden to me. I never wanted it but the fact is I could never work or do anything without a car, where I live. The thing is, my dad practically forced my hand and got this car for me (we are paying it off through a loan and it is my brother's old car, who he sold to my dad) so he ""got it for me"" but the payments are thrown onto me. Ever since even the talk of getting me a car has come up a couple years ago, he has constantly told me I am ungrateful for it and this still continues today. My friends, my guidance counselor when I was still in high school, and even my doctor who I had told about this, expressed how dumb they thought it was that a parent would ""gift"" their kid a car and then make them pay it off. To me it isn't a gift. Especially when I don't want to be here and where I will move to in the city, a car is completely unnecessary and the payments are too much. By making me invest in this car, they pretty much decided for me that I would continue living at home for probably a few years, and then continue to live in-state, too. I didn't foresee this when I signed that auto loan. The only solution to me is for the car to be sold when I leave. Which my dad would have to do himself. 

I'm basically running off and leaving them to sell my car and take care of all that, which I feel guilty about, but I don't see another viable option for me. The stress of the issue with the car makes it even harder to tell them I'm leaving in several months. They're going to be furious...


Sorry this turned into a mess of a rant post, I should probably cut it off here.

I just don't know what to do. My anxiety and my bad relationship with them which never made me feel comfortable talking to them or confiding in them, has put up such a huge barrier in me moving forward. Guilt holds me back and fear of their reaction holds me back.

661,"So first things first I’m on a club wrestling team that I’ve put a lot of time into, its filled with students from high-schools around where I live. This club goes to a lot of high school tournaments and helps us reach championships. This year I was getting ready for qualifiers when my school told me I couldn’t go(it would take me far to long to explain why), this was a major bummer but what’s even worse was they said I couldn’t next year either. So my only choice is to move schools if I want to continue, and the only school I’d be able to go is a little snobby as it’s in a rich area, I know some people there but we aren’t that alike.

After waiting several months I received my letter of acceptance to move to Canada for 2 years which was exciting news. But since then I've run into a load of problems. I found out the medical insurance I need to take out for the 2 years as part of the visa requirements went up in price due to an insurance company change over (and they won't honour the original pricing). My flight price has gone up massively due to a policy change I was unaware of (I found out that British Airways now charge for any checked luggage on long haul each way, making my flight price out of my budget).

I decided to try to live in new country despite being disabled as I don't have many friends or family where I live, and I wanted to do something with my life.

I've tried lots of times since to get back into it and even still go to life drawing classes, but it just doesn't really give me anything. Nothing does. 

I'm in my final year of university and lots of career talks I've been attending talk about how your passion is ultimately more important than your grades, and it's about the work you do for fun more than your coursework that will make you stand out. That terrifies me. I have good grades but I don't have any passion. My only drive is fear of failure and embarrassment, and that if I don't work hard at university I'll regret it later on. But I don't have any drive to do anything. I'm worried I never will. Not having any passions makes me so depressed. I think it affects my relationships because I place all my happiness and self worth in others, because I have nothing I care about within myself.

There's this dude and I don't remember how we met but he kinda appeared out of nowhere in my life and apparently we seemed to talk a lot before (according to him) I really don't remember but that's nothing new since I'm awful at remembering stuff. So we ended up talking a lot for a week, he ended up sexting me late one night and me being the socially incapable person that I am didn't notice till he had to spell it out for me that he's masturbating to me. He kinda coaxed me into it, has a way with words or maybe I'm just too easy, but I ended up going at it with him. Now him being a play boy and him having a huge amount of friends kinda makes it hard to me too talk to him again. When I do, I end up getting shut down for any conversation, saying he's busy and honestly, I don't want too seem needy (I really am though) but he's been stuck in my head for the past weeks and I don't know what to do. I'm not good with people and I'm god awful at knowing what too say. So I may have gotten attached to him after that happened and it's gotten to the point where I stalk his socials everyday. As sad as it sounds I don't get many people telling me they like me maybe because I rarely talk too people and I just need help.

678,I’m a senior in high school who’s going off to college this fall. I’ve been having major issues with my lazy and stubborn 25 year old brother. My family immigrated here 10 years ago and my brother finished off his senior year here in America. His English was perfect when we got here though so that wasn’t a problem for his. He had to start off at community college right after graduating and he went for the first part of the semester when he stopped going to class after a few weeks (2011). This whole cycle of going to classes for the first couple weeks of semester and suddenly dropping the classes continued for him until fall of 2018 when he decided to get serious because my parents got tired of him doing this. Keep in mind he never had good grades back at our home country either. I started dual enrolling at the community college as well when I became a senior in HS this year and now I have a class with him. He literally has no work ethic and my parents continually appease him with whatever he wants just so he passes his classes but that’s fueling his laziness even more. He always fails the tests and makes me do his homework and somehow manages to make me feel guiltly for not doing that. He literally cannot sit down and study for the test until the night before- which he ultimately ends up failing the test. And he blames on me for not helping him even though I tell him to sit down and study with me the week before and he outright refuses to do so. His definition of me helping is basically doing the work for him. He’s basically been at this community college for 6-7 years now and has only passed 4 classes so far. I honestly don’t know what to do at this point and I’m worried for his future. I don’t think college is for him and he’s not an independent person at all. He cannot survive a day without my parents supporting him. He doesn’t know how to cook or clean up after himself and now he’s somehow blaming me for failing the class we have now. And yes I have tried to tell my parents this but they say they don’t know what to do about it and continue to buy him a Mercedes. I’m both tired of him and what my parents are doing to him because frankly they’re more harming him than helping him by appeasing him this way. He literally threw a tantrum when my parents said they weren’t sure if they should buy him the Mercedes. He’s a grown man with the mentality of a 13 year old boy. Any advice would be appreciated!,24Feb2019,1

My friend, Jack, is the one who introduced me to his crush, Jane, and when we first met 2 days ago, my first impressions of her was that she was really cute but I had no intention of dating her or even being a good friend considering we never met each other in school or any other activities and Im not too fond of online platonic relationships. But as the day progressed with her, we found out we have A LOT in common, even down to specifics. One thing I really noticed was that when she talked to me she maintained eye contact with me the entire time and waited for my reaction before she diverted her attention. She would go out of her way to talk to me, reaching over many seats so that she could tell me something. This wasnt how she acted with Jack.

Jack is insane when he's with her. He is head over heels for anything she has to say and never disagrees with her. The volume of his voice is twice the level of our voices and he's really exaggerating his content of the moment (He said ""THIS IS THE HAPPIEST MOMENT OF MY LIFE"" 4-5 times when all we were doing was listening to music together). When I present my opinion, Jack usually disagrees and Jane takes my side almost everytime and once Jack sees Jane agreeing with me, he agrees with her. She puts on the same smile with both of us but is definitely more intent on hearing me out rather than him. Later that day, we were so close that I proposed that we make a club around our interests and she was very excited by the idea and accepted.

 I'd basically set for myself a rule that I wasn't gonna date in high school because the girls that I communicate with in school aren't really 'gf material' and always trying to look for a gf would just be a waste my time. Note, this wasn't a self esteem issue I had, I just tend to be Stoic in nature and the trivial emotional swings when trying to woo girls that were hot but didn't care for me didn't appeal to me anymore at all. 

But this girl was so much more different. I feel like for the first time in my life I've really been understood by someone Im physically attracted to. I mean, it's only been a day since i met her and at the end of that day we were talking as close friends would talk.

But obviously my friend is head over heels for her and he was the one who introduced me to her. But I don't think I can talk to her knowing that I can't be with special girl like her. 

I'm very conservative in my approach in evaluating how others think of me just due to my knowledge of perceptive illusions like confirmation bias, selective attention, availability heuristic, optimism bias, etc. but even with those in mind it was quite obvious that she was more interested in me than him and Id really like to be with her.

What do I do?

682,"Hi, I’m currently living with a couple in a two bedroom apartment. I’m really good friends with the girl, and was pretty much acquaintances with the boy before moving in. They had the apartment before me, I’m just living here for the semester for school. I’ve lived here for two months and am living here for two more months. 

Since living here, my relationship with the girl has remained strong. We get along really well!! As for her boyfriend, my other roommate, we just haven’t clicked. Most of our conversations are strained or just awkward. It’s always kind of weird when it’s just the two of us, as we never really know what to talk about or what to do. I can think of about three comfortable situations we’ve had alone since moving in, and we’ve been alone a lot more that that. I don’t see him often by himself as our schedules are quite different, so there’s not many times we end up by ourselves. The girl and I, however, are on pretty much similar schedules. 

The boy is pretty stand offish and doesn’t really show any great emotion towards me. Sometimes, he can actually come off pretty short and it makes me uncomfortable. Not so uncomfortable that I feel uncomfortable to live in my apartment, but uncomfortable enough that I try to avoid hanging out with the two of them because I always feel like I’m a nuisance to him, even though I’m not to her. 

For example, they were fighting earlier today, just a small agreement. They were cleaning the apartment, which I would have stepped in and helped with, but I felt uncomfortable doing as I didn’t want to get into the middle of their argument. Later, the boy came into my room (after knocking) to get some papers from their filing cabinet as I was doing homework. As he was leaving, he said “if you’re not busy, we would really appreciate it if you could help us with the cleaning sometime.” (They we’re finished by that point). He said it in a very condescending manner, shutting the door as he finished his sentence so I couldn’t even respond. This made me uncomfortable. When I saw the girl roommate, I apologized for not steeping into help, saying I didn’t want to be in the middle of them fighting. She insured me it was fine. 

The next two months, my rent is being upped due to a mistake in math done by the girl. This is fine, we’ve worked it out, but I feel like I have some issues.  My rent is going up, so I should feel comfortable living in my apartment, even though they got here first, you know? I’m just unsure how to go about being more comfortable in our shared living spaces when he’s around. I’m afraid I’m going to say or do something and he’ll make a snarky/short comment about it. 

Basically, how do I make myself more comfortable around the boy roommate to justify the rent increase? How do I live more comfortably in the common areas, if I’m paying my fair share? ",24Feb2019,1

684,"Hello... this is going to be a tough one to write. 

&amp;#x200B;

My grandparents have been the 2 most important people in my life. The 2 people I love the most. They raised me, they played with me. I remember me and my grandpa playing ball in my room and my grandma yelling at us to stop because we're making too much noise... people might complain. Feels like yesterday really. I was around 7 or 8 at the time. My mom re-married and then we had to move away from my grandparents house, but I kept on visiting them as they were no more than half a mile away. I can't really put it in words, but no matter how bad of a day I might have, as soon as I walk through that doorway and I see them I'm in the happiest place I could be... my grandpa died on January 9th... it has changed things quite a bit. My grandma lost a lot of weight and because really frail... but still refused to move to our house. Around 3 weeks ago my grandmother fell in her home and broke her right hip.. she had to go get surgery. And she did, but my grandfather was her moral support, he was the eternal optimist.. she was the pessimist of the 2. She went trough the surgery and came home 5 days ago. She clearly isn't the same, it has taken a mental toll on her. Her condition deteriorates day by day, she has pneumonia and it's really giving her a hard time. Day 5 as I said, she... looks around the room as if she's seeing things, and she has difficult time uttering words out. I hate seeing her like this, the woman who held me as a baby... who raised me, too tired to even talk. I'm restless afraid to even go to sleep as I fear she might go. I can't stop crying as soon as I leave the room, although I keep a smile when around her. She is the last living remnant of my childhood... the bridge that connects memories with reality. And although she isn't herself now, I know she appreciates me. I need to stay optimistic, that this isn't the end.. it can't be. I doubt I'll be sleeping tonight. I just needed to get this out.

Some of the things that disappoint me the most is when I ask some friends to hangout and they either ignore me, or blow me off.

687,"I've never met someone who hates school as much as I do, and I'm starting to worry that there must be something wrong with me. I have about one year of university left. I go to a large public school in my state. I'm a woman in my early twenties. On paper I look like an excellent, attentive student. 

I don't consider myself to have anger issues- my friends and family would describe me as a pretty mellow, laid back person. But when I'm in school, it's like a whole new side of me comes out. I *hate* university so much - not even my university in particular, because I feel like I would be just as miserable at another large public school. The massive, impersonal lecture halls with hundreds of people, expensive textbooks that are flippantly scams, monotone lectures by professors who aren't fit to teach or inspire, micromanaging clicker questions and mandatory attendance policies to force you to show up to class, don't even get me started on the bullshit bureaucracy at the Dean's office. All of the stupid, asinine little rules in place - can't drop a class whenever you want to, can't switch to pass fail whenever you want to, can't go part time status unless you have medical documentation (I do, for a chronic illness, but it still makes me livid knowing that I'm not allowed to do it just because I feel like it, but because I was able to ""prove"" that I deserve it). I've asked people to explain to me why these rules exist, and the answers I get range from ""duuuuuhhhh, I don't know, rules are rules"" to the more honest ""think of the university like a business that wants to make money and then everything makes more sense"" (said to me by a professor!). 

I can't pay attention in class. When I try to, I start feeling so angry. My mind starts racing with all sorts of toxic thoughts about what bullshit this is and how trapped I feel. I count the minutes until I can get the hell off of campus. I feel like I'm being suffocated just being within 100 yards of that campus. I sometimes cry tears of frustration when doing homework because I *hate* it so intensely, I hate it so much. I get so furious sometimes that my stomach and abdomen will start to hurt, I'll feel physically ill. I have to try and stay emotionally numb because if I allow myself to start thinking about these things when I'm trying to do my work, my head will become so clouded with anger I can't progress anymore. Even things like watching a good TV show or listening to music triggers these rebellious, hateful feelings. There have even been points where the anger transitions into depression so severe, I've planned out how I could end my life. I've stopped going to most of my classes, partially due to depression, but partially in protest. I just can't stomach being in a classroom anymore. 

I do have depression and anxiety, but I don't see how that would be an adequate explanation for this level of anger and hate. When I talk to my friends, they agree with most of my points - but they just don't seem to be... that emotionally riled up about it. They agree, but there's also apathy. They've found a way to let go I guess? Or maybe they don't have anything to let go of because they haven't struggled with such intense feelings towards the university. I've never been in trouble with the law and was always extremely well behaved. Despite this, I do have a problem with authority for some reason. I can't stand feeling like I don't have flexibility in my choices, I can't stand feeling like I'm being trapped or coerced into doing something I hate because it's the only way to survive in this world, and I *especially* hate being told what to do when I feel like no one's giving me a good reason as to why I should be doing something. I can think of few things I hate more than the ""rules are rules"" mantra. I can't help but aggressively question everything, and it's extremely unsatisfying when the answers to those questions seem to be completely arbitrary bullshit fluff, or worse, thinly veiled attempts at making more money. I feel like punching something when I see the posters and e-newsletters from our chancellor or any of the other offices on campus, talking about ""progress"" and ""innovation"" and ""putting our students first"". It feels like such a lie. 

Is this abnormal? Is there something wrong with me? When I'm not in school, I'm a very artistic, free spirited, entrepreneurial person. I feel *alive*. When I'm in school, I feel either completely dead inside or so consumed with anger, frustration, despair, and the feeling of being trapped that I wish I had an off switch, to make the feelings stop because it's so hard to function with them. I just want to know if this is actually a common phenomena and people just don't let it show. I know I certainly don't - most people who know me would probably be shocked to read what I've just written. ",24Feb2019,1
688,"This is just something I have to get off my chest.

Right now I'm 17. I'm graduating high school in 3 months. I get above average grades, but I'm no straight A student. However my life has amounted to nothing and at the rate it's going I feel it never will.

Since 6th grade I've essentially been a shut-in. All I do is sit in my room with the door closed, lights off, blinds shut, and either watch TV or play online on my PC. Starting from 2015, you can add ""watching anime and reading manga on my phone"" to that list to. My experiences with friends outside of school have been exclusively online aside from 3 specific occasions. I used to have a decent amount of friends, but I fell out with a lot of them and currently I only have 4 real friends IRL, only one of which I really actively talk to outside of school (online of course). The others are busy with whatever it is they do.

In school I've never been involved in anything and have absolutely zero school spirit. My school is centered heavily around our sports teams, and I have no interest whatsoever in sports (unless a home team is in the finals of something). I've never attended a sports game, school dance, never participated in a club, nothing. And that's just how people have come to know me now. Just a quiet kid who really isn't worth noting, so it feels extremely awkward to come out of that. I'm not bullied or anything, I just feel lost and lonely in life. Besides my few friends I have, I have no siblings and have never been in a relationship (though it's not like I've actively looked or one anyway).

At this point you probably think I'm suicidal. I've never tried to attempt it, but last year I was sent to therapy for a few months for having thoughts about it. The therapy didn't help, and the feeling just went away. But it almost comes back whenever I reflect on my life. If I were gonna do something, I would do something that would be instant. Sometimes I wish I could restart my life from certain points or overall in general. But I think of the future and what I can maybe do one day. 

I figure that maybe once I'm in college I plan to totally overhaul who I am and my personality since no one there will know who I am or who I was. When I started thinking of what I wanted to do for a career my family suggested architecture. It's true I have some sort of interest in architecture, however I feel like once I get into it, I might not enjoy it as much as I think I will. I don't want to go to college and spend 4-6 years on something that won't be worth it in the end, as well as be thousands of dollars in debt. I'm getting no financial support from my family so whatever  isn't covered by scholarships, I have to pay for. Architecture is very math-heavy, which is my worst subject. I don't know how well I'd fare.

If I don't end up doing architecture, I don't know what I'm gonna do. I have no plan 'B'. I mean I have interest in things like video games and drawing, but neither of those really make for a career. Even I have a hard time motivating myself to draw anymore. If I could do any job, I would like to design my own cars and try to sell them. But that's not really realistic. Even my family says so. They don't believe in me whenever I speak about it. And so that's why I chose architecture. It's at least maybe something I can get into, and is much more realistic as a career than designing cars.

But even going to college isn't something I'm sure I'm ready for yet. I kinda feel like I'm going just because it's what's expected of me. It's what people generally expect you to do. But if I don't go to college, it will hurt my odds of getting a good career with good pay. 

So if I could step back and look at my life as a different person, I honestly would probably say, ""yikes, this guy is a loser."" I feel like one when comparing myself to anyone else I know. Like I said at the start, my life has amounted to nothing and I don't feel like it will if I don't do something. I'm lost.",24Feb2019,1

690,"I mean, I’m always lonely to some degree because I’m single. But ever since getting off social media, the loneliness has been substantial.

I decided last week that I was going to take a break from social media (Instagram and Facebook). I’m 24 years old and I was (and am) feeling very upset and unhappy with my life for no specific reason. I realized I spent over two hours a day looking at Instagram. And that wasn’t ok.

I’m an engineer. I make a 6 figure salary. I’ve traveled to over a dozen countries. I have an average body figure (not overweight, not supermodel skinny). I have friends. I play the piano.

And all of these things are supposed to make me happy with my life, right? .. wrong. I go on social media and I see my friends and strangers who are more successful than me. Getting married, having babies, traveling the world. And then I see celebrities who are living life in luxury with perfect bodies. And then I see piano players far better than I ever will be.

Teddy Roosevelt  said “Comparison is the thief of joy”. And that is so true. But as a human being  it’s hard not to compare. And the whole concept of social media, people constantly flaunting their every achievement and material gain, makes it harder.

So I decided to delete all of the apps. But now I feel lonely. It’s like there were 1000 people watching my every day life and now there are zero. And sometimes men would message me complimenting my pictures and it was a nice ego boost. Even though this did bother me, because I’d get a heart eye emoji instead of a compliment using one of the many words in our English vocabulary. Which made me feel like courting was now lazy and genetic.

Anyway, how can I combat this feeling of being alone? I don’t want to go back to social media. I want to be present and life my own life and not see everyone else’s every second of every day.",24Feb2019,7
691,"Around summertime of last year, I learned one of my cousins was having her wedding in the spring of 2019 in Florida, a state all the way across the country from me. I was originally hesitant to go, and so was my mother, who assured me it was okay if I didn't. Fast forward to last month, when I decided to make plans for spring break of this year (I'm in college). A friend and I are going on a trip to see some other friends who moved to Colorado a while back. It would be my first real trip with friends, and frankly, it would be great to get away from family for a while. I attend college in my home town and am constantly surrounded by my family.

&amp;#x200B;

As it turns out, the week of my spring break, and our trip, is the same week as the wedding. Now, it seems that my entire extended family has learned of this and are pressuring me into going to this wedding. My siblings, aunts, uncles, mother, and cousins have confronted me either in person, through text messaging, or through email to try and convince me to go to this wedding.

692,(18f) My moms boyfriend controls her parenting decisions he even went through my room and went in my dresser. Me and my mom just had a heart to heart about everything that was going on and she said she’s not happy in the relationship and they are having problems. This is making my mom unhappy and she even said he was the reason behind all her bad parenting decisions that ended up hurting me. He has put her in debt and she’s so tired of him she just lets him control her because she doesn’t want to fight with him which has lead to her doing stuff for me behind his back. She can’t mentally deal with a break up right now because of how exhausted she is and the fact that I’m going to college next year and although I’ll be paying for my own college she doesn’t wanna have to make me move and have to readjust my life right before college. I hate seeing her upset like this and it constantly feels like I’m in prison with my curfews being changed all the time. I’m not sure what to do I feel like the only option is to wait it out until I move out and won’t have to live with them. :( (I’m still in high school btw),24Feb2019,1
693,"Hi, I’m currently living with a couple in a two bedroom apartment. I’m really good friends with the girl, and was pretty much acquaintances with the boy before moving in. They had the apartment before me, I’m just living here for the semester for school. I’ve lived here for two months and am living here for two more months. 

Since living here, my relationship with the girl has remained strong. We get along really well!! As for her boyfriend, my other roommate, we just haven’t clicked. Most of our conversations are strained or just awkward. It’s always kind of weird when it’s just the two of us, as we never really know what to talk about or what to do. I can think of about three comfortable situations we’ve had alone since moving in, and we’ve been alone a lot more that that. I don’t see him often by himself as our schedules are quite different, so there’s not many times we end up by ourselves. The girl and I, however, are on pretty much similar schedules. 

The boy is pretty stand offish and doesn’t really show any great emotion towards me. Sometimes, he can actually come off pretty short and it makes me uncomfortable. Not so uncomfortable that I feel uncomfortable to live in my apartment, but uncomfortable enough that I try to avoid hanging out with the two of them because I always feel like I’m a nuisance to him, even though I’m not to her. 

For example, they were fighting earlier today, just a small agreement. They were cleaning the apartment, which I would have stepped in and helped with, but I felt uncomfortable doing as I didn’t want to get into the middle of their argument. Later, the boy came into my room (after knocking) to get some papers from their filing cabinet as I was doing homework. As he was leaving, he said “if you’re not busy, we would really appreciate it if you could help us with the cleaning sometime.” (They we’re finished by that point). He said it in a very condescending manner, shutting the door as he finished his sentence so I couldn’t even respond. This made me uncomfortable. When I saw the girl roommate, I apologized for not steeping into help, saying I didn’t want to be in the middle of them fighting. She insured me it was fine. 

The next two months, my rent is being upped due to a mistake in math done by the girl. This is fine, we’ve worked it out, but I feel like I have some issues.  My rent is going up, so I should feel comfortable living in my apartment, even though they got here first, you know? I’m just unsure how to go about being more comfortable in our shared living spaces when he’s around. I’m afraid I’m going to say or do something and he’ll make a snarky/short comment about it. 

Basically, how do I go about feeling more comfortable in my own apartment? If I’m paying my fair share, I should be able to feel comfortable. Or is this just normal roommate problems and I’ll be fine for two more months? ",24Feb2019,1
694,"Hey everyone. Just seeking some perspective. 

I’m 23 about to turn 24 in a couple months (based in Australia) I’ve graduated in 2015 (major in advertising and branding) and was keen to get right into the work Force without a gap year or travelling or anything indulgent I guess. It’s good. I’ve saved up a bunch etc.

First job -Advertising for a big company - did it for 1.5 years and wanted a change. It was way too corporate and couldn’t stand sitting down all day in a boring and robot-like environment without any input. 

I’ve moved now to another state to another job. I have my girlfriend here of 6 years. Being away from family I’ve grown up a lot and really am enjoying being responsible for myself and my partner. However even though my new job pays more for arguably doing less... it’s sales based. Which I took just to get a head start in a new state. But I can’t do sales forever. I find it just as boring and dead end (no offence to those excelling in this field). 

I Know it’s hard to give advice without knowing me too well. But I just love everything culture, music, fashion and media ... all the industries where jobs aren’t as common. 

I put a lot of pressure on myself to have things sorted in a short period of time. I’ve contemplated opening my own business for a while as I don’t detest long hours. But I just don’t know what career is right for me. I’m at a place where a lot is falling in place except my work.

700,"Hi all! 
First-time poster looking for some advice regarding college and careers. I am currently attending for Mathematics, a subject I have been good at and enjoyed for many years. Recently I haven't been enjoying it as much and have been failing exams. I've been wondering for about a year now if I am doing the right thing. I'll be honest when I say I'm pursuing this for the money, not the enjoyment. Which everyone says is a terrible thing to do, but growing up in this shaky economy has made me a realist. I know I want to be comfortable financially, despite what I do for work. I have 2 years of financial aid left and I feel like I'm already halfway there, I should just finish my degree. I know I CAN do it but I suspect I would continue being miserable. 

What I REALLY love to do is sing. I am also a good singer. I will not be humble here, MANY have told me this, even professionals. So much so that it's become a broken record to me. I'm getting my studio up and running this week. Just bought a new audio interface so that I can connect my mics and keyboard to my laptop. I'm going to make some recordings in my free time but it would be unpractical for me to make a living doing it because I don't like the bar scene, I'm an early riser and thus, early to bed and who really makes a decent living as a singer without being famous? In my dream of all dreams, I'd love to be a voice actor/singer. Hello, Disney? Can I be the next princess? 

I love to cook and many people have told me that my food is delicious. I have considered opening a restaurant, as I have been working in the service industry for over 10 years and think I could be successful. I've even created a menu and chosen a theme. This would be loads of fun for me to start, but then I'd be at the mercy of the public. Hopefully, they'd enjoy my food as much as my friends and family do, but there is always a critic. This would be great, however, I don't have the credit to start that kind of venture. 

I also love working with dogs. I've been told my dogs are really well-behaved. They are my life, I already spend a majority of my time just hanging out with them and with a lot more training, my Corgi could do agility courses for sure. 

Ultimately, I'll probably just continue with school because I'm stubborn and MUST succeed. But I'm very interested to hear what anyone has to say that isn't biased. It's difficult to get advice from friends who don't want me to leave school, my husband who will support me in anything as long as I'm happy, or my family which is filled with teachers, lawyers, and musicians.

There’s this cute girl that sits in front of me in one of my college classes. She’s really pretty and cute. I mean really cute. I watch her interact with others (creepy, I know) and she’s always so nice to everybody. That makes me like her even more. Of course I can’t talk to her.

To me it symbolizes my general failure at life. I’m afraid she’d get creeped out and maybe even worried for her safety if I tried to talk to her. There’s yet another girl that’s off limits to me.

705,"As the title says, I feel like I'm becoming depressed again and I don't know what to do or who to reach out to. I've never been actually diagnosed with depression, but I'm pretty sure I've gone through it before.

A little background: When I was in middle school, I had a pretty rough time. I'd try to talk to my mom about how I was feeling, but I'd pretty much always get dismissed. It got to the point of self harm, and when I told my mom about it, asking for help, all she did was buy me a few crosses and sage the house, believing that it was some sort of spirit in my house that was making me feel down. It wasn't until someone alerted the school that I was on the verge of killing myself that they actually tried to do something about it. I had probably three meetings with a therapist before I stopped going. I never felt comfortable around therapists or talking about my feelings. The only thing I've ever been diagnosed with is insomnia. Every since then, I keep going back and forth between feeling fine and feeling depressed.

Current: Recently, I've been feeling like sh\*t to say the least. I'll be exhausted all day but I can't sleep at night. I never want to get out of bed and I just want to sleep for weeks or disappear. I get random panic/anxiety attacks over the stupidest things. I can't focus and just feel down almost all the time. I never really want to do anything. It's getting to the point to where it's affecting my boyfriend. He hates seeing me down all the time and believes that I'm depressed. I can't help but feel like it's an overreaction by calling it depression.

I don't know how to get help or who to talk to. Any time I talk to my mom about anything, I get dismissed. Last time I tried to talk to her, I told her that I was feeling angry for no reason. The best I could describe it as was ""red hot anger."" She said it was just hormones and brushed it off saying that everyone feel angry occasionally. However, it wasn't occasional. One thing would go wrong and I'd get pissed and want to hit something, but every time I was thankfully able to control it. I can't talk to my parents about things and I'm terrified to go back to a therapist. I don't feel safe with therapists.

Are there any resources that y'all know of that I can use to get help? I want to get better, but I know I won't be able to get an appointment to get diagnosed or medicated for anything because my parents will just brush it off (or my mom will try to say that her essential oils will help). Worst case I wait until I'm off at college to get help, but I don't want to wait that long (I'm currently a senior in high school). I want help and I want to get better. I'm sick and tired of being exhausted all the time and feeling like I want to die or disappear. I want to see the joy in life again, but I don't know who to turn to. I want help, but I'm scared to get it.

TL;DR: I've struggled with what I believe is depression on and off for a few years. I'm terrified and uncomfortable around therapists, but I want to get better. Anytime I try to get help from my parents, I get brushed off. I know that I'm not going to be able to get in with a doctor to get diagnosed with anything or medicated.

So I need a new ultrabook for coding as my 2013 Acer one can't handle Chrome + VS Code anymore, I am looking for anything for up to 1200$ that has a more Premium fell ultrabook, so I came to the options of: 

\- Macbook Pro 2017 entry non touchbar Apple refurbished (i5 256ssd 8gb) (1100$\~)

\- XPS 9370 refurbished  (13.5"" 4k touchscreen, 16gb ram 512ssd I7 8th gen) (1200$)

\- Thinkpad x1 Carbon 6th gen (14"" UHD, 16gb ram 512ssd i7 8th gen) (1800$\~, looking for a refurbished one also, some were ranging for 1400$ sometime ago, a bit over the price)

&amp;#x200B;

My use would be for Web programming mainly, with React js and sometimes .net core. Other than that, general web browsing, and I may use it to draw with photoshop. 

&amp;#x200B;

I currently own a iphone and Ipad, so that would make it feel like the Macbook would be the obvious choice. But the macbook packs a weak processor for its price, and an issued keyboard that may break anytime, which scares me.

The XPS from Dell is known for having faulty motherboard, and some people say that even tho its keyboard is better than the Macbook, it is still defective and do not have a great fell.

And the Thinkpad x1, which is said to have the best keyboard ever, but is also said to have issues with the screen across its models and keyboard issues.

710,"It started as a great friendship that developed over time. We were best friends. This last year I developed a crush on her and messed up a whole lot of stuff. I told every friend I had and asked for advice and she ended up finding out through our mutual friends. I tried patching it up by asking if it would be possible just to talk about it and she was reluctant. I was very hurt by the fact that she did not want to speak about it at all with me. I chose that I did not need that kind of pain and chose to leave her out of my friendships by not contacting her or speaking to her regularly like we had done in a daily basis for about 2 years. 

Recently at a party she asked me why I was being awkward around her, and we ended up telling each other how much we actually missed each other. That we both really realized what we were missing when we didn’t have each other. I told her that we should talk again in private, sober, to try and patch things up for real. She was up for it and we talked about it. She told me that she would not change her view on me as a friend and that she wished that we only should be friends again. I told her yes but i have no idea if my feelings would return.

This is only one day later and my feelings for her are already returning. I have no idea how to figure this out and if only it was as easy as shutting them off I would’ve.  I have this hope deep inside of me wishing that one day she will realize we are great for each other.

What should i do? How should I approach her? I don’t wanna mess up with this cuz i think it’s too personal but ITS WRONG!!! i’ve been cheated before so i was very disappointed now and added to that, she’s my little sister. Please help me guys. ",24Feb2019,0
712,"Hi all,

So I’m sure this is pretty silly but I could really use the advice of some outsiders here.

Wednesday is my “Golden birthday” meaning I’ll be 27 on the 27th. I have been waiting a long time for this birthday just bc I’ve played up so much when I was little. My wife and I took off and we’re going to a nice spa and then heading over to NYC to 1 of the 9 places (and the only place on the east coast) that serve authentic Japanese Wagyu Beef (Kobe).

The cost for 9oz is around $225. You can do 3oz for like $75. 

We do pretty well for ourselves so it’s not like we’re going to break the bank going but at the same time $225 is a good amount of money and after getting another dinner and maybe an app it will total to around $375. 

Is this just too insane to spend on a meal? Has anyone ever had Japanese Kobe steak and could recommend if the price is worth it? I want to make this day special and we are good/cooking enthusiast so this would be really special.

Thanks anyone for some insight. ",24Feb2019,1

This is an update to a previous post!^

I had been dating a boy for 7 months whilst recovering from a sexual assault by a coworker.

My bf was also a coworker, and in a friend group with the guy who assaulted me. I didn’t think it would be that bothersome until I got to a stage in my recovery where I needed to know that the guy who hurt me wouldn’t be a part of my life in any way, so I asked my bf to end his friendship with the guy, in order to help me. When he said no, and after a long, painful conversation, I told him that I needed to do what was best for myself and separate myself from the problem, and now he has decided to be a part of the problem, so I had to separate myself from him as well. 

He said he understood where I was coming from, and we ended things. I’ve been happier and more confident since!

Tl;dr I broke up with a bf who didn’t respect me ",24Feb2019,182
