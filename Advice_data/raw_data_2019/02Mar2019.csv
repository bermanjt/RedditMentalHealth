0,"First of all I'm a male and I'm not gay, we have been playing together for 5 years, but for a while now, we are just not in touch anymore, there is this bad negative vibe and I end up sad after every conversation we have, it is always end up in a bad way or bitter way not to mention the toxicity that recently we had as I joined his group of friends... I'm considering removing him from all platform, but especially from Steam. I think it is a key for me to move on from my gaming life. It is hard, I have many good memories with him but I actually don't know what to do..... I just feel so attached to him, but we never met in life for example, but we played together and he was there for me when I was alone, altough he always tried to put me down in a jokingly way I guess, like telling me to kill myself or I'm autistic. I'm not sure. What to do guys?",02Mar2019,1
1,"So me and my girlfriend have been together for a while (long distance)  and we both have some exams coming up, she’s been spending a lot of time studying and revising which is good and I want her to do that yet we had originally a time at night set where we’d videocall and talk but now we don’t have that time as much anymore as she wants to study instead, I’m a very shy and nervous person and I always encourage her to study rather then spend time with me but deep down I just want to spend time with her, I suggested me staying away and giving her space until exams are over, she told me no and that she wanted me but times before she tells me that she wants to be on her own all the time so I don’t know what to do, I don’t want to make her any more stressed than she already is but it’s really bringing me down. I don’t want to be selfish and I want her to do well in life ",02Mar2019,1
2,"Hi, I'm an openly gay freshman at a high school. I recently began to taking a liking to one of the guys in my grade. I'm not sure if he is gay, and even if he is, I don't know if he likes me back. We're friends and so I'm afraid that if I tell him that I like him, he'll stop talking to me. What should I do?",02Mar2019,1
3,"Like many other families, mine is a blended one. My first husband and I split when our daughter was around 2 years old. Since then I've been trying to co-parent as best I can, but he doesn't seem to ever have his priorities straight. A few years ago I remarried, and my daughter calls her step-dad, dad. They are very close. He's always made a point to make her feel like she is important and loved. He calls her his daughter to any and  everyone. She knows who her birth dad is, and still sees him. We don't keep him away, and allow him to talk to her as much as he and she wants. 

My husband's family accepted her since day one. My mother in law has always called my daughter her grandchild and dotes on her as much as any grandma would. And so does my ex mother in law. Even after the split we managed to conintue to get along, and honestly stay friends. She loves her granddaughter, and dotes on her as well. 

But, as great as things have been, things have started to ripple. Last year our son was born. There was a small moment of nervousness knowing how excited my current MIL was about having a grandchild. When he was born she did try very hard to not make our daughter feel left out or less loved. She and the rest of my husband's family have done a very amazing job to not show favorites, or anything like that. Now I know at this point you are wondering, okay so what's the problem?

My daughter does still have a very great relationship with my ex's parents, as I said before. They are truly wonderful grandparents and a blessing in our lives. Whenever our daughter needs a single thing all I need to do is mention it to my MIL and/or ex MIL and it's taken care of. 

Recently I told them both that our daughter, who has had a growth spurt, was in desperate need of bras. I only mentioned it in passing as I talk to each one at least once a week. So, of course within a week there was a package sent to my daughter with new bras and other things from my ex MIL. Later that day, I just happened to be on the phone with my current MIL and mentioned it.  She asked me what my ex MIL had sent for our son, and I said nothing. 

She became really upset and went into this whole thing about how my ex MIL couldn't do that because it wasn't fair and showed favorites. I was just kinda taken back because I just don't see it that way. First our son is 10 months, so he obviously doesn't care right now. But also, my daughter's Grandma from her dad's side is hers. I just don't see why she would need to include my son. My ex MIL is a wonderful, kind person and has been very sweet in sending little things for the baby, she even gave us a very nice baby shower gift, and I'm extremely thankful for her. However I just don't agree with my MIL on this one. I told her I didn't agree and she was really rude about how I shouldn't allow favorites to be played with any of my kids. How if I allowed my ex MIL to do this would hurt my son down the road. 

Am I wrong? Should I talk to my ex MIL? Any advice?",02Mar2019,3
4,"I have this gym teacher in high school school teaching my gym class who is young, (30 I think) and she teaches physical education and English. She is a pretty cool teacher and nice. We will be about to do the swimming unit. When she was describing what stuff you need to bring she mentioned to the boys in the class that with the boys not wearing shirts she can see how you really look and how fit you really are so they will have to work harder. the comment doesn't bother me in the slightest , but if some kid who was around me decides to go cry about it, will she get in trouble? I talked to a friend of mine about it (who wasn't there) and he says it is wrong and she should get in trouble but I don't see why, I talked to another person and they said this was out of line and should be reported If she was actually doing anything then I would agree. I am not going to say anything, she is a really good and nice teacher and I will not get her in trouble. Would you feel uncomfortable by this comment?

6,"Alright. I made a throwaway account because I'd fear my personal security.

I've been thinking of asking r/Advice for a few hours now about something serious. After today, I'm getting vibes that my Orchestra teacher is either manipulating me in some way with some sort of goal in mind. I'll go back to the beginning and do a quick summary of how it's been building up.

**8th Grade**: She was my Orchestra teacher for the first time in 8th grade. She was just a normal teacher, but by the end of the year, she and I were, on occasion, watching funny videos during lessons. It wouldn't take up that much time, but we still watched some of these things on occasion. Then, when it came time for high school, we had auditions for Chamber Orchestra, which is the advanced Orchestra. I explained to her that I just didn't have time to do an audition and was wondering if there was another way to get in, but she just let me in without an audition. Trying to sound as least boastful as possible, I'm pretty much Chamber Orchestra-tier material, so I can play well. I just found it strange that she was willing to let me in like that. Nevertheless, I was grateful.

**9th Grade**: Not much has changed. We still watch some funny videos, but now just more often. Sometimes she'd have me come up on stage and watch some sort of funny video then.

**10th Grade**: 10th grade was pretty good in many ways. Sometimes I'd miss classes like P.E. for ""lessons,"" which became a small habit. I ended up making all my classes up and getting a 100 every quarter, but I definitely missed a decent amount of P.E. during the second semester. We'd continue to watch funny videos, and I think it's during the end of the year that we started talking about people. It was mostly people on Facebook in a group where they had complaints about the district. She started confiding in me about small issues she'd been having with students, too.

**11th Grade**: Oh boy. I'm in 11th grade right now. This year we've been a lot... closer... which sounds weird. That's because it is. She's always venting to me about this girl who's really good at cello but is one of the most obnoxious people to have ever walked this earth (quite literally). We'll call her Mary (not her real name). She's vented all about how Mary complains, and she's confided in me from things like Mary telling the AP that there was bullying going on (because there was, but Mary was doing most if it, so I could see why someone would want to vent about it, but to a student?) to Mary's attitude. I find her venting to be fair complaints, but I don't think she should be confiding in a student. Her trust worries me.

Recently, she's been talking about other things, too. We've been touching on politics, and she even had me sit down and watch the Michael Cohen Hearing while the other people in my lesson group were getting their instruments ready. We've just talked a lot about more people, and I've been getting a bit uncomfortable with it.

Oh, and she recently followed me on Instagram and has occasionally messaged me on Snapchat.

**What Made Me Write This**: After today, I realized that these things aren't normal. Here's why:

1. A meeting after school (Music Honors Society) ended, and she had me come into her office. First, she told me how our principal told her that someone said my teacher was talking about Mary. I didn't tell our principal. She then told me she didn't think it was me and listed a few other people. ""Maybe it was one of the freshman,"" she said. She continued by saying that the principal said it was alright that she was venting about this, which I seriously felt like was a lie. I'm almost positive she said this to make sure I hadn't said anything or wouldn't say anything, and that I would stay quiet.
2. After she made sure I didn't tell our principal about these conversations, she mocked Mary by saying she had a scratchy throat, saying she put her hands on her throat (and she proceeds to put her hands on her throat and say with a raspy voice, ""I can't talk. I need to go home""). All the while, she had the door closed so nobody could pick up on our conversation.
3. Her husband works for my dad, and APPARENTLY she heard from her husband that my dad refused to talk to him about back pay, and she proceeded to tell a good friend of my mom's. My mom's friend told my mom, and she didn't believe it because my dad would never do anything like that. He's the nicest man ever, and he has gained so much respect. Hell, he's a Brigadier General in the Army (retired). He wouldn't do anything like that! The problem is, my dad doesn't think her husband would say that, so now we're thinking that she's lying to other people. The fact that she's talking about my dad like this is really getting me upset.

I really need your opinions. What do you guys think? Any thoughts or contributions help! If you have any more questions, I'd be happy to answer them!

8,"Okay my parents decided to get us a puppy during December only if we promised we would get good grades. 

So, first semester passes and I ended up with two Bs and my parents were disappointed in me. I felt really bad about it but it was the best I could do. 

So anyways, second semester rolls around we we get a ton of snow days due to the storm. So far, I’ve had around 10 days of second semester. 

Side note: My parents are very strict on when I use my phones. I get my phone when I come back from school and I have to leave it in the kitchen when I go to sleep. 

Yesterday morning, I woke up and used my phone. My mom got very angry at me and started shouting at me even though I did nothing wrong. I always walk to school by myself and I was never tardy . When I got back, my phone was gone. When my mom came back,  I asked her for my phone but she refused because of what I did in the morning. I got very pissed and just went to my room. 

So anyways, my mom checked my grade later and was very angry that I got a B in AP chemistry. I was still frustrated that they don’t understand the grading system and how things are weighted. I only took one quiz and got a 8.5/10. It was the Same for other classes. There was only one assignment in the grade book that dragged my grades down. I told her that it was the beginning of the semester and not to worry. She just wouldn’t listen to me! 

She keeps telling me how I’m too lazy and I waste my time on my phone instead of studying over the break we had. I already finished my hw and I didn’t want to study. 

Anyways, I locked myself in my room with my dog and cried. My mom later gave me my phone and told me to never call her “mom”again. Later, I heard my brothers tell me that my mom was selling the dog online. I could not tell you guys how angry and sad I felt. 

This just boils my blood. I don’t know what to do. 

TLDR: My mom is selling my dog because of my “bad” grades.

17,"I'm usually pretty positive and resilient, but I guess my friend died recently and my other friend is on his death bed and I've been feeling extremely lonely and unloved, and I'm not sure if that's a symptom of mourning or if it's brought on by something else but it's making me feel quite depressed.

Before this, I went through a terrible horny stage (i think my hormones might be messed up) and it's like now that I came down from that high I've crashed and now I'm just sad and lonely. I have a history of sex addiction so I know that mainly happens when I'm trying to avoid something thats bothering me. I get addicted to human touch when I get so lonely, to fill that empty void in my soul, but it never works.

And the thing is I'm not lonely, nor am I unloved, in fact I've been joining clubs, making efforts to go out when people ask me to, plus my parents are living with me temporarily and our relationship has been good, so I'm definitely not alone. 

But for example, last night after I got home from badminton and the bar after, I felt incredibly lonely - more lonely than before I went. And I don't know why, maybe it's because I don't have a deeper connection with those people or not, but I don't think so because I haven't had a deep connection with anyone for many years, and was quite content with superficial relationships before etc.

I don't know what's wrong. I keep making more effort to socialize, and when it gets turned down (for example i cant find anyone to go to the bar and dance with me tonight) then I feel even more depressed, but the weird thing is I don't even like bars and I've never wanted to go to one to dance before so I don't know why my loneliness is bothering me so much right now.",02Mar2019,1

20,"Warning : Cringe and annoying blunder material

About a month back I tried to get in contact with someone who I used to know 3 years ago in an online roleplaying group. At the time I was just an annoying kid who rambled too much about my own thing and liked to latch on to people as parental figure due to abusive parents and lack of social skills (I was homeschooled till 16 and no good role models) and I annoyed her the hell out. I realised that and stopped talking to her.

After a while she unfriended me on Facebook due to inactivity. So I went back and asking her about the unfriend. She added me again, and unfriended me again after a while for some reason. So last month I tried to get in contact and get a clear picture on why she unfriended me. She blocked me immediately.

Then a mutual friend said she spammed multipost rants about how annoying I was and the things I rambled to her 2 years ago, how rude and awful I am for asking her about unfriending. She showed my name too. A lot of many things.. I talked with a mutual friend to clear that up for a bit and she removed my name and some posts.


During the years I haven't talked to her I have been trying hard to improve my social skills and emotional issues. Especially coming to live independently I am not around with roleplaying community anymore. Most of my friends said that I've changed and improved a lot. Pretty much a consensus now.

But from her rant.. she said that while I showed self awareness I'm still rude and I changed nothing in term of behaviour I claimed to.. she said that I am delusional. Going on about how it offends her so much for me to want to add her on Facebook. Of course I get her reasoning, and I feel the need to be guilty because she got so upset over it.. I was on the wrong too, of course it's pretty weird and creepy to just try to add someone on Facebook who  used to get in an argument and bad situation before, especially we don't really share the same social space anymore. For me I just wanted a perhaps a reconciliation, I didn't say a lot or moan or go out about anything. But I can see how asking about unfriending can be a bit too demanding for me.

But at times I can't fully feel like I'm responsible for all of it, I feel like she blew the situation up too much and for me it's better to talk and try to get some understanding. Of course people do things in a different way. 


To be honest, I want to take it as a lesson of reinforcement how awful and annoying I could be to people back then to improve myself even more. BUT I kind of see her in the wrong too and how she dealt with the situation didn't seem mature...

I tried to change myself, and now I'm still trying to change myself. But now I wonder what's going to matter if for some people. They're not going to change their mind to appreciate that. I do have a lot of friends.. I just can't stand to have a spot of someone who actively dislike me. I feel so flawed about it

I wonder about my friends' judgement of me how they thought I got better. Then out of the blue she said I didn't.. am i an imposter? Why do my friends even like me, why do they think I'm better?

**I don't know how to assess the whole thing anymore the situation just fucked with my head. Just ridden with shame and how I feel like I wasn't given a chance to change. A month after J still couldn't move on yet**

One of my friends friend told me perhaps I should reframe to situation as being me trying to forgive her instead of hoping she'd forgive me to move on. It feels better, I feel more in control but But since she got upset first, HOW can she be wrong? Of course she hurted my feeling but I deserved it because she said it just as a reaction of me bothering her... Isn't it going to be more 'delusional' to pur her on wrong side?

It feels like she just won the fight and I'm supposed to feel guilty regardless how much I feel it's unfair.

Am I going to look like someone without self awareness and humility for moving on and not caring about it. And since she blocked me there's nothing I can do but not caring.

What do you think of the situation? What should I do or think about it? Why I can't move on from someone who's not even that close at all, literally internet rando? Perhaps she's very loud and angry about it and I want to fix my reputation.


I've been up and down between not caring and ruminating over it for a month. I am sick of trying to please and attend to everyone's feeling now but I know it's partly my fault too.

And no matter how much I change myself, she can't see it anymore.

21,"I know there are so many families out there dealing with drama, but it's especially hard if abuse is involved.

So a little backstory: my mom, aunt, and uncle were really fucked up by my grandparents. They all abuse substances to get by. My aunt, however, has become a raging alcoholic. She burned the bridge on our relationship in the past but what she's doing presently just takes the cake.

Here's where it gets shady: her and my cousin were on a trip with some family friends and drinking was involved, words were exchanged, and then my aunt got mad at something my cousin said and shoved her into a door frame with enough force to leave a bruise from shoulder to elbow. Her friends had to hold her back as she yelled at my cousin that she wished she punched her in the face. Now my cousin has dealt with verbal abuse and my aunt dropping all her bad vibes onto her for her entire life. But as far as I know, this was the first time things got physical. 

My aunt later sent an email that I saw which said that my cousin and my sister (who is undergoing treatment for mental health after a breakdown at college, mind you) are cut off from financial help. This is where it gets tricky because they are relying on that help to get by as they're gearing up for school. My cousin just got accepted and my sister wants to go back. My aunt likes to do this shady tactic where she offers assistance, gives you an ultimatum, and if you dont do it she takes away everything. 

I've stepped in for support for those two with advice and such but I can't help financially. Sure these two need to grow up and realize a second job and loans are an option, but I'm worried because the last time I spoke with my cousin she said she'd put up with the abuse so she can get through school.

I'm also very protective of my sister. Her and I have been through a lot of shit and I've taken many a blow to keep her safe. But I'm at a loss. I feel like they wouldn't have told me the situation or the details if they didnt truly need help. I've told them repeatedly they can get by without the help, that that part of the family is toxic, that the aunt needs an intervention. But I don't know what to do from here on out. 

I understand they're adults, but It's very hard to sit with this information. What should I do??",02Mar2019,1

23,"I really didn’t want to have to post anywhere for advice but I’m lost for what to do anymore.

Basically here’s a little backstory - when I was younger my mum let me each whatever she didn’t give a damn what I was eating, as I got older my other family member started verbally abusing me about my weight (I wasn’t even overweight) they’d constantly tell me I was fat, ugly, worthless and might as well kill myself (they told me this EVERYDAY) so it was normal for me to believe this I pretty much stopped eating as much as I could I lost a lot of weight which leads me to where I am now ‘extremely’ underweight. 

Basically me, my mum and sister moved house meaning we had to swap our local doctors I had to go in for a like information check my mom told me before we went in that they had to weigh me and I’d definitely come out underweight and that she thinks I need to eat more, we went in and I got weighed they calculated my BMI and I apparently was seriously underweight the doctor was asking me questions to do with my diet however, my mum answered every single question herself not allowing me to speak as before we went in she had told me if they ask about what I eat to just say I eat very healthy and do a lot of exercise when in reality I eat 400 calories max a day and do a decent amount of exercise she pretty much forced me to lie. It broke me knowing my mum didn’t want me to receive help so I just left the doctors like nothing was wrong.. I don’t know what happened but I went from not eating enough and burning off the calories to not eating enough and throwing up the calories. My mum complains when I don’t eat and complains when I do eat food I like so I kind of decided why not just throw away food she said I have to eat then I’m technically not eating, meaning I’ll pretty much starve to death and in all honesty I couldn’t care less if I die or not.

Idk what to do don’t even know what type of advice I’m looking for because I mean I want to get better I guess but at the same time I’d rather just die early so I don’t have to see my family at all.

Also no way in hell could I talk to my mum about an eating disorder because she thinks she’s the best mum in the world I stg you say one thing to her and she’ll breakdown and act as if you just told her something traumatic and she’ll come up with all the reasons why I wouldn’t have an eating disorder because ‘she raised me perfect’. Also can’t speak to my dad about it because my mother brainwashed me that he was a horrible and abusive man who I shouldn’t speak to and ended up loosing all contact with him..

Honestly I need advice on what to do because I’d find it pretty amusing if I died from starvation but I also don’t really want to die that much

My hacked concern is that it seems as though the last two messages were sent within minutes of me using my ipad... I tried to have private accounts for porn and sexually messaging people that I only used my ipad for... I have never given my phone number out and I only had gmail and reddit accounts that I was using on that ipad... I did have to set up that gmail account with a phone number, but then I removed it from that account and I kept that account separate from my regular account.

&amp;#x200B;

This is also an old ipad that I have not been able to update in a long time... I am concerned that I may have run into malware issues...

&amp;#x200B;

A few more embarrassing details:

&amp;#x200B;

A while back I was using DoubleList, which does require a phone number when registering. I was also using Grindr, which I cannot remember if that asked for a phone number or not...

&amp;#x200B;

I had received an email through DoubleList asking me to reply to my own email... I freaked out, changed my passwords and deleted all of my accounts associated with that and I did a factory reset on my ipad. However, I did link that email to my actual email and to my phone number before deactivating, just so that I could set up 2-step verification and get notifications in case anyone tried accessing it. This was months ago and that email should be completely gone (I have tried messaging it through other accounts and I get an error sent back instantly that it doesn't exist).

&amp;#x200B;

Then I made another gmail and grindr account, but after messaging with someone who was obviously a scam over grindr, I deleted everything again...

&amp;#x200B;

I reset my ipad again, I even took it into an apple store and paid for them to reset it. They assured me that it shouldn't have any malware on it and that a reset would completely clean it, whether they do it or I did.

&amp;#x200B;

I started using the ipad again, but only with gmail and reddit, as I previously stated.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever I watch porn with PornHub, the first link would always redirect me to a web page which I instantly closed before it could load and open pornhub in a new tab, and it would not do that again unless I closed the new pornhub tab.

&amp;#x200B;

I only started receiving these text messages after the most recent reset, when I tried to be extra private with my information. One was sent in the middle of the day while I was at work. The second was sent pretty soon after getting onto reddit/gmail on my ipad, however, the link was typed incorrectly and did not show blue (or they were trying to trick me into responding). The most recent text came while I was trying to delete that reddit account, but I kept receiving a weird error... This text did have a working link.

&amp;#x200B;

I have never clicked on the links or responded to the texts. I have reported them to my cellphone provider through their scam reporting options and their scam text service, as well as to the FTC. I cannot report the numbers to the FCC because they aren't real phone numbers... I also blocked the numbers, took a screenshot, and deleted the texts...

&amp;#x200B;

Other than these texts, and the fact that I get at least 1 scam phone call a day (which seems increased, but isn't unusual), I have not received anything malicious or with my personal information attached.

&amp;#x200B;

How concerned should I be that my information has been compromised? Is there anything else that I can or should do to protect myself?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for any help!

&amp;#x200B;

I should point out that the first text was almost a month ago, but the next two were within a week of each other and very recent/weeks after the first.

32,"Background: So there's me, call me M, and there's this girl I met in the first week of college, call her F. So we hit it off, friends for a few weeks then start dating. This goes well for some while and we become best friends. Then we break up but remain friends for some while. I realize I am still in love with her and I can't bear being friends with her because I want to be with her. So I isolate myself from her and the rest of my friends as they are mutuals. There are other reasons that I also isolated and I just hung around with that group of friends just to be with F. This goes for a few months and then I get the courage to ask her out again. She says yes. We are planning our date but it's hard coz she's super busy. I run into one of our mutual friend and he attacks me for leaving the group. I tell him the other reasons why I left and not that I still love F. He obviously realises his mistake since am in the right and gets super pissed, I try to talk logically to him but he doesn't listen. He goes and talks to F and next thing I know F puts in a complaint with the dean of campus life saying that I tried to bury her alive. Dean calls me in and he knows me really well and we talk and I explain that I would never do something like that. He believes. F then requests a no contact directive which I willingly sign since am pretty angry at F.


Currently: F and I have a meeting with the dean next month to discuss our relationship and the no contact directive. It's most likely that F would wish that I join the friend group again which was extremely draining and toxic. I will ask for another no contact directive, one that lasts forever. Neither of us want this, but it's good for both of us. She's obviously gonna resist and then I'll ask her "" Do you think am sadistic? I believe you know me well enough to know that there's nothing sadistic about my actions. This is my at my masochist."" This is what Bill from Kill Bill says to the Bride before shooting her in the head. This dialogue conveys the situation perfectly. I just wanna know if this would be a good idea.

33,"I’m graduating in May with my Bachelor’s of Science degree in Biology. My university has a graduation ceremony they call commencement for some reason, and you have to sign up ahead of time to participate in it. 

I’m sort of jaded towards the whole thing for a few reasons. For one, it takes weeks post graduation to get the actual degree in the mail, and they just give you a fake one for show at the ceremony. Secondly, it sounds boring— I’m gonna be sitting there for like 2 hours while I listen to speeches I don’t care about. Thirdly, I’m sort of off graduation ceremonies after high school because my high school graduation ceremony was a huge shitshow, but that’s another story. Finally, I have an asston of relatives nearby, one of which works at the university I go to, and I have a cousin that goes to the same university. I’m just sort of shy and don’t like being the center of attention and I don’t want a fuss raised over me.

However, this derision of the whole thing has some trying to talk me into it. My older sister didn’t do graduation and my mom is trying to suggest that I should be with my fellow biology students (many of whom I know as close colleagues), and part of me wonders if she wants to see one of her kids walk at graduation. I’ve also had several other seniors tell me I’d regret not doing it and that I “worked too hard to skip out on this.” Even my therapist told me I’d regret not going but I don’t know why. 

TLDR I’m really iffy about signing up to walk at graduation despite personal qualms. What exactly WOULD I be regretting by not walking? Should I show solidarity and be there with my fellow bio majors? We have a relatively small class of biology majors (my capstone only had 14 people, myself included, though there were other capstone classes) so most of us know each other. Do I do it just to make mom happy? Do I say fuck it all?

I understand this is all a personal decision but input would be welcome. Thanks.",02Mar2019,2
34,"My life is shit. I suck at everything i do. I have crappy genetics both in looks and physical health. Socially i never developed, never made friends. Depression and anxiety since high school thats only gotten worse. Lots of self harm and hatred of myself, a few near suicide attempts. Nothing ever changes, things don't get easier or better. I'm just a useless fuckhead with no basic human skills whatsoever and can't do jack shit right.

Oh and i'm attracted to young girls. That alone is enough for me to end my life. Why does everything bad happen to me, why couldn't I be one of the normal people. This world truly is better off without me.

37,"I’m in my late 20’s and a few months ago began a new job at a retail store as a stock/customer service employee..

There’s this pretty attractive cashier that works there who’s my in her mid 20’s, and she introduced herself to be by asking what dessert she thinks she should purchase..

I’m very private and come across serious/unapproachable, so I was surprised she did this..

Anyways, when I’m at work I naturally find myself looking at her as I’m working or walking by etc... never staring, but looking for 2-3 seconds maximum, and then continuing on with my walk..

This will happen maybe every 10-ish minutes during work.. Here and there I’ll catch her looking at me, but not too often..

We never have conversations since were in different departments, and I’m just so guarded atm so I don’t strike up any personal convos... She’s just very attractive, and pleasant to look at to be honest..

I even would coordinate breaks so that we could be in the break room together... I’ll just notice when she is away from her department, then go in there shortly after.. I stopped doing that mostly just so I don’t weird her out.

Like do you think this would all make her feel? Would she somehow think I am like a stalker or something?

How do you think she perceives me?

38,"I’m a 24 year old straight guy I’ve always had a weird sexuality, when I was in kindergarten I had a wet dream-like experience where I would orgasm in my sleep usually right before waking up and always when laying on my stomach, however I didn’t cum bc I clearly wasn’t old enough. These involved several (recurring) voyeuristic scenarios, one where me and my classmates were all required to climb over and examine the frozen forms of the female bus drivers whose clothes had vanished when time froze, and another one where all students were required to go through this “toll booth” on the way into school which was paid for by peeing. Now the bus driver dream was the first one after I had learned that women had vaginas. Prior to that I had no knowledge of females and believed that they also had penises except they never got pubes. Around that time I had one about a series of naked girls at the beach too, however this was a normal wet dream. So originally in the toll booth one, which was the most frequent recurring scenario, the girls had penises too and I would pee in a urinal next to the girl I liked with no divider. Later this changed to a setup with both a toilet and a urinal. There was always a fully clothed teacher or attractive volunteer parent monitoring, which I liked. This had all started with sort of a “prologue” series when I was 2, where I was in my local mall with a several bathtubs on display in the middle of the indoor pavilion, and then one time there was always a girl in one of them who had presumably been trying to take a bath in it (in the middle of the mall for whatever reason) and then she came-to right as I was walking by and wanted to get out and presumably put her clothes back on, but she kept slipping and staying in the tub, and then finally I got there and saw this and she was trying to get out of the wet tub while keeping her body covered, so I offered to help her knowing I’d get to see her body and so I did and when she got up I saw that not only did she have a penis (as again I thought all girls did during the time period of this dream), and not only did that penis have a hot dog slice around the bottom of the glans where that little ridge of skin is in real life, but she actually had two penises growing from the same hairless crotch (she was probably in her 20s), both with hot dog slices around the bottom of the glans.

I mostly forgot about this and my sexuality however was normal until 6th grade when my classmates began to develop breasts and I started masturbating. I began jerking off to pictures of them on a regular basis. Eventually of course I saw my fair share of tits, plus I already had seen porn, so what I noticed is that all dudes even those with tits have small areolas, no more than about 1.25 inches across. Many girls also have this, and I find that many of these girls are the ones who have no problem baring their tits in public. Now many women who are overweight tend to have large areolas, I suspect because their boobs were once smaller. However I have found that completely randomly and unpredictably someone will have larger 1.5” or above areolas who is skinny, and who maybe doesn’t even have large breasts at all. I found that these girls tended to be much more reserved, not only about baring their nipple but really displaying a more conservative and/or conservative feminist (clear difference between these two despite their similarities) attitude toward their breasts in general.

But I was still pretty normal sexually but I guess just years of running out of material has left me with this: the only thing that gets my libido going these days is a chance to add to my mental database of what everyone I know from work, college, middle and high school, and summer camp’s nipples look like, specifically the size and shape of their areola. Anything that does not add to this database doesn’t interest me, including pictures of and/or sex with people I know who’s nipples I already have seen.

Now I don’t actively pursue this, because that would be creepy, I can’t control my brain but I can control my actions and I would never do anything stupid because rapists are the scum of the earth. However that doesn’t mean I don’t have an issue regarding my libido, I will be moving away soon and having relationships/hookups/fwb with these people from middle and high school, college, summer camp, and work will no longer be an option. I also know that my new job will not be a place to pursue relationships. So I will need a solution to this problem. How can I “reset” my libido?",02Mar2019,1
39,"I’m 31 female and I am in a challenging situation at work with a customer who constantly pushes limits and seems to be in control of the relationship with my company - always a power struggle with the customer.

My manager leaves it up to me to make a lot of decisions, but I’m not a manager so I don’t know how much power I have. 

My coworker (on a team I work very closely with) contacted me today and laid out some very valid concerns she has - co worker feels like I’m giving the customer too much (this is true) and I’m not saying no to the customer enough. She also told me that she doesn’t want the customer making my life a living hell and didn’t want me to lose my sanity. What she told me was hard to hear, but I needed to hear what she had to say, and I’m weighing the best way to move forward. I don’t think she meant it as such, but it felt like a blow to my ego.

42,"Ok this might be a long post but idk I just need to rant. One of my friends. (I’ll call her Julia for the sake of the story). Her parents are both very controlling. Her dad is an atheist but Her mom is a very strict Muslim and insists that she doesn’t do anything to go against their religion. However, Julia has recently been hooking up with a guy she works with (I’ll call him Tom). Her dad soon found out about this and was not very happy. A few nights ago, at like 2am Julia phoned me. Her dad was messaging her, asking her to come to his room so they could “talk” about what she did with Tom. She told me her father has done stuff to her in the past. He even borrowed her laptop once to watch incest porn and didn’t clear the history. She kept messaging him saying she didn’t want to come to his room but he threatened to tell her mom about Tom. I kept telling her that she needed to leave her house. I’m away at university right now so I felt kinda helpless, but one of our other friends (Amanda) was parked right outside of her house and said Julia could stay with her. Amanda and I kept pleading her to leave but she wouldn’t listen. Eventually Julia told me she was gonna go to his room and hung up on me. I didn’t know what to do and neither did Amanda. We wanted to phone the police but were afraid we would make things worse. Eventually I went to sleep and the next morning Julia called me and told me what her father did. She said her father tried to justify it by saying “this is what happens if you keep hooking up with boys”. Julia told me she started cutting herself afterwards and felt like she wanted to die. Her dad said she has to quit her job now and stop seeing Tom. Eventually, Julia decided to go behind her dad’s back and just tell her mom about Tom. Her mom was furious. She also told Julia to quit her job. I keep telling Julia to just leave and go live with Amanda. However, Julia’s parents took $9000 from her for “safe keeping” and she doesn’t want to leave unless she can get it back. Also she cares about her mom and siblings as well. She feels bad for her mom because she has had to put up with her dad for  18 years. Also, she is worried her dad will do the same thing to her younger sister. I really want to help her but I have no idea how. Sorry if this post was super unorganized.

47,"Hello, so I need a little bit of advice to help my sister.
My sister is younger than me by a few years. She is a freshman right now. We recently shifted ro a new country so she is in a completely new place, not that we aren't used to this. As she has been growing up, I made sure I shared all my secrets and personal stuff with her to ensure her that she can trust me. As she cane in middle school, this trust allowed her to talk to me and share her problems but for the couple months or so, i  have been noticing that she is hiding her texts, and would hardly ever talk about anything that happens-at school or her thoughts.  

A few of her friends from the previous place have been contacting me and telling me stuff about what she is feeling and doing, as they too realize it sint healthy and need my help.

The problem is:
1)Our parents are strictly against dating until after highschool, they believe that dating distracts students.

2) Thattt is literally the case with her... she doesnt focus on her studies but instead would follow her crush, try to contact them, even after being told no several times. 

I am no longer in school so cannot keep an eye on her. I want to know how I can help her understand that dating isn't the best in situations where she would study, and focus on her mental health first.

The problem with her ""wanting"" to date dudes is she forgets that her self respect and approval doesnt rely on this ONE person. She is always flattered by any attention and any nice behaviour and comment will make her believe that she likes said person or they like her.
Last time she wanted to date a boy who was manipulating her, the small ""making her wait for hours before texting"", ""ignoring her in classes"", but when alone giving her full attention.

I just need her to stop depending on guys like they give her oxygen to breathe.
I know that its her life but I know she needs help with all this growing up but is afraid of our parents.

Is there some way that you suggest me to handle this situation? Should I confront her about it all saying ""I know whats up""?

I know this is very long, but any help and I mean even the littlest of all help would be appreciated!

I really don't know what to do",02Mar2019,2

We weren’t fighting but I had to leave. I just couldn’t take it anymore. Now I’m at a loss at what to do. I don’t want to live at home anymore. I’m diagnosed with GAD and medicated but I have a LOT of breakthrough anxiety, SOB and burn out from my job. Right now my sister is singing loudly out of key and my dad had his TV full blast watching an old Western. I want to just SCREAM. Do I move back in with the toxic partner?? Get a shitty studio apartment and lose a lot of my money? I wish I could get a place with my mother but she’s an addict and constantly asks for money or alcohol... Am I being a baby?! 2 years ago my stepdad died suddenly and I haven’t been the same since. Anxiety kicked into high gear and I can’t function like I used to.",02Mar2019,2
50,"My workplace has over-hired and there’s never enough work for everyone. Business varies, but I spend anywhere from 5-20 hours a week desperately looking for either something to do or, sadly, something to make it look like I’m busy.

I’m not the only one in this situation, but this place is so damn passive that nobody says anything!! There’s a big list of “chores”, mostly cleaning, but it’s all bs stuff to fill time generally. 

I brought it up once with my boss and she looked confused and finally gave me a small project to work on for that day. Nobody recognizes this as an ongoing problem... I get the impression if I did tell my boss that, she wouldn’t know what to do with me because as I said, nobody makes this a issue.

Turnover is high here for a number a reasons, the biggest being a lack of advancement opportunities. So I doubt anyone cares much about fixing the problem; they just tough it out for a year and move on.

Sadly that seems to be the solution to most workplace issues... get a new job.

Unfortunately I really can’t do that anytime soon for a number of reasons. 

The main reason I haven’t brought this up (again) with my boss is that I just get the impression she wouldn’t know what to do about it or may not even have the power to do that. The attitude with management seems to be if the work gets done, nothing else matters. I guess I feel like they’re not going to be motivated to solve the problem because it’s not affecting them. I thought about talking to the VP, but I’m not even sure what to say because I also don’t have any specific solutions to offer... I don’t really know what options there are. 

Any ideas at all on how I can broach the subject , who I should talk to, anything?

TL;DR - I don’t have enough real work at work due to overstaffing and (at least middle) management doesn’t seem to care; what can I do besides look for a new job?",02Mar2019,1
51,"**Background:**

I have a parent who has ended up in a situation where they need 24/7 caregiving. They are actually not elderly (under 60).  This condition has effected them mentally and physically. There is a lot of work to be done to care for them (hospital visits, tests, and round the clock care).

However I live in the same country but a far away state. Also, my relationship with this parent is very peculiar. When I grew up we became detatched, physically and emotionally. Barely spoke. Obviously there are past issues that brought us to that point. 

I don't hold any hard feelings toward my parent, however, our past simply didn't create a strong emotional bond like other ""normal"" relationships. It did the opposite.

**Current:**

Long story, short. They are now in need ofconstant care, and I have no idea what to do being so far away. It's been almost a year since this happened to them and I have only visited them just a couple times. I keep in contact with other relatives to make sure they are okay, but have not really spoken to my parent directly, visited them or been involved with immediate decisions. 

I'm torn and feel an extreme amount of guilt over this. I want what's best for the parent, but have not been able to suddenly turn on the switch to be emotionally and physically close to them in this time of need after so much of our relationship has been damaged. I also live miles away. This was a sudden health accident and both my parent and I are relatively young. It's not like taking care of an elderly parent. I would have to walk away from a life that has barely gotten started to care for them. The health accident is also the result of lack of self care on their part (preventable). On top of this, the disconnect I have is not just with the parent, it's with most of the family, which I guess you can say I ran away from. Taking care of the parent means going back into that family situation, since they are still around the parent and doing most of the work.

**Question:**

 I'm not holding a grudge or acting in retaliation, but the bond that would bring most families together in this situation, just isn't there for us. I still love my parent and want what's best for them, but it's the actions that I can't do adn it's bringing guilt.

I’ve been really close with Alice since I know her and she means a lot to me and I mean a lot to her. We have always been there for each other. We don’t see each other often but we talk a lot on WhatsApp. About 2 months ago I got to know Luna better and we started to call a couple of times a week. One time while I was calling with Luna I talked about how Alice had a boyfriend for about a week now. And I probably shouldn’t have said that because Luna and Alice weren’t talking for about a month at that time. And Alice probably didn’t want Luna to know. And of course, Alice got angry at me. I said that to Luna because we were calling and she told Alice that she shouldn’t get angry at me and should leave me alone. But Alice probably saw that as a message that I didn’t want her anymore.

It’s been about 2 months since that happened and for all that time I have thought that she really hated me and never wanted to talk to me again. But at a second thought, she probably doesn’t hate me as much as I thought. It probably just hurts for her to see me being so close with Luna. So I’m thinking about messaging her again but I’m not sure what I should say and if she even wants to talk to me. I’ve got this struggle for about a week now.

I put in my two weeks because I only work on the weekends because of school but recently they have started giving me upwards of 20 hours a weekend. I had put in for them to decrease my hours but they denied it. The combination of the hours and the fact that I hate the job made me want to put in my two weeks.

The only reason why I began making music was because I had such an appreciation for my favorite artists, that I wanted to figure out how to make music like them. But like any art form, you don't learn music over night. It takes a lot of time to figure out what sounds good with what, how to even use the fucking software, how the effects work, how to make your shit sound good. And after six months of reading up on music theory, trying different stuff, and listening to countless hours of reference music. I feel really sad. I go into making a song, and think about what I want. I begin by listening to a couple songs, thinking about how they did what they did, and attempt to recreate it to some degree, while of course making it original. But even though I can break sections of the song apart, and maybe recreate a sound pretty well, I start making chords, and they sound like shit. I then tune them for maybe 45 minutes, and keep trying, until I say ""fuck it, I can't even get close to this"" and call it a day. I really want to create music, and I don't want to stop, it is something that I really enjoy, and don't want to stop doing. But I am so heavily discouraged that it seems like I'll never get where I want to be. I understand that in sic months, I can't imitate the style of someone who has spent years of their life making music, and also has probably sunk thousands of dollars into their music career, but how can I convince myself that it's even worth it to spend a lot of money, and try for years? It seems so far off that the road there seems like hell. And I'm so preoccupied with other things, that I barely get any time. Does anyone have any advice?

67,"So some backstory
A friend of mine and I met over a year ago and have been really good friends ever since. He was like my only real friend for a while but he kinda pulled me out of my shell after a bit and got me meeting new people. 

 I one time told him about a girl I liked (this is high school so nothing really serious obviously). So after a short while he basically told her that I like her right in front of my face, and after that I just couldn't be around her without being awkward about it, and me and the girls ended up drifting off.

 Fast forward a few month and I found another romantic interest and am skeptical to tell him about it after last time, but decide to give him a chance. I'm not going to go into details, but overall the same thing happened. I thought I had learned my lesson.

 A few weeks ago I'm talking to him and he suggests that I like this one girl, and I reluctantly say yes so that I can beg him not to say anything. This whole secret keeping thing went smoothly for a week or two apart from a bit of poking fun at me harmlessly, nbd he wasn't crossing the line.

 But today he called her on the phone and said ""someone wants to admit their feelings to you"" and hands the phone to me. I'm pissed at this point and act like I hadn't heard any of what he said to her and quickly give him the phone back. I thought this would be the end of it.

 An hour or so later he calls her back and continually insists that I like her and I'm over here bviously annoyed at what he's saying. After he hangs up, I tell him that I'm upset at what he did and he acts like he's not in the wrong by saying ""oh you told me to never mention you by name, which I never did 🤗"". At this point I'm pissed so I leave as soon as I can without making a big scene or anything.

 Later I post on my Snapchat story a small rant about the situation and how it's pointless to have a friend that I can't trust etc. This dude goes ahead and tries to disregard it as all a joke after seeing what I posted.

 I really don't know if I should cut him off or not, he really has changed my life and I've considered him one of my best friends for a long time, but I don't know if Im just overreacting about the whole thing and should just cool down a little.

Any advice?",02Mar2019,1

Partner: 21f

Background: I'm in a committed relationship and have been for about 2years now. Cheating has never been within my moral realm. 

Context: Today at uni during some fancy event, there was an after-party. Regular club with students, not too crazy with the alcohol. 

Story: I rly enjoy dancing especially at the club, cause I suck at choreography and just enjoy moving to the music freely and they usually only good songs at clubs (not today, today's sucked). During one song i begin to dance with a girl in my program (she also has a boyfriend) and it gets a bit too heated. We held each other's waists and had flirtatious looks while legs were intertwined and webwere dancing. I felt really good about myself at that moment, kinda like I was in a shakira feat beyonce/rihanna music video. And I had been feeling meh about myself lately so that was a boost. Might wanna add that I'm bisexual but I'm not attracted to her

She was kinda drunk so I don't think she remembers or even cares but I'm just so disgusted with myself. Idk if I'm over reacting here or not. i still feel so so bad and don't know what to do

Tl;dr: I danced with a girl at the club a lil bit too closely and flirtatiously, I feel like I betrayed my partner (although I told him Abt this later and he didn't feel betrayed or angry).

69,"Using a throwaway since a few people know my main. So I’ll try to be as brief, yet descriptive as I can. (Spoiler: turns out it wasn’t brief lol) For some backstory, I started a second job a not too too long ago, but in the middle of this past January my knee blew out trying to move some things and I’m stuck home for god knows how long. The surgery isn’t for a few more weeks and the doctor isn’t sure what my recovery will look like because I’ve had some nasty injuries to it in the past that required 3 previous surgeries (all of which were ~8 years ago if anyone’s wondering)

Now part of the problem begins with trying to figure out finances. Now I’m not asking for any handouts here, I’m NOT that kind of person. If I want something, I’ll make it happen with my own efforts. The problem is I don’t know where to start. The injury was filed through workers comp but initially got denied because of the previous injuries to my leg. Fortunately the case is going to court but that’s still not for another few weeks as well, meaning I’ve been without a source of income for about a month and a half, and there’s no certainty that I’ll even have a source of income for a while. 

Unfortunately I haven’t been able to save any money at all in a few years because every 6-8 months, like clockwork, something like this happens that puts me out of work and slaps me with a few thousand dollars of debt each time leaving me with having to live in anticipation of paychecks a month out when I actually can work. My credit tanked because of these past things so a personal loan/a credit card is not feasible, and my family is not going to help me either. For the record I have -$0.90 in my checking account lol I have no shame admitting that, I usually have around that much after all my bills. I’m not one to care about money AT ALL so long as I can stay afloat. Basically I just wanna see if anyone has any ideas how I can try to alleviate some of this new debt on my own or at the very least keep it from stressing me out because I’m going insane over here

The other issue is being stuck home. I live with my 80 y/o grandmother who I help take care of (mostly just daily things around the house that she can’t do, she’s independent for the most part and prefers to be left alone) and I don’t exactly have friends around. Of the two that I have one is halfway across the country in the military and the other lives over an hour away so there’s zero chance of being able to see them or even talk to them all that often. I haven’t had any real social contact in months and I’m losing my mind being alone like this. I need to find hobbies but I can’t think of anything to do around here. All I own is a laptop and a tv which I can only get so much entertainment out of. There’s no public transport where I live and it’s at least 7-8 miles to the nearest anything. But being that I cant walk more than like 100ft going out isn’t much of an option anyway even with transportation. Can anyone suggest something to get my mind off all this? I already suffer pretty heavily from depression and when things like this happen it only makes it worse, which I’m aware of and try not to let get to me, but after a while this sort of thing is gonna break even the strongest spirits. 

I’m sorry that this sounds like just straight up self-pity, but I really can’t think of any options to at least brighten my mood a little bit. Thank you all in advance

I love my parents and family very much, but every question I ask leads to another and another and they all seem to lead back to ""I guess it's just one of those things we don't know.""

73,"Hi Reddit,  
  
I am an 18 year old dude who just started an Engineering/Computer Science degree and moved onto the University campus with my girlfriend under a scholarship I received. My girlfriend (17) and I have known each other for about 5-6 years now, but have only been together for 11 months. Our relationship has been extremely rocky and we have multiple disagreements and arguments that lead to loud verbal battles and sometimes even gets physical. We're just not right for each other, but she refuses to believe that and hangs on to the moments where we aren't being bitter towards each other.

&amp;nbsp;

Prior to getting with her, I had an amazing friendship group who I was very close to, we used to hangout and play video games all the time and we could just laugh for hours straight about the dumbest shit. However, when I got with my girlfriend, I found that she was extremely clingy, controlling and absurdly jealous about things that don't make any sense and over time I lost contact with my friends. For example, about a year before getting with her, I was talking to another girl who I wasn't really interested in, but thought of her as a friend. My girlfriend discovered I had liked her Facebook profile photo about a month of being with her and she flipped her shit, telling me I am lying about having feelings for her and that I had to delete Facebook. I tried to make a stand and told her I wasn't having this shit and tried to leave her before I fell prey to her threatening me that she'd kill herself if I left. So I stayed.

&amp;nbsp;

I was sexually abused (groped on a bus and in classrooms) and blackmailed into sending nude photos to a male (I'm not gay/bi) before and during a period of my relationship with my girlfriend. I don't really want to delve further into this but point is, I did NOT want to do any of this, I just felt extremely trapped and helpless that I gave in. I did not tell anyone of this but my abuser decided to come forward to someone and basically news spread all the way to my girlfriend. She was understandably upset and shocked, I tried explaining everything to her, however she told me I was cheating on her and hiding it from her purposefully. I guess she isn't wrong and over time has convinced me that it is something that I have done wrong as she brings it up to this day in arguments, calling me a cheater and a liar. I'm not even sure of myself anymore in terms of whether i'm the problem in this relationship, because while I do agree I sometimes have trouble communicating my feelings, I didn't think it would cause this much of an issue.

&amp;nbsp;

I can't really explain how insanely clingy this woman is. Before we moved in with each other, we called literally 24/7 (sleeping, eating, urinating, everything) and If I took a few seconds too long to reply to her, she accused me of something ridiculous such as messaging another female. We also found out that my abuser attends the same University that we do. While my girlfriend was on her way to class, she noticed him walking in the direction of our apartment. When she got home she was extremely upset and accused me of potentially meeting up with him to hook up. I'm not sure if this is normal among girlfriends of victims of sexual abuse but it seems so bizarre and insane to me.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, to tell you how I completely fucked up my relationship with most of my friends. Towards the end of high school, I planned to finally man the fuck up and leave my girlfriend, where I would be in a situation where I don't have to see her every day. Boy did I fuck this up. I pussied out. And I panicked really fucking badly. My friends were expecting me to come on a holiday with them, because they all thought I would have left my girlfriend. And man my anxiety kicked in like crazy so I panicked and did something really dumb that I regret very much. I messaged all of them on discord and told them I didn't want to be friends with them anymore and kinda just disappeared from their life. They called and texted but I was too scared to answer or reply. This was a few months ago now and only recently I decided to talk to someone who had been my friend since I was like 8 years old. I'm so thankful for him because he seems to be the only one willing to rekindle our friendship.

&amp;nbsp;

I think I've been ranting too long now and will get to the point. I want to break up with my girlfriend and be friends with my friends again. I feel like I'm in too deep and there is no way out. I am willing to pay back her parents for all the help they have given us in terms of buying us utensils and things for the apartment and also throw in some extra money for the hassle of moving her out again which is about a 1 hour trip to our apartment from her home. I'm also not sure how to approach my friends as I am going to be incredibly nervous and scared to talk to them, but I am very willing. I apologize if this hasn't really been a coherent post to follow, I am kind of just getting everything off my chest at the moment, but I really do want your help Reddit.

**TL:DR: Essentially all I'm asking is how do I go about leaving my girlfriend and approach my old friends (whose trust I betrayed) again**.

74,"Hey all, just moved into a new room with roommates. The landlord is extremely anal about permanent changes being made to the room. (I can't put holes in the wall or use anything permanently adhesive). The walls are mildly textured, but I was considering thermal curtains, a draft stopper, but especially the foam wedges in the link to soundproof the room. Advice I'd appreciate is how to adhere them to my wall, without any permanent effects. Also any other soundproofing advice, particularly on a budget, would be great also. I was considering double sided foam mounting tape.

75," I tried dating sites (tinder and okcupid) and I barely get any messages, replies or any attention whatsoever. I tried reddit, but most people don't really find success there. Now, I don't know what else to try. I don't know how to get a girl interested in me. ",02Mar2019,0
76,"So I'm pretty new to sex. I've had one girlfriend, who was my first sexual partner, and my second last night.

To give some context, the date went perfectly, she was cute, not amazing, but cute, I took her for drinks, she was clearly into me and we were both really touchy, we kissed in the bar and it was going amazing. She held conversation really well.  
We ended up coming back to my place to hang out. Okay, so far, it's like the picture perfect date right. Everything is going amazing. Cool girl, good conversation, kisses, back to my place, netflix and chill. Great.

We watch a couple episodes and I start making moves on her, and it slowly progresses into us starting to fuck, but I couldn't get hard... I was just so fuckin nervous and I couldn't get it up. This happened the night I lost my virginity too, and I thought it only happened cause it was my first time, but it happened again and I was so embarrassed, which only made it worse, and I don't know how to fix this shit. It could be the alcohol, but I only had two drinks, and the other time it happened, I was sober.

So we took a little break and I calmed down and I got it up so we went at it again... Only to encounter my 2nd problem. It went soft after like 5 minutes, because I just stop feeling good in condoms. And once it starts to go soft it doesn't stop. Same problem with the ex girlfriend, but as she was a girlfriend, I just ditched condoms, I obviously can't do that for people I have just met.

Now let me say, it wasn't because of lack of lube. She was the wettest thing I've ever felt, like before I had touched her I feel like I could go swimming down there.  
But when I was soft and gave up, I realised the condom was dry? So maybe that was playing into it?

Anyway, that happened again 3 more times, I went through 4 condoms, didn't cum, made her obviously feel like shit, would've given her one of the worst sexual nights of her life.

When I was fucking her she said it was amazing, and I could tell it was, and I'm upset that I didn't get to do it properly.

My concern is, do I have ED? Like surely not, I'm 19, I masturbate frequently and can always get it up myself? This only happens with a girl.

How do I have an active sex life if I can't use condoms? How do I stop this from happening?

Now I'm so fucking scared to take things further with girls cause this shit happens.. And the sad part is, I wouldn't mind having another go with that girl, but it probably won't happen.

I'm just really concerned and don't know what to do. I think step 1 is to quit porn, for good. But I really don't know how to fix this and it's so concerning...

I took a perfect date and made it shitty for her..",02Mar2019,1
77,"So several hours ago my (F 20) boyfriend (M 20) got mad because of an off-hand comment I made. I told him that it was just a joke and that I meant no harm. I've made playful jokes before and he's always really cool about it, usually giving it right back to me and we get a banter going. Today, that did not happen. So I got upset because he was upset and ended up just asking him to leave. He told me he loved me as he walked out the door and I just said ""yup"" in response. He texted me a few hours later to apologize but I have yet to respond. I know this seems very petty but I have a history of fueling small fights just to keep drama going because it's entertaining for me. I'm planning to seek help for this behavior. I've been really good the past few weeks about toning the drama down. But right now I'm conflicted. I want to ignore him just to keep the fight going on longer. Part of me also wants to reply and accept the apology and move on. Another part of me feels like this relationship isn't working at all and we should break up. This is part of the reason I want to keep the fight going. So that the drama will result in a break up. But I also love him and want to continue being with him. I'm not sure what to do. ",02Mar2019,1
78,"So ill spare the details of my past experiences.. because theyre not needed and i dont feel like typing this stuff all out

So in high school i was the smaller kid, ended freshman year at about 6', 110lb (i know.) I was bullied a shit ton &amp; never did anything about it because I wouldn't be ABLE to do anything. I was super depressed, I'll spare the details of all of that because it got messy. So midway through junior year I start working out, stopping for a few months, never really being consistent but teenager hormones and shit made it easy to gain muscle anyway. I'm at about 160 right now, so about 50% heavier than what I was before lol.

Needless to say I'm still pretty skinny but I've got the muscle behind me now. I run, I lift, I do BJJ &amp; Boxing. I can back up what I say now &amp; I'm not afraid of people anymore. This isn't to sound all arrogant or badass or anything, just stating that I'm not the soft kid I was before. My anxiety is gone but I still get the depression whenever I don't work out, so I kinda cover it up by just working out 2x a day. It may not be healthy mentally but it keeps me focused on everything I need to do. I just don't think about it anymore.. if that makes sense.

So because I've gained a bit of muscle, got rid of most my acne, kinda grew into myself a bit, women are way more attracted to me now. I notice the glances, stares, etc. Feels good for the ego, but that mentality from being bullied stuck with me, y'know? Like every time I start talking with a girl now I just can't open up and get it past the surface level of getting to know them. It's like, I KNOW they're attracted to me. They KNOW I'm attracted to them, but for whatever reason that small kid that I was is still kind of inside of me and is afraid of the rejection I guess. 

I'm talking to this new girl right now, she's way out of my league but I'm not sure she knows it. I dont wanna fuckin ruin this one too. Anybody wanna help me out here? Anyone been in my situation?",02Mar2019,1
79,My girlfriend and her mom expect me to prompose but I think it’s cheesy and not genuine. Like she is my girlfriend obviously I’m going to take her to prom why would I have to make a stupid poster with a garbage ass pun on it.  I thought straight up asking her is better than “promposing” because it’s a genuine thing. Her mom is expecting me to and asking me when I am promposing but it’s just not my style. ,02Mar2019,4
81,"So I went to check my mailbox today and I had to do a U turn in order to park my car properly since the mailbox is located in an odd spot and I accidentally backed into one of my neighbors’ backyard(he has a detached garage in the back and there’s a backyard in between the garage and the house) with no fences and there are lots of snow on the ground. 
He probably saw me doing that ,so he quickly came out of his house and got on his car and waited till I headed onto main street.  Although we made a little eye contact,I had no clue he was following me the whole time and when I was just about to stop at a stop sign,suddenly,a white Volvo XC90 came out from nowhere cut me off and stopped right in front me. I realized it was him and he quickly jumped out his car and came towards my car while he was cursing at me,initially I was confused since I didn’t know what was going on so I rolled down the window and he said “ you little cunt,I’m gonna f*** kill you if you ever do that again” I said “I’m sorry,what did I do?” and he goes “ you were f*** driving on my grass,are you f*** retarded or what ?” (The temperature is around minus 30 in my city and all the roads are covered with ice and snow). I didn’t want to escalate the situation so I quickly apologized to him and told him that I didn’t mean to do that ,then he goes “f*** you,you piece of s***” while I kept saying sorry to him. He then quickly left the “scene”.   

This whole incident left me speechless and I’m now really upset and extremely overwhelmed by this incident since I have never met any one like him in my life. 

Can you guys help me overcome this?  This guy lives right across the street and I see his car every day which makes me fearful as I don’t know if he will do something crazy to me and I don’t want any troubles. I appreciate it ahead!",02Mar2019,1
82,"My younger brother and his friend hang out together on the weekends(they're both 13). When ever the friend(I'll call him X) comes over he uses my controller. Now I have no problem with X using it as he is a respectful kid but I wish he would ask me first since the controller is mine, He uses mine because my brother's has really bad stick drift(if you don't know what that is basically the joysticks are broken so either the character or camera will move on its own in a game). I've ask my brother to talk to his friend about this but he seems to absolutely refuse or says I forgot every time. I want to just take my controller every time X comes over but then I'd be an ass.

85,"I’m curious on how others go through this. Mine seems to leap out at me when I least expect it, and I’d like to find tools to be able to manage it for myself a bit better. 

Lately, it’s been pretty bad. My job became uninhabitable and I needed to move on, so I took a bootcamp for web development.  That went alright. In the beginning the uphill battle was unreal, I cried a lot. Ended strong though, just coding like mad without even realizing the hours going by. 

Fast forward, now an intern. That’s nice, I’ve gotten good cookie points for my boss. I’m a junior full stack and databases are my Achilles Heel. When I leave work I’m proud of everything I’ve learned and my reviews are good for what I get. 

When I get home though, I don’t even know what happens. Suddenly I realize that maybe I made a fool of myself and no one wants to confront me. Or my boss is reviewing my code shaking his head because I didn’t ask enough questions or ask for an earlier review. 

My only tool is to keep telling myself ‘I am where I am’. I was hired to learn and that’s what I’m doing, I can only go so far everyday. Yet again I’m at home stressing for some reason. 

Today it goes as follows...

Since I’m a intern I don’t get hourly pay, just weekly rates. Due to learning new technologies I’m slow af. Even though my boss is super chill and said that putting in 8 hours a day is fine I can’t help but feel it’s not enough. 

Like why brain? 

Our hours aren’t specific at all, 8 hours with enough overlap that the CTO can review and give advice. I show up earlier than everyone because if I catch that’s how my transit route is. Now today I left before the CTO, it felt so wrong. And now my imposter syndrome is like wild about it. 

I even did the database today successfully CRUD and DRY!! 

But....

Should I have stayed until he left? Should I this, should I that....

Today I even got a good review from my boss, and the coder who’s project I’m taking over so what’s the problem brain?? 

Tl:dr Getting good reviews and doing my job as laid out in the contract. Struggling with imposter syndrome everyday when I get home despite feeling good when I leave work. 

What’s your tools, how do you manage your imposter syndrome?",02Mar2019,3
86,"I want to go out . And be around people 
Even though I don’t know anyone 

wherever I go , I still want to be out . 

I want to watch people drink, and have fun 
And be with friends and enjoy themselves 
While I drink and observe from a distance wishing I could be doing the same . 

I miss having real friends , I miss when 
It only took a few beers and conversation
A blunt or two and a good jam session in a buddies garage or a movie or just overall conversation and being productive made me happy .

When I could go out with my girlfriend, and enjoy each other’s company and end the night in each other’s arms , or in bed together keeping each other close and telling each other we love each other .



I miss when people would approach me , and talk to me . 

Instead of looking at me and seeing how much pain 

I am in even with a smile on my face and completely avoiding me .


All the love I had and have for myself 
And others who love me 
is lost .

I think I’m just destined to be alone because I’ve spent so much time with others , and avoiding my needs , avoiding my feelings and trying to help others out before helping out myself .     Only because I was okay though, only because I was confident in my life with where I was , and was going to end up, and knowing I had enough strength In me to protect myself .


But, it makes no hell of a difference now . 
It doesn’t matter if I’m alone or with people , if I’m over a break up or not . If I have money or I’m dead  fucking broke .

The people I once loved and 
who once loved me wont be back . 
No matter how much I try and beg ,
Or how much space I give them when 
They ask .

I think I’m destined to be alone .
And with how selfish , and damaged I’ve become from other people before myself ,
I don’t care .

Does it matter if I go out or not , or should I just not fucking care? 

Nobody else seems to care . 
Why should I .

This is despite me going out whenever I can, planning trips, having family I can contact, and having a good support system at work.

88,"So my (24F) coworker (30M) and I have became really good friends lately. We usually talk a lot at work and will continue talking after work once we've both got home and are resting for the night. We also play video games together on the weekends. The last few days him and I have stayed up till midnight talking about our lives. I've also noticed that as we've really  connected he's started to stand way closer to me to the point thay we're bumping into one another but not backing away.

Big surprise, I have a crush on him and I think some of my coworkers are thinking something's up between him and I based on some comments and questions they've asked me.

My work doesnt allow us to date coworkers that work in the same area as you. So there's no chance that we could do anything right now regardless of his feelings.

I'm not sure if he sees me as just a friend or if there's a little more behind it. I cant really ask him to hang out after work because we both live an hour from work in opposite directions.",02Mar2019,1
89,"I don’t even know where to begin. I live with my best friend and we moved across country to this house almost five years ago. We both run an Airbnb together and have for three years in this house to help with rent. My sister used to live here and I believe her name is still on the lease. My friend and I moved in to live with my sister before she went away to medical school. After she left, we just took over the lease. In fact, my sister still has a lot of stuff in her shed in the backyard. I mean, she lived here for five years before us so she really helped us get out here and settled. My sis and I had a small tiny house built in the backyard for myself to live in and she helped me pay for it. She even helped my friend in I move out here, across country from our hometown. Long story short, my best friend is toxic and I feel so trapped. Now that she lives in this house and her name is on the lease, I would have to fight if I wanted to stay in this house. Which I do, because my sister will be moving back and actually asked my best friend if it would be okay if she moved in with us. But my best friend is very selfish. She has been using and taking advantage of me for years. We’ve been friends since we were in middle school &amp; we are now 27. Back home when we were younger, I never really grasped how toxic she was because she’s very good at seeming kind and caring. But I’m realizing now it’s all manipulation. Now I’m here in this house living with someone who deeply affects my well being: mentally, emotionally. I’m a giver at heart and she is a taker. She has always been the type to ask for rides and offer no gas money. I feel I can never ask her for a favor but she constantly asks me for favors. If I ask her for a favor, it’s a big inconvenience. I’m the type of friend who if I see something that my friend would like at the store, I’ll get it for her. She’s the type to ask you for a huge favor and wont reciprocate. It just seems that a lot of the negativity in my life is caused from her. She brings this weird energy into my life that leaves me drained. Like a leech. Our friendship doesn’t feel genuine anymore. I have too much resentment to even act normal around her sometimes. And we’ll have one good week, laughing and living in harmony and then she throws another curve ball at me. Either being unreliable, irresponsible, or asking for favors. Trust me, I have some insane stories and incidents I can go on about but I’d be writing a book. I know I wouldn’t be friends with her if we didn’t live together because it’s just ruined for me. I feel so used. I’ve tried having conversations with her about how I feel, over and over. We fight constantly because I just can’t handle it. But she’s never going to change. It’s a situation where now that we are adults, we can’t live together. It’s not working for me and my health. I wake up every morning thinking about how angry I am with her. And I feel like I’m walking on eggshells living in my own home. She has OCD so you can’t change a thing about the house or she flips out. I can’t leave a water cup on our kitchen counter. She just has a very controlling personality in the home. I’ve been trying so hard to not let her trigger me, but its hard when you live with the problem. If she has problems in her life, she sinks you down, too. Whether it’s projecting her emotions with anger or actually getting you involved. Recently, my sister texted my best friend asking her how she would feel if she moved back in temporarily. I tell my sister everything so she knows I’m in a bad head space living here. I’m pretty sure that’s why she only texted my friend because she knew it would only be a problem for her. My friend was telling me that she wasn’t too excited about it. I feel so torn because it’s my sister and she helped us move out here, now I can’t help her because of my friend (who wouldn’t be out here if it wasn’t for me)?!!! My “friend” who makes me crazy because she doesn’t see how awful she is? How do I get her out of this house? Our landlords are very laid back and adore my sister. They always ask when she’s coming back.  So I absolutely know they’d want her to live here again. The problem is my leech friend. What do I do?! How do I go about this in the best way. We run an Airbnb together so there are financial ties unfortunately. I feel so trapped. I wish a miracle would come and she would move out. But I know she’ll fight if I try to get her out of this house. And it’s so messed up because my sister and i are the reasons she even got here! My sister has two sheds in the backyard full of her stuff and I’m living in the tiny house she built. To me, this house belongs to my family and myself. How do I kick her out? With this financial tie too!",02Mar2019,1
90,"My 39-year old flatmate is making my life miserable. He keeps making creepy, sexual comments about me and my appearance. He would comment how my butt looks bigger after I’ve been to the gym, he asks me about my sex life, how passionate I am in bed, how he leaves the door of his room open hoping that I’ll “accidentally”  trip and fall in there. I said how sometimes I get dizzy since I have neck problems and he said “great, I can take advantage of that”. 

He thinks he’s being fun, and I tried to brush it off and laugh it off, but I got so fed up tonight and I sent him a text saying that I find his comments inappropriate and not funny, and could he please stop, and all he replied was #metoo.

93,"Hey there, first post here

I visited a campus of my dream college today and I had a lovely time. Perfect programs, lovely people, a great climate etc.

I am worried about the cost, but I have accepted that I am going to be in debt which I feel like is unavoidable at this point.

My main worry is just the life transition. It's an out of state college for me, and far away enough that it's not within driving distance. I'm not terribly upset being away from my parents, but I do have a girlfriend whose needs include seeing each other in person, so there's a lot of sadness and awful feelings with that. We have quite a few months ahead of us (Terms for college start Aug or Sep depending on where I go) but I don't know how to not dread that. The whole transition itself is making me feel very scared and just unprepared to experience such a drastic change that I don't know if I can be fully happy in a place where I should be happy.

If anyone has advice on this type of situation, leaving loved ones behind in pursuit of a better career/school life I would greatly appreciate it. ",02Mar2019,1
94,"I make great money doing this and I have been for over a decade. But I’m not 32 and my knees are feeling the west and tear. I am thinking about what to do for the rest of my life. I have managed to save up a sizeable amount of money (150k+) as I have never done drugs or drink much compared to other bar staff. I just kept putting money away. I work at a high end establishment that I love. I am also very well connected in the city I live in. I have no worries about needing to find a job if my current one folds. 

Even if the whole serving industry goes away in a decade, I’m sure I could find a job in a bar that I could live off of.

I don’t know what to do with the rest of my life but feel as if I only have two options.

Option 1: Work in a bar and continue stockpiling money until I literally can’t do it anymore, then live off investment income, my one (hopefully more) rental property, and a modest job (min wage in my province is 14/hour). Even if I’m washing dishes, it’s 14+tipout which is around 17-19 an hour. This is more than livable, not even considering my other sources of income.

Option 2: I was offered an office job, but it pays 20k less than a 40 hour week for me. But the ceiling is much much higher. I do have a bachelors, but it’s in poly-sci. I have a college diploma too but again it’s not in anything relevant. My work ethic is great and I have amazing soft skills. But nothing transferable to an office environment besides being able to balance numbers and do quick math.

Any ideas or suggestions on what I should do?

TLDR: Working in a bar is wearing me down even though I like it at 32 years of age. Should I take an office job that involves a big pay cut, but would have room for growth even though it’s a completely different field of work? Or keep grinding in the service industry and continue stockpiling money?",02Mar2019,1

(And if anything I say in this timeline seems off, I'm sorry, but my memory is trash to begin with and the treatment I received hasn't at all helped)

&amp;#x200B;

I met a guy online a few years ago. He lives in Finland but is as fluent in English as anyone else I know.  We were young and dear god we were stupid with things. He was catfishing me and pretending to be a girl for months when we met, and I'm honestly still not sure if he identifies as a girl or not, which I'm fine with. We didn't even really intend on dating, I think, for the longest time, but that's just kinda how things turned out.

He put up with me being an emotionally developing shit, and was super sweet most of the time. He was severely depressed and I talked him out of suicide a few times. I feel dumb saying that, because I almost can feel my mom leaning over my shoulder saying that he's just doing it for attention and my words can't change his decision, but I really think he would have done something stupid if I wasn't there constantly pestering him to stay around.

That was back in early 2017 through early 2018, I honestly can't say when we got serious. We began getting super serious about seeing each other, talking about one of us moving over the pond, visas, passports, laws, money, marriage, everything. I was still in highschool, and I'm super aware of how naive that all sounds, but teenage love and hormones is infinitely more powerful than logic at that age.

Come May of 2018, and I fall off the radar for him. I'll skip the long sob story because I've heard more than enough ""You'll be in our thought""'s and ""We're praying for you""'s to last at least 3 lifetimes. I get diagnosed with cancer, I receive treatment for it for 6 months, and got my prognosis in January. Terminal.

He obviously flips his shit. I kinda saw it coming, I always had the inclination that I'd die young, and what I had was rare as hell and only about 1 in 5 people pull through, and the ones that do are faaaar younger than me and are more capable of bouncing back. Whatever, I guess I'm dying now, let's make the last months of my life great.

The whole half year we still talked, getting passports, the works. But to go back to what I said earlier, ""he was super sweet MOST of the time."" He had, and has, a weird clingy issue.. Whenever I'm not online for a day, or I say I'm going out to hang out with friends or do anything that involves literally anyone, he gets super suspect of me assumes I'm going out to bang other people and lie to his face about loving him, we get into a fight and I point out how I never flinch when he goes out and gets drunk with friends, how he's going out to all these social events all the time, is surrounded by young eager guys in university, and how I never suspect him. He says I have nothing to lost if he isn't faithful, but I'm his world and he has everything to lose if I don't love him.

He's still like this as I'm in the hospital. I say the nurses treat me like an angel (the competition isn't fierce, it's me; A chatty nice teenager with high pain tolerance, or B; children ages 0-7 who begin screaming the moment a doctor enters the room), and all of them light up when I come in for a round, and he puts it together in his head that a sick AF teenager who is receiving chemotherapy is getting it on with adults who are 10 years older than... what?

I put up with it. He still loves me, I love him, he says he's trying to change, and he's basically the only thing I have. Come January, I get my prognosis, and everything kinda changes. I have anywhere from 2-8 months, which is fantastic, and he goes back to assuming I'm unfaithful. 

I say I'm planning on getting drunk and playing games in February, and he thinks I'm going to do webcam shows or going out to get fucked or something. And I just kinda snapped. I tell him how much it hurts me when he doubts my commitment, I begin crying, I call it a night, realize my heart is broken and that I can't love him, and break up with him the next day.

I came back though. Several times. I caved on my own resolution, but my heart's not in the relationship. I owe this guy the best parts of my life, I promised him that I'd break the heart of everyone I know just to see him, but here I am, doubting if I even want to message him anymore.

It kinda ended up like this. I enjoy talking to him sometimes, but he broke my heart that day. Me breaking up with him snapped some sense into him, and he hasn't doubted my faith since, but it's too little too late. I'm tired of the relationship, tired of love, tired of him. But he says that I'm the only thing in his life that gives him meaning, and he says that if we break up, he'll just kill himself.

I know that it's his choice to live, and that a dying kid shouldn't have to bear the weight of his emotional issues, I know that it's not my fault if he offs himself. I need someone to tell my why I'm staying, even though I shouldn't... Why I can't put my own needs before his.

I've broken up about 3 times with him this month. But I feel so terrible for him that i realize the only way for me to say goodbye would be to block him and never look back, and then cry for a few days and pray he doesn't create alts to try and friend me and get me back...

99,"So ill spare the details of my past experiences.. because theyre not needed and i dont feel like typing this stuff all out

So in high school i was the smaller kid, ended freshman year at about 6', 110lb (i know.) I was bullied a shit ton &amp; never did anything about it because I wouldn't be ABLE to do anything. I was super depressed, I'll spare the details of all of that because it got messy. So midway through junior year I start working out, stopping for a few months, never really being consistent but teenager hormones and shit made it easy to gain muscle anyway. I'm at about 160 right now, so about 50% heavier than what I was before lol.

Needless to say I'm still pretty skinny but I've got the muscle behind me now. I run, I lift, I do BJJ &amp; Boxing. I can back up what I say now &amp; I'm not afraid of people anymore. This isn't to sound all arrogant or badass or anything, just stating that I'm not the soft kid I was before. My anxiety is gone but I still get the depression whenever I don't work out, so I kinda cover it up by just working out 2x a day. It may not be healthy mentally but it keeps me focused on everything I need to do. I just don't think about it anymore.. if that makes sense.

So because I've gained a bit of muscle, got rid of most my acne, kinda grew into myself a bit, women are way more attracted to me now. I notice the glances, stares, etc. Feels good for the ego, but that mentality from being bullied stuck with me, y'know? Like every time I start talking with a girl now I just can't open up and get it past the surface level of getting to know them. It's like, I KNOW they're attracted to me. They KNOW I'm attracted to them, but for whatever reason that small kid that I was is still kind of inside of me and is afraid of the rejection I guess. 

I'm talking to this new girl right now, she's way out of my league but I'm not sure she knows it. I dont wanna fuckin ruin this one too. Anybody wanna help me out here? Anyone been in my situation?",02Mar2019,1
101,"Some insight to my current situation, I go to a college preparatory charter school and am currently in my junior year. Come summer, I will be taking a month-long class for my English 12 so it’s done and out of the way Next year, I’m taking my final class (only need one to graduate which means I need to stack two useless classes so the school can get paid for my attendance) and doing an off-campus class for business and finance through a program known as EVIT (East Valley Institute of Technology). My weighted/unweighted GPA sits at a current 3.92/4.27 across my freshman-junior year (considering I finish this semester with all A’s, which is extremely likely), and I currently have a job at Starbucks. 
Our college prep school doesn’t have that great of an advisor, or a guidance counselor at all, so I’m taking things as they come. I really would like to go to a good social college for the experience and for education on business and finance, obviously, so my top choices are UPenn and UCLA. 
I have a lot of aspiration to make my top choices out-of-state colleges, I’ve been told. But I run into a few problems, obviously. I don’t have the money to support my college choices, and I have no idea how to write grant and scholarship letters despite the time wasted trying to look up some good formats to use in writing, or even what websites are safe for scholarship/grant finding. Another problem is, how am I going to achieve what I want? I aspire a lot, obviously, but I have no idea where to start right now.

I come from a black household. So that means spanking/hitting are no strangers. I just want to say I love my mom, very much. She does everything for me. Single mom, who buys me damn near everything, buys me a very high end gaming device, consoles, spoiled me to a brim. She expresses her love for me a lot. However when she gets angry, it’s bad. She yells at me when I don’t do what I’m told, hit me, etc. there’s even times where she would make threats, call me names, insult me too. One time we had a very heartfelt moment and we hugged. It was the first time ever we had a really huge moment like that. Mainly because I never open up, talk about my feelings, etc. She’s always there for me and accepts me no matter what. So today, I was being lectured at, to always close the drawers. I was just kind of brushing it off? Then my Mom was yelling at me to not brush stuff off and listen to what my Grandma was saying, (the one who was lecturing me) and I was like “Calm down.” Maybe even a little loud. So my mom got up, I back away then proceeded to hit me, slap me in the face. Stung a bit, but didn’t really hurt. I then said, “I don’t appreciate you hitting me.” She then proceeded to say, “As long as you’re my child, I can do whatever I want.” Then made the occasional, Threatening to kill me threats. She always said stuff like this and we even joke around about it. But she was always never serious. However this time, I think she was serious. She then told me to go upstairs and complete all my work (homeschooled, had stuff to do), so I did. She also told me she was cancelling movie tickets and keeping my chore money. So yeah, fucked up. Haven’t gotten into an argument with my mom this bad for awhile. She always blames me and the same old, “Oh you never keep your mouth shut.” “Oh, there are kids far more grateful out here.” “Oh if you think me slapping you is bad, there are other kids out there who get beat up.” Etc. How can I learn to keep my mouth shut and not do anything. She even told my Grandma  I was doing so well too. How can I learn to not say anything during arguments like these and not talk back?

108," 

This is my first time really making a post, and I do not know if I am doing this correctly. I don't know if I am posting this in the right subreddit.... If I'm not, I will delete this immediately.

I never thought I would have to turn to reddit for help.. But here's my story. (I'll explain this the best I can..)

 I am currently a sophomore in High School, and I joined the junior varsity golf team back in September. I was good enough to be recommended to the Varsity team halfway through the season. Although it seemed good at first, things quickly went downhill.

The Varsity Golf coach invited me to play a game as a substitute one day. It was a very sudden request, but I was free that afternoon so I agreed. I thought it would end there, but I was very wrong. Afterwards, the times he would ask me to be a substitute increased, and he would always do so by writing emails 2-3 hours before the game started. I am pretty sure that after the first time, he expected me to have free time every single day (which I do not), as I was still in the JV team and we still had many games to play, and I was also in many other clubs. Basically, I was playing golf every single day, and I had to skip many classes as a result.

One day, he asked me if I could play for him as a substitute. However, he had sent this email basically around an hour before the game had started. I was in class during that time, and there was no way I could've seen the email... After class had ended, I proceeded to go to the storage room where my golf bag was stored, as I had left my water bottle in my bag the day before. However, he was standing right there, waiting for me. I was shocked. I did not know what to do, and I was in a state of confusion and panic and we basically had a stare-down with each other. He spoke, and asked me if I could go to the game. Having not read the email, there was no way I would've brought any kind of spare clothes with me. I was shaking very badly, and what I thought of at that moment was I did not want to inconvenience the entire team, so I said: ""No, I'm-"" and before I could even mutter the word ""sorry"", he said, in the most calming tone of voice but with complete anger: ""You should check your emails more often."" Then he slammed the door and walked away.

(Why did he say this? Before school started, I was on vacation, and like always, I do not check my emails until a week before school started. However, I saw an email from the Varsity Coach about my plans for the fall season in 2019. I was very confused, but panicked due to the fact that he had sent the email 2 weeks ago.

I quickly replied to his email and said sorry, and promised him that I would check my emails more often. I can say for sure I have kept my promise till this day, I probably check my email countless times every single day.)

And that's it. Up till this day, I still have not replied to his email, and after that fateful encounter with him in the storage room, he never asked me out on another game. Ever since that day, I have never stopped thinking about what I would say to him. Golf is the only sport I play, and it is the only thing related to sports I can talk about when applying to any university. I know it is not required to have a sport, but after everything my parents have done for me, the most I can do is to perform well and get into a decent university. However, he is the only Varsity golf coach my school has ever had, and I really want to be on the Varsity team next year, but with the current situation, I have no idea what to do. I know this is not a very bad situation to many people, but it is to me. I know I should have replied to the email and sorted this out earlier, but anxiety and procrastination got the better of me and thus why, I am writing this today for help. I had been very disrespectful... but I have never faced anything like this before, and I just do not know what to do. I asked people I know irl, and they all said anything along the lines of 'just start writing the email now' or 'rip man, i don't know'... I'm socially awkward and I have no idea how to tackle this. I know there is no way I can resolve this issue unscathed, and I have no idea how to rejoin the golf team next year otherwise. I do not know anyone on the Varsity team personally, and due to my lack of social skills it really isn't the way to go. 

I've been trying to put this off for the past half year, but its gotten to the point where I think about this pretty much whenever I am not using my brain. At a lot of times, I feel so helpless I could cry. I know I am weak, but please, I need some help on how I can resolve this. I am pretty sure I have said everything, and I don't know if any of this have made sense. Maybe I'm too dramatic about all this, and should just leave it alone, but right now I am too desperate. I don't think I can go on a single day anymore without going insane about all this. ",02Mar2019,1

I just don't know what to do now. She rants a lot in our friend group, which has caused many of our other friends to mute the group chat and just not interact at all. Now the group chat exists as little more than an abandoned ranting ground.

 One of her rants is being unlovable and not having a significant other. Which makes my boyfriend constantly ask me if it's all right that he even sits beside us when we're lucky to have joint classes together (he's a different section from me and my friends though he's also part of our friend group). She recently always looks at him pretty sourly--out of a general bad mood or otherwise, I don't know. Sometimes that look extends to me as well.

121,"last spring i dropped out of college and moved back home. in the fall i got a full time job as a daycare teacher. this would be the first full time job i would ever have. the money was &amp; still is great all things considered, but that paired with my overall outlook on life have completely rid me of the desire to achieve anything exciting. monday - friday my day consists of working from 7 am to 5 or 6 pm. then i go home, eat dinner, shower, and am in bed by 9. in the few hours after work i complete coursework for my cda to become a lead teacher. on the weekends i catch up on class work or spend a few hours browsing the aisles of target by myself. i have a good handful of friends (though i've never been one to collect them by the dozen) but many of my friends are spread out in other parts of the state i live in or even further out in the country. the one friend that does still live in the area is at a very different point in her life right now so we've been spending a lot of time apart. i enjoy doing most things on my own, and am independent by nature. but to make matters worse i don't have a driver's license (simply never got one as a teen, and time caught up to me). 

the biggest thing is that as a teen and even up until this year i used to love writing. i had no purpose to my writing. i wasn't trying to become published and in all honest my writing is probably shit, but i did it because it made me happy and helped me out in times of stress. but in the last few months whenever i even thought about it, it only seemed like such a task. in fact, almost anything that isn't in my daily routine seems like a task in and of itself. things i used to love doing seem pointless right now. 

i realize that as we grow older it's just a part of life to go to work, pay the bills, and fall into a routine, but i'm 22 and life feels pointless to me right now. i'm single, i spend 40+ hours of my week at work. i just don't know how else to make life more desirable. in about a month i go on a two week trip to europe through a group travel program and while i'm excited for it, a part of me knows it'll be over in a second and life will go right back to how it was before. i need a change!

122,"Using a throwaway account, sorry for a long post. I’ll include tl;dr at bottom.

Tonight my school’s band program had a concert with the students from the local middle schools to encourage them to join our band program. Throughout the night my friend  repeatedly cussed at me and called me gross things in front of the eight graders. He does things like this all the time, almost always in public. 

What originally started the problem was when I told him I can’t handle him being disrespectful to me in front of other people like that anymore. After I told him that, he immediately got mad at me, cussed at me, said the world revolves around me, etc. Whenever he is rude to other people he thinks of it as a joke, but he gets mad when I tell him it was actually rude and not seen in a joking matter by people other than his friend group. Looking back the comments he told me weren’t what made me feel as if I should report him (not including the fact that he said these things in front of 14 year olds) to our head director, but the fact that he completely went off on me in a complete rampage. He was cursing, saying I’m immature, that I’m the only person who gets upset by him (I’m not, he’s done similar things to other students before). 

My friend has a history of anger management issues and has had depression and suicidal thoughts in the past. I really want to tell our director because I want him to get some help coping with these problems and I want him to realize he can’t keep being rude to people and playing it off as a joke. Our director has experience with mental health and knows how to handle these situations, but my friend has gotten in trouble in the past so I’m scared he may be kicked from band or taken off the upcoming spring trip we’re taking with the band. 

I guess what I’m trying to ask for help is whether or not I should tell my director before or after our trip. My friends think I should tell him before but I don’t want to get him in trouble before the trip. I also don’t even know if I should tell the director at all. My friend definitely has mental health problems but he has been getting better. I’m scared of him getting in trouble when I want him to get help.

tl;dr : My friend has a history of mental health issues and suicidal thoughts, he expressed his anger management issues again. I want to tell our band director but I’m not sure because I don’t want him to get in trouble.

I grew up somewhat religious, in high school I had a lot of friends that were popular or of the rich skater type.

This meant leggings without a skirt, tank tops, high heels over 2'', stuff like that. Due to the friend I had I always liked the look of somewhat sporty/androgynous outerwear.

Recently I went to visit my family and it was very cold, so I brought my warm clothes. Of course I had a nice modest dress, but I also brought a utility type jacket that is slightly over sized. I didn't think twice about it, but as soon as I walked in the door (25 degree weather) my mom tells me I look like a slut wearing this jacket.

I've tried everything by being myself and not caring what people think in hopes that maybe someone would want to be my friend, but that isnt working alot cus people who i try to be friends with talk to me for a moment and never speak to me again. Honestly idk why god is so cruel to me... I'm really sad and really  need help because i dont know if I'm able to live another 60 years being this way

131,"So, just as the title says, I (24f) started working at this new place back on December and there is a very creepy guy (around 26yo) who just won’t stop touching me. This happened since day one, and will use absolutely any excuse to place his hands on my shoulder, knees or waist. It has gotten to the point where I am too afraid to go to the board to write something during a team meeting because it happened that once I couldn’t reach the top of the board and he grabbed me by the waist as if “helping me keep my balance”. I get very uncomfortable when strangers touch me. I don’t really know if I am being very dramatic about it but it just makes me feel so uncomfortable. I heard from a friend, this creeppy guy is married to the manager where I work at so I am afraid saying something might get me fired ... I really like my job, but I really don’t know how to approach this situation. I talked to my friend and said he would help me anytime we need to write on the board or sit beside me during lunch times or meeting times to keep him away as much as possible. Still I can’t rely on him forever so, any of you who have dealt with a similar situation?

TL;DR: creepy guy at work won’t stop touching my knees, shoulders or waist with no reason at all.",02Mar2019,1

138,"I have been considering getting a tattoo in memory of my grandma (on my paternal side) who died when I was 7 since I was 14/15 (I am now 18) but I am not sure it would be in good taste. 
I don't have a set design but it would consist of sprigs of lavender as the few memories I have of her are all linked to lavender (The main memory I have related to her one gift I remember her by is a pouch of dried lavender she gave me when I was 6 which I still have). I feel like having a tattoo in memory of her on my body would help me remember and think of her more often. 
My main concern about whether this would be tasteful is that I feel like she wouldn't have wanted me to get a tattoo as she was a very conservative and religious woman so I'm not sure it would be a fitting tribute. Additionally, my parent's aren't too keen on tattoos - my mum explicitly told me not to get a tattoo in memory of her when she dies and that I wouldn't be allowed back in the house with a tattoo (I think that's an empty threat though) while my dad says he doesn't mind small personal ones. 
I mean I haven't thought in depth about this in a while and just writing and thinking about my grandma is making me cry. While the tears are partially due to sadness over barely knowing and getting to spend time with her, they are also due to appreciation over how lucky I am for all the possibilities I have in life which she never got which makes me feel so much more grateful and motivated.
Sorry for detour but back to the question - considering everything I've written - do you think it would in good taste to get a tattoo in memory of my grandma - despite the fact she might not have approved of me getting a tattoo if she was still alive?
Thank you

I've had a pretty big crush on him for a while now, and while I'm pretty sure he doesn't feel the same way, he's always fairly friendly to me and we'll joke around in class and what not. Due to my school's unfortunate girl:guy ratio, a lot of girls will probably either not have dates or have to find dates from other schools. I don't have the latter option, and I'd rather not go with the former if I could help it. In his case, he isn't actively involved with anyone so I think it'd be a good idea to ask him.

I want to gauge if he's going/if he has a date before I ask, so a friend and I have planned to casually bring up prom in front of him and then involve him in the conversation. The problem is, if all goes well, what do I say to ask?

He just wants to push carts with his buddy. Forever. (I thought he was joking at first but he seems serious!)

I've floated the idea that maybe his friend has other aspirations beyond Walmart, but he doesn't think so. (I don't know that guy so maybe it's true.) My friend doesn't think he'll get too old to comfortably work in the heat/cold all day, and he doesn't think he'd ever get fired so that Walmart can hire a younger person they can pay less.

154,"So, some backstory;   


I have a friend at work who had been married to the same guy she has a kid and is living with. They basically got divorced and were separated for about 6 months, then got back together but did not remarry.   


I usually take the bus to work because I have a bus stop 6 minutes away from my house, so there is no need to use my car. However, my friend lives nearby and offered to give me a lift every day and drop me off at walking distance of my home. While we are in her car, we talk A LOT about lots of random shit and we sometimes go to eat together during lunch time, that's all well and good, but I've been noticing weird changes in our conversation as of late. Just so you know, I also happen to know her kid and her kid really likes me.   


Recently while we are work, she talks about the guy she is with. She used to talk to me about him and now she only talks about him with my other colleagues (male and female), she has also started to say things like ''I'd really like you to spend time with my kid, you know about a lot of stuff he seems to start liking, and I would love if he had someone that could teach him all these things, since his father really isn't that interested in sharing times with him''.   


This other time I was telling her how I like to go ride my Bicycle at a local park that's got a huge track for people who want to go roller skating or cycling, and she said it would be great if we 3 (her, her kid, and me) would go and ride bicycles together.   


The icing in the cake was one day we were in her car and she was very serious because she had a dream in which she had a bad accident and died, and all of a sudden she grabbed my arm and said ''Please take care of my kid if something ever happens to me''. I didn't know how to respond so I just tried to dodge it by telling her to try not taking dreams so seriously, but if at any point something happened and she was in a physical state to ask me to help take her of her kid while she was incapable I'd definitely do it.   


I am single, I can't say I do not consider her attractive, but I do know she is technically -not available- given her situation and I certainly do not want to be a home wrecker so I am 100% away it is not my position to try to make any moves, I know my boundaries, but this is a bit uncomfortable in a way that I don't want to get tangled between a kids parents.

157,"I (18F) am a very sensitive person so I cry over trivial things. I was in my room crying over something dumb, then she sees me crying and starts bombarding me with all these questions even though I repeatedly told her to leave me alone. She does this everytime I cry and it makes my mood even worse. She keeps thinking I have depression or something but that's not the case.

One time she asked me ""why do you always cry, why can't you be angry?"" That's just the way I am. Sometimes me crying results in her being angry or even guilty. Wish I could be sad in peace.

I told her in the past that I have social anxiety and now she's trying to help me with it, even though I don't want her help and I am capable of getting through it on my own. I only told her about it so she can understand me more. 

I hate hearing her give me advice I didn't ask for. She only tells me things I already know. It is the same concept as having a plan to do something, then someone telling you to do that thing you already planned on doing. It is infuriating.

Anyway, now she wants me to have a therapist that I don't need or want. I have emotional problems but I am completely capable of handling them on my own. I don't want any medication for it. How do I tell her that I don't want her to interfere with my problems? Why is it so hard for her to understand that I am not depressed or suicidal? I am just sensitive and I think too much.

160,"Ever since I was small I’ve always had these problems with my parents  and I’ve honestly tried everything to fix them. It is only now that I’m starting to realize that maybe they are “abusive” as my close friends have started to say. I just wanted to get my story out there and ask for you alls honest perspective. Maybe I’m crazy or maybe there is some truth to this. I come from a medium size family we originally lived in the south. We relocated to Seattle due to my dads job. My parents are traditionally Christian and very strict. I was never allowed to have a boyfriend. I had no friends in Seattle and I was often crying alone in my room. I would call my cousin (whom I had grown up with since a baby) for comfort but was banned from talking to her due to her being a bad influence as she was now a “boy crazy” teen. It hurt not to be able to have my “older sister” around. I tried to hard to fit into my new school and make friends and my parents for the most part bought me whatever I wanted and really tried to help me adjust. When 7th grade came around I got my first phone. But I was only allowed to talk to girls. I only was allowed to have 5 contacts and they had to be parent approved. I started to get a bit upset due to the fact that I was so closely monitored. I also tried to open a Facebook yet my parents were so angry I was then banned from using the computer. They claimed it was for my own safety and it was a dangerous world out there. I only wanted to make friends ! One time one of my best guy friends called me for homework help and my dad freaked out and demanded he have my phone and he put a lock on it. He told me not to talk to boys. I started to get resentful. Some girls at school started to notice the new girl and I started getting invited to middle school parties and hangouts but I was never allowed to go and I cried in my room a lot. I was allowed to play sports but when my coach started the Facebook group I was embarrassed to say I didn’t have one. I begged my parents yet again to have a Facebook since this was the only way I could communicate with them. My dad said no and to tell the coach that if they want to speak to me so bad they can call the home phone. I started to feel more like an outcast in this new place. Soon I started to like boys and a nice boy asked me out I agreed to date him but kept our 7th grade relationship on the low. He would call me on private on my cell phone every night and we would talk about life. I finally had someone I could talk to. My parents eventually found out and saw some of our messages and my mom literally pushed me against the wall and dig through my phone reading every single one of my messages much to my embarrassment. She would threaten oh just wait till your dad comes home. I waited in stomach dropping anxiety as I knew this would not go well. He hit me and slammed his hand so hard against the wall that his hand split open and blood went on the wall. I was scared. He told me to never talk to that boy again and that my phone would further be on lock. This sort of behavior continued through high school. I eventually made some school friends and avoided the whole topic of me calling or texting them which really impacted my social life. I had another boyfriend in high school who my parents actually got to meet. I was allowed to his house for only two hours a week but no where else. No movies , no restaurants, just his house. And my mom would get out the car to check if his parents were there. I was only allowed to text him on her phone and not delete any messages. My mom read them every night. He never found out it was not my number. He often complained about wanting to take me on a real date. We ended up breaking up due to the fact that my mom found out we did  sexual act . My dad demanded he come to the house to explain himself. My high school boyfriend never came over. This was “proof” he didn’t love me. I was horrified. I heard the horrible rumors going around school how I was treated as a 9 year old and how crazy my parents were. I couldn’t deny it but it still hurt. My relationship with my mother started getting worse she hit me with a wet rag on the eye when I was being disrespectful to her and my eye bled from the inside. I tried to get a job when I was in 10th grade to try and be financially independent and start saving yet I wasn’t allowed . My mom told my dad and he yelled at me and I for the first time told him I hated him. He hit me across the face so hard that it bruised. Fast forward a year I was a junior. Very calm. No major issues I was single for quite awhile after the previous horror experience. I decided to date a nice boy again he was 2 years younger but we clicked very well. We were always laughing and just talked about life . It was by no means that serious of a relationship but it felt like that at the time. My parents refused to meet him due to his age and I was ordered to break up with him immediately . I never did but they made it known they were not okay with me dating him and his “welfare family”. One day my dad ordered me downstairs and told me to keep calling my boyfriend until he answered cause I was going to “break up with him”. I had known this was coming and told my bf to not pick up no matter what. He listened . After many threats I stood my ground I wasn’t going to let my parents do this to me again. I wouldn’t let another relationship be ruined. My dad told me to get out the house then. I was upset I immediately called my bfs mom and she drove over right away to pick me up. I left with all my things and my dad told me not to come back. My bfs mom ended up talking to them and I ended up having to move back but things were never the same at home. I was a betrayer of the family now. I was told I was to sleep on the couch no longer would I have a room. I also was not allowed up stairs and had to keep all of my belongings in the laundry room and the closet. I at least had a place to stay but my siblings refused to talk to me and my parents refused to do anything about it since I did this to myself. I tried many times to say sorry and apologize inviting them out to many events yet always getting declined . I eventually stopped trying and got the whole “you don’t care” response. My mom and I are constantly at odds and whatever I do is never good enough for her. My dad always calls me a liar and is now waking me up at 5am and telling me to get out the house and not come back till curfew. I’m currently about to graduate college . I still sleep on the couch (a lot of times the floor due to my family using the living room late at night) . I am not treated as one of the family and am starting to feel resentful. I have another boyfriend who I met in college who they view as a piece of shit. His family loves me and actually talk to me like a normal human so naturally I just want to spend more time over there. They told me to go live there if I’m just going to be over so much and I’m a betrayer. I’m “too worldly” and I treat my mother like shit and stress her out. The scholarships I’ve won I do not deserve. I will apparently be miserable and regret everything according to them. I am told to shut the fuck up when I try to explain myself and my siblings have me blocked on social media. I’m hurt and I wonder did I really bring this upon myself? Please help. ",02Mar2019,1

I took the medication all through Middle School and some of High School but in grade 11 I decided to try going without it.

167," My professor was offering bonus marks for those who attended a conference event. I couldn't make it to the event because I was studying for four midterms that same day. My friend who went to the event signed my name onto the attendance sheet. Something I did not ask her to do. She just did that of her own accord. My professor was at the event and saw that my name was signed but knew I was not at the event. My professor sent me an email calling me out on this. So now I am expected to apologize and I am also in trouble for academic misconduct. Not to mention my professor thinks negatively of me now.

168,"I'm 24, a junior, and still working on my bachelors degree in something I don't care about and will never use. Like other people I felt I had no other option but what I want to do with my life has nothing to do with college. I go to school in a tiny freezing town and I hate it here. I hate the stress college brings and the fact that I'm wasting my twenties here and have been for years instead of taking that time embracing my talents and living a different life. I feel like I have potential and I've been told I'm very talented by many people. I can see myself succeeding, but at the same time that seems like a distant pipe dream: I would need to overcome mental health issues and severe trauma. I feel like I'm too far gone. I can see myself taking my life when things get bad enough, somewhere on the horizon, if my life never picks up.

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety but I really don't think it ends there. I suspect I have ADD/PTSD/OCD. And I struggle with compulsive skin-picking. When I'm trying to concentrate I can't keep my hands still. I can barely make decisions, my bedroom and my car is filth, I dwell on things I say in conversation and I'm just a terrible procrastinator. Being that I live in a tiny shithole college town, finding adequate help has been a struggle, still have not gotten there yet. I use on-campus psychiatry but I just realized my therapist, who I see off-campus, isn't very good. 

While I have mental health issues I believe most of my trouble is caused by my childhood. I grew up with two abusive parents and a severely disabled sibling. I have a lot of painful memories and years of my life feel like a massive disassociative blur. I feel like a dark shadow has been cast over my life. I've suffered so much and no can understand. It's this profound sadness in my whole body. I had an awakening when I left home a few years ago when i realised nothing about my life was normal. I can't decide whether or not I should forgive my parents. Their apologies can never erase what they've done to me. I want to cut my entire family off and disappear from their lives.

Everyday is a fight because on top of hating college as it is and processing trauma/mental health, I want out. I can't take it anymore, I have suicidal thoughts everyday. I only have one year left but getting myself to give a shit and actually try on my assignments is like pulling teeth. Everyday is a struggle. I don't see the point. I don't want to change my major, i dont want to transfer, i want to leave. I've gotten involved and had fun doing that but academics are the main reason why I'm  here and it's agony. I want to move far away and live on my own terms and pursue what I want to pursue. I wish I could get out now but I already invested myself in this semester. I've been hating college for past semesters too but ive never had the courage to do anything about it, I just reason with myself and come back to the same obstacles. I'm so unhappy and i need help. Any insight or wisdom, please.

169," (early 20's F) Srry long read

&amp;#x200B;

Last summer my mom pressured me into signing my name onto a financed car at around 1k/month (total with insurance). I worked part time and didn't think I'd even get approved when she asked to check but I did. . So she had previously purchased a used car from her somewhat friend and paid it off for me as a gift to ease my commute in the big city where we're from. Not once did she mention car bills, issues, or anything about finances that would be considered a red flag.

Fast forward to maintenance on the used car:  It also turns our the guy who sold her the car had previously warned her about issues that had to be corrected. It was only 5k worth of fixes needed so I asked her about and she went on a one player screaming match which turned verbally abusive per usual.

The next week she says she just wants to look at trading in our car for a car of my choosing from a certified dealership. I didn't want a new car I insisted we could just get my used car a fix over the months and be fine. I was already saving towards a college tuition, moving out, and i didn't want to add expenses. 

Bottom line, she pressured me into buying the car using my credit (she doesn't have any) saying she'd cover the payments.. So I did bc I live with her and knew she'd threaten to have me out on the streets if i didn't. I have been kicked out countless times ever since middle school so I just couldn't take the risk of being homeless again I just couldn't do it okay, so I signed my name. .  

Not even two week in went by before she got power hungry and used the car against me. She physically fought me over this issue bc it was ""her car"" and she could have her way with me. After the fight she kicked me out meaning i had to relocate out of state and I had to quit my above minimum wage and very stable job and school. I spent my entire savings from working part time and made it to 5 months of car payments + insurance. 

Now I'm back home bc I thought she'd pay if she would pay to have exclusive access to the new car like we fought over. She's refusing to pay. She can but she doesn't give two shits about me or what she's done. She's always been a toxic person but what I suppose to do in that situation? I'm not okay with being homeless again, it was the roughest parts of my life begging for shelter for food for kindness. I've had trouble finding another job and have only been back for a month now and my savings are long gone. The stress of having this car is eating me alive, I want out of this debt out of this situation. 

My question: What do I do? What can I do? I want to give the car back but my credit would be damaged right? Is there a way to soften the blow to my credit?  Will I ever be able to finance an apartment or another car when I'm older and have a stable job?

172,"**tl;dr:** It's become hard to focus at work (and sometimes in general), be proactive and keep up with new hires hustle. Please advice what to do

**Background:** I'm 26 and this is my first job after university (been working there 3+ years). I've also changed teams a couple times while in this company.

**Body:** I joined the current team about a year ago because they urgently needed another person so the higher ups requested to transfer me. The past several months I notice a decrease in my desire to work. I don't feel proactive, feel like I'm going by the bare minimum requirements, not really thinking ahead or actively making decisions. Instead just waiting for things to happen. I catch myself spacing out on meetings and using my phone a lot at my desk.

Looking back I can identify these 3 negative pieces contributing to why I might be losing my grip, desire and / or focus:

* *New colleagues:* they recently hired two new entry level people who are just out of university and hustle hard. They always step up making a good impression and being proactive. It kind of belittles because I'm considered a senior (level above them) but I feel like they are more in the loop than I am. They're very determined and I don't have the energy to keep up with them. One of them sometimes makes mocking comments about me and seems to not respect me.
* *Shit manager:* doesn't care at all about the job and actually gave his 2 week notice today and is officially leaving. During the time I report to him he often overlooked my work, didn't provide any feedback or encourage me. We frequently disagreed on work-related decisions. If anything he restricted what I do and prioritized his attention on one of the new hires. It's super discouraging when in a meeting about a project I'm leading he invites the new hire and talks to her, doesn't look at me at all even though I'm suppose to be the lead. I feel like she became his favourite.
* *The field:* This team is responsible for a field I have no experience with. English is not my native language so a lot of the terminology used is unknown to me (even in my native language). I've been learning and getting a little better but it still very difficult to keep up and understand the discussions that they're having. A lot of things change frequently, I feel like there's too many cooks in the kitchen and it's hard to stay on top of everything.

**Other Possible Reasons:**

* I'm not reading / learning enough outside of work. I generally listen to music and some comedy podcasts (I fall asleep listening to them too).
* I'm bored of the company.
* A couple of months ago I occasionally (once a week or so) started taking these ""brain enhancement"" pills. I'm concerned they messed me up and now I feel dumb without taking one. I don't think I took them often enough to establish a dependency but still something I'm cautious of.
* Not understanding the field of the team is blocking me from being more proactive. It's hard to think outside the box and make decisions / impressions at work when you don't know the ins and outs of this field.
* Ended a long relationship a couple months ago but I'm not dwelling on it so don't think that's it. I also stopped smoking cigarettes and now vape which is also unlikely to be affecting my thinking / energy but worth calling out.

**Possible Solutions:**

* Be upfront to new boss about struggles, ask to be less involved with new colleagues and instead do my own thing
* Apply to a new team in this company or find a job at a new company
* Suck it up and try to be better. Quit using phone at work unless at breaks or lunch. Ask all the questions despite how dumb they are, despite a lot of people saying ""wow I can't believe banica24 didn't know this"". Meditate every morning. Play crosswords, sudoku and other games that simulate the brain.

I can't find any of them anywhere and I think she has actually got rid of them. She wont give my phone back which I need incase my boss calls beacuse when I ask she just tells me to shut up. Whenever I ask a question to my sister or brother she just says No one cares or shut up when i'm not even talking to her.

He probably saw me doing that ,so he quickly came out of his house and got on his car and waited till I headed onto main street.  Although we made a little eye contact,I had no clue he was following me the whole time and when I was just about to stop at a stop sign,suddenly,a white Volvo XC90 came out from nowhere cut me off and stopped right in front me. I realized it was him and he quickly jumped out his car and came towards my car while he was cursing at me,initially I was confused since I didn’t know what was going on so I rolled down the window and he said “ you little cunt,I’m gonna f*** kill you if you ever do that again” I said “I’m sorry,what did I do?” and he goes “ you were f*** driving on my grass,are you f*** retarded or what ?” (The temperature is around minus 30 in my city and all the roads are covered with ice and snow). I didn’t want to escalate the situation so I quickly apologized to him and told him that I didn’t mean to do that ,then he goes “f*** you,you piece of s***” while I kept saying sorry to him. He then quickly left the “scene”.   

This whole incident left me speechless and I’m now really upset and extremely overwhelmed by this incident since I have never met any one like him in my life.

184,"I've been an apprentice upholsterer for 3 years, my training is up and all I need to do to be a tradesman is get my certificate of competency from my boss.

The past 4-6 months have been particularly tough in my workplace.

The business is just us two, I came aboard out of the blue after some experience in the field inspiring me to pursue the career. I've gained a lot of skill sewing to the slight detriment of more advanced upholstery skill (the direct application of material to furniture, is what I mean here). But I am very grateful for the experience I've been given.

I've also gained a lot of managerial experience. Quoting, client management, logistics etc. Anything you can think of in a similar sized trade.

However, my boss is very slack in just about every aspect of the business. Arrives late, takes frequent breaks to walk his dog, run errands, read the news online. Works slowly through jobs.

This occurs mostly when business is comfortable, just enough on our plates to pay the bills and me. But his attitude shifts when business is slow and bills are due. I'd mostly become used to these mood shifts and learned to ride it out, but lately it has been more difficult die to unfortunate circumstances.

We moved the business across town to move in with another business that restores furniture, which made total sense and did work out for the most part, but the partnership hasn't worked out and we've been struggling to get out since about October last year.

My boss has not been proactive when it comes to making the move happen. The specifics aren't important, but they amount to my boss resisting speaking with the owner of the other business, which has led to being blind sided by lawyer's terms we weren't expecting. He generally spends any time that could be used beneficially preempting arguments with people instead of heading them off.

I was very hopeful for this new year in regards to the direction of the business. Now I have no hope at all. I have lost respect for him and am extremely frustrated  by his approach to business.

We had a potential new team member start early in the year on a week trial, things looked good. She started in earnest Tuesday gone and quit yesterday. She confided her worry about my boss' attitude and sense of insecurity in her role. She wanted to be in the trenches much more than the boss was I tending her to be.

After a long chat with her, I realised that I have been putting up with far too much for far too long. More than what I've complained about here. I was utterly dejected, I went home and spoke with my fiance, visited my dad and spoke with my mum and they each pointed out something I'd blindly missed. A job opportunity.

The job is in vehicle upholstery very close to where I currently work. I spoke with them yesterday behind my boss' back and they are enthusiastic. I have had a lot of interaction with them prior to then so I am not going out on a limb by expressing interest in a job with them. They had thought about hiring me hypothetically the last time I saw them a few days prior.

My current boss needs to pay my training fees, which he should have already. He needs to sign my competency certificate and then I'll be a tradesman. But it seems like a truly shitty thing to leave my current employer, he bought a new truck, is about to commit to a 3 year lease in a nearby premises and the business will fold without me.

But I don't feel that I can stay.

I know nothing will make it easier, but I always like to hear from a totally separated party.

Appreciate your time.

189,"For context, I used to have friends when I was younger, up until 10th grade (12th now) when I went to a mental health institution. After that I only had 2 friends, the 2 friends I’ve had since 4th grade. 

I’m embarrassingly shy and anxious so I don’t really know how to approach and talk to new people, plus I always get anxious that new friends i’d make are just friends with me to use me for stuff or make fun of me behind my back (or probably both). This has now caused issues with my only two friends I have left. I say this because the only time we hang out they want me to smoke them up or bring them somewhere, we never do anything just for fun and when we hang out they don’t really talk to me- I do all the talking while they basically sit there in silence with a few ‘yeahs’ and ‘ohs’. 

They also have no respect for my things. My friend put all my things on my backseat of my car into the wet muddy floor and left a full smoothie on my car floor too (seems kind of random but it has to do with it). Well, I got into an argument with them today about it and started crying and was basically just saying ‘you guys don’t care about me, i do so much for you guys and i feel like you guys only use me for things. plus, you left my brand new clothes on my dirty, muddy floor and a smoothie when I told you multiple times to please not do that’. And again, they just sat there in silence and only talked back to me because ‘well you shouldn’t have left your clothes in your backseat’ and ‘well the smoothies frozen today so it doesn’t matter’ (it wasn’t frozen the entirety of the day yesterday when i was driving with it in my car for the entire day on slippery roads?’ they didn’t say anything about how i felt like they made me feel like shit or how and why i felt like they were using me. In fact, the day before it I told my friend the same thing because we had plans but then they cancelled them to hang with their other friend, so I go “You guys don’t give a shit about me” and my friend just goes “Ok??” oh yeah, and my only 2 friends are siblings so neither of them ever have my back. 

well anyway, tonight my friend texts me and says ‘we cant be friends anymore this isn’t working out’. Now, this wasn’t a huge argument. I never said one bad thing about them (unless you think telling them how they make me feel is something bad about them, but thats why I was hurt) (lol literally bc i got suspicious that they were just using me and that i got mad that he left my shit plus a smoothie on my floor?) so anyway now i have no friends. if anybody wants to give me advice on how I should’ve handled this situation or how to make more friends, please let me know.

195,"So, the background here is I'm a bi woman, 23. I've been with my girlfriend for 5 years. Her younger brother is a 20-year-old that just moved out on his own, and is having a rough go of it. He's lonely and depressed, so I've been talking to him on and off, whenever he needs someone to vent to, just so he has a friend, even if we can't actually hang out. (He lives kind of far away.)

About a week ago, he messaged me sounding odd, his messages full of typos and not making much sense, but I didn't think much of it- he drinks a lot. So, I humored him, because his drunken ramblings were entertaining and I had no reason to ignore him. The conversation took an awkward turn, though. He said something along the lines of ""if you weren't dating my sister I'd totally be dating you."" ... I guess it's because he knows I'm bi, and I've been nice to him?? But I thought that was an inappropriate thing to say, disrespectful to his sister at best, so I pretty much shut him down as nicely as possible. ""I see you as a brother, sorry."" etc, and had to ask him to stop sending me flirtatious/kissy emojis. That was a week ago, and we haven't spoken since.

Now, he hasn't had much experience interacting with any girls who aren't related to him, so I can see how he could've gotten the wrong idea, and alcohol could've made him say something dumb. That part isn't what makes me mad. The issue is that I found out later the same night that he'd been having a conversation with my girlfriend around the same time, and she was shocked when I mentioned how wasted he was. Apparently he had perfect grammar/spelling with her, as normal as ever. So, I assume he was faking it to me, presumably to excuse what he'd said? And then, she mentioned how dark their conversation got; he'd been saying he's suddenly suicidal, stressing her out because she's terrified that he's serious. I know such comments are serious, I'm not trying to make light of his issues, but it puts a bad taste in my mouth to complain to someone about how sad you are about being rejected, when you were rejected by that same person's girlfriend.

We're slated to see him tomorrow, as he's coming to visit my gf, and I don't particularly want to be around when he does. I've told her what happened, and she doesn't think it's an issue at all because he didn't press the topic after I firmly asked him to stop. Should I just pretend like nothing is weird, and hang out with them? Am I being dramatic???",02Mar2019,1

197,"Face your fears is good advice when it comes to things you want to do, or know are best for you, but are scared of (talking in front of a crowd, asking someone out, etc.). 

https://www.inc.com/sims-wyeth/17-inspiring-quotes-to-help-you-face-your-fears.html

^ a lot of quotes on the subject


But I have OCD, and it’s telling me to face all my fears, even when I have them for good reason and don’t actually want to do the action. For instance: contacting someone on a forum I sent a cringey but harmless anonymous message to as a young teenager 17 years ago to apologise, even though I didn’t say anything bad (it was just cringey and lovestruck), he has no idea who I am, and has probably forgotten the incident. So contacting this person out of the blue on Facebook.   

Or posting on /r/rateme. It does scare me, but mostly I don’t want to do it. I’m confident enough in my appearance, but I’ve seen a lot of people be judged harshly there, so I don’t think it’s a good idea.

Or telling my father I’m bisexual, when I’m not really bisexual. I had a crush on another girl 7 years ago, and haven’t since. If I actually did have another crush, I’d tell him and he wouldn’t care. I don’t see why I should awkwardly bring up a crush I had 7 years ago when it’s not part of my identity and I’m not attracted to women. So the terrible awkwardness of that conversation scares me.

Or trying smoking (already gave in and tried). I don’t feel good now I’ve tried, because it wasn’t something I wanted to do. There wasn’t pride in conquering the fear; quite the opposite - a feeling of having given in to make the obsession go away.  I feel like I’ve opened the gates and I’m a prisoner to all my fears. Anything I’m afraid of, I have to do. That’s stupid. 

See what I mean? All this useless bullshit I’m obsessing over. I was hoping someone might logically set out why facing literally all my fears is a bad idea. Sometimes I respond better to hearing it from other people. The problem is I keep reading about why facing your fears is good, as in the link above, and misapplying that advice to literally everything, to the point where I feel I have no control. 

Here’s my attempt for two other common pieces of advice:

Live every day as if it your last. No, because if you did that, you’d spend every day crying, eating ice cream for all your meals, farewelling loved ones and going to Disneyland. The actual meaning of it is to avoid spending days or months on end stuck in a situation that you don’t enjoy (bad job, bad relationship, etc.).

Say “yes” to everything for a change. Sure, being more open will likely take you to unique places, but you need to say no *sometimes* to avoid being taken advantage of or wasting a lot of time in activities of genuinely no value to you. So the spirit of this phrase is simply to consider being more open to things.

If anyone’s still reading, I just realised I’m Jim Carey in “Yes Man”, where he has to say yes to every offer made to him. I’m essentially the same, but I have to say yes to every fear I have.  ",02Mar2019,1
199,"A little bit of background before I get into my problem; I am a fourteen year old girl, I make all A's in school and am part of NJHS, I play tennis for at least 9.5 hours each week, I live in a big house and have plenty of friends. For the past two years, I have been struggling with symptoms of depression, anxiety and ADHD. Recently, my relationship with my mother has been increasingly bad; it wasn't great to begin with, but it's really bad right now. We barely talk, we avoid each other and argue when we do talk. The other day, I had a massive fight with my mom that ended with her storming out of my room crying and me bawling in the bathroom for over an hour. Writing has always seemed to calm me down so I wrote down everything I had bottled up on a piece of paper, using both sides. The letter talked about everything, my symptoms, my frustration, my insomnia; I poured my heart into that letter. In the letter, I also apologized to my mom. I know I should reach out to somebody and talk to my parents but I just can't. I was thinking that giving my mom the letter would let her know everything there is to know about what's wrong with me. I'm afraid that dumping so much information on her at once will make her even more upset, even though it would be the fastest and easiest way for me to tell her how I feel.

I've tried all my life to get her to stop, (even begging her with tears to stop) because of how concerned I am, despite that though, she doesn't really care to stop. It's even affected me at times (she also smoked while I was in the womb, but I don't think it affected me phyiscally, maybe mentally because I think I might have a slight case of OCD) like me getting bullied at school because I smelled like smoke all the time, but I didn't care about that.

204,"I've been with my boyfriend for 6 years. He's verbally cheated on me for a girl he has been trying to win over for 15 years and gave up after he saw she was stringing him along. 
This year he started to say things like “I'm sorry it took me this long to realize how much you mean to me/took me this long to realize I'm in love with you.”. He's started to spend money on me, constantly says he wants to be around me and showing a lot of affection. This is the first time I feel like he has ever loved me. He makes me happy and safe.

However, I'm starting to see red flags. He started to delete all his texts messages, changes his pin and though I have mentioned I feel uncomfortable with the friendship he has gained from his ex coworker, he still texts her. 
He's told me that he changed his pin to make it easier to open his phone when driving. He deleted his messages because he thinks it slows down his phone. He hangs out with this girl because he hates being alone at the house. 
I have huge trust issues that I'm trying to work through.
What should I do?

I know it's so freaking stupid but I don't want to go or leave him and even if I did, I don't have anywhere to go. I have a judgement against me from being evicted (we live at his dads now - house will be ours in april). My friends and family adore him and would be pissed if it ended because of me. 

Like… what do I do? I love him… I really and truly do but there isnt much trust. While there are red flag, he has made a lot of progress. He went from never wanting to settle down to wanting to get married in November and have kids with me. 
I can't tell him to pick between me and his ex coworker because I don't want him to resent me in the future for it or for him. He believes he can help this girl get clean (she's into meth).

209,"Pros of working night shift
- I’ll get £450 on the 15th of march which could go towards some bills 
-I start tomorrow so no waiting around 
-I don’t have to interact with customers much (socially anxious here) 

Cons of working night shift 
- My sleeping pattern will be messed up
- I won’t be awake enough to go to my seminars as work would be from 10 pm to 6am and seminars are 9/10am
- I’m already very very behind on my school work and this might make it worse. I need to get enough credits to transfer to a different university so i’m scared to risk not getting enough
- Pay day is in 2 weeks and 2 weeks worth of pay isn’t enough to cover my rent and a loan i temporarily took out. 

also should i go to the 5 hour paid induction today ? 

*TLDR* Night shift job will affect my sleep and studies but will give me enough to cover half of my bills. I could get a paid weekly job but whilst i applied for it, I haven’t actually got the job yet (risky). Rent is due in a month, so i have time i guess



The other option is that I wait to be given an interview at a job I applied to at a store that pays weekly. I actually applied for 2 stores in different locations. One of them gave me an interview, the other hasn’t yet. I’m very good at interviews so i’m confident i’ll get the job. I have 4 weeks to pay my rent so i’m nervous but not overly nervous.

I believe I have two options - pay for school and finish my degree (1-1/2 years left) or learn on my own outside of school and attempt to get a web developer job without a degree.  If I pay for school, I will have about $150 left over each month after all expenses so things will be tight.  That is my main concern, but it’s only 18 months.

224,"Alright boys, here we go.

There's this guy, let's call him Joshie, that I have known of since 6th grade (currently a freshmen in highschool). I met him through mutual friends and the second I saw him I knew I had romantic feelings for the guy. However, we went to different schools so from 6th-8th grade I really didn't think about him much.

Flash forward to the summer before my freshmen year. Joshie, my friend who currently has a crush on him (we'll call her Maddy), and I are all in a summer activity together. When I met Joshie again I was instantly very drawn toward him but I honestly thought that it was just because he was cool and I wanted to be his friend. It wasn't until later on that year that I actually realized that my feelings were and are romantic.

Now I'm taking you to Autumn where my best guy friend (note: not Joshie) asks me out. I say yes for many reasons, none of them being that I actually like the guy. The whole story of this dude is long, complicated, and doesn't affect my relationship with Joshie or Maddy so it's not relevant.

During the two weeks that I was dating my guy friend, I find out that Maddy fancies me. Maddy and I are both bisexual so it wasn't totally out of left field but it was still stressful. Now I'm dealing with a lot of unwanted romantic attention and my anxiety, which is normally manageable, got totally out of control.

Right before winter break things reached a calm and Maddy stopped liking me and my best guy friend and I weren't together but we also weren't hating each other anymore. In this calm I realized that I liked Joshie romantically. I didn't tell anyone though.

Over break Maddy had a party and she invited me. That's where she ""spilled the tea"" and told me that her break had sucked so far since she really misses Joshie. Oh shit dawg. I still didn't say anything though.

Now finally to where we are today. My closest friends now know that I like Joshie. Maddy still doesn't know. Joshie and I aren't dating or anything but we hang out on weekends and we do all the stupid crush stuff where you sneak glances at each other and whatnot. At the risk of sounding arrogant, I think Joshie and I are going to become a thing unless I specifically try to stop it. 

What the hell do I do?? Is it dumb and rude for me to go out with someone that Maddy likes?

And I realize theyre just caring for me, but frankly im like 17 and dont need then to tell me if im full or not, i can judge that just fine myself. And sometimes being cared for when you dont need it is just as annoying as being harrassed, since it also kinda implies they think you dont know what youre doing. When I bring up this issue some people call me entitled and im getting so much stuff and being ungrateful but I dont think so, being treated like a little kid and taken care of like a baby while being almost an adult is pretty annoying, they also constantly barge into my room to make my bed and wash my clothes when I can do it just fine myself.

And whenever I tell them I dont need X done for me or they can take a break they just quickly do it anyway. A few times ive gotten really annoyed about them constantly barging into my room and doing chores (like 5 times in 10mins) and after I ask them to leave me alone specifically they come right back saying itll only take a second. After a few of these instances I got really annoyed and yelled at them to stop once but them my grandma started crying (I didnt even say anything harsh, I was basically telling them to get our of my room and leave me alone really loudly) so I basically am stuck.

232,"The title is probably the best TLDR I can muster, this is a long one.

A little bit of background to set the stage.  When I was 22, I dated this girl who was 18.  We dated for around 9 months and ended up breaking up.  My life had gotten really rocky and I couldn’t handle being in a relationship at that time.  She took it really hard and always assumed I was hiding the real reason I broke up with her.  She was a virgin and we tried sex a few times but things never worked out for whatever reason.  She assumed that’s why I broke up with her and that I was using her for sex basically which couldn’t be further from the truth.  

We kind of remain friends.  About 6 months after we broke up, I find out she’s talking to my best friend.  This blows up, and after a few terrible exchanges, things turned really sour and we stop talking entirely.  I was upset she was talking to my best friend.  I was emotionally immature and thought she was talking to him out of spite.  So naturally, I reacted poorly.

Fast forward 6 years, I run into her at a concert on my birthday and she’s with my ex best friend still.  They’ve been married now for a couple years.  We chat for a bit, I asked if we’re cool and she said we’re fine.  She says it’s all in the past and suggests we hangout sometime soon.  We all exchange numbers and that was that.  

I was honestly really happy about this.  I don’t like having bad blood with anyone and was happy to move on from this.  I was upset for a long while about them being together, but it’s been so long, I really couldn’t care less at this point.  I’d just like to have my old best friend back in my life and try and be an adult about the situation.  

So we all start talking again, catching up on what’s been going on with each other the last few years.  After a couple days of sporadic texting, she brings up how things ended between us all those years ago.  She tells me she had some unresolved issues from when things ended that have given her some insecurities and made things tough on her.  She said she’d blamed herself for things ending and felt like she was sexually inadequate because of what happened.   

She kinda made me feel like I owed her a better explanation for why I’d ended things all those years ago.  I prefaced this by saying that I just wanted to give her a fair explanation for closures sake.  She said she understood and she was glad to finally feel like it wasn’t all her fault that things ended and put to rest some of her insecurities about it.

We hang out a couple of times, me her and her husband.  Have a few drinks at a bar, hang out and play old video games.  We all have a great time and it seems like we’re all handling this pretty well.

This is when shit starts getting weird.  I noticed she’s texting me a lot more often.  I don’t really think anything of it at first, but then she starts saying things that kind of weird me out.  She told me she’s glad I’m single because she thinks seeing me with another girl would feel like a gut shot.  I can kinda sympathize with this feeling, seeing an ex with someone new for the first time can sting a bit.  But it’s also been 6 years and she’s married now.  So this weirded me out.  I asked her if her husband was cool with everything and how much she’s texting me given our past.  She responded by saying “it makes him a bit jealous 😏”.  I responded by saying I didn’t wanna be disrespectful and we should probably text less.  I’m not trying to stir anything up, just making peace and hanging out.  

Tonight, they were out drinking and I couldn’t go because of work obligations.  She started texting me as they were about to head home saying she wishes I could’ve been there and that she missed me tonight.  I said I was sorry I couldn’t make it but I was happy to hang out with them next weekend when I was free.  

Then she hits me with this text
“Too bad you didn’t see me in my cute bar hopping outfit 😘”

I responded by saying
“You’re married (ex’s name).  You’re basically a dude to me now”

She responds 
“Pfft, you know you think I’m cute ✋”

I responded
“You’re married.  The only person you should be texting like that is (husbands name)”

She didn’t respond

I’m honestly a little blown away at this point.  I tried to put myself in her husbands shoes.  If my wife was texting someone shit like that, I would consider it the first step to cheating.  I want nothing to do with her romantically or sexually.  Even if she wasn’t married, I don’t want anything to do with her at all outside of a platonic friendship.  I feel like I’ve made a mistake by talking to her again.

What do I do here?  Did I handle this properly?  Should I tell my old best friend?  Should I just talk it out with her and try to remain friends?  Cut it all off and don’t look back?  I’m at a loss.

I don’t wanna give her the wrong idea that I’m at all interested in something with her outside of a friendship.  I’m really happy that my old best friend is back in my life, so I’d like to try to resolve this, but I’m not sure I can even do that now.  I don’t wanna get in the middle of their relationship in anyway.  I feel like I’m fucking things up by talking to them again.  I feel like she’s disrespecting her husband.  I feel like maybe me entertaining the idea that we could all be cool again is a pipe dream.

233,"Hi, im 15. Never struggled badly in school. It’s getting harder for me to concentrate at school and at home and a lot of times i just lose my thoughts as im actively thinking about them. This hasn’t happened in the past. It’s also harder for me to retain information than before. I dont think it’s a tumor or anything, but im still concerned. I’ve been a little depressed lately meaning no good moods and no bad moods, which i’d imagine isnt helping it. I’ve been getting a decent amount of sleep recently (previously i didnt) and i’ve been taking vitamins. What are the possible causes? Not sure if this is related or not, but i’ve had rly good vision, and it’s a bit blurry sometimes, and idk if it’s a tic or not but i feel the urge to like raise my eyebrows to like stretch my skin on my head kind of and make a popping noise in my head i think with my ears (not entirely sure how i do it, but it might be hereditary because mom does it as well)",02Mar2019,2

235,"TLDR: Moved into an apartment where the drywall/walls/paint have been horrendously maintained. Want to redo the walls- advice?

So my guy and I just got the keys to a new place today (yesterday at this point), and we're psyched! It's a great little apartment, great location, great price, and, best of all, not in my Mom's basement. However, as soon as we became the keyholders, we realized how terribly it's been maintained.

We want to make it work, and are both hopeful about the situation. We cleaned a lot tonight- and were prepared to caulk things and fill in holes and were planning to prime things for painting afterwards, but the drywall jobs in the place are consistenly awful. Awful enough that I can't justify applying the expensive KILZ primer we have to them... Beyond that, most of the windowsills are gummed up with gobs of latex paint, and there are large paint drips all over the place. Seriously looks like the person drywalling and painting gave less than zero fucks, and  smoked 2 packs a day... there are nails buried in the paint, staples are all over the place... You get it, it's a fixer-upper to say the least. 

We're still in my Mom's basement, in the same town as the new place, so we've decided to stay a little longer while we correct the terrible walls, at least (if anyone has any tips on the awful window paint issue I'd love to hear them). Our plan is to buy a palm hand sander, smooth what we can, and then use mud to fashion a smooth wall over the terrible ones... I'm wondering if this is a good plan? Anyone got any advice?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I just had to try to be unknown while posting this pathetic shits (yes fake account ... real person.. real problem...) I also did post this in another question post on reddit in hopes to get some helpful people that may have some advice for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

29 year/o male from Illinois

&amp;#x200B;

I'm seeking advice but I'm not sure where to start. This might not the perfect subreddit to post on ; I'm not sure. 

Eh .. 

Anyway - I guess any advice would be great. Specially pertaining to my first question/situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Drivers License - Perfectly able to drive. Actually one of my top 3 thing's to do in life. Situation - Once I turned 25 I had to renew my license. But I'm the state of Illinois - Youre unable to renew if you owe money on tickets. Course, I'm not perfect got a speeding ticket( 15+ mph, racing to work years back ) and 2 seat belt tickets. Roughly 600 dollars worth in Fines. I basically haven't been able to get it back for four years now. Does anyone have a suggestion of what I may do? ( can't pay it )

&amp;#x200B;

First thing ties into the second thing. I've personally have had my share of jobs - retail, telecommunication inbound calls, security job - I'm just not sure what I want to do with myself. I'm at the age where I know what I want and don't want, and that causes my options to be very slim. I certainly don't want to work a cash register and with my anxiety, the less people I've to deal with the better.

&amp;#x200B;

I see all these jobs on [indeed.com](https://indeed.com) or something - they all have great listings then .. bam ... require drivers license ... Personally...I just want to mention with jobs, its hard for me. I'm not lazy, but at times I can be slow. I'm very fatigued inlife, depressed, whatever. When I first get a job its all hunkydorey - love it at first. back to making money - then 3-6 months in bam - all these pressures from having rough anxiety makes me aches. some reason i get pissed when ima round people and my anxiety starts making me feel weird and do weird stuff(mainly movements i guess) ... all these things just pressurize in me to the point where i call it quits. recently when i started noticing this a year ago with what was one of my last jobs - i went to the doctor. course this is the kind of clinic that doesnt want to perscribe anything ""good"" --- In the sense ive nothing for anxiety they trying to take care of my depression with welbutrin (and smoking that ive tried to quit for like 8 years)

&amp;#x200B;

I just dont know where to turn honestly. I look at jobs and the good ones require license, the other good ones require experience. Realisticly the only job i want is driving but that 100% isnt gonna happen. i feel like theres nothing more out there other then those two situations (require exp/DL) I really just wish someone was like here - heres a good job for you. your hired. (also think about IT work but need college degree)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway this is a bit of rant, but any suggestions / helpful information would be great. If this doesnt gain much traction then, on my own we continue. =)

238,"Hey, sort of a weird one. I'm F 23, and was having casual sex with a female that attends the same university I do. At the time she was in a relationship with a married individual, so we were very, very casual, friends with benefits really. 

However she did have some issues with drugs and alcohol, which worried me a little but I'm no saint myself and she's a grown ass woman so I never really pushed that.

We never had any sort of problems communicating, it was always so easy to tell each other if we wanted to cool things off or see how things were with other people, which is why it surprised me when she disappeared off the face of the frickin Earth?

One day communication just stopped and she hasn't attended university since. I once sent her a message on a service that has read receipts just saying ""open this message so I know you're alive"" and she did, but her phone was never passworded and I wonder if that was even her now.

I've recently just moved into the same town she lives in (not anything to with this situation, I'm not stalking her!) and it reminded me of everything and I wondered as I'm fairly nearby if I should swing by her place? As the title suggests though I dont want to be a creep!

I know if my ""fwb"" turned up at my house with no invitation I'd be a little taken aback, and maybe a little weirded out especially if we hadn't had contact in a long time! 

I do worry though as she doesn't have any family nearby and no friends in the country. Her being in a relationship with a married guy doesn't put me at ease because I can imagine that going wrong in multiple ways, and her drug and alcohol (ab)use was beginning to get slightly worrying. 

Is it possessive and wrong of me to just turn up at her house. Realistically if she is no longer with us, me knowing won't change that. 99% chance I'm just being ghosted because she's done with me, which would be fine! I don't really know what to do, I can talk it through with people IRL because I can't bring up the her personal issues, which is the thing that's got me specifically worried. Do I need to just get over my damn self? Be brutally honest with me, I need some objective, perspective. 

TL;DR 

Don't know if I'm being ghosted by my old FWB or if she's OD'd in her flat and no one knows. If I go to her place is that creepy, borderline stalker or an okay thing to do? ",02Mar2019,1

240,"Ages are hella relevant in this situation, so: I am currently 14, my brother/sister(she might be trans, it's confusing.) is 15, almost 16.

Backstory: I was neglected by my mom from an early age (3) and my sibling had pretty much raised me. They were there for every nightmare, victory, defeat, etc. and I grew extremely attached to them, to a point where without them I wasn't capable of actually making friends, socializing, doing anything, etc. I have since become better at managing without them. 

However, in the past two years they have gotten into a lot of trouble. Summer of 2017 they did drugs , and may have gotten a girl pregnant (was never confirmed due to her drinking the baby away). A week before Christmas 2017 they became violent and were sent to a group home, a few days after to lockdown where they stayed over Christmas. 

January 2018 they got a girl pregnant, for the next few months they would attempt to fight for custody, but ended up putting the child in foster care when it was born. Summer 2018, they ran away from the group home they were in multiple times and were sent to lockdown for the second time. August 2018, may have gotten a girl pregnant again. Halloween 2018, ran away from the group home and went on the run for 3 days, with a friend who was extremely depressed, suicidal and had server anxiety, she had no medication with her. Christmas 2018 she was in lockdown for a third time, I forget the exact reason, but it was probably because she ran away, they stayed over the holidays again. 

Currently: On the run from the police due to running away, we have no idea where they are. All we know is they're with friends somewhere. According to his ex (who is carrying his second child) he may be back into drugs. According to him he is in a fundraiser group, a fundraiser group that you can only find on Facebook and need to be accepted into the group to view. I call bullshit. I told them they were low life father who didn't deserve a kid, and that they were an asshole sibling. I would've gone on, as i am fed up with this shit, but i didn't.

**Onto what I need advice on!**

Long story short, you don't have so to read my life story again: I feel like an ass for some of the things I said while cutting off communication, but I also feel like I shouldn't have cut off communication as what if I could've helped them? I've never been the best sibling, and I know that, so maybe they just needed me to help them and finally for once in my life be a good sister and actually do something for a change instead of letting them fight both of our battles? I don't know, I just feel a bit like shit, even though I know there was nothing I could really do to help.",02Mar2019,1
241,"I knew I never wanted kids. I never enjoyed them and never had any interest in spending time with them, even when they were family. 2+ years ago I started fooling around with a friend and, needles to say she, got pregnant. I'm asking you don't pass judgment on that because i thought I was safe. I managed to have sex for 13 years with no slips, so I'm careful.
Anyway... I told this girl that I couldn't stand the thought of being a parent the night she told me she was pregnant. Her reason for wanting to keep the baby was that she felt bad the first time she had an abortion and couldn't do that again. I didn't agree with that because it seems selfish and that she's only considering her own feelings in this, not mine or the baby whose life, in my opinion, is fucked before or even begins. 
She decided to keep it. I go off the deep end, silently. I am very close with my family, but couldn't stand the thought of bringing this to light. I tried to be supportive of the mom throughout the pregnancy. I even went to a few ultrasounds. Throughout the pregnancy mom shows how much she really cares about the baby by drinking on multiple occasions. I can count at least 5 times that I personally saw her have multiple drinks. We have huge fights over this. I can't imagine ever being happy again with nightmare mom and a baby that I don't want. I  was being eaten alive by my own thoughts. I completely lost it and tried to kill myself when she was 7 months pregnant. I managed to sever the artery, tendon and whatever else in my left wrist. My best friend didn't let me go. I was stupid enough to think she wouldn't notice me leaving. Almost 2 years later I still have almost no use of my 2 smallest fingers. 
After that I managed to bullshit my family and say I was just being drunk and stupid. Somehow they believed me. The following few months are a blur... But mom apparently is in love with me.
After the baby is born I try to see how mom feels. She says she feels nothing for the baby. I know postpadem is a real thing in a lot of women, but given how she acted while pregnant I tried to convince her that adoption is the best thing for the baby. Astoundingly, she's perfectly healthy and even cute. She won't adopt her. I think it's pride, but what do I know. 
I finally break down and tell my family everything when the baby is 2 months old. They're supportive, of course, and love the baby instantly. 
I give up on my own happiness and try to play family because I think I can learn to love babyand hopefully forgive mom. I hate every minute of it, but I put on a smile and, once again, fool everyone into believing that I'm ok. This goes on until baby is 12 or 13 months old. Mom is noticeably depressed the entire time. I guess she thought baby would make her happy. She didn't. She then tells me she wants to drive off a bridge and kill them both. I immediately went and took baby away and brought her to my parents house. For a few months my parents and I split custody, only giving mom supervised visits. Now mom watches her two days a week, i watch her 2 days a week, and my parents 3 days a week.
Baby is now 18 months old. I want her to have a good life, but I still feel nothing. I still have no desire to carry on. Escapism is the only thing that remotely comes close to happiness for me, which is why I'm drunk 4 or 5 nights a week. I don't know how long is too long to try... I'm a ""good"" dad to her. She loves me, i can tell. But at a certain point I either have to stop kidding myself, or actually want to be here.

245,"Below is me explaining what’s been going on—sorry its so long but I can’t explain my situation well otherwise. 

First off, my girlfriend’s cousin and mum died two weeks ago within the same weekend, but different occurrences. Just really unlucky. She doesn’t have any other family who genuinely cares to be emotional support her so I’ve been spending a lot of time with her to make sure she’s safe and doing alright. On top of that, my mum has a mental illness that makes her paranoid and lately it’s been worse. She’s been talking to me about the same things, over and over. Beyond beating a dead horse. I love her, though, because it is yet another situation like my gf. I’m the only family member who genuinely cares to look after/care for my mum. 

Tonight my friend went off at me for not talking to him, even though I have been. Constantly. It stressed me out beyond anything because it was all BS accusations, so I talked it out with him and tried to make him cool off.

Today I felt so suicidal that I began shaking uncontrollably. I felt like I wasn’t me. Like I was in a dream. God knows why but I cried as well. I haven’t cried in what feels like a year. It just made me more stressed. 

There’s more going on. Possible identity theft is just the icing. School just finished, thankfully.

I tried explaining this to my manager on Thursday but he acted like all of this was no big deal. I’ve been in a very bad mental spot the past two weeks (ever since the deaths) and I’ve ended up missing 3 shifts due to my depression getting so bad lately. Instead, he just talked shit and continued to make passive aggressive comments about me calling in “fake sick” even though I didn’t call in for “being sick” any of the 3 times. Each time I explained it was due to being up too late working on **school finals** (literally), and making sure my gf was in an okay mental state. 

I’m mentally worn out. Today has really been in the top 10 of worst mental days ever. I have work in about 8 hours and I’m worried I won’t be able to interact with customers at “1000% happy mode” like my manager always expects me to. I just don’t know what to do. My plan at the moment is to try and push through, but I’m worried that I’m going to just break down again like I did today.

249,"So backstory, I used to be a girl, and started working at a large chain restaurant as a hostess when I was 17. On my first day, I made friends with another host (M, 27) through our mutual love of video games. Since some days were slow, sometimes we ended up just chatting at the front door, waiting for the next customer. We'd talk about just your run of the mill gamer stuff, and eventually our personal lives. 

One day, he started talking about his exgirlfriend, who in long story short, appearently used him for money 2 years ago and caused him to go broke, and having to move back into his parent's place for the time being to save money. Anyways, being a normal person, I sympathized with him. 

After 2 months of working there, I turned 18 and that was when I started noticing that he would say seemingly normal things, but when I look back at it, they weren't. For example, I mentioned that I liked Dungeons and Dragons, and he mentioned how that ""turned him on"". I'll admit, I was naive and thought he was kidding or something, so I just awkwardly laughed. 

I also noticed that he would mention what his exgirlfriend did to him more often, repeating the same story over time. At this point I should also mention, I was in a relationship, and made it well known that I had a boyfriend within the first week of working there. He also wasn't a gamer and never wanted to game with me, so I mentioned that to this guy and the other hostesses a few times or so, whenever we talked about our SO's. 


Anyhow, after a few months, I soon resigned due to wanting to focusing on school. On one of my last nights, I got a message on Steam after work, and it was from him. Now, we had been chatting regularly, but all the times prior, it had been about normal topics. It would have been a red flag, except I also had other friends who messaged me all the time, so I thought nothing of it. Anyways, this time was different. He started telling me I should strip for him, and that he would love to have sex with me, and other explicit things that I won't go into detail about. 

Anyways, I was pretty freaked, and although I initially replied awkwardly, I eventually said that I had to go, because my friends were streaming the screen with me and thought he was weird, or something along he lines of that. I'm sure he was sober during this time as well, because when he messaged me while high before, he always had ""messier"" typing and  misspelled words. 

That was about a year ago, and to his day, I cant game anymore without getting triggered and thinking of that incident. I know I should have reported it, but I was scared to at the time, because I was saying things like ""Haha that's weird"" or ""Lol"" at his remarks, and thought it might have been partially my fault that the conversation continued. In a way it was, as I should have just told him to stop, but I had thought he was kidding or something, until I thought about all the other red flags that he had given which I didn't notice.

My question is, should I still report it? Like I said, it's been a year but I think he still works there, and with other high school girls too. I'm worried he'll try something with them. Although I was 18 at the time of the incident, I had barely just had my birthday, and I think he might have been waiting for me to since we met. Also, if I did, I would send in a letter, and leave an anonymous contact email, because i really dont want to face a whole ordeal myself, as it's a triggering issue for me. I also don't have proof, because he deleted me on Steam after the exchange, and I didnt think to take screenshots because I was so freaked out. I do have one message in my Facebook of him calling me pretty though, but I'm not sure that really helps. I'm not sure if there is even a way to recover those messages. 

Anyhow, I have still been thinking about reporting it after all this time because I'm afraid he'll prey on other young girls there, not because I want revenge or something. What he did was legal anyways, so it's not like he committed any crimes. Let me know what you think. ",02Mar2019,1

251,"So my current living situation is myself, my brother, his wife and my best friend since high school living in a 3 bedroom condo. I'm not married but will be moving out with my girlfriend next year, and my brother and his wife will be as well. 

I'm 33, my room mate (I'll call him ""John"") is my age and has had a rough life. His mom was ill for many years through high school and into adulthood before passing away 4 years ago. As you can imagine he was devastated. Myself and our group of friends tried to support him as best we could through these times, as well as John's brother and sister who live nearby. I really tried to be there and support him emotionally as best I could, but also encourage him to better himself and find his path in life. He is an aspiring artist but hasn't really picked a path to commit to in the industry and isn't very educated in any field. He has a lot of potential but has never applied himself. Despite the support, he has committed to a lifestyle that involves mostly playing video games and smoking weed. He is afraid of growing up. He essentially stays in his room most of the day, and I try to talk with him here and there when I can but he tends to keep to himself. That aside, he has a great job as well as a great part time job bartending. As far as I know he is very professional at work and makes good money, but when it comes to having any self worth and motivation to do things for himself, he does the absolute bare minimum. He is deeply depressed and hides it well. I know that he has some comfort and feels support living with us, his close friends, but I also know he is living a double life.

I can't help but be concerned that once my brother and I move out, he will continue down this path of self destruction and never apply himself to something he truly loves. I have had talks with him many times in the past, gently suggesting some lifestyle changes and offering advice on how to create goals and take small steps toward those goals...even helping him invest in a computer to work on his digital art. He ultimately always chooses to live the way he did in high school - weed, video games, take out food, watching movies etc. 

I know that he is an adult and needs to make better choices for himself when he is ready, and I can't force him to grow up. However I do want to sit down with him at least once more while we still live together and offer to help him get his life together. I personally don't know how to approach this without setting an expectation that could potentially make him panic or feel judged.

252,"Current situation: living with my bf temporarily (we don't feel ready to move in together). I found a place thats in a good area and is equally far from my work from his place, the room is awesome as with the roommates 

But I will only be spending 2-3 days there since I stay at my bf's a lot and its 25% above my budget I wanted to spend on housing.

My parents say I should take a place imagining as if I'm not with bf because I want to make it feel like my home and this would be the place but I can't reconcile with the fact that it's more expensive than I originally wanted and I won't even be getting full use out of it. 

Any thoughts?",02Mar2019,1
253,"For context, I’m in high school, and when we moved to our new house three years ago, cameras were installed in almost all rooms of the house except the bedroom and the bathrooms. I literally don’t know what I was doing, but my mom marched upstairs and demanded I showed her all the tabs I had open because she saw me watching a youtube video on the camera. She told me it was something inappropriate (it was a lookbook video??), and she yanked the headphones off my head and threatened my friends to go to sleep and stop talking to me or she would call their parents. 

I was literally just typing on a doc online and looking through bucket lists for things to do over spring break.

Thinking about it now, my mom said the cameras were for security reasons but in that case shouldn’t they be only outside??? And she sometimes texts me things like “I know you’re not doing ____. I can see you on surveillance.” And she constantly goes through my stuff, reads my diary (I stopped writing when I found out), and she used to demand my passwords on social media. 

She would embarrass me in front of my friends if it meant leverage for her control over me and control over who I talked to, which caused a lot of problems in middle school and led to bullying. I’m really frustrated about this, and it seems like she doesn’t trust me at all. Especially since I wasn’t even doing anything that could seem sketchy.

And she was being really protective over what I wore, but it just made me feel sexualized and weird. I wanted to wear shorts and she said ill attract the eyes of older men and younger horny boys. She said the only reason I’d want to where that outside was to tease boys.

She does this weird thing too where she tells me I’m one thing then when I change she tells me another. For example: “you wear so many baggy clothes. you look like a boy.” so i started wearing form fitting clothes “who are you trying to flirt with? why are you putting so much effort into your clothes now?” or something like “your legs are so hairy and ugly. and your teeth are big like a rabbits” i started hiding my smile with my hands and shaving. “you dont have to shave. your beautiful either way. and your teeth are fine.”

She even praises me and shows me off as if I do nothing wrong, and I hate it because she makes it seem like I’m this perfect human when I’m not.

Is anyone else’s mom like this?? Or is it just mine??? how do i deal with this??",02Mar2019,61
254,"I love my sister, but I’ve never been able to have a close relationship with her. She’s struggled with addiction most of her life. When she was using she would go to any lengths necessary to get drugs, including stealing from our elderly grandmother and pawning irreplaceable heirlooms. She could be very manipulative and cruel, although it’s hard to say whether that was her actual personality or the effects of drugs. I never spent enough time around her either way to be able to tell, but most of my memories of her are negative ones. 

I lived in a different state than her most of my life, and recently moved back close to the area she lives. We live about 30 miles apart. She’s sober now and seems to be getting her life together. I’ve been talking to her a bit more often and have hung out with her a few times. Now she is wanting to come to my house to hang out when our brother is in town, but I don’t know if I’m ready for her to know where I live. 

Up until this point, all hangouts have been in public places. I just don’t know if I trust her enough yet to let her be in my home. I don’t know how to tell her this though. I don’t want her to feel like I’m going to hold her past against her forever, but I also don’t want to put myself at risk. She has not been sober for more than a few months, and if she does relapse, I don’t what my place to be on her list of places to potentially rob or for her to show up here unannounced if something bad happens or if she gets evicted again. I hate that I even have to consider this and I feel like an asshole for not trusting her, but it is what it is. 

There is so much more that goes into this than just past addiction issues, but it would take me a year to type it all out. 

I just don’t know what to do. I don’t want to hurt her, but I want to keep these boundaries. I want to keep trying to build a positive relationship with her but it’s going to take time before I feel like I can fully trust her enough to let my guard down. 

Has anyone else ever been in a situation like this? How do you keep boundaries and spare feelings at the same time?

259,"I'm 17m, and I live with my aunt. My father and cousin are also in my life, but they don't live with me. About 2.5 months ago, I pulled a 180 on my life. I used to feel like I was doomed in the future of life, I had no plan, I wasn't able to be social at all, I had no identity, and I was pretty autistic; I was generally just some joe shmoe of a human being. Now I'm dedicating myself to self improvement, I have a plan for life, I can socialize very well, I have a clear identity, and if you met me today you would never know I acted pretty autistic not to long ago in my life. I'm writing this post because all of my online friends that I can talk with this about are asleep and all fucking lies start with tomorrow. We all know the movie the matrix with the blue pill to be conformed into the lie of society, and the red pill to see reality for what it is and break free. 2.5 months ago I took the red pill and 99% of the people around me are still taking the blue one. I see millennials talking about ""the grind"" and I look at it, and go ""fuck that shit, I'm gonna go do everything that was beat out of you by the school system and your teachers and family who are still living the lie of the blue pill. I honestly reject the 3 members in my family, I obviously love them very much, but you will never hear me on a stage going ""I have to thank my mom"" (my aunt is pretty much is that for me since she adopted me at the age of 6 months). The only reason I'm making a life for myself is because I reject what my parents want for me, and my aunt is always yelling at me about my life choices, and how I need to follow what everyone else is doing, yadda yadda yadda. I hate when she does this, it causes an itching in my brain and I just fucking walk out of the house for 3 hours when she starts.  


Today I was planning on doing some work towards my life goals. I have a list of things to accomplish by age 18 and yesterday, where I had marked down 6.5 months till age 18, I crossed out the .5 just making 6 months left; I had made no progress. This was one of the few times in my short life that I felt a deep fear. I just spent half a month that I should have been working towards something just fucking listening to music. A 3 min song goes to 15 min, 15 min goes to an hour, an hour goes to a day, and a day goes to half a month, I'm not letting that half a month go to half a month and 2 days, and fuck me if it turns into 6.5 months. Today when I was listening to music in school, I was just asking ""why am I fucking doing this?"" and when I got home I was about to eat an Oreo, and looked down in my hand, asked \*why\*, and chunked the fucker into the yard, then turned on the oven and made a meal. I was bored by denying the pleasures I sink myself into, and unmotivated to do work, so I went to bed for 4 hours. I wake up, I sit on the couch upstairs in my game room, which is also my work room and a general me room. My bedroom is too small to think in. There's a problem with this. My game room that I work in is open to the down stairs and I can hear my aunt grunting and wheezing because she didn't exercise for 20 years and is age 64, I hear things getting knocked about down stairs and the TV is on. When I woke up after my 4 hour nap, she was out of the house. I thought she was a sleep or something, but I didn't hear her, so I just went to work. After spending 30 min learning what I need to on how to use Scribus and about to get to work, I heard the door open and I heard he so clearly downstairs. Old men will at least try to hide the fact that they're dying and a lot will go to the gym to not have their body to be falling apart; not my aunt, she is dying and you are going to know it whether you want to or not, you can hear it in every breath, and see it in every action. I'm hearing her right now, she'll probably be asleep by the time I get replies to this, but the same thing will happen tomorrow. I can't function when I hear her, but I can't be productive in the room I can't hear her.

260,"Don't really know if this belongs here or not but it's an interesting story none the less.

I'm a socially awkward 16 year old male (what a shocker), and recently i've talked to my mom about how some girls have been acting wierdly around me. She asked how and I responded ""well one had her friend ask me if she liked me and-"" my mom cuts me off and says that girl likes you.

SHOOK.

I always thought girls found me unatractive. I went to my sister with this problem (thinking my mom must be wrong) and she asked ""what did you say?"".
I responded ""at first I answered ""as a friend yeah"" but her friend pushed the question specifying ""do you like like her?"" (We are still under aged so you can't expected her to ask ""so you love her?"" You know"" so seeing no way out of it i said ""yeah i guess"".  My sister then specified ""a girl normally only asks that question if she likes you or thinks you're being creepy, how did she acted after that?""
I said ""she became more clingy and-"" (once again cut off) my sister said ""oh she totally likes you"".

° °
O

Mc scuse me mf

Every time I ask someone about their thoughts its always ""she totally likes you"".

Just... How could I be so clueless. But this is when it gets worse (or better).

Earlier this week I was talking to a friend (I don't remember what we were talking about). Then she asks (in the most seductive way possible) ""are you trying to impress me?"" To try and not come off as creepy or I like her I simply said ""no of course not"". She got sad and went back to work on her computer (this was in class mind you). She started texting someone and i just thought maybe someone died in her family (I honestly don't understand how I didn't take the hint). I ask her if shes ok and she said something along the lines of ""I'm fine!"" Or ""its none of your business"". So that solidified the idea of a problem in the family.

The next day rolls around and shes being cheery again and I think 'wow maybe someone was hospitalized and got released soon after'.  About halfway through class she walks up to where I'm sitting (this is crucial for my thinking in this next part, but their were plenty her friends sitting near me). I think 'she must be talking to a friend and continue working on my essay (it was english class). But then I notice shes still standing their about a minute later AND WAS FACING ME THE WHOLE TIME. I was about to take my ear bud out (listening to music is when I work best) when she kicks me. I take my ear bud out and look up at her. She asks ""can I sit next to you?"" I oblige and say ""sure knock yourself out"". I put my ear bud back in and continue working. Near the end of class I notice she is texting someone again I pay no mind to this and continue working. It was like that for the rest of the 20 minutes we were in class. Nothing note worthy happened after that however.

It was only after thinking about the strange behaviour and texting that i relized what happened.
She was mostly likely into me and was texting a friend for advice on how to get me to like her...

I am like a cliched harem male protagonist and because of what has happened I have a whole new respect for harem protagonists. With the information I have obtained so far I have... Absolutly no idea how I'm going to reacting to anything either of them do. I mean it hasn't come to hugging my arm yet... But I believe it will soon escelate to that. 

I truly just need advice cause anime characters rarely make the first move but also real life ain't no mfkin anime. How they hell do I handle something like this?! Just what?!

I will be posting updates as thinga progress and am opening this post up as a advice post but also an ama.

262,"So backstory, I used to be a girl, and started working at a large chain restaurant as a hostess when I was 17. On my first day, I made friends with another host (M, 27) through our mutual love of video games. Since some days were slow, sometimes we ended up just chatting at the front door, waiting for the next customer. We'd talk about just your run of the mill gamer stuff, and eventually our personal lives. 

One day, he started talking about his exgirlfriend, who in long story short, appearently used him for money 2 years ago and caused him to go broke, and having to move back into his parent's place for the time being to save money. Anyways, being a normal person, I sympathized with him. 

After 2 months of working there, I turned 18 and that was when I started noticing that he would say seemingly normal things, but when I look back at it, they weren't. For example, I mentioned that I liked Dungeons and Dragons, and he mentioned how that ""turned him on"". I'll admit, I was naive and thought he was kidding or something, so I just awkwardly laughed. 

I also noticed that he would mention what his exgirlfriend did to him more often, repeating the same story over time. At this point I should also mention, I was in a relationship, and made it well known that I had a boyfriend within the first week of working there. He also wasn't a gamer and never wanted to game with me, so I mentioned that to this guy and the other hostesses a few times or so, whenever we talked about our SO's. 


Anyhow, after a few months, I soon resigned due to wanting to focusing on school. On one of my last nights, I got a message on Steam after work, and it was from him. Now, we had been chatting regularly, but all the times prior, it had been about normal topics. It would have been a red flag, except I also had other friends who messaged me all the time, so I thought nothing of it. Anyways, this time was different. He started telling me I should strip for him, and that he would love to have sex with me, and other explicit things that I won't go into detail about. 

Anyways, I was pretty freaked, and although I initially replied awkwardly, I eventually said that I had to go, because my friends were streaming the screen with me and thought he was weird, or something along he lines of that. I'm sure he was sober during this time as well, because when he messaged me while high before, he always had ""messier"" typing and  misspelled words. 

That was about a year ago, and to his day, I cant game anymore without getting triggered and thinking of that incident. I know I should have reported it, but I was scared to at the time, because I was saying things like ""Haha that's weird"" or ""Lol"" at his remarks, and thought it might have been partially my fault that the conversation continued. In a way it was, as I should have just told him to stop, but I had thought he was kidding or something, until I thought about all the other red flags that he had given which I didn't notice.

My question is, should I still report it? Like I said, it's been a year but I think he still works there, and with other high school girls too. I'm worried he'll try something with them. Although I was 18 at the time of the incident, I had barely just had my birthday, and I think he might have been waiting for me to since we met. Also, if I did, I would send in a letter, and leave an anonymous contact email, because i really dont want to face a whole ordeal myself, as it's a triggering issue for me. I also don't have proof, because he deleted me on Steam after the exchange, and I didnt think to take screenshots because I was so freaked out. I do have one message in my Facebook of him calling me pretty though, but I'm not sure that really helps. I'm not sure if there is even a way to recover those messages. 

Anyhow, I have still been thinking about reporting it after all this time because I'm afraid he'll prey on other young girls there, not because I want revenge or something. What he did was legal anyways, so it's not like he committed any crimes. Let me know what you think. ",02Mar2019,1

265,"Hey..
Thank you for clicking on this. I'm going to say right off the bat, this will be a long and kinda personal post. It's a lot of pressure to put on you. The reason I'll be bringing up so much personal and maybe even heavy info is because I don't feel like I have anyone else to talk to. The people in my life who say they will help and are here for me are the ones who ignore me cuz they only said it to look good. I've also cut off the people who said they were gonna be here and used things against me. I've been surrounded by theives and snakes. The one person who had my back is leaving.
I don't feel like I belong here; I don't feel like I can talk to my psychiatrist, or my counselor. My family isn't really there for me emotionally, even though they'd love to be. 
I've fucked up so many jobs here and I get disability for anxiety. So now all I do is sit around. I used to volunteer but everyone in this town is just so irritated with me. I don't catch on quick enough or this or that. I feel like I need someone around me but I don't vibe with anyone.
I remember how I'd travel with my ex and I'd be so happy. I want to run away from here. I feel like that would force me to get my shit together but then I remember how I can't support myself. Even if I did hitchhike and go to a new town, it would be the same as here; a ton of jobs I could get. Struggle with for a few weeks before I mess up or get overwhelmed and my mind won't let me really believe that it's okay. And I'd still be struggling with my health. 
I'm just not sure what to do. I feel trapped. I can't communicate openly with others, I self sabotage things without trying to. I can't make or keep friends, let alone deep connections. There's been so many bad things in my life that make me scared of people. I've had horribly mean family members. When I was young counselors would call me names and side with my parents. Friends have used me for things or talked poorly of me. I just recently stopped acting like I'm okay with things and it's fucked me over. I stopped going around people who were mean to me and put me down and used my issues as entertainment. I stopped acting like I like things just to be around my parents cuz that's not giving me anything. I could say company, but for some reason I'm just not okay with it anymore. I wish I could be okay with things like them, but I'm not. I'm either acting so that others will like me or I'm in my room wishing I had a purpose.
I'm not sure what I'm looking for here. I want to ask how to start over. I am not sad I don't belong here. But I've been talked out of any career I'm interested in and I just can't be talked outta the things I've said here. I'm good at being an emotional dump. But I've learned so many bad social skills. I learned recently that I either talk to much or not enough, and if I ramble sometimes I say mean things and not realize till after. I don't think I mean them but so many people have told me I'm abusive I dont even know what I mean to do and don't anymore. 
I wanna say that I wish I could have a meeting with a counselor every day but i couldn't afford that. I dont think I could just wait a week either for another appointment. 
I just wanna leave and hop trains and hitchhike and keep going till I either land in jail, find a friendly town and feel a sense of belonging or learn that I actually am too sensitive, shut that off and accept that I only live to work and act out the american dream. 
I know people are mainly concerned with themselves. And I understand that. So. If you made it this far. Thank you for devoting the time. Again... I'm not really sure what I'm expecting to hear. So if you wanna vent in the replies as well ot share a story.. that's alright. I suppose I'm just venting, part of me wants advice and tips on how to leave and wander aimlessly, haha. I guess I'm really just hoping for anything but hate. Like I said, i already get a lot of negativity from people around me.. Anyways. I'll stop being a downer now.

My father was able to get me a job in construction when I was 14, out in the field doing hard labor. It was a good experience, did it during the summers up until I was 17 when he offered me to be manager at his construction company. I’m still working there because it pays alright for my age and I’m getting really good managerial experience. I could’ve gone to a 4 year university that I was accepted to but I decided not to because I felt like it was a waste of money and just wasn’t feeling it.

The problem is that I spend a little too much time with them. We all work in the same building, all day when I’m not in class, then I go home and see them then. I pretty much live for free, I don’t have to pay the electric bill or anything like that but I do pay for my own stuff (bc why would I make them pay right?).

Right now I feel like I’m not progressing, I’m doing well in school and at work but I feel like I could get something out of moving out. Right now I’m working to acquiring a general contractors license which will help open up a bunch of doors and help me make more money for myself. I’ve been offered by a friend of mine to move into a town home with him and some other people, we’re not super close but we play video games from time to time. It seems like a good deal because the rent is split and it’s a good area that’s thriving. Should I move out?",02Mar2019,1
273,"Ok so I ended my relationship with my ex because I was scared she would leave me and it would hurt (side note she was a great person I just have a lot of issues) so I lied and said I still loved my ex before her to end things before I got hurt. Looking back I feel stupid for destroying the best thing in my life and I feel like she should know the truth, but I think if I try to tell her it would just sound like an excuse to get back together. The whole idea scares me to death just because it's hard for me to admit when I love someone even without having to admit I'm scared to lose someone. I just want to know if telling her the truth is for the best or to just keep going with the lie?

274,"Hello, just some quick background before I get into this. I just need to ask for advice and help, I have no idea what to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm female (17) and I have a little brother (15) and my parents have been married for 18 years. We (mainly them) are very catholic so definitely  no divorce here but still. We're Chinese and moved from Hong Kong to Australia when I was 4 due to my dad's failing IT business and I was having trouble keeping up with school in HK. All our relatives are overseas.

&amp;#x200B;

My dad had a stroke when I was 6 (11 years ago) from Moyamoya disease (it's rare). Before, my mum was pretty much supporting our whole family as a nurse, but now my dad was fully out. Over the years he's made a great recovery and can walk, talk, drive etc. However, his thinking is not always the best and there are some issues. He's pretty self centred and not really empathetic (think passive aggressive road rage and being super impatient). Learning English has been also really hard for him, especially with the stroke so he can't really speak English well enough to get a job. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since my dad had the stroke, my mum has been taking care of the family by herself. She's raised my brother and I in a foreign country, lost her previous high nursing position in HK and had to take care of my dad. She makes most of our family income and does the gardening, cleaning etc. My dad has a job for people with disabilities but the income is unlivable so we get government payments. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, my dad's been a lot worse now that he's hit his mid 50s. He's a lot grumpier, even less empathetic (honking at other cars on the main roads), his driving is a lot less safe (near misses when merging lanes frequently to skip traffic, even though we weren't in a rush) and he's been arguing with my mum a lot more. She's a hard worker and I love her, but if you're working this hard all the time, it's easy to angry quickly.  They're having a lot more of monetary disputes and just not seeing eye to eye and refusing to communicate. I have to take my mums side because I have personally experienced it, but my dad's thinking isn't right? Even if you are clear, concise and simple he will fail to consider my mum's perspectives (or me). 

My mum just came into my room and cried. She talked about how her husband was 'dead' and now she has to take care of an 'extra child', which, I can't really deny. She didn't marry this guy, my dad is a different person to who she married. She talked about seeing her old colleagues from Hong Kong and how they were travelling abroad and posting happy pictures on facebook. We aren't having financial problems (I think) but their marriage is at stake. They don't even sleep in the same room (m dad sleeps in the guest room). There's no divorce but I don't know what to do. I love my mum and I love my dad too but I can see why she is frustrated. I just want them to be happy. 

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone can just give me advice here that would be great, thank you.",02Mar2019,1

However with my age and maturing etc I’ve began thinking lately that maybe one day I would like children definitely not rn but in the future yes. 
I brought it up to my SO and he wouldn’t even talk about it he says he dosent and nothing wouldn’t change his mind and I respect that and definitely wouldn’t want him having children with me if that’s not what he wanted. Seems like an everyone loses kind of situation.
I love him so much and he is my best friend I don’t want and can’t imagine not being with him but also I don’t want to reach 35+ and not feel fulfilled in my own life. 
Am I right to stay in the relationship (which is good may I add) even though we both want different lives in the future?

277,"Me and my girlfriend started going to the gym 3 days ago and tonight noticed two of my ex friends there. They saw us in the pool from upstairs and kept coming to the window to look at us and laugh. It made us (me especially) really uncomfortable... I’m a very anxious person but not nearly as bad as I used to be.  I want to confront them and say sorry for the dumb shit I did in high school... so maybe they’ll just leave us alone, but they were shitty to me too and are the biggest assholes I’ve ever met. The last thing they ever really said to me was that they were going to jump me when I least expect it (5 years ago). I feel like I should just ignore them and hope they’ve matured a bit... but honestly I think about what happened in that friend group a lot still and it tears me up inside and makes me incredibly anxious. It also makes me glad we all stopped being friends because I realized I was never being my self with them, and after them I met my best friends who mean everything to me now.

278,"So I’ve been working at this place for a few months almost 3 and they still treat me like crap. They hold me responsible for drive offs but if they ask to pay inside I can’t say no. I have to say yes and let them come in. I should at least have a choice if I’m being held responsible. They act like I’m to slow I’m not happy enough. And I told them I have jury duty coming up (which is illegal to refuse) and they said they will fire me if I don’t get my shift covered. Which is illegal. There was two days I only got one 10 minute break. And my knees were killing me. There is this manager that lets herself on break hours before she is suppose to for herself and sometimes skips our breaks entirely. They have such a high turnover and I can see why. All new people they treat likes shit. We get 2 10 minute breaks that’s it. And a little bit ago. I had one day off in between a 2 day work streak and a 3 day. They asked if I could pick up a shift my day off I said no because I didn’t want to works six day week. Because the next week I had a six day work week. They said well to bad because your the only one who can do it but WHEN you do it. We will let you go home early. They wrote that down and said if I don’t show I’m fired. So I showed up and they never let me go home early. The next day I was pissed and everyone knew it. But I got over it. With a chip in my shoulder. But today they asked if I could covers day shift tomorrow. I said no. They said well the manager didn’t give (girls who were currently in college and couldn’t get back) the schedule and we need you to at least take an afternoon. I said I’d have to check to see if I would be back by then they said they’d write me down for it just in case. Turns out I’d be out past the time I had to so I told them no. And they said sucks to be you I already wrote it so you are going to show. With a smirk. Now, I can take a lot but that just makes me mad. I just got through 2 six day work weeks and I already made plans it’s not my fault they screwed up. I can’t believe they are allowed to do this. If I don’t show I’m fired. But frankly.

279,"* While reading this, remember that I was not present at the time of this incident. I didn't see or hear any of what truly happened.

Here's a summary of what's going on:

My father was arrested recently because of an incident that happened between him and his (now ex) girlfriend. According to my father, he was laying in bed while on the phone with a friend, his girlfriend entered the bedroom, said something along the lines of ""don't tell people our business"", and smacked his iPhone 8 out of his hand. He says: when she smacked the iPhone out of his hand, the phone hit the radiator next to the bed, and the screen shattered. I did see the screen days after this incident and it was badly shattered. I think he told me that was the second iPhone 8 she broke.

* Note: My father is an alcoholic and he gets kind of hysterical at the peak of his drunkenness. Yes, he was drunk at the time of this incident.

After the girlfriend smacked the phone out of his hand, he says he backhand smacked her face one time. He claims the smack was a reflex.

* This is the most accurate replica I could find:

Imagine the area around the eye being puffier, and ignore the nose bruises/blemishes.

Now, he has to defend himself in court and he wants me to be a witness for him. Keep in mind, he had the option to plead guilty and only have to attend anger management classes for a few months (no jail time). So, he wants me to tell the court about events where she 'bullied' him and etc., but I truly don't remember these events happening. It isn't hard to believe they happened because she is a strong, dominant woman, and they did wrestle a lot. 

The main problem is: I don't want to be labeled as a snitch. If you knew me in person, you'd always hear me talking about how I honored omertá and fuck the police, etcetera. If this wasn't going to take place in a courtroom, I would lie my ass off for him. But it is in a courtroom and everything is going to be documented and recorded. 

What should I do: set my pride aside and lie for my father, or, keep out of the situation and let him handle it himself?",02Mar2019,1

288,"So my 16 year old friend has broken up with her boyfriend around a couple weeks ago and has been on a low mood ever since. 

She was already going through depression and anxiety to begin with, and because of that, her relationship with him failed. The two always ended up fighting instead of trying to understand one another. And because they kept fighting, it resulted in a break up.

Mind you, this isn’t her first break up. She’s had around three boyfriends in the span of one year— this one though, he was a good catch, one of my friends too.

During our first prom, we see him dancing with another girl— one of my friend’s best friends. She was practically devastated at this point then a few days later, we find out that the two were taking it slow before dating, but my friend assumed they were automatically dating.

So now, my friend is posting depressing “my days” on messenger. Not only that, she was home alone yesterday and took a picture of the balcony. Her ex-boyfriend confronted her about this, trying to help her not to do it— that it’s not gonna help anybody.

Let me say that we, her four best friends, and some of our classmates have been trying to help her go through it. But it was all futile because she kept shutting us out, ignoring us, or practically refusing all of our help. I mean, she listens to us but doesn’t take the advice or anything we tell her.

Eventually, we got tired of it because she has actually been doing this even before this whole break up with her boyfriend. We told her the truth: “We don’t want to help anyone who refuses to take our help.”

It might have come off as harsh, yes, but we tried to help her kindly and telling her how much we love her but all of it was useless because she won’t listen whatsoever. Telling the honest truth was our only resort to make her realise that there are people out there who care about her, people who think that her suicide won’t be doing anyone a favour.

It’s like she’d rather complain about her problems than do something about it.

Her ex-boyfriend has also confronted her and tried to help her get through it. He wanted to be friends with her, just like before, but she kept turning him away then cries over it. As her friends, we were there for her when she was, but during prom night, she wouldn’t stop. She and one of our friends kept going to the bathroom to let it all out that I barely even saw her in the ball room anymore.

She had also started cutting herself again, after a year of abstinence because we helped her stop. All because of this stupid break up.

I’ve talked to her ex-boyfriend about this and we had a recap of what happened:

He says that the two made a promise to not be too attached and that they should stay as good friend if they ever do split apart. He mentioned that he wasn’t really ready to be in the next level of their relationship yet because he just felt like carrying a burden trying to help her but like I mentioned before, she wasn’t taking any help then they’d just fight until they broke it off.

Now, when he’s moved on to someone else who likes him back, she gets jealous because that he visited that girl’s house to introduce himself to her parents. Keep in mind that the two aren’t dating yet, they’re just testing the waters.

They’re also trying help my friend to get out of her phase but she just rejects all help. He says that she kept apologising for what she had done and on top of that, she adds how depressing this all is and how it’s making her miserable.

We’ve made it clear that it’s making us feel guilty too, as her friends. It’s like she’s too selfish to actually care about all the help we give her. She says she’ll deal with it but she clearly isn’t “dealing with it” properly.

I’m sorry this probably isn’t as serious as all the other posts here but my friends and I are in desperate need of what else to do. She just won’t listen.

We’re still young and we don’t exactly have a clue on how life works, so I’m scared for my friend’s state and well-being. Please, we’re willing to consider any option there is.

I don't look very masculine. I'm short at 5'4"" at age 23 and have gotten made fun of for it. I look young, can't grow body hair, and have a statistically small penis. I do a lot to compensate to make me feel more masculine. I exercise a lot and eat well but I always feel like I look like the stereotypical short-person try-hard. I definitely have been a try-hard in school. I try to groom myself well, and try to dress well. I'm always looking to improve social skills and be more friendly.

The one thing that has ever made me feel masculine is my long-term relationship. A few months ago I confronted my girlfriend about her faking most of her orgasms which she was. This ended up really hurting my ego which is funny because she was trying to prop it up.

I'm happy to be a man and I understand that men come in all shapes and sizes. It just feels like everyone treats me as a boy which I sometimes find myself doing but I am an adult and I want to be respected as a man.

296,"So  I had sex with a girl(19) a couple times last month and was told today  that he is 7 days late on her period. She is not on birth control  however we had sex with condoms every time and everything seemed fine  with them (no slipping off completely and no breakage and a the tip  pretty filled). One time she was 4 days into her period and the other  time I believe it had just ended.

The  only thing I can think of is one time where I think I may have  accidentally touched the wrong side of the condom with my dick when  putting the condom and was stupid enough to continue. This was maybe 1  hour after having sex earlier so I assumed any sperm on the end of my  dick would have died off. I also checked it and it didn't feel wet or  anything.

I get anxious as fuck so have  been researching since I woke up and it seems that stress and other  factors can mess up a cycle? When I asked her she said she was really  stressed with school as she is studying to be a nurse and was doing  placements in a hospital. Also waking up early a lot and not getting a  lot of sleep.

Another thing I can think  of is that it was maybe her 3rd or 4th time having sex ever and she bled  a little bit the next day from it. I think that may have been because  her period had just ended though. Also seems like the first few times  having sex can mess with a cycle? I'm not sure though

She has had late periods in the past (about 2 weeks) though not common. And she has never missed more than one period in a row.

306,"Someone close to me is struggling with often wanting to have philosophical or deep conversations that generally involve questioning everything, especially societal norms, and it can come off to others as too energy consuming or even combative or unsupportive. They're just ensuring everyone is being logical and expressing reason behind their thoughts and beliefs, but it's noticibly upsetting to my friend. They think that this may be why they struggle making and keeping friends but they feel this is what makes them feel they're good friends with someone beyond just a surface level. 

I love them but also understand it's exhausting when you're not the type of person to question and reflect on everything, especially if you're the type of person that's never questioned anything in life. I have expressed it's what most people should be doing and it's a form of intelligence, but it doesn't make it any easier for them. What should I do? What should they do? 

I imagine therapy will be suggested but I don't believe it's covered and I'm scared they'd end up with an unsupportive therapist.
SSRIs (antidepressants) are involved.

I don't think their conversations and curiosities are wrong and I think they are in fact what I should do more of, but it's causing issues in their relationships so I think we need some advice.

307,"As the title says I think I want to transfer universities. A little bit of background on this, I had a choice between two universities A and B, they we tied in my opinion on wether or not to go to A or B. 

I chose A after I brought it up with my best friend and she said they were planning on going there, this was the tipping point to chose A. She told me last night that she chose a different university so there is nothing for me here I think.

Pros of University A
-already in my first year
-	will cost less than to transfer

Cons of University A
-6 hours from home
-	4 hours from best friend
-	I have literally no friends at this university


Pros of University B
-	4 hours from home
-	1.5 hours from best friend
-	they accept transfer credits although classes are different
-	already have a friend there

Cons of University B
-	May have to retake courses
-	costs
-	have to get used to a new city


P.s I decided after writing the majority of this post to say that I’m going for a bachelor of business administration and university A is Nipissing university in North Bay and university B is Lakehead university in Orillia.

308,"I am 16 years old and live in Denmark. I am a male, just saying for context. I’m sorry if my english is all over the place.

I really don’t know where to start but last time I wrote here, I got some real good advice.

Everything bad that happens I get blamed for

Every problem she has with her own personality she tells me is wrong with me.

If she doesn’t wan’t to do something she uses me as an excuse. She didn’t want to go visit my grandparents (aka her parents), so she told them that I didn’t want to.

She wants everything to be done her way or she threatns me with taking something away from me. (Fitness membership for an example)

She always want to talk about a problem she has with me, the way I act or that I should be better at remembering chores. Even though she knows i’m trying to improve. 

If I try to defend myself she would tell me not to argue with her. I’d then tell her that I was minding my own buisness untill she showed up. 

I’m just trying to get some peace and here she fucking comes telling me to wash the dishes. I then ask her if she even has been out in the kitchen. She hasn’t, because if she was, she would see that all the dishes in fact were clean. She did tell me not to argue then yes. Not only that she actually told me to leave her alone.

I have a depression and I am getting help. My mom pays for it, but is threatning me with ending it.

She would come out of nowere telling me to go work out. I’d tell her no, it’s not her choice when I work out. She would tell me that I never work out (even though I do) and that she will end my fitness membership or that I should pay for it. 

My mom  woke me up for work 7 in morning last weekend because i had to go to work even though I never go to work in the morning. So yeah.

My mother tracks me on find my iphone all the time. I asked her to stop. She said okay the first two times I chaught her but just continued. I tried again and she tried to find “a middleground”. She didn’t track me, but i had to tell her were i was and what I was doing all the time.... What!? No man, just stop tracking me i’m 16! What in the actual fuck is this?!

I have a sister who always argue with my mother, so you would think I could come to her right? Wrong! She unites with my mom and here you go. Two hours of listening to why I am a horrible son. My sister doesn’t live at home because they just couldnt get along. 

I live alone with my mom. My father was mentally abusive, but who knows if my mother just brainwashed me to think so. I know he’s no great dad at all, but who am I to know if he actually was mentally dangerous to be around of if I was getting brainwashed. Maybe they both are. Most likely my dad was but I don’t know about my mom to be honest.

I feel completely alone. My close friends are slowly drifting away. I don’t know if my classmates like me. I don’t even know if i’m just delusional. I don’t feel like I actually want to be alive. I want to move out ASAP or I think, I may kill myself in a few years.",02Mar2019,3
309,"To start things off I'll have to go back to the end of 2013, this is when I first started talking to this girl. From the very beginning I was madly in love with her, we had so much in common, she was stunning and extremely kind. I was open about my feelings towards her and she felt she just wasn't in the right head space to be in a relationship at that point in time. 

We graduated at the end of 2014 and we kept in contact through Facebook through to mid 2015, around that time is when I'd found out she was in a relationship. We fell out of contact fairly quickly after that but my feelings for her never faded. We would occasionally talk every 8-10 months very briefly but that was all. I'd had flings with other girls but all I could ever think about was her. 

Just last month I had found out she broke up with her boyfriend in October last year and we got to talking again but more frequently. She and I still have way too much in common and she is still the kindest person I have ever spoken to. I have honestly felt so numb these past couple years and she is making me feel so many feelings I forgot about. 

I asked her out 5 days ago now because we haven't seen each other since 2015 and I thought it would be nice to catch up in person, she was fairly short in her responses and I felt like she just didn't want to say no to me. I haven't heard back from her about meeting up and now I'm afraid that this is where it will end again. I'm so scared about going back into that numb abyss, I enjoy feeling these emotions and I feel like there won't be another person that will evoke these emotions from me like she can.

Please don't tell me to go and talk to other people because I have honestly tried that and it doesn't feel like it works for me.. how do I move on? or how would I pursue a relationship with her more seriously?",02Mar2019,1
310,"I was babysitting 3 small children aged 4,5 and 7 at their farmhouse today, things were going pretty well but I noticed it was getting pretty hot from their dad lighting a fire in the fire place. 

I was making breakfast and noticed something smelled a little but thought I must have just burned something on the burner, heard a short hissing noise and checked the room with the fireplace and didnt see anything, so I went back to cooking and just chalked it up to a log in the fireplace burning. 

After about an hour of being there the kids and I are startled by an extremely loud whistling/hissing noise, like a tea kettle boiling but louder, I run to the noise and am hit by a horrible smell of gas, I notice the dad has left a large propane torch next to the fireplace and it is gas leaking out into the room, I scream for the kids to get their shoes on and get out of the house and run over to the tank thinking if I don't get this out of the house it could blow up and kill me, I go to reach for the tank in my mind feeling like even touching this thing could cause it to blow up, the metal is burning hot to the touch, I pick it up and bring it outside and it stops whistling, I make sure the valve is shut and leave it outside all day. 

I called my Dad right after, extremely shaken and upset and he said I did the right thing, getting the kids out. 

I texted the kid's Dad while he was at work telling him what happened and he didn't seemed that concerned. 

That moment of reaching towards the propane tank was easily the most terrified I have ever been in my life, was this no big deal? Am I just being dramatic?

319,"So I have issues with myself. Sometimes I think I have a firm grasp of my strengths and weaknesses and I am at peace with myself, but then something happens, usually something insignificant, like losing more points on an exam than usual or someone critisizing me about my hair or me embarrassing myself and it is enough to send me into turmoil. I usually overthink it and obsess over it for days. Objectively, I have more positive feedback than negative but as I said the negative has much more of an impact on me. 

I am afraid of making mistakes so I hate speaking up in class or giving a presentation and I am so stressed over these that it has a negative impact on my performance. 

It also makes me overly competitive because it gives me a feeling of satisfaction to do better than others. People also often think I put up a facadé when I say I'm worried about my grades because usually they turn out to be fine, but I am in fact terrified of messing up.

324,"So this is going to be a long one but here we go. I’m really lost and confused. And I want to apologize in advance if some of the information is sporadic and jumbled. I did my best but I’m kinda furious at the moment and trying my hardest to think straight.

My younger brother who is the manager of my dad’s restaurant and a former employee are dating behind the back of the ex-fiancé who is a current employee.

So here’s the run down. I used to manage a restaurant for my dad before I moved on just recently to a new job that fits my career path. And my younger brother became the stand in manager. Well not long after I left, a former employee who we will call B came in to pick up a family friend who still works at our restaurant. Well my brother started hitting on her and they started dating. Well so far this sounds all wholesome and good. Well this is where it gets messy.

You see there’s another employee that currently works for us who we will call M. M here has been working at this particular restaurant for over 10 years. He’s one of the best workers there and I became pretty good friends with him. Well he and his fiancé B used to both work at this restaurant until about 8 months ago she quit to work at another place. About 5 months go by after she quit, and she breaks up with her fiancé M who she’s been living with for about 8 years now and has had 3 kids with. It wasn’t a pretty break up from the small parts that I saw. M really took it poorly and it negatively affected his health and work habits. He started started to drink a lot and even had to miss a shift due to being hospitalized for alcohol poisoning. I really felt for the guy. He told me a little about what happened. He told me she left him for another guy she was working with. She told him he treated her right. He kept cursing the “gringo” as he would say. It took him a bit to get back to a more manageable emotional state and only recently has he started to recover and stabilize.

As far as I know about their complicated relationship, was M has some commitment issues. He never really wanted to pull the trigger and get married even though they’ve been living together for 8 years and have had 3 kids together. He also has a deadbeat Brother and Sister who live with him but don’t pay rent.  And supposedly M’s family didn’t really like B. As for B, she was pretty controlling and manipulative. I’ve seen this first hand myself. M and B had separate finances where M payed the mortgage on the house and most of the food for the kids. B would spend money on the kids and her personal things (clothes, etc.).  Well this got even more complicated when they broke up as they stayed living together still but sleeping in different rooms.

Now let’s go back to the present. My brother and B have been going on a couple dates lately. And he tried hiding it from me. Well today I found out and I confronted him and asked what was going on. I told him that I felt like this wasn’t the right decision that he’s going behind this other employee’s back and dating his ex fiancé. That this is a layered situation. That this isn’t just some girl who doesn’t have connections to any of us but someone who is working under us and has been a star employee that we’ve relied on for many years. And that he’s not really thinking about things and being a bit selfish especially for not being upfront about it and trying to hide it from M. He kinda stormed out of the room saying some terrible statements I’m sure some out of anger. But I definitely feel like our brotherly relationship was damaged a bit. Now I have a question. What do I do? I feel like I’m good friends with M and I have the policy of I should do what I hope others would do for me. And in this situation if I were M I would want someone telling me about what’s going on. But on the other hand I don’t want to further damage my relationship with my brother. And honestly it’s not my relationship I have to deal with so I’m not even sure if it’s my place to intrude.

If you have any advice I’d love to hear it.",02Mar2019,1

I became addicted because I was in a negative traumatic period which lasted 5-6 years. I have beaten all the issues that were built up in that period, but now I'm left with the device addiction.  


Luckily I have already found a way to beat this addiction, which is to simply do something else in the meantime, endure the pain for about a week, and then be done. I have unlimited motivation to get my life back again. But I run into a very big problem: namely that the traumatic period encompassed (almost) all of my puberty.

It's started off as messaging everyday/every couple days for pretty much 2 and a bit years. The past few months she has basically stopped messaging me all together and I am always the one to check in and try to get the light hearted conversation going every so often. She's stressed, has a busy life and really doesn't have much spare time. She is always apologising for not messaging me, I understand life is crazy at times. The conversations lately have been short and I try my best to keep the conversation rolling but it just doesn't happen.  She is not putting in the effort and I am sick of trying because I believe friendship is a 2 way street, no matter how busy life is I always think there is time to send a how are you message and have a quick conversation with a friend. She enjoyed talking to me essentially to get alway from her problems and busy life for a bit, which I was definitely fine with but I feel now I am not needed in her life anymore and our friendship is coming to an end.

I'm not a party person at all, I have no intention of getting intro drugs, not even drink alcohol or smoke at any point in my life. I'm still a young teenager, but it's no surprise to hear that young people often get into trouble, smoke and drink while underage, and of course, go to parties.

I recently came across a post on r/teenagers about a person whose friend had died because someone had put something in his drink that caused him to have an asthma attack. It got me thinking about what I'd do if I were to really attend a party.
I can imagine myself with my only drink being a bottle brought from home, with a lid, that would never leave my hand. Sounds lame but better to be safe than sorry I guess. I know if I went with friends they wouldn't do the same, and would probably be way more careless, and maybe someone could put something in THEIR drinks.

I only started compound lifts like 2 months ago and am doing 40kg bench press, 80kg deadlift, 70kg squats and 30kg overhead press. 



I’m 5’10” and 70kgs and am trying to bulk in order to gain weight but as soon as I eat a big meal my stomach protrudes out even though my ribcage is visible the whole time. I’m pretty sure I’m skinny fat. 



Even my parents comment on my belly fat as they ask me “Why is your stomach out?” constantly even though they are both in worse shape than me. I don’t tell them that because I know what could arise from it.



Also, when bulking I’m sure you don’t have to look like a guy with a protruding stomach the whole time because I know a guy who started the gym last year who is a similar height and weight to me but he’s ripped now and has a 6 pack.



Again, this is so frustrating for me because I feel like I’m doing everything right but nothings changing. I don’t care what I have to give up or do in order to get a 6 pack and get into shape I’m just fed up of getting made fun of by people.

331,"TL;DR: My „messy self“ and „organized self“ are having a fight again and I don‘t know what to do. Should I loses up a little or push through?

I spent the last two years of my life organizing and „perfecting“ myself as much as possible. As a child I was very organized too but that eventually ended me in a very terrible position as a young teenager. The pressure in school was just too much so that I eventually ended up having a depressive episode, abusing drugs, cutting myself and seeing a therapist. I losend up a little and realized, with the help of many amazing artists and albums (cause music always has been my escape) that I can losen up a bit. That I don‘t ever have to be perfect and can sometimes really just enjoy life.

But I am still very ambitious and especially since I didn‘t get into university after finishing school (because I wanted to live abroad for a year and failed miserably in this foreign country) I have tried to keep a tight schedule and do everything possible to better myself. I have two jobs, and a blog, and I write my second novel, learn the guitar and this june I can apply for university again. 

I plan every day and write to-do-lists. I get up at 7 am every morning and go the gym three times a week, I count my calories. But lately I feel as if all of this just stresses me out. I feel trapped in the routines I created for myself because if I don‘t fulfill them I feel like a loser. I can‘t seem to find a balance between my „chill-self“ and my organized self and it is so annoying. 🙄 I recently considered starting smoking again because I wanted to be „rebellious“ against my own strict rules. Wow, writing this down makes it even more ridiculous. 😅

338,"Hello, I am new to Reddit and I was wondering if anyone has been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia? I have had it for years but was officially diagnosed 2 years ago. I have tried many treatments none of which made much difference to my pain. After a recent hospitalization I was prescribed Oxycodone. I do not wish to be on this pain med for too long after doing my research so any advice or help from fellow patients would be welcome. 

Thanks for your time in reading. ",02Mar2019,2
339,"So this is just a weird situation. Yesterday I was hanging out with my friend all day mostly hanging at the beach and after that we went back to my place and played some video games. At one point he went to the bathroom and when he exited it he said something to the effect of ""wow you've got a lot of medicine in there."" Which kinda threw me off because why call attention to that?

I do have a few random prescriptions that I kept around even though they're years old because they kinda amuse me that I was ever prescribed them, the three in particular are Ambien (to sleep on a plane I hate flying), pseudoephedrine (for a particularly strong cold), and last vicodin for when I had a couple of root canals done in 2016.  

Anyways I briefly explained the medicines being there to him and joked about how they were like my ""illicit reserve for a rainy day"" or whatever and we went back to playing video games before my friend eventually left. But the next day (today) when I was shaving I noticed that the vicodin from my medicine cabinet was missing, and I'm sure it was there less than a week prior because I remember looking at it and kinda cracking up over me even having a whole bottle of it still (I never needed to use it, the pain pre-surgery was much much worse than after). In that proceeding week my friend was the only one who had been over. 

Now I don't actually need this medicine at all so there's no like real worry over me not having it but more than anything I'm just so baffled and thrown that my friend who I've known for like 4 years and who I've hung out with probably at least once a week with for the last three and a half years would randomly take my medicine. He's had a million opportunities to do far worse or steal way more valuable things over the years. Plus I live in a country where getting access to opiates is very hard, and I've gone on like vacations with him and some other friends for extended periods of time and I've seen/heard no evidence whatsoever that he has a drug problem. Also we're just like really good friends who've shared a lot of personal topics with each other and stuff, I'm 99% sure I'm his closest friend, so for him to just brazenly steal this medicine (while essentially calling attention to it beforehand) is mind-boggling. To top it off while we were playing video games after he exited the bathroom he was trying to sell me on a vacation to another country with him this coming summer. And then he was texting me later that night about his various girl problems.

So yeah, basically I have no idea how to proceed. Basically my own moral code dictates I have to call him out because I don't let people walk over me or just blatantly disrespect me like that, but at the same time it sucks that he'll probably deny it and there's a chance out friendship will be over . . . but at the same time should I even want to be friends with this guy?? So to anyone reading this, what would you do? Never in my life have I been faced with a situation like this and I really don't know what to do.

We had a long conversation about it about a month ago where he said he's all in, but then a few days ago he brought up a bunch of concerns about how much work children are and how much I would expect of him. I go back and forth on if his concerns are a healthy adult way of preparing or if he really doesnt want this life but also doesnt want to break up. He's great in so many ways and I feel like the odds of me finding someone else (especially in the amount of time to actually be able to start a family at this point) seem so slim.

However, it turns out she has a crazy ex boyfriend, who keeps stalking her social media all the time. Suddenly he messaged me asking me where I knew her from. At the time of the message I didn't know who he was, so I asked her because it involved her. She told me he has been stalking her, trying to control her entire life (even to what she wears. I'm from a western european country, it's very uncommon to do this) and now he has been threatening me, to fight and stab me. There are voice memos of him, telling her that he will stab her future boyfriend(s), although I'm not, he is convinced that I am. He implied that he either wants to fight/stab me. 

My friend feels for the dude and doesn't realize that what he does is so wrong. I told her she should file for a restraining order but she doesn't want to because it'll involve her parents (she's 17).

352,"I'm a 26 years old female and I would like to get help or some advice on how to deal with my mom or even just someone telling my why things are going the way they do now. I will try to keep is as short as possible.

So ive been raised by my mom and when i was younger i always thought we had a good bond. We were not rich and but i got most things i wanted. I'm also an only child. 

I now live on my own and I have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for over a year now. My mom never met hem, nor doesn't seem to want to. I don't know how to deal with this. She is sort of mildly interested in him, but she never uses his name when asking something about him, just uses boyfriend. She also does this with friends, one of my friends I've known since I was 12, my mom knows her as well. My friend used to work at a fast food restaurant for a longtime, and when my mom asks me about her shes calls her burgergirl, because 'she forgot her name' even though my moms sister has the same name. To me it feels like she's mocking me or just isnt taking my relationships serious.

&amp;#x200B;

She also doesnt like when I have my own, different, opinion on whatever subject we're talking about. So mainly or conversations are just her talking about everything. And she seems fine with that. She also likes to fight through the phone with one of her sisters, where she just hangs up and proclaims my aunt is being a bitch. I used to always believe her and sort of live by her words. But ever since I started living on my own and reflecting on my past I start seeing all the 'red flags'. I also have an extremely low self esteem, I used to hate the skin I was in, I never went to therapy so I'm not sure if my youth is where this all started. But I'm doing way better now that I live on my own and live the way I want to.

But she still is my mother, and I would like soms advice on how to deal with this, or some insight in why my mum seems only mildly interested in me. Cause it hurts and I can't really talk about it to her, cause i have a feeling she is doing the best she can.

On my mom's side it was just her and one of her sisters so I never really knew most of my mom's side of the family, but there's a huge Filipino community that my mom was a big part of. 

Growing up my dad's family treated me like I was different because I was so much like my mom - they belittled those parts of me but celebrated any tiny resemblance I had with my dad. Whenever I went to filipino events with my mom, they would point out how ""dark"" I was and belittle any part of me that was exceptionally ""Caymanian"".

I am currently in highschool so during 9 period, Beth was with Sandy and a girl called, we'll call her Tammy. I got dared by Nate to whack her on the head. Mind the fact that i did but not hard at all. This usually would never be a problem as we do this all the time to each other as a joke, but she got super defensive and immediatly assumed the dare was from Jake. She yelled at me for doing a dare from Jake and when i said it wasnt from him and it was from Nate she got embarresed and turned around. After that she moved across the room. I went over to ask her if something was wrong as she never freaks out like that. She was now sitting in a chair and slumped down and the only part showing was her head. I tapped her on the head lightly two times and she was fine until she saw it was me. When she did she straight up bust in to tears and claimed i was bullying her. I said i wasnt and to stop saying that because i just wanted to see what was wrong and then i walked away. After i walked away my friends were saying that was bullshit and she had no right to say that as she has currently shoved me in a locker and locked it earlier that day and i told no teacher because she was my one of my best friends.

373,"I'm a software developer, I'm 30. I came from a coding boot camp. After completing the boot camp I started working at the company I'm currently at. I've been there for about a year and a half. I like pretty much everyone I work with.However, I am miserable working on what I work on. Just about every other person I work with works on newer technology (i.e. Angular, Micro services, API development, Springboot). I work on an IBM product called filenet. I understand a lot of people may not understand what these are but picture using a dial up modem to get to the internet with a computer running on windows 95 while everyone else has a 2015 macbook pro or better. I work on something that was considered modern 20 years ago and they work on something that's modern now. The system is garbage because the people who worked on it before me were contractors and they weren't really invested in keeping it stable for the future b/c they were trying to just get it done. Working on it makes me miserable. I constantly come in to work miserable. That is saying a lot b/c I've worked at a lot of bad jobs. I worked as a cook at a nursing home before this. I was constantly groped by old women. Outside of that I've worked at McDonald's, at a butcher shop, UPS loading trucks at 3 AM, a bar back, etc. The nursing home used to be what I thought was my worst job, but for the last 6 months I think where I'm at is giving it competition. 

&amp;#x200B;

I approached my boss in October and told him I was unhappy with what I was working on. I asked him if there was a way I could transition off of what I was on and told him I'd be happy to train someone else to work on filenet. He said ""who do you suggest I move off so you can be on there?"" Which kind of felt like a big f\*\*\* you. I've also asked if there was a way to let me work on some other stuff as well and he told me he thought I had too much on my plate to do any other work. Which is mostly true. My bosses think the technology is outdated and know how poorly managed it is but are reticent to make any changes. Everyone I work with gets paid similarly, but it feels like they all get to do interesting things. Everyone else had a senior developer over them when they first were hired. I had to learn pretty much all of what I do myself along side another person who was there for about 4 months and also came out of a boot camp. The longer I work on what I'm doing the more my skills will regress. My bosses are too afraid to make changes and it adding to my misery. No one wants to change anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Last night, I told a coworker/friend how I feel and he told me he was afraid that if I go somewhere else it won't be as nice (in reference to work environment and people I work with). That's probably true because I am pretty much friends with everyone I work with and we hang out outside of work almost every week. The development environment is pretty low on stress. But he also said I didn't have enough exposure to good code standards and practices ( which translates to ""you don't have a good enough skill set""). And this is where my problem comes in. I feel like I need to leave because I'm not going to improve where I'm at. If I stay here I'll continue to be behind. I work on a lot of things outside of work. I'm going to take a certification test for an 'AWS developer - associate' in the next 2 weeks. I work on personal projects outside of work. I've been helping my 2 younger cousins learn how to code (9\[m\] &amp; 11\[f\]) using Lego robotics. I have built a website for a friend. I've learned how to use other languages. But in the end I've never had actual code reviews, I don't actually use very many modern coding design practices, and I don't use modern technologies at work and so now I'm afraid he's right.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I know if it's a good idea to leave? Since now I'm somewhat afraid that I really am behind compared to others who've been in software development for a year+. Is this a catch 22 where I'm screwed regardless if I stay or leave? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr - I like my coworkers but not what I work on. Specifically I don't like working on outdated technology especially when all my similar coworkers work on modern technology.

376,"Hi all, posted this in /r/Music already but I think that was the wrong place and it'll probably just die under the amount that gets posted there. I'm a bit of a reddit noob so please excuse. Hopefully someone here can help!

Bit of back story -

   So my girlfriend started learning guitar last September or so and seems to be picking it up pretty quick, she also has an amazing singing voice already which her guitar teacher has picked up on. His family own a studio and so he has offered to let her use the studio and his skills on the guitar to record a few demos, for free.

   She's not the best at practicing and will sometimes go between lessons without picking up the guitar, which is a shame but sometimes life just gets in the way. A few lessons ago he had a little pop at her saying that he's putting effort in to learn the songs for her demos and its annoying she isn't doing the same, which is fair enough (even though she doesn't need to practice the singing - she really is good). However he also said that he is taking a 'financial hit' for the demos so it would be nice if she could make more of an effort...no money was mentioned before this so we assumed (as its his mothers studio) he wasn't having to pay. I've no idea how much its costing him but I find any amount of money just makes things weird.

   The last lesson she had they concentrated more on the singing and him learning tabs rather than her learning guitar, so he didn't charge her for the lesson as he wasn't actually teaching her. I understand they probably need to practice for the demos and what not but i just find it odd he's doing so much for free. In my experience people don't do something for nothing, especially when it involves money. I'm fairly protective of her and don't want her to get walked over, if he catches her like a rabbit in the headlights telling her how incredible she is and that she can make it big she'll be blind to anything he's doing in the background. I don't doubt that she could make it if she tries and I think she should definitely go for it as the opportunity has arisen and I will support her whatever she chooses to do but i just cant help but be a little suspicious.

&amp;#x200B;

So i guess my question is - is this something music teachers might do if they see something in a student? Is he just a really nice guy and genuinely just wants her to make it? Or has he got some kind of ulterior motive that she might not be seeing?

&amp;#x200B;

I've asked to go along to the studio with her for the day and she's going to ask him if thats ok (i don't really see why it wouldn't) - mainly because I want to see her in that setting, hear her sing *properly* and take a few pictures. Obviously also because I want to meet this guy and see what he's like in person. So we'll see what he says to that I guess. Maybe I'm just overthinking and should trust that someone could be that nice...but past experiences tell me otherwise unfortunately. 

  

I cant get it off my mind but don't want to bring it up too much with her because she seems to trust him and think its all ok, i don't want her to get annoyed at me and start to think I'm not supporting her.

377,"I am currently working at the best paying job I've ever had. No it's not crazy amounts of money, and it isn't my dream job. It is tolerable and can be really tiring. Anyways my boss has put great effort into training me to be a groomer, currently mainly washing dogs and also during their nails and a bit of grooming now. I had no plans to leave this job until my boyfriend was kicked out. I did always want to move out of my moms place. Though I don't completely have the means to YET, I do have the option to go with my boyfriend back to his original home. He wasn't able to find a job and it didn't work out. Despite having done everything he could to look for one and on top of that do ALL of the housework and chores, he was still kicked out. My boyfriend moved in with me because my mom had invited him to live with us seeing how he was very caring of me and that especially stood out when he would travel a couple hours from another city (where he originally lived) to see me and sleep at the hospital for days just to make sure I was okay. That really touched her so that's a huge reason why he was invited.  
If it wasn't for him, I don't think I would be able to keep this job. He keeps me sane and happy.   
Now on the other hand, my mom is something else.   
It is very hard to be close to her. She is always judging and has always judged me for things I've told her and over time, I just stopped telling her things. She is very religious and it has always been very hard to keep faking that I am as well. Recently things got heated, and one thing that was said by my mom is she wished she was closer to me. My boyfriend encouraged me to tell her that I wasn't religious as a first step to being close again with her mom. That didn't turn out too well and things were tense for like 3 weeks before back to normal. I know she still loves me but I think she think it's my boyfriends fault even though I have only spoke about it twice to him (he is a non believer as well and she knows).   
She always complains about smells in my room even though there's literally no smell. Even when it's cleaned and a incense is lit, still complains.  
She buys stuff without my knowledge and has me pay for it as if I asked for it in the first place.  
She treats my brother very differently as well. For example, if a spoon is left in the kitchen sink by me, I will be incinerated, but if my brother does so, she just puts it up herself with no words said.  
Another example is if food was made by my mom, usually my boyfriend cleans everything on his own voluntarily, but if it was like xmas dinner or thanksgiving where she wants everyone to pitch in, my brother isn't included and no words are said to him etc etc.  
Yes my brother works pays bills but it's annoys me when my mom says EVERYONE has to do something but she really only means me, her and my boyfriend. I pay bills as well, not as much as my brother, but if I made more I'd pay more. Mom says it isn't about the money though.  
Anyways I just can't live with my mom and brother and I have the option to go with my boyfriend. I appreciate everything my mom has done for me but I just can't deal with the things she does. It drives me up the wall and I don't want to come home to that. I handle dogs double and maybe triple my size and a lot of times they obviously get scared  or maybe don't want to be bothered etc basically tiring. I am able to do it, and I also have walk home in the Floridian heat. I come home tired and want to relax, not have anxiety waiting for my mom to come home and to complain and get mad at something random. Not to be treated differently from brother. I already have anxiety and depression and NOW a disorder where I can't eat properly. Considering I can't even eat properly AND being anemic, I don't have that much energy.  I was only able to deal with this again because of my boyfriend. Now that he is kicked out, I just don't want to deal with this again and just want to go with him. My mom already knows that I might be going, the harder part is quitting on a boss that has put me a lot of effort into training me to groom... I don't know how to go about this. My boss and I are really cool with each other and with coworkers. He somewhat knows what is going on at home and he does know because I thought at one point I was going to get kicked. Anyways I don't know how to go about it. I don't want to make it seem like I am ONLY going to quit because my boyfriend was kicked out. Like I said earlier, if I could, I would've have moved out and also kept the job. But I don't have the means to yet. That doesn't matter now because boyfriend was kicked out.",02Mar2019,1
378,"Here’s some context as to why. I’m a 14M and I have some classes with this one kid I’ll call O. He’s popular and has a lot of friends, I do not. It actually confuses me why he goes out of his way to put me through hell when I barely even speak to him but he does. I think I’m a pretty resilient guy due to all the shit I’ve gotten in the past from people like O in the past but he has legitimately gotten under my skin. I’ll try to give a few examples.

It’s usually simple things but they manage to push me to breaking point. I’m pretty tall for my age (tallest in my year) so it’s awkward for me to sit under the small desks comfortably so I usually end up with my legs in a really awkward position. In German class where O sits in front of me he likes to kick me in the shin and even wind me up about it when I try to ignore it. We aren’t talking light taps I mean he puts his full force into every kick and just one leaves me with a bruise. One day in German he pissed me off so much I snapped. I’m not a violent guy, sports coaches have told me I have the perfect build for the rugby team but I’m just not that into rough/violent sport, but I was so pissed at that moment I grabbed him by the arm and yanked him over the desk and practically yelled in his face “If you want me to move my leg you can just ask!” The entire class went silent and I even heard one girl say to her friend next to her she thought I was gonna kill him. I was so rattled after that I had to excuse myself from class as I was physically shaking with anger. I went to the bathrooms and beat the shit out of a hand dryer to the point where it was dented and my hand was bleeding.

In geography class it’s a lot more bearable but still gets me riled up.  It’s mostly power move stuff to show me he’s in control like emptying my pencil case and making me pick it up. I understand maybe written down it doesn’t seem as bad but I suppose you have to live it to fully understand how frustrating it is.


He only does these during the classes and not anywhere outside of them almost as if making me suffer is just something to pass the time. This is why I think getting moved a few seats away from him would be the only thing needed to stop it. Some of you may be wondering why I won’t just report him for bullying. My school is pretty shit when it comes to dealing with stuff like that so everyone stopped trying to tell teachers that they were being bullied once they realised how bad the process was. Standard procedure is usually to confront the accused bully about whether or not they did the bullying. With no evidence the bully cannot be given a detention and gets away scott-free. If the student insists the bullying is still happening but still can’t prove it they can ask to be moved to another set of classes. No one does this because all classes are learning at different paces so you usually miss out on a lot of work and you lose all your friends from your previous classes.

I want to know if there’s a way I can request different seating without having to do the standard anti-bullying procedure because if that happens then O will find out I snitched and it’ll get 10x worse.

I once told a friend of mine my manager dislikes talking about anything too personal. After getting the poor grade, I did casually said to my friend how my manager casually mentioned hot guys she came across (I am female btw). My friend reacted by saying ""wow, you didn't tell me that! Now that changes everything"". I said I thought it wasn't ""professional"" to talk about hot guys at work and said my manager seemed uninterested in other topics such as the newest TV shows. My friend said it's because she is not interested in those topics and she called me ""autistic"" for missing the social cue to talk about hot guys. I said I thought it was ""unprofessional"" to talk about hot guys at work especially given how my manager was in her 40s and married with three kids and she said I was ""dumb"" as it was the manager who brought up the topic so obviously it would be ok to discuss this topic.

How can I avoid future ""issues"" like this at work? Also, is it really ok to talk about hot guys at work? The thing is I have this thing for older men and I really don't want acquaintances or people at work to know lol. The vast majority of my celebrity crushes are twice my age.",02Mar2019,3
384,"First off sorry for my formatting and there might  be Some autocorrect since im on mobile and english is my second language

Anyway

So a few years ago when i was around 16 years old i moved schools and in my Class there was this girl, cute looking very sweet to die for type of girl. I got to know her over the last 2 years of school and i fell in love with her. I told her what i felt for her but unfortunatly it was only one way. Im the type of Guy that just thinks: oh well Some girl Will cross my Path Some day. I was a little sad but we stayed friends to this day. 

Fast forward About 3 years (yesterday) she called me and asked if wanted to come and go out to a club, i didnt have anything to do that night so i said fuck yeah beer! Anyway i took the bus to a city near me and she Joined me at a later busstop. We just chatted as usual and decided to sit on a bench in a little park so we could have Some drinks before meeting Some friends and going to the club so we could get a little drunk without spending my entire college fund. 
So we sat down and had Some drinks, we got pretty intoxicated and just talked and laughed at everything we saw. Then she sat down right next to me, this is a bit unusual because she has this thing where she hates Anyone who comes near her, not that she hates people, she even does this with her parents. She just hates physical contact.

Anyway i didnt think much of it and we went to the club. It was an awesome night out the dj’s were great the beer was good and even the other visitors of the club were nice. About an hour in the club and i go out for a cig, she follows me, she doesnt smoke but i She probably wanted Some air. But she came and gave me a hug like a tired toddler, it was fucking adorable, anyway i went back in and went to get Some more beers and she kept comming to me and Hugging me and holding my hand. I know.. i sound like a child but i loved it, we went back to the group and danced for the rest of the night, Every now and then i went out again and she did follow me most of the times. After the club closed we took a taxi home. She kept laying her head on my shoulder and holding my hand, now keep in mind she normally hates physical contact. While  in the cab she also kept looking me straight in the eyes, it was like her looking into the deepest parts of my soul. I didn’t want to try to kiss her or anything to avoid awkwardness but holy shit my heart was beating fast. 
Anyway, for the last two years I have been stuffing my love for her away but this night made me realize that I cannot get her out of my head, I feel like this girl is the actual girl of my dreams. I’ve cuddled with girls I’ve kissed and even had sex with girls but just holding hands, hugging and the stares into my soul felt more special that any of those relations put together. 
But, I’m scared to tell her because I cannot tell if it was just because she was drunk or if she is actually interested in me.

I honestly don’t know what to do. Should I tell her again what I feel and hope for the best or should i just let this go and put it in my memory as one of the best nights ever.  

If you have any advice please let me know, thank you for reading this post.

I come from a family of doctors and lawyers. I've always felt the pressure to succeed. We are also minorities, so there was also pressure to never act out or ""be a stereotype"". My parents were very strict. Couldn't stay out late, parents chose most of my friends, and forbade me from hanging out with the ones they didn't like (like my dear gay friend, Octvavius. Still miss you, dude). Wad discouraged from dating boys. Was hit when I showed the slightest interest in girls. 

 Didn't really know what I wanted to be growing up, but I was interested in being a psychologist or a vet. Dad said I wasn't good enough at math to be a vet, and psychologists don't make any money. Decided to be a teacher at my parents request. Went to college, made friends, but lost them all due to social awkwardness/being a dick in general. Graduated, didn't feel like walking the stage, so I stayed home to avoid both the people I knew would be there and expectation to enjoy the day in general with my family. 

Went to grad school. Wanted to study abroad, but I was told there were no programs for me except a student teaching position in Costa Rica, which my parents forbade me from participating.

Dropped out of grad school (3 classes short) and decided to teach. 

I absolutely hate it. The kids are rough, yes. But the staff and general structure of our education system is abhorrent. 

I got married to someone I knew for 6 years. He was the sweetest person i ever met, but I was hoping happiness/love would kick in someday. Started doing drugs. Cheated on him. We are now divorced.

Today, I live with my now boyfriend. I teach in a state down south. I hate it here. My bf and I fight daily. We sleep on mattresses. I have no work friends due to my room being on the opposite end of the campus than everyone else. Plus, lots and lots of social awkwardness.

I'm not going to go into the full story because that's just too much to read, but I'll give a quick summary: my mom had a friend who decided she had to have me as a family member, so she started emotionally manipulating me for three years (age 7-10), putting her own idea of what love was in my mind and convincing me that that's what I felt towards her son, and once she'd gotten that idea in my head she started convincing me that I needed to marry her son.  The manipulation got really bad when I was 9 and 10 cause a tragedy happened in my family and I was depressed and easy to mess with.  Worst part is I started to believe it and I probably would've been completely under her control if she'd been around for another six months.  I don't even want to know what she did to her son to get him to act the way he did towards me. 

It's stupid but that whole situation made me incredibly distrusting, and anxious.  It also caused quite a bit of depression.

I don't know why I am posting this, probably looking for an excuse to do it anyways. My grandma has always been very traditional and I know she is genuinely trying to do what she thinks is they best for me. Mom is different idk, maybe I am adopted haha.

401,"For a little background, I have been solving rubiks cubes for the last 4 and a half years, for about 3 of which I’ve been doing it competitively. Every summer, here in the U.S., there is Nationals, the largest competition in the whole country. For my speed at a certain kind of puzzle, I have an opportunity to win a national title. 

However, this year, the 4 day competition lies right over my dad’s birthday. I really want to go to the competition, where I can show how all my practice and hard work over the last year has paid off, but at the same time I want to stay here for my dad’s birthday, as I feel family ties are more important than anything else to me.  

What do you think I should do? Should I stay here to celebrate my dad’s birthday with the rest of my family, or should I leave him a present, a heartfelt card, give him a call on the day while I’m at the competition? ",02Mar2019,1

405,"My friend, who we’ll call Bunny, got diagnosed with terminal cancer in march of last year. I don’t want to go too deep into specifics of what’s happening with her but I feel like I don’t know how to talk to her anymore because I can’t find a middle ground. I don’t want to act like this doesn’t exist, and I don’t want to act incredibly sorry for her making it harder for her to let go. 

On one hand I can see how pretending it’s a non issue will make it harder by making her see the way her life used to be before she was sick. Bunny doesn’t want to die and she’s not ready, so I can see how this will make it harder for her to let go. 

On the other hand, I can’t help feeling a little bit sorry for her. What she’s going through is very hard for a 16 year old girl, and I want to be there and show some empathy for her, but I’m afraid of making her feel guilty for being sick because she’s “upsetting her friends”. 

I’m trying to plan a day to go out with her some time over the summer, the doctors gave her a year and a half, but I don’t know how to go about this planned day without making it seem painfully obvious that she isn’t going to make it.

409,"Hey ya’ll, so i’m gonna lay out some context, might be a long post, TLDR at bottom!

I’ve never been extremely overweight, at my heaviest I was 220lbs, but I lost 50lbs going into my freshman year of college, putting me at 170lbs. I felt really good, I could wear what I wanted, it seemed like I had several men interested in me- it felt good after feeling so miserable (and unattractive) for so long. 
Fast forward 4 years (present day). I’m freshly single after a 2 year long relationship. Turning 21 last year was the worst thing to happen to me as I have gained a tremendous amount of weight back from drinking and also seem to have lost my self-control when it’s come to food and not exercising. I’m back to around 200lbs (I haven’t weighed myself out of fear). 
I feel extremely unattractive again and my cute clothes don’t look so cute anymore. I know that i’m in my head and I probably don’t look as bad as I think, but it’s hard to see things from outside my own body. 

A few days ago (Thursday), I was sitting in my favorite coffee shop working on some homework, when I laid eyes on one, extremely, attractive man. I don’t know what it was, but I was drawn in. Crazy kind of story; I ended up asking a stranger if she would drop my number at his table because I sure as hell wasn’t gonna do it (mind you, i’m fresh out of a relationship, this is my first swing back at any kind of flirting and i was intimidated). The stranger, to my surprise, agreed. I wrote a note with my number and she went up to him and gave him my number *making it extremely clear that it wasn’t her number and that she was in a relationship*

This guy ended up texting me after I had left the coffee shop, so much to his disappointment I couldn’t introduce myself. I thought i’d ruined my chances with this one because of my 
timidness, but the next day (yesterday) we made plans for a date this coming week (Monday). I’m a mix of excitement and nerves. I’m worried that he’ll see how heavy I am and instantly be disinterested or make a slew of rude comments, though i’d like to believe he’s better than that. 

Any advice on how to be confident? Date outfits to look flattering?

TLDR: Freshly out of a long term relationship, gained 50lbs over the course of 6 months (~200lbs total), indirectly gave my number to a guy, scheduled a date for this coming week, feeling a wave of low-confidence with being heavier than i’d like to be. advice on what to do? feel? wear? what?",02Mar2019,1
410,"I need to preface this by saying I'm incredibly fortunate to have a good relationship with my family. They're a decent bunch of people and I'm really lucky to have them in my life. We've been through some crap times together and I think as a family unit we're pretty solid.

I (33F) currently live with my mother, my sister and my 6yo nephew in the house I (and my siblings) grew up in. My parents have been separated for almost 10 years and my parents' marriage broke down primarily due to his adultery and his substance abuse. He moved away and though my relationship with him now is better than it was, we don't speak all that often. 

As my parents are currently in the process of finally getting divorced, this house is one of the assets that they currently share. The mortgage for it is due to be repaid in full next year 2020. My mum is nearing retirement  age (within the next 7 years) and my sister (a single parent) is in a job that pays her just enough to survive but not enough to be able to afford a place of her own. 

The only way that I could see to keep a roof over my mum, sister and nephew's head is taking out a mortgage togther. We're currently in the process of doing this (my dad wants equity out of the house too so we're also having to make agreements with him about how that will be paid and how much). We have a mortgage secured but there are legal bits and pieces happening with my parents' divorce first including a consent order etc.

I really do love them all to pieces, but I'm starting to wonder if I've forfeited my own independent life and things that I want to do to make sure that they still have somewhere safe to live. Neither my mum or my sister are in a financial position to rent (or buy) in this area, even if they moved together, and both of their jobs are relatively local to the house so moving out of the area would be a real upheaval. My mum is also at an age where she would probably struggle to get a new job, and my sister works for a company who are really flexible with homeworking so that she doesn't have to also try and find money to pay for childcare for my nephew. I have a reasonably well-paid job and am sensible with my money, so I have savings to enable paying fees and anything else that we need to pay whilst going through this process. In short, I'm probably their only option that doesn't put them in a bad spot.

I just feel so suffocated at the moment by the weight of these decisions and this responsibility that I've taken on as the breadwinner of the house. I'm worried that it's taken over my life and affects things from my mental health to being able to form romantic relationships. I'd love to have my own place and find a meaningful relationship, hopefully have kids in the not too distant future. And yet I just can't imagine that happening in my current situation. I've felt myself backslide into a mental space that is ruled in part by anxiety and it's so frustrating because I'd worked so hard to get myself out of it. My average week for the last 4 or 5 months has been work, evenings of coming home, eating dinner and watching random trash on Youtube, and then weekends of doing pitifully little because I'm mentally exhausted.

I guess I'm really interested in finding out what advice anybody has to suggest regarding regaining some semblence of control over my life (and feeling like I truly do own it rather than it already being a done deal) without leaving my family in a difficult position? Thanks so much in advance for any tips!

411,"Hello everyone! I’m just going through something right now and I need your advice. I was dating this girl for a month, we’re both 28 years old (both turning 29 in a few weeks), everything was going great, and then something embarrassing happened during sex. Almost 2 weeks ago, she wanted me to cum on her face at the end, so I obliged and I was trying to get the condom off but it was so tight I couldn’t get it off and it snapped back and some lube from the condom went onto her face. We both laughed, she said it was hilarious, and she still wanted to have sex a second time later that night. She even stated herself that she wanted to go on a trip with me, I didn’t even bring it up, just trying to point out that the rest of the night was fine. The rest of the week she was rather distant/different, no flirting like she usually does, and she sent me a message a week ago saying that she’d like to make things casual if I’m up for it, but if not then she’d like to be friends. I said I’d be okay with making things casual but asked her if something happened in particular that changed her mind. She replied saying that she’s afraid things are moving too fast and she wants to get to know me better before jumping into a relationship. I said that I couldn’t agree with her more and that we’ll talk in person about it, she said okay. A day later she sends me a message asking if I’m okay and apologizing for what she said and that she was being a jerk. After she said that, she invited me over to her place. I went to her place and she told me that her mom’s boyfriend left her and she was crying on the phone with her mom for 30mins before I got there. Also a couple of other bad things happened during the week and she’s been feeling down. I just wanted to comfort her. We did kiss but that’s it, sex wasn’t on my mind. I sleep over at her place and leave the next morning and then a few hours later she sends me a text saying she confirmed her concerns last night that we’re not sexually compatible and that because of the incident (condom thing) that happened a week ago, she lost that type of attraction to me. I tried calling her a couple of times to talk about it, but she blocked my number and blocked me on instagram. I’m extremely hurt and I haven’t been able to get over it for almost a week now, we were so compatible in every other way, and I keep thinking that if I didn’t screw that up then none of this would have ever happened. What do you guys think about this situation? Should I try contacting her or just move on? I can’t stop thinking about her. I know we’ve only dated a month but I’ve never felt such compatibility with someone. She is much kinkier than me but I expressed interest in exploring and she’s told me that she’s “going to make me kinkier”. I’ve been trying to figure out how I screwed this up so badly. I keep going back to that moment in my head with the condom mishap because she was noticeably distant the rest of the week after it happened. She was fine the rest of the night after it happened, but the next day was when things changed. Here’s the last text she sent me:

“I’m so sorry for having to be this blunt, but last night confirmed my concerns. I don’t think we’re sexually compatible and after the incident that happened during out last sexual encounter I’ve lost that type of attraction to you. I know it’s really harsh to put it in those words but I don’t know how else to say it. I wish it wasn’t the truth because you’d be an amazing partner but I can’t fake those feelings. Thank you for everything. I’m sorry I’m a coward and am doing this by text. I really hope you find someone who makes you happy.”

It seems genuine, but a big part of me doesn’t want to believe it because of how compatible we were in every other way. It just seems like such a small problem that could easily be resolved by talking it out, I’m just so confused.

I don’t know if this is relevant, and just to give you an idea of what kind of person she is, I should mention that she’s only been in 4 relationships. All of which the men have cheated on her. The first relationship she had was 7 years and it was emotionally and physically abusive according to her. When I took her out for Valentine’s Day, she said I’m the first person in her life to take her out on this day.
On our first date, we made out, she got drunk, and she was feeling me up hard. Saying things like ""I want to ride your cock so badly right now"". I eventually found out that she's incredibly kinky, she has toys, costumes, has been in a threesome, obviously way more sexual experience than me, but I was okay with that. We spoke about it and she said she's okay with me being inexperienced, and I told her that I'm down to try anything.

Her birthday is on March 22, mines on March 23, I was thinking it would be a good time to try and reconnect. The only place she hasn't blocked me is Facebook because I never had her on there to begin with, I was thinking of messaging her there in a few weeks.",02Mar2019,3

413,"I am only three months pregnant, but I am terrified my stress will make me lose my child. I can barely get any help from the father, who keeps me up all night with his gaming and then chastises me when I am crying, begging him to let me sleep. He calls me names, forces me to wait hours for my nausea meds and has singlehandedly pushed me into PTSD panic attacks every single week for the past two months. 

The house we are in has seven animals, mostly dogs and some large cats, who regularly fight each other and jump on people, which is not safe for me as again, I am pregnant. The german shepard worries me, and I barely leave my room unless it is to quickly go pee or run out the door to leave for a bit. I get scared that she might jump on my belly and hurt the baby, but no one seems to think that is a credible worry.

Not to mention the in laws. One has even stood in my doorway and screamed at me while slamming my bedroom door and opening it to slam it again so hard the frame shook. The whole time, the father was sitting two feet to my left, playing his online game and not acknowledging his relative screeching at me that I am inconsiderate and lazy and all other horrible stuff.

I am trying to make plans to leave my state entirely and go across the country with my bestie from middle school, but I am so uncertain of anything and terrified. Am I making the right choice by leaving? I haven't even scratched the surface of everything that has happened to me here, this all is just from the last 1-2 months and off the top of my head. I am scared for my own safety and freaked out about this being where my child is to be born in six months, but is that enough of a reason to leave?

I've missed assignments this quarter. Up until this point I've only had one grade below an 'A'. I feel so stressed about performing well, but with the make up work, I feel like I just can't keep up. I feel socially isolated, and generally unhealthy. I hate my job, and have been looking for another one for a little while, but I feel like my degree is the only thing that will get me there.

423,"I have worked at a conservative private university for over two years. Thursday I attended a meeting with representatives from private schools all over the state, 32 people were present. The meeting was to share best practices within our departments and to learn more about how each school is run. The gentleman I was sitting next to was middle aged and we took part in many group discussions throughout the 4 hour meeting. During a casual lunch conversation, he mentioned his college was an all male college. I was intrigued as I was not aware those types of colleges were still in operation and I had genuine curiosity about how it operated. Because we were in a professional academic setting I asked the following questions:

1.	Is it private or public?

2.	Is there a religious affiliation?

3.	Do you receive state funding?

4.	Have women ever been accepted? 

5.	Do women work there? 

6.	If a woman applied could she be accepted?

I was genuinely interested in what he had to say. He invited me to visit his school and I jokingly sheepishly said oh I don’t know, I’m kinda scared. But when he insisted I said please do, I’d love that. 

&amp;#x200B;

The next day my supervisor and the president’s assistant came into my office. The gentleman from the meeting told his dean, who then told their college’s President, who then called my university’s President’s Office. 

A list of quotes were read to me that I had supposedly said at the meeting during this conversation, they were:

“The Board of Education should revoke your funding” 

“You would not drop the topic all afternoon and kept bringing it up” 

There were other false statement made but I was so shocked and surprised I find them hard to recall. When I tried to explain the actual conversation I was told those questions should have been kept to myself and looked up on Wikipedia, because of the sensitivity of the news these days not reflecting men in the best light. Also, I was told he has been in this profession for 30 years why would he make these things up. I did NOT say those things as I was genuinely curious about his college and we were at a meeting specifically to trade best practices and learn more about how each university operates. I gave them the contact information of another woman who was a part of the conversation and they said they would contact her and ask her if I said those things. I know I did not, but I’m still nervous that the damage has been done and I will be fired anyways. They shut down my computer access. 

I just finished my master’s degree THIS week at my university, grades have been posted and I am officially finished! The benefit is a loan agreement where you get the tuition loaned to you and you work at the company for 2 years after graduation to “pay back” your tuition. I do not have an official transcript or my diploma yet. I am afraid, they will try to withhold it as part of my firing. I feel betrayal, shame, and confusion. I did not say those rude things, and I am at a loss. The private university I work at has a reputation for misogyny as the VP had an affair with an employee who was later fired under strange circumstances. I am not upset at losing my job as it was not the right fit for me. I am upset that my professional reputation is going to be slandered for something I DID NOT SAY/DO! I feel as if I may have struck a cord with this man and he felt threatened and lashed out trying to silence me. I feel this wouldn’t have happened if I were a male, as I am an easy target as a new young professional curious female. BTW I am not a raging feminist (not that there’s anything wrong with that) So those statements would be out of character for me. I need advice, I do not know how to go to work Monday, waiting to be fired with no computer access. How do I explain this to my team or family without sounding like I’m the one trying to cover something up?

When I was 17, (I'm nearly 20 now) my boyfriend of a year broke up with me. I was devastated for months, I took it really badly, even though he did it nicely, but it was my first real heartbreak and it hurt like hell. A few months before the breakup, I attended this gala event with my youth group (it's from the church, but isn't very religious). One of the counselors, R, is 6 years older than me and I have known him since I was 9, when I attended summer camp and he was a counselor there. We've always been rather close, but because of the age difference it was more like a brother/sister relationship than a friendship. I did hear some vague stories about him trying to get the older female camp attendees to massage or kiss him and stuff, but at the time i heard the stories I was very young and didn't really understand them and later forgot about them. At said gala event, R got very drunk and when I said goodbye to him, he kissed me on the mouth, but I thought he just wanted to kiss my cheek (he sometimes did that) and missed, so I didn't worry about it too much. A few weeks later my bf broke up with me and I was super sad. I saw my friends from youth group a day later and told them, it was obvious that I was extremely sad about it and R tried to ""console"" me by giving me a lot of alcohol. (legal drinking age for beer and wine is 16 in Germany) I didn't want to drink though and so I declined.
Like 2 weeks later, a friend from youth group turned 18 and had a big party in this secluded cabin in the woods (sounds creepier than it was). I was still sad about the breakup, but that time, I drank alcohol. R was there and naturally made me drink even more than I intended. But I was still making the choices. At some point, he asked me if I wanted to go outside because he wanted to smoke, but didn't want to go out alone, so I said yes (remember that I still thought of him as like a big brother or something) we went to this parking lot behind the cabin and just talked. When he finished smoking, he came over to me and kissed me, which really shocked me, so at first I was kind of just standing there, but then I took a step back and put my arms out to keep him away, but he kind of pushed me into this pile of leaves and got on top of me, kissing me, groping my chest and eventually putting his hand down my pants. While that was happening, I still tried to push him away and I said ""no"" and ""stop several times, but he didn't and I was pretty drunk at that point, so I wasn't really coordinated. After a while, I somehow managed to get away from him (don't really remember how) a d got back to the cabin and tried to avoid him for the rest of the party. Tried avoiding him further because I kept getting flashbacks of that scene, but at another party that I didn't know he was going to. He pulled me into another room and tried to kiss me, and I left the party. Since then I left the group, kind of lost contact with them, because they were always together in the group with him, so I lost a bunch of friends.
I've never told anyone about it, but does that count as sexual harassment or something? ",02Mar2019,1

428,"Hey guys, so my (22 F) boyfriend (19 M) has recently started complaining of a sore throat. It started about a week or two ago, his throat was so bad one morning that he had to use a numbing spray. I kept thinking that, like most sore throats it would go away soon, but it just hasn't, in fact it's gotten so bad I'm kind of worried. When he eats he sometimes makes pained sounds and won't finish his food, and in the middle of the night I wake up because he's cursing and shouting about how bad his throat hurts. I've tried to look in the back of his throat for him to see if it was red but it looked pretty normal, he says it feels like theres a giant cut and when he swallows it hurts, and he is CONSTANTLY taking vitamin C or numbing spray or cough drops. I also have not had any symptoms which makes me wonder if it's contagious because we've made out and had sex (sorry if that's tmi) multiple times a day every day since he's been sick, and I've felt nothing. Anyway, I was just wondering what this could be. ",02Mar2019,1
429,"I'm posting this for a friend who doesn't have reddit and is at her wits end and has no clue what to do about this situation.

So my friend (L) has been living in an apartment with a girl (I'll call her Z) we both went to high school with since September 2018 (its a 12 mos lease). At first everything was fine. Only complaint was Z didn't pick up her dishes and hoarded them in her room.   
Then one day Z confronts L, saying she's lonely and she wants to get a cat. L says no. She has a few reasons. 

\- She's allergic to cats, and she doesn't think Z is responsible enough since she's never home and her room is a mess.

Z immediately starts threatening to break the lease unless she can get a cat. she is acting like a child at this point swearing up and down that she'll take care of them, she'll buy L allergy medicine or pay for her to get shots, keep the apartment super clean so L's allergies don't act up, and shell pay the pet deposit. L stands her ground and says no  


At some point Z convinced L to get one. But then the problems arise. Z comes home with 2 kittens. Not the agreed upon one cat. From the very beginning Z didn't take care of these cats. She purchased 1 litter box for these two cats. She didn't pay the pet deposit, and as time passes she doesn't clean up after them at all.

L starts to get very sick coming down with everything going around this season, she's basically immunocompromised from being exposed to allergens. I'm getting so sick of this that I tell Z I will clean their apartment if she pays me $20 to do it. She agrees.   


I walk into her bathroom with the liter box and its is absolutely disgusting, litter all over the floor, piles of shit that Z had covered with litter, shit in the bath tub, splattered on the wall, piss all over everything. When i start cleaning the liter box it was a lost cause, the litter was cemented into the bottom because she never scooped the box. Z has had these cats for three/four months at this point and they still have loose stools, she refuses to take them to the vet (by the time I'm writing this their stools have solidified a little more and they've been to the vet). Litter is cemented to the floor from piss, I start cleaning using baking soda, vinegar, enzyme pet cleaner, and disinfectant. Its absolutely disgusting and it reeks. It took me three hours to clean that bathroom. I also cleaned the couches, which were destroyed. so much cat piss was soaked into the leather they're beyond saving. I tell Z she needs a second litter box, puppy pads to put under the litter boxes, and she needs to keep the litter swept up. She says she will but never does. Every time I go to clean its basically the same fucking situation.

currently she owes me $60 for the cleaning and hasn't paid me.   


L is freaking out, she doesn't know what to do. She's worried if she reports to the landlord she will get in trouble for not saying anything sooner. She's worried about reporting her to animal control basically for the same reason. She can't get rid of the cats as they're legally considered Z's property and that would be theft. 

What should L do? I've run out of ideas. 

**TL;DR:** My friends roommate got two cats without her permission, didn't pay the pet deposit,  and they have effectively destroyed the apartment.

432,"I have a housemate of mine who will constantly do this long sigh. It happens everytime I see/hear him and, although I appreciate people get frustrated and such, it happens all the time.  I sleep near the kitchen and I can genuinely hear him sighing at night when I am in bed. He kinda walks in; stops, and then sighs.

It is driving me mad even though he really isn't doing anything bad. I've spoken to him before about any problems he may have and I have offered my company and such, but he doesn't want to speak about it and instead sighs.

He also has this weird tendency to speak to me whilst I am speaking to my other housemate. The other day me and my friend, call her GH were speaking in her room and he kinda just stood behind me and started talking to me whilst ignoring her. It was freaky and I stepped aside and pointed out that I cannot speak with two people at once. For a good hour, he just stood behind me and kept talking about god knows what.

434,"A couple years ago while my bf and I were still in the early dating stage, I had snooped around his text messages and found texts between him and his friend having a conversation about my best friend.... 

The text convo started by his friend sending him an IG pic I had just posted w me &amp; my best friend and asked “damn, who is her friend??” My bf replied, “bro her ass is so retarded I wanna hit so bad”
Then the next text was about what time they were going to the gym &amp; that was that.

I decide to bring it up to him after seeing it &amp; instead of getting upset/asking why I was even snooping, he immediately apologized for what he said &amp; explained it was just “the way guys talk” &amp; how he didn’t really mean it &amp; it is nothing he would ever try to act upon- it was “guy talk” that never went any further that those two messages. He promised all he could ever want is me and he would do nothing to jeopardize that.

That incident was almost 4 years ago but somehow I am still reminded by those words when I see my girl friend and even break down sometimes. Besides that incident, my bf is everything I’ve ever prayed for &amp; more. He motivates me, loves me unconditionally, a man of God, the most family-oriented person I’ve ever met, the best D I’ve ever had, etc. We’ve talked about marriage but I’m scared I can’t forget about that one text from 4 years ago. Am I being paranoid about his text??? Do I try to forget about it and move on??",02Mar2019,0
435," Moved out of my family house to move in with my friend down in South Carolina from Connecticut to start a new life, especially since i got this as an offering, because hes cool and the family was nice.

*Was*. I'm paying $50 extra for the rent down here, while minimum wage is lower here than back there. This let alone makes me want to move back as I need to get a car ASAP &amp; overall better financial situation. My good friend started to be toxic and unnecessarily rude lately, along with his family. they're talking trash behind my back, cut off my internet if i don't abide rules, make fun of me, call me fools, all while cherishing their son who is genuinely lazy and rude (to them and me). I can get a ride back to CT no problem, but i feel like it would be a punch to the face to my friend/his parents.

Granted, to be fair, they're essentially punching my face in every single day. I love them, but they just aren't living up to their promises/expectations and stuff. Should i just move back or stick with it here? I have crippling anxiety to bring up issues, and to tell them I'd be moving back would take a lot of will and max my anxiety out, so if you do agree, how should i approach this?

439,"Alright I'll give you guys some context about me maybe It'll give you guys some idea to help me out. So I'm a 19 year old black guy. I'm pretty chubby but not that bad. virgin going to a community college for a TV radio broadcasting major. Also I have a learning disability where I can't process things in my head as fast as others. Like it's pretty slow but I'll get it eventually. So the problem is...well everything. 

I don't know what to do. I've had this doubt about going to college yet here I am. But its getting worse by the day. Everything I used to love is not as fun as it used to be. I don't even know what makes me happy anymore. And my feelings well I don't know what to feel anymore. Everything I see and hear are different and I don't know which path I should go on like ok let's say I had the chance to be a jedi or a Sith now I don't like any conflict so I want to make everyone happy but theres no way. 

I know some people might say hey just go your own path, find your own purpose. And I say sure but where do I start ? I have no idea what interests me anymore. I'll say ""oh I like history"" but my heart and feelings say something completely different. And at this point in my life society expects you to already know what you want and I just don't know. Every decision I make feels like I'm lying to myself. Maybe I'm retarded like my sister always says I am or maybe I'm a ""late bloomer"" or I just need to hit the gym and get laid like my brother always says i need to do but fuck man I facing a wall and have no idea about how I can get over it.

440,"so i think i might be falling for this guy. we’ve known each other for over 2 years, but we were never really the close type of friends. we both share a lot of mutual friends, but we’ve never really called ourselves actual friends. we used to hangout with the same group all the time and he would like always never directly talk to me unless one of his other friends had talked to me. i was always super close with the group except for him.

what is weird though, is that whenever this whole drama thing started between the group that i had got dragged into, he defended me. one of my friends that was staying out of it told me that he would get mad at his friends if they would start talking bad things about me.  i never really wasn’t sure to believe him because the guy never was close to me. then i started remembering that there were times that his friends would play with me rough and they would accidentally give me a bruise, he would get upset and be like don’t play rough with her. or they would call me this nickname they knew i didn’t like that name but i wouldn’t get mad i would just be annoyed, he told his friends to stop calling me that. it was just like little things like that. 

it’s funny because most of our friends want us together. they knew that i had liked him in when we first became friends and he liked me too, and we were close to being boyfriend and girlfriend but i chickens out since i was going through my own personal issues that i didn’t want to put in other people. i did really like him but i think he got the idea that i didn’t like him. since he really didn’t talk to me that much but that was 2 years ago.

then recently in the past months we had became little bit more of friends. i facetime his friends a lot and when they used to spend the night at his house they would facetime me and his friends and i would talk. in our friend group it was normal to ask sex related questions to each other. so there would be times that he would ask personal questions and for some reason i felt okay with it. we did stuff together but nothing was actually physical. 

now he has a girlfriend and it sucks because i might actually love him. the sucky thing is that i think he might be in love with his girlfriend and he is kind of moving fast with her. they’ve been dating for for only 4 months. there’s times when he see at school with his girlfriend and i catch him looking at me from the corner of my eye, but i doubt that means anything. there’s times we will see each other a lot and then there’s other times he would completely avoid me. i don’t know if i’m overthinking all of these encounters. 

don’t worry i don’t plan on taking him away from his girlfriend but i need advice. if i should move on or wait until they breakup? if i should wait, then suggest what i should do?",02Mar2019,0

443,"Okay guys. So about two and a half months ago I moved to this suburban neighborhood with my mom. We have two cats, a brother and sister, and they live inside. 

Within the first week of moving my mom and I got approached by this little tortoiseshell cat who ran up to us from across the street. She is a petite little girl who likes to yell and is very friendly. We thought at first she was someone’s cat because she was well fed and so loud, and typically cats who grow up wild don’t meow. That’s a characteristic *usually* only found in house cats, because they beg for their food. 

After talking to our neighbors we found out that she’s kind of the neighborhood cat. Everyone feeds her, which is why she wasn’t skinny like a typical stray. In the months since we moved here I’ve seen her on our neighbors porch, napping on their furniture or eating from empty cool whip containers with cat food and scraps. My mom and I have taken to giving her food as well, with two little bowls on the porch specially for her. I think she sleeps under the bushes up against the neighbors house most of the time or in their garage, which they leave open for her to go inside. We also put a little makeshift shelter for her in our backyard, which is fenced in and she sometimes visits. 

I started calling her Minnie, because, well, she’s mini. Tiny. Petite. My mom took up the name too. 

About a month ago I started noticing she was getting...fat. I hoped it was just the fact that we were feeding her so much, but... Well. She’s over twice as “fat” as she was when we met her. 

After bringing it up to my mom several times we picked her up one time while she was on our porch and felt her tummy. She seemed tender, particularly when we felt her abdomen. So I’m 99% sure she’s pregnant. 

She’s even bigger than she was last week when I was home. I’m getting worried. 

One stray cat is something, but suddenly a bunch of kittens? In the middle of winter? Minnie knows how to stay out of the road, but these kittens won’t. And I can’t take them in my house, I’m only here for one or two days out of an entire month usually since I work and go to school during the week and then drive two hours to take care of my grandma who broke her leg back in November. My mom goes with me to help my grandma, but when it’s not the weekend she’s working two jobs, full time and part time. 

I don’t want to ask our neighbors, because I’m sure they don’t want to take care of a bunch of kittens. My cats *hate* other cats so I can’t have them inside. I don’t have any family that could take them. The local humane society told me I’d have to pay for Minnie and her kittens if I dropped her off there. 

There is only one place over an hour away I can think to take her, but the thing is that I don’t want to displace Minnie. I know how hard it is to get adult cats adopted. Her kittens might be adopted quickly, but what about her? I know that, at this shelter in particular, they have cats who have been there for literally *years*. (It’s a no kill shelter.) The cat I adopted from there (who lives in my apartment on campus) had been there for over a year and he arrived when he was basically still a kitten. 

What I was wanting to do is take her to this shelter where she can have her kittens, then get her fixed and bring her back to our neighborhood. Her kittens stay in the shelter and get adopted, and she goes back home to where she’s got a life of freedom and all the food she wants. She really is *the* neighborhood cat and she does well, even though she’s technically a stray. There isn’t a spay and release program near here either. 

But I don’t know that this is even possible. I don’t even have the money to get her fixed, let alone shots. I don’t know what to do. I want to help her. I don’t think I could stand coming home one weekend and finding a dead kitten around our house or in the road. Could I even take the kittens from her? Would it hurt her motherly instincts somehow? I don’t know. I’m asking for advice. 

I’m thinking about starting a go fund me for her but I don’t know if it would even get attention. I’ll try and update this post with pictures of her here in a bit, I went outside to get some pics of her just now but she didn’t come up. I’ll even put my username in there with her somehow as verification. 

Please any advice would be welcomed. ",02Mar2019,2

I live far from this job and have to commute about 1 hour both ways, waking up super early cause I go in at 6am to beat the traffic. The pay is decent but lately I’ve been having issues with a coworker and this week it escalated to a confrontation. I have talked to management about this person before this confrontation but nothing was really done so I don’t feel supported. I haven’t talked to HR but I’m not sure what can be done about the situation since this person has worked there for so long and apparently everyone seems to like them. Management doesn’t provide any training so most of the time I’m figuring out stuff for myself. Plus, we’re moving offices sometime in May which would be FARTHER from my house and more driving and traffic I have to deal with. All of this have really made me  hate this job. 

I’m addition, I’ve dealt with a lot of personal issues these past couple years and this stress from work is bringing a lot of those emotions to the surface and I’m not sure how to deal with it without letting it affect me. My friends at work tell me to ignore my coworker (even though they sit right in front of me) but the stress from the job on top of everything else is getting to me.

Last night was undoubtedly the worst night of my life. We had been partying with some friends last night and my husband took it too far and tried to fight someone at the party. I have never seen him so drunk. (although he does have a drinking problem) when we had got home, I messaged one of his friends off my husbands phone to let him know we made it home safe. My husband had been passed out and after sending the texts off my husbands phone I noticed some girl names in his recent text messages. The texts looked very shady, and I decided to look at his Snapchat, after he had got a notification from a female snap name. His Snapchat has 30+ girls and he has sexted all of them. Receiving/sending pictures, calling them beautiful etc. one in particular stuck out as he said “I want you to suck my dick again” this had me heartbroken. I confronted him and he said it happened before we were married, but that doesn’t make me feel any better. He broke down when I said I would divorce him and we have an appointment with a councilor tomorrow, but what should I do. I am absolutely broken and have never felt such sadness ever in my life.

I went on a trip recently, got really drunk, and just lost my fucking mind. I was crying so hard and was just despondent. Thank god my friends had the sense to take my phone from me so that I didn't call or text her Marvin's Room style. They were really supportive about it and didn't judge me, but I can't help but feel like such a pussy. That was an all-time low point in my life, I can't believe I actually did that.

I know that I probably shouldn't be ashamed of what happened and that it's healthy to just let out held in emotions, but I just feel like so ashamed about it",02Mar2019,1
453,"I'll try to keep this short. 25 male, staying with mom and dad to help out, they need it for unrelated reasons and are getting older.

Recently got accepted into law school. An event, call it Event A, was held at the school for a little meet and greet and to give us info on the school, which I went to. There were two more events like this, let's go with Event B and Event C, but different title. 

On the day before Event B I emailed the person responsible for the events about the differences between the events. Almost verbatim, stated they were different, but she didn't think I would learn anything knew since I had been to Event A. So I didn't go to Event B.

Now, the sticky part. My mom and dad are pushing hard for me to go to Event C. They think more facetime will be good. I don't see a point, as last time there were only about 10 or so faculty, and we only got to speak to about 3 for a max of one hour. So there doesn't seem to be much to gain.

I have a tattoo, and my mom, who found this out days ago, is extremely against tattoos, as is my father. She is now saying that unless I go to event C, she will tell my dad about the tattoo.

This has deeply disturbed and upset me. I just feel that what is is doing is deeply wrong on a moral level. I know it is not a really big deal, and I can't really get in any trouble, I'm 25 and don't live here, just staying to help around, but it just feels so wrong. I would never treat her that way, yet she has no hesitation to do so to me. 

I am considering telling her, if she goes through with it, that I am not speaking to her until she apologizes. I have a concisely worded draft of what I am going to say before that ultimatum which explains my feelings if it does.

So I guess, in essence, my mom is lightly blackmailing me to do something I don't want to do, and I find this very wrong. Am I over reacting, or should I feel this upset?",02Mar2019,1
454,"Basically my aunt and her daughter live about an hour away and she wants to get a job in my town. It would be an overnight job so she wants her daughter to stay overnight with me while she works.

I don't think this is a good idea because I have my own life and family with kids of my own to take care of. I recently moved ""back home"" after 16 years of traveling the world. 

I don't mind helping out initially, but I feel that my aunt will try to take advantage of me. Right now she lives in a barn (it's like a barn with a small living area attached) and has an unreliable vehicle to drive the hour each way to the potential new job. I'm not going to go pick her up if her vehicle breaks down.

I also think, ultimately, that this is a bad idea for the child. My aunt's shift would be 10pm-6am so they'd have to be in the car to drive here by 8:45pm. Then the daughter would have to go right to sleep when she gets here and be up at 6am to drive an hour home/straight to school. 

I feel like this will just open the door for issues between me and my aunt because she'll keep pushing the envelope for me watching her child at other times as well. 

For example, we agreed a few weeks ahead of time to let the kids have a sleepover at my house, and that I'd go pick up her daughter if she'd come pick her up when it was time to go home. Once it came time to come get her, my aunt said she didn't have the gas money to come pick her up. That was mildly infuriating because I didn't feel like driving 2 hours round trip when I had already done it to pick her up for the sleepover.

Should I just tell her no about watching her child overnight? I don't mind helping initially, but my limit would be about 1 or 2 months.",02Mar2019,1

My parents are pretty Christian and can be a little bit of helicopter parents sometimes, but I still love em.

I’m stoked but i tried to tell my parents last time we tried something similar(fall break) and they totally flipped saying  I’m going to have sex before marriage and that I’m totally going to end up with a kid if I do this. Not good stuff, never felt more insulted before.


So now my gf bought tickets, and we were going keep it a secret but it turns out my gf’s parent told EVERYONE, some people that my parents know too.

470,"So backstory to this question. 

Mom and dad got in an argument over something that wasn’t a huge deal. My mom elbowed an entire bowl of chili off the stove top by mistake, and it was my dad’s personal recipe, and he spent all day trying to get everything right. 

He was rightfully upset, but had to lecture my mom as if she intentionally did it. In his tantrum, he tosses out mom’s chicken breasts. Everything was uncalled for overall, and he went downstairs to try and cool down. 

That’s when mom sort of went on the offensive, and she tells him that she isn’t going with him to Florida for vacation next week. My dad just responded with backing out on things she wanted to do. 

I got them to separate from each other for the night, I went upstairs to see how mom was doing. I was worried that she was going to start crying, but was relieved to see that she was trying to make an effort to keep herself from laughing at my dad’s tantrum. 

So as of today:

My dad is still upset about this, and because of this awkward encounter last night, everyone lost out on their appetite. That meant, of course, everyone woke up this morning hungry. My dad went to the diner not to far from our house. Mom decided to just have an extra bowl of cereal, and I just had a few protein bars. 

My dad decided to extend the invite to Florida to me. I’m not sure I really want to go after that whole situation that took place. What’s worse is I only gave him an undecided response. 

Part of me does want to go, but part of me doesn’t. The reasons against mainly point to trying to get my dad to learn his lesson, plus if I go, that means I’d have to hangout with people outside of my age group unless I could find a way to break off from them. 

The other reason against is that we are going to be in land from the beaches, so unless I could come up with the money for a rental car (which I can’t) then that means I’m stuck with the older people.

476,"[This is my first time posting on this subreddit, if there's any problem you can tell me.]

Ok so let's put a bit of context and let's hide this post because I know he's on reddit.
We've been together for more than 2 years and we both love each other very much, been going on vacation together, met family and everything. 
I really have the feeling™ that he's the one, I don't want anyone else, and I feel ready to push it further. 
I know he feels ready too, as we talked about it at some point, big talk and all, and we both agreed to ""I'd like to be married some day, with you"". 
But now. 
I want to ask him, but I'm really panicking and overthinking about it. I don't want to make a big deal of it but at the same time, I do.
I could ask him while watching a movie casually blurring ""hey wanna marry me"" but hell no that's not worth him, he's worth so much more. 
Yeah I could ask my family but we're real chit-chaters and I fucking know there's some cousin or uncle that's gonna talk about it to everyone, and I don't want him to be ""yeah I know, your brother told me to 'be prepared to something'"".

So here I am, asking complete strangers about proposal, like, something cute you've seen on the internet, thought ""hey that could be a cute proposal"", blurt it out, something not too social as we both are not very good around too much people. I don't have that much money, I'm already saving for the rings, but I don't think the kind of proposal at a restaurant is his style. He's more of a dork, pun-guy, so I'm thinking about some day doing something we both like, probably going to a museum or aquarium, dropping a fact® about some big ugly fish and saying my shit about how much I love him and boom, knee-drop, marry me pls. 

As for the rings, we're both men and I can't seem to find ""manly"" rings, I don't know how to say this urgh, but yeah.

Should I get really good rings now and use the same for the day we get married? 
Or should I get nice rings, for the time, and then get really good rings for the mariage? 

I'm thinking silver for now or titanium, I think it's really looking good with sapphires, I don't know man, I'm fucking lost and in love.

I'm resuming my questions here :

Should I get really nice rings now, using them for mariage, or get nice rings for the proposal, buying real nice for the mariage ?
Is proposing at an aquarium/museum a good idea?
Any idea about ""manly"" rings? Websites, form, material, stones, anything (the kind all round with a big stone in the middle isn't really our thing).

I'm sorry for the big text and I thank you for taking the time to read it. I'm a fucking mess and I don't know shit about proposals. ",02Mar2019,1
477,"I’ve been teaching for the  past 16 years. I moved schools last year and have become a Head of Department. The school is nice on the whole, but with some challenging kids. Quite entitled and rude at times. I have two small children myself and am married to a fire fighter so our financial situation isn’t brilliant and we have a lot plates spinning to keep childcare, work and our home running smoothly. I’ve been recently feeling incredibly low, which I have put down to tiredness (my just 3 yo has disrupted sleep quite a lot) and the fact I’ve started to get quite bad migraines. The doctor has prescribed an antidepressant which I’ve only just started taking.

On Friday (yesterday) I had one of the worst days of my teaching career. I had had a bad night sleep as my daughter was up a lot in the night ( I ended up sleeping in her toddler bed). I taught a full day of lessons which ended on my Year 10 (14-15yo) double lesson. There is always some kind of crap going on in the lesson, some undercurrent of throwing paper or passing notes or comments made, but I never quite catch the culprit (they ALL deny any wrongdoing immediately). There are 6 challenging students and then 8 lovely, sweet hard working ones. I can never get through the content in the lesson, the student continually interrupt me. And I feel like I’m never doing a good job. Yesterday there were sweets being thrown about and a lot of sniggering going on so I send one of the main culprits out and I completely lost it. I was so angry, no faking it as you should, I was completely beyond it. I apologised to all the lovely students and said how lucky the class were to have me and that I shouldn’t be treated as I was. I think went out and completely lost my shit at the girl I had sent outside. I went back into the room, I couldn’t bear to look up at the class and told them I wasn’t teaching them. I ended up asking them to leave the lesson early. They all went out silent and, I thought, shocked. My line manager was at the end of the corridor in his lesson and they told him I had kicked them out. They then came past when the bell went and one was saying I was crying (I wasn’t at this point) and they all found it highly amusing.

My line manager came down, clearly disappointed in me. He wants to talk ‘strategies’ because clearly I’m not handling them as he would. I then did cry and by chance, literally every man and his dog on the teaching staff came into my room for various reasons so loads of people witnessed my downfall. This included the lovely new teacher who I trained in my department, who seemed visibly shocked.

I feel mortified. I embarrassed myself in front of all my colleagues and in front of the kids. I feel even more blue than before. I don’t want to go back to work now.

Little background about me: I'm a 16 yo dude turning 17 in 4 months, jr in high school with 100% west african parents

So going in depth with the title, my parents are really starting to get more suffocating by the minute. As someone my age I definitely need some outside interaction other than school. With that you'd think my parents would give me ANY sort of freedom but no. It's to the point where any day that I'm not going to school, I'm trapped inside my house mostly in my room by myself. This makes weekends and summer so fuckin shitty and I have to stay inside for WEEKS at a time. Every time I ask to go anywhere (even as minor as the gas station that's literally a block away) It's the same answer. They immediately think of the WORST thing that can happen and use that to justify why I can't go. This effects me in so many ways: I can't make meaningful friendships because when they ask to hang out I'm constantly saying no and they think I don't want to chill with em, I can't have a girlfriend either because it would ""ruin my career"" and so I would have to wait until I g r a d u a t e c o l l e g e, and that in turn means prom would be a little lackluster so no point in showing up to that, I can't go play sports and shit outside with the homies(0 childhood memories lol), no eating out unless it's with family, no inviting friends over to my house either ""cause they can kill you anywhere,"" you get the point I can't do anything.

I'm always big on understanding the other side of the argument and I do. My parents have lost their son and my brother 2 years ago in Africa due to him making not the best decisions (drug, alcohol abuse) and so this can definitely explain why they're like that but the thing is they've always been like this. It's to the point where my two siblings that I grew up with (moved out now) have been brainwashed to think the same way. My parents, especially my mom, are insanely impressionable, meaning that as soon as they see something bad once, they think it's 100% what's going to happen and they always watch the news. News is always gonna talk about bad shit cause who gives a fuck about the kid who got home safe and sound? A normal person would probably goto a close friend or someone outside of family to ask for help or advice, but how the fuck would I do that? I have online friends but they don't really understand the magnitude of the situation. I don't want to tell any counselors at school cause at the end of the day I love my parents and I don't want to risk them getting in serious trouble. But man I'm getting more and more miserable everyday. Summer's coming up too so this is kind of when the realization starts to kick in. Honestly my mental health is in a really terrible position right now. But like I said, I have african parents and they don't really see sadness or poor mental health as an issue as long as I'm going to school it doesn't matter. My mom tells me all the time about how she needs me to goto school get a high paying job so I can send her money when she goes back to live in Africa when I turn 18. Kinda makes me feel used

I have a 5yo boy, and the other day he told me that he would have preferred to be a girl so he could wear dresses like the Princesses of the TV. I don't have any problem with that. But my husband is a very religious man, so I don't know how's he's gonna take it, that's the main motive for this account being a throwaway (he uses Reddit too and knows my username)

Well, first of all I know that this doesn't mean my son is gay, but I have been suspecting it for so long. Since he was three, he liked unicorns, he liked to play with make up, he prefered pink colors, he often talks girly, he plays with stuffed animals and says they're their babies, and a lot of more things, But I think that's because he passes time more with me and his aunt that with his father (he's always working). I have always kept this hidden from my husband (he obviously noticed some things, like the unicorns and pink colors) and he told him that he should not play with that, because those things are for girls.

I don't know if I should make assumptions because I think is very early to say that my son is gay, I don't have any problem without that. U would love to support him in whatever he decides. But also I don't want to say anything to my son about supporting him if he prefers girly things and make him confused. Because u think that he doesn't tags the things as being girly or manly, until the other day with the dress thing  I thought that he just liked them and thats it.

One was for the summer (we're in highschool), and he said he loved summer because he got to hang out with his best friend basically every day and he was worried about me being upset if he hung out with his bff everyday (I literally would not have cared, I would be happy because he's happy hanging out with his friends, and I told him that) so I'm pretty sure he got over that. Another one was that we called too much, and I told him that if we got back back together (I'm sure at this point it's obvious I want to get back with him) he would be able to decide how much we would call, if we do at all. The biggest reason, which is the one keeping him from wanting to get back together, is that everytime he wasn't with me he felt this stone in his chest and his feelings for me would kind of go away. He said as soon as I started talking to him or would send a cute picture the stone would go away, but he said he never wanted to feel that stone again and is terrified that if we got back together it would come back.  Is there anything that we could do if we got back together to help keep that away? I think the cause of that is cause we hung out almost every single day. We have 5 out of 9 classes together which is already almost everyday of the week, and then I would go over his house almost everyday after school and Saturdays would be our ""alone"" days and we would spend the whole day together. I think that if we stopped hanging out so much and stopped talking/calling as much we would be more comfortable being apart, and maybe then that stone would go away. I wanted advice first though so I don't push him or say something and it not work. He has made it clear though that he still loves me and misses everything we did, and the only thing really keeping him from coming back is that stone in his chest, and he said it might prevent him from ever coming back. I don't know what to do and I really need help figuring it out. What could we do(or not do) to make the stone go away?",02Mar2019,2

I told him if he did that i would be extremely uncomfortable and i wouldn’t be too happy if he did that, but to tell me if he did. He assured me that he would never if it made me uncomfortable.

I saw on venmo that he paid this friend and the message said “you’re still in it are you?” with a syringe and a pill emoji.

I feel really dramatic right now but would it be creepy of me if i brought it up to him?? i don’t wanna seem possessive but i’m genuinely worried about the effects it would have on him and his friend.

Memories of you flow through my mind
That night under the starlit sky
Sitting in your car singing swing life away

Sunset and Memoires (04/19/18)

Watching the sunset 
Sitting on that bench near the oak tree
Overlooking the ocean
Just the two of us
Alone in time
Trying to find words to describe how much you mean to me and how beautiful you are
I wish this summer could last forever 
I will always remember this warm summer night
The warm summer wind blowing in your hair
Everything felt perfect
The orange and red sky reflecting in the ocean quickly fade to black
Stars beginning to appear 
Johnny hobo playing softly in the background
Singing our hearts out to Whiskey is my Kind of Lullaby under the starlit sky
The sun and moon-kissed each other goodnight
As the sun sets and the moonlight reflecting in your hazel eyes
For a brief moment, time stood still 
I could feel my heart beating a thousand beats 
You left me breathless
I got lost in your hazel brown eyes
Can you feel my beating heart when we embrace?
A momentary sense of euphoria fills me
I get a high from your presence 
I can feel the butterflies in my stomach 
I felt nauseous 
I feel a lightness in my chest
You look  beautiful under the starlit sky
I swore I saw the whole universe reflecting in your eyes
I would stop  time 
so I can stay in this moment forever 
A star shoots across the sky 
You looked at me and smiled and asked: ""What do you wish for?"" 
I looked deeply into her eyes and faked smiled but that smile turned into a frown a single tear ran down my eyes 
I took a deep breath and let out a deep sigh
""I wish that you would love me""

Sitting in your car 


Swing life away playing softly in the background

Remember that night we sang johnny hobo under the starlit sky
Starting deeply into her dark brown eyes
the heavens reflecting in her eyes
The sun and moon kiss each other goodnight
Staring at her
I got lost in her eyes
I felt at peace
the whole world disappeared 
 it was just us alone in time 
I swore I saw the universe reflecting in her hazel brown eyes
That Night goes through my mind every time I close my eyes  
Wishing you were mine

494,"A little background:
I graduate this May and then I’m moving in July about 1,500 miles away to a new state. I used to live with my ex and when we had an apartment together we bought all our house essentials together. However, when we broke up, I moved out in a hurry and to avoid any more conflict, I left him with all the silverware, pots and pans, dishes, Tupperware, etc. items. Then I moved in with my aunt and uncle who obviously already had all those things and I didn’t need to buy anything more. 

Now I’ve been making a list on Amazon of things I will need once I move and I’m wondering if it would be weird to share that list with any guests I plan to invite to my grad party? I thought of phrasing it somehow like “you certainly don’t have to buy anything, but if you want... here’s a list?” I’ve also made a “classroom” list, since I will be graduating with a teaching degree and I’ve thought about sharing that too, since classrooms tools/furniture/manipulatives are expensive at first. 

I also wanted to mention that I don’t ever see myself throwing a big wedding. Even when I was with my ex, I always envisioned something small and now that I’m moving, I don’t foresee most of my friends even attending a wedding in the future.  So I don’t see myself taking advantage of a wedding registry in the future.

496,"It's not slang, i literally mean taking a showering.

Please help! I literally take 4 showers a day. In the morning, during lunch (I use my workplace's shower), when I get home from work, and before bed. I don't sweat or get dirty easily, my job is sedentary, and I don't do strenuous activities. On the weekends I can take up to 14 showers.

I think this all started when I was a teenager during summers. My parents were poor so we didn't ever go anywhere and I was a big introvert so I just stayed home all day. A ton of masturbation and boredness lead to requiring multiple showers. I think I just really loved the refreshingness a shower provided, the warmth and smoothness of the water, and soothing whitenoise of water burbling down the drain!

This addiction is severely impacting my life mentally and financially. I have to hold gym memberships to all the area's gyms just in case I'm away from home and the urge to shower is overpowering. The utility bill is enormous. I don even use soap, shampoo or conditioner. I just wash my body off with water and then get into my clothes witout even drying myself off (that's another weird thing I kinda like). But realistically the main thing is that since I spend so much time showering or thinking about showering I'm missing out on my life where I could be meeting people, learning a skill or enriching myself. I don't have any friends just coworkers. And they're not even really my friends. And I would really like to have some people that genuinely cared about me and we had fun times together. It's just a huge time sink. And it's making me waste my life.

I'm even writing this post from my shower on my phone, I've been standing here so long the water is getting cold.

So anyone else out there like me? Anyone got over it? Anyone in general with some advice? I'm so desperate,..

I'm 20 years old (male)

I have this one friend (female) in my circle who I really care about. I know she has feelings for me as we tried to get together before, but I didn't feel the same way and so we stopped. After that I always had this feeling of wanting something to happen. This was 2 weeks ago and we left off as just being friends.

Yesterday, my friends including her made a plan to go to a club. One thing led to another and we were drunk, dancing and kissing all over each other. I was really turned on in the club as was she and we decided to take this home. My apartment is near so we walk home good California weather. We start making out and cuddling and my little one just won't get hard. We both had quite a few shots but we were completely aware of what was going on and I still couldn't get hard.

She tried her best, even a bj and that didn't work which just made me feel even worse that I can't get hard.

I just don't know what it was. Was it the alchohol suppressing me, my mind thinking this is a bad idea as we are good friends. Idk.

I feel like Joey with Rachel but worse becuase I couldn't perform when we were knee deep.

I got them suicidal thoughts, I am constantly critical of myself, I hate my own reflection, I practice mild self harm of just hitting walls with my head or hands, I find myself getting flustered with small decisions and becoming incredibly assholish just because I can’t stop being lazy. I cry a lot I hide it pretty well. I’m incredibly afraid of the future and change as I’m about to leave high school without finding help with any of these problems. I’m scared I’ll kill myself first week of college as I almost did when I orientated for dual enrollment classes last year. I am even more terrified of living a terrible life as some kind of drone with no fun or anything and being a statistic and dying of something curable but not having enough money. I hate everything about myself, I’m not skilled in anything and not good at anything either.

I have been with my current company for a couple of years, I gave my notice to my previous employer and the employer before that because I was sick of the anxiety the political bullshit was giving me, I know it’s more my ability to deal with the world of business than it is the companies I work for.

504,"Hey everyone, let me start off by saying I have been dyeing my hair for about the last 4/5 years. My natural colour is a dirty blonde but I’ve dyed it: brown, black, burgundy, basically white with a pastel pink that then washed out to be a level 10 blonde. I had always gotten it professionally done, except for the last time I dyed it 2 weeks ago. 

My hair was level 10 blonde when I decided to try out blue (I’ve always wanted to go blue). Instead of going to a salon I decided to dye it myself at home using the ‘Arctic Fox- Aquamarine’ semi-permanent dye. HUUUGE mistake. I mean the first day I was pretty happy with it but now I’m really regretting it. It’s now faded into a greenish colour with my roots still being dark blue (probably because it was the healthiest section of my hair). To top it off my hair is super dry and damaged- it looks horrific. It’s super patchy and the green is just gross looking. I don’t know what to do now. I want the colour to be gone and go back to blonde but that’s probably unrealistic. 

At this point my family is telling me to chop my hair super short and start fresh, but as a girl I love my long hair (not bashing any girls with short hair I just don’t think I could pull it off well). I want to just throw brown or something over it to get rid of the green but I feel like my hair will just fall out because of all the damage I’ve done to it if I do that.

If anyone could possibly give me advice I’d really appreciate it. I don’t even want to leave my house, I hate the way I look and it’s seriously killing my confidence and overall mood. I know you’re probably just thinking I’m being dramatic, maybe I am but my hair is really important to me...

(Side note, she never recived a degree. While she is hard working and responsible now, I feel like collage was an extended party, with a huge bill that was in perpetual deferment until she moved in with me.)

We have a nice house, a nice vehicle and several credit cards on my credit alone. She says her loans aren't my problem and I wasn't the one paying for them.  We share a bank account....

I've been having this issue for a while...so I (20f) broke up with my boyfriend of two and a half years in November. I'm fine and over him. But the problem is that I then developed a crush on my best friend (20m). It was really bad (butterflies, etc.) because it was the first major crush I'd had in years, and ever in my adult life. So, I told him I liked him and he very politely said he'd rather just be friends. Then, we didn't see each other for a month because of winter break at our college. However, when we got back I didn't want to make him feel uncomfortable or like he had to watch what he said around me so I told him to just act like he always does. But it's hard being best friends with a guy who rejected you. I feel like I'm in this weird limbo where I don't really want to date him but I also can't bring myself to date anyone else in hopes that he'll ask me out.

After a year in that program I made a choice to leave and come back home as I wasn't interested in the subjects, and I didn't want to waste the next 4 years doing something I hated. When I came back home 2 years ago my friend offered me a job at his family construction company,  they do restoration in concrete and are a multi million dollar company, very successful. They will be around for a long time and a lot more jobs are coming along. I started off at $18/hr doing general labor stuff. Then he taught he how to drive machines, chip efficiently and much more. Over the past 1.5 years I got a raise to $26/hr as I'm considered a Lead Hand, for some weeks I was running the job sites as our foreman was fired. I love what I do, different work everyday, being on the job site,  using my hands and head to figure things out. His parents who are the owners love me and want to teach me more, the PM's, foreman all like me as well.

My parents are pressuring me to go back to school for absolutely anything, just so I can get an ""education"". I don't want to because I'm happy where I am, making decent money at 21, and knowing that I can climb the ladder through work experience. They think I'm just a ""general laborer"" and that's all I'll ever be. So I need some advice on whether to go back to school, even though I don't want to, or continue working with the company.

Hi!

So I finally man up for once in my life and asked my crush out for a coffee! She said yes :))))

I have 3 questions. 
1) instead of grabbing a coffee in a week, she asks for in two weeks. She said she has 2 midterms coming up and is not ready for them. My dumbass friends then start filling my mind with stupid theories and thoughts... like this is totally understandable, right? I shouldn’t be freaking out at all
2) my friends also tell me to play cool and not to come off as too eager. By eager, I think it’s about how I expressed how happy I am for the coffee date to my crush. They want me to play it cool by acting less-caring. But this is not who I am though. I tend to act very nervous around her but at least it’s my true self. 
3) should I keep texting her until the coffee in two weeks? I see her twice a week in class but I don’t get to talk to her because she sits with her friends. Although, I do talk to her in recitation 


Thank you so much in advance :) have a good day!!!

He used to talk to me about how he felt and everything. We used to talk for hours in general about anything. Few months ago he stopped sharing how he felt and we didn't talk much in general. I am always worried about him and want to know how he is but don't know how to initiate the topic since he doesn't talk about it now. IDK if he wants to talk about it or not. Asking 'how are you' is of no help because the answer is usually 'fine'. I want to know if he is better or not. What to do? ",02Mar2019,1

524,"My girlfriend who is an Asian immigrant (being generic about specific nationality for a reason) just got a call from her step mom who still back in her home country along with everyone else in her family.

Apparently her sister who is in her late 20s recently told their parents about how when Google searching her name, nonconsensual amateur porn of her shows up along with personal details like name, age, street address, graduating class, etc. While its currently unclear whether or not the porn was filmed consensually ( I am pretty sure it was but its irrelevant), the distribution of the content is by no means consensual. The original video post was made over 7 years ago without her approval, and has increased in popularity ever since. The details of who posted, why, where etc are unclear. Whether or not the victim knows but isnt saying is also unclear at the moment, as she is displaying tremendous emotional trauma due to this issue and does not wish to speak about it. This has haunted her everywhere she goes since then, as a simple Google search of her name retrieves the content described. Now as if this werent complicated enough, the issue now becomes that US law and her countries laws are obviously different, and I dont know what they look like in Korea (if your still reading this I am assuming your interested and want to help if you can. Obviously in order to do that people most likely need to know where this issue is occurring, I could be wrong for posting that information but I really just want to fix this). 

She can't hold a good job bc people find out and either gossip and exile her socially, or flat out fire her. Apparantly she can't find a quality boyfriend who will stick around after learning about the issue either, so she has been forced to date men who also have social stigmas attached to them, and who she wouldn't be interested in normally (to put it nicely). From what my Korean GF tells me, her people's attitudes towards this type of thing really make this issue into something drastically more problematic than it would be if it happened here in the states. Its like a Scarlet Letter or something.

Apparently she has gone to the police who say that can't do anything bc of the fact that its spread to the Chinese dark web. She has threatened suicide twice. After internally dealing with this for 5 years without telling anyone other than the police, she confessed to her elderly parents who really dont know how to deal with it at all other than support her (its fortunate that her parents are understanding). My GF had no idea until she received the news from her mother over the phone this morning and her sister has no idea that she knows.

Having a career in tech and passion for infosec, fraud, and as someone who knows the ins and outs of the darkweb and utilizing the internet to solve problems, i really feel like if anyone is ever going to help this poor girl, its going to have to be me. I want to find a way to help this woman but I don't know how. If I can gather enough helpful info to give to my girlfriend, she can relay to this girl, and if this gets resolved with that info, or  by any other means, I will be satisfied. Until then, this is my mission...

Now I dont expect to track down every reposting, every webmaster, every single copy of this shit and get it removed. What I do expect however, is to fight tooth and nail to be able to get this under control to where it no longer comes up on google search result (or at least it becomes buried a few pages deep) when someone plugs her name into Google. As a bonus I would love to find the person who posted it originally and Doxx the shit out of him. I'd love to make the rest of his life a living nightmare, but honestly, thats secondary to this.

I've experienced a similar (not nearly as awful) issue when I was arrested as a teenager for felony theft, and news articles of my face and the story of the arrest follow me to this day. (I used to have a problem with heroin but have been clean and sober 5 years now). I am basically SOL when it comes to my stuff thats out there because its public information. This girl is innocent though, and should not have to be violated 24/7 for the rest of her life with every upvote, like, click, etc. It makes me sick.

I did some digging online and even in the US, ""revenge porn"" as it's called isn't technically illegal in every state (in my state its still legal), and victims of this crime often have zero recourse. A lot of the time even getting the content taken down isn't possible for fucks sake!

Sorry for the rant guys. I'm just heartbroken over this and I don't even know the girl. I really dont care about the legality of solving this, so maybe this isn't the best place to do so, I just want to figure it out by whatever means necessary.",02Mar2019,1

526,"Hi there! 

To make a long story short my girlfriend and I have been dating for the better part of two years. Recently I booked us both a trip to Cuba for May 9th to the 16th, and my plan is to propose to her while we are in Cuba. 

The problem comes in when my girlfriend went to work today to request the vacation time off. They advised her that all time off is seniority based and the earliest she will know is by May 1st, which is 8 days before we’re supposed to fly out.

While I understand her works side that it’s seniority based, I was wondering if it would be worth talking to them myself (and letting them know about the proposal) in order to get a definitive yes or no as to whether she’ll be able to have the time off.

Not only would it be a waste of money for the vacation, but it would throw a massive wrench in my plans to propose.

536,"I've always known I had issues with things like depression and anxiety, but after turning 25 recently it hit me how dysfunctional I am in general and I'm not sure what the best steps are to take to get help.

I grew up with an alcoholic narcissist mother (father wasn't there much) and she sent me away to one of those wilderness and boarding school programs discussed in r/troubledteens at age 16. After getting out at age 18 I didn't know how to adjust back to the real world and started smoking weed all day every day. I also started stripping as I had issues keeping other jobs and focusing in school due to my addictions. It's now been almost 7 years of stripping and I've spent the majority of my money on plastic surgery which was not a wise idea (I have severe body dysmorphia, not that its a valid excuse for my actions). Over time I've developed alcoholism myself and I have an average of 5-10 drinks almost every day, and more recently a bit of a coke addiction as well. 

I'm currently staying back with my mom as she recently had surgery and I've been helping her out, but now she is healed and wants me out of her house and I'm not sure what the best move is. She is aware of my situation but doesn't really seem too concerned about it (my father is mentally ill himself and though he is a loving dad, can barely help himself yet alone me). Do I go to rehab? Counseling? AA meetings? I can tell it's a matter of time before something extremely disastrous happens. I'm not trying to come off with a victim mentality as I realize I've done this to myself, I'm just genuinely unsure of what the next move is and don't feel like I have anyone to turn to and help me.

538,"Tennis season recently started and I am so excited because I love my team.... except for this one girl. From the beginning she rubbed me the wrong way. She didn’t try out for the first two days because of an “injury” but was magically fine for the next three days of tryouts after the coach told her she had to tryout to make the team. 

I am usually accepting of everyone and I am a very easy person to talk to. I already love two of my three new teammates but I just can’t get myself to like this one girl. In fact, I can’t stand her. I make an effort to try and talk to her but she’s just kind of awkward. And not in the shy awkward way (I can be like that sometimes so it’s understandable) but in just an uncomfortable awkward way. She doesn’t even seem to try to get people to like her. She’s constantly making excuses for herself and isn’t supportive of anyone but herself.

Today I decided to make a really good effort to get to know her and get myself to like her but while playing a doubles game she hit me with the ball three times. THREE TIMES. On the feed (the first easy ball the coach hits to you). This made me dislike her even more. I was new to tennis last year, so I know it can be hard. But it is not easy to like her or to talk to her so I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to be mean or to have someone on the team that I don’t like, but I’m not sure what my options are here.

And it shows a text version of whatever the person is saying so people can read along as well, so a feature I want to add because of that is an audio button next to each paragraph of text so people can play the audio from that paragraph without having to listen to the whole thing. Thing is its really tedious to go and put in all the different time stamps for when each paragraph ends and the next starts because I need to listen to the audio and wait for the paragraph to end and pause.

Everytime I texted him after that he always replied within 30 seconds to 5 minutes. He seemed like he really wanted to talk to me and was really engaged in the conversations. Even saying, ""You're not bothering me 😅"" when I apologized for texting so much. When we finally hung out( it was casual. No romantic implications were there. I didn't want to scare him off.), he kept trying to make me laugh and laughing at everything I said the whole time. We watched anime together and agreed on many things. He seemed comfortable and friendly. When he had to leave, he asked to walk down from my dorm with me. Before he left, he asked to hang out again saying ""we can do anything. Anything is fine."" and told me to text him anytime I wanted to because he is always available. 

Well I finally texted a day later and he didn't read my message. So I waited 24hrs, it wasn't a big deal. I texted him again and he didn't read my message. I started to worry.

544,"Long story short, my brother is being given a dog from our Parents’ neighbors (who are breeders, and they don’t care which of us gets the dog as long as he’s well cared for), and he asked me to care for the dog until things were favorable for him to take ownership. Initially, I said that it was fine, but that I fully expected him to cover all the costs and whatnot. I’ve been out of town for a bit, so I’ve had some time to think about it, and I’m worried that I’m going to end up me owning the dog. 

Now, I am not against this at all, I had a dog a while ago that I unfortunately had to re-home because he had a lot of behavioral issues. If I’m completely honestly, I hope he winds up in my permanent care without any fuss, but I agreed to watch him for my brother until he gets his own place.

What I’m looking for advice on is how to properly deal with a situation where any of the following things occur:
-I end up having to pay for all of the expenses
-I have the dog for longer than a couple months or so
-basically any situation where I wind of the clear owner


I don’t want to stir any shit if I put a lot of time, money, and effort into this guy and become attached and my brother expects the dog to be his free and clear. I will talk to him about the above things and for him to be aware that my time and energy will not be free after a prolonged period of time. This dog is only a few months old, so I feel the situation is different than if it was an older dog, as I’m basically going to be training and caring for him.

545,"Hello, I’m new so I apologize if I’m not doing this right, or if I ramble too much. I’m panicking. (I’m also not sure where I should post, but I figured here would be good.) 

I’m a 17 year old female who’s turning 18 in roughly a month. I was just let go from my job today, after only being there for not even a week. (I had made mistakes at the register and that’s why.) I also had a previous job (that I hated) for 3 months at a fast food place where I was let go for mysterious circumstances (I wasn’t told a firm reason, but I think they were probably losing business; this also leads to other dilemmas since my parents say not to put the latter on my resumé since I don’t know why I was let go— so it looks as though I’ve never had a job before).

To get an idea of my personality, I am very shy/awkward and have very little people skills as a result. I’m hesitant and unsure/lack confidence, and I have incredibly bad anxiety. I would say I’m somewhat sort of intelligent, but around people I get so awkward that I become stupid. Either way, I’m very nerdy, and passionate with animals and science (I figured this would be important for any suggestions). 


To get on point, I’m nearing graduation and I have this overwhelming feeling that I’m not good enough and I won’t be able to find a decent job, since I can’t seem to stay in minimum wage ones. I do plan to go to college, community first to save money, then transfer to university— but I’m not sure what I should major in. I’m interested in the science field, but I can’t shake the feeling I’m not intelligent enough to work in it. I was looking at the genetic engineer route since I adore genetics/heredity and such, but, there’s quite a few subjects I’d need to study for it (plus it’s an umbrella term so many things fall under it) and no guarantee I’d make it. And as I said before— there could be a lack of intelligence on my end. High school chemistry I made an A in, but college would be much different, I imagine.

In the end, I guess you could say I’m not sure what I’m going to do with myself. I really want to work with animals, but the veterinary career is extremely competitive. Zoologist/Marine biologist would be cool, but I can’t handle planes or boats and those are the sorts of careers you travel for. 
I was really looking forward to being an ethical breeder (be it reptiles, dogs/cats etc), but it’s most likely something I’ll have to do later in life when I have stability since the start ups and care of babies are expensive.

With that, I do local pet sitting (and just had business cards come in for it), but, that’s not something I could pay the bills on. 
I want to be able to afford a rural home in my dream state of NC (I currently live in VA) where I can also buy lots of animals. Not sure what kind of money I need to be making for such a dream, though, since existing itself can be costly. Everything is so incredibly uncertain. 

My mother says I should work with computers, and I hear you don’t have to be too sociable in order to be a software engineer... yet, I don’t know the first thing about programming or any thing of that sort when it comes to computers (hell, I don’t even know how to upgrade or build my own computer. I just use it and mess with files and programs when I need to)
She says people take classes to learn— but I’m intimidated since higher education implies in my head just that, a higher level. Like, if I were to take it, everybody would sort of know it already and I would fall behind. (Not to mention my uncertainty can make me a slow learner because I’m just not 100% sure that I’m doing something correctly. I constantly ask for reassurance)

So, I was hoping those of you who are older and have experience (or are currently going through the process) can give me advice on what I need to know or what I can do to actually be a somewhat functioning member of society. 
Obviously I can’t expect to have my hand held in life, but even that idea is making my heart beat faster (and independence in general). ",02Mar2019,0
546,"For some context, I am a nurse aide who works 6:45pm-7:15pm for three days a week (36 hours/week). While I like my work, I don't particularly like my schedule and the workload. It's pretty heavy because they downsize at nights and there are no evening shifts.

A few months ago, my boss proposed a new position for aides- a rounder shift that goes from 2pm-10pm Monday through Friday. That is definitely easier than what I have now as I would have no charting to do, I could help out where needed or float to other floors of the hospital, etc. The workload won't be as heavy and the hours are better for me.

ADVICE NEEDED: what can I do from here? I’m screwed having to pay the $1000 deductible to fix my car. My insurance is going to try to get here to reimbursement me. Should I just take her to small claims court? Will I win??

She lied will she have to change her story if I take her to court?

We divorced when my son was 2, and now He is 5. a year ago my ex husband got remarried, and I have nothing against her and have been very supportive of her being in my sons life. Recently my sons been asking about god and Jesus, mimicking prayers and telling me that he prays with his stepmom. I haven’t talked to my ex husband about it yet because I want to go about it right. I don’t want to start any arguments. How do I go about this?",02Mar2019,0
554,"This is kind of long but here it goes.

My best friend of 10 years, let’s call her Becky, is getting married in a couple of months and I am the maid of honor. I have never been in a wedding let alone been a MOH, so I didn’t realize what I was in for. I’m a young single mom who suffers from severe depression and anxiety, but I was super grateful to be chosen for the role. 

The main event is a destination wedding, meaning everyone attending is spending well over $1200 in expenses. Although it set me back quite a bit, it wasn’t too difficult a trip to organize; the resort is all-inclusive, there were payment plans available, and it’s a week-long vacation for everyone and I get to see my best friend get married. So I’m pretty excited for it. 

Here’s where things get complicated. A few months back, a fellow bridesmaid, we’ll call her Sally, reached out to me about planning the bachelorette party. Sally and I are not close, she’s a newer friend of Becky’s. But I know she is fun, very smart, has money, and typically just seems to have her shit together. Honestly, I find her pretty intimidating and maybe I’m a little jealous. But I was happy to have her help. She’s been in a dozen weddings and loves planning parties. For all I knew, a bachelorette party was just a group of gals going out, sipping out of penis straws, getting wasted and celebrating. Turns out there’s definitely more to it than that.

Sally suggested going to a different city and renting an AirB&amp;B for the party. This seemed expensive on top of the wedding, but I figured, easy enough, I can manage that. So we chose and booked a nice condo together that definitely wasn’t cheap, but I knew it’d be fun and worth it. We were keeping everything a secret from Becky the bride.

A couple of months go by and the party is coming up fast. Meanwhile, I’m struggling with regular life. My depression peaks and my days consist of panic attacks, crying fests, oversleeping/not sleeping at all, and trying to be a good mom. It’s freezing outside. I’ve isolated myself from family and friends and don’t leave the house unless I have to. I’ve fallen behind on bills and can barely pay rent. It’s definitely the worst time of the year for me and maybe the worst I’ve ever felt.

Sally contacts me asking me to come over to her apartment to discuss more party details. Almost everyone in the wedding, including Sally and Becky the bride, live in the city. I’m about 30 minutes away in a suburb and the thought of putting on a happy face and trying to get to know Sally right now fills me with anxiety and dread. But I am, she reminds me, the maid of honor, and these are my responsibilities. I suggest planning over the phone but she says there’s too much to discuss. I get it. 

So we plan a couple of get-togethers that end up falling through because of weather and issues on my end.  And when I say issues on my end, I mean my anxiety kept me from leaving my house. It all just overwhelmed me. So in the mean time, Sally and I texted about games we’d play at the party, food we’d bring, possible themes, etc. I figured it would all just come together in the end. Then one day Sally posts a message to the event page. 

Reading into the new details of the party, I start to panic about the costs involved. Sally added an additional night to the weekend, at a separate hotel. I know I can’t afford that. The games we’re going to play and the theme now requires us to buy new outfits and accessories. Sally also sends me a picture of all the decorations/ gifts she bought for Becky and asks if I can send her some money for the it all, which I also didn’t have at the moment. I felt
like shit and figured I just wouldn’t be able to go anymore. 

So I reached out to Becky the bride about my concerns and my emotional state. I can’t tell her any details of why I can’t afford stuff because it’s all supposed to be a surprise. And what I do say only upsets her.  It turns out she and Sally have grown, rightfully, frustrated with me for not being more involved in the planning of the party. She feels like I don’t care enough to put effort in and that Sally has done all of the work. I feel horrible and try to explain why I’ve been so shitty but she tells me she has enough wedding stress and she doesn’t need my issues negatively affecting her so, from now on, I need keep my complaints to myself. So I confided in
another friend in the bridal party, who ended up telling Becky everything I said in a really negative way and made her and Sally even more upset with me. I have no one to talk to about this. All of my friends are in the bridal party. I don’t want to make things worse. I feel horrible. And the other girls have distanced themselves from me further. 

Luckily I got my my tax return much earlier than I thought, so I immediately sent money to Sally, covering everything she bought for the party, plus extra just for the troubles. So at this point, everything is paid for. But I’m embarrassed and guilty. I know I should have just gone to Sally’s to talk in person and it was selfish of me to not to just do it. Right now I wish I could just disappear. Becky the bride says everything
is fine but it doesn’t feel fine. All of this has brought up feelings I’ve been burying and brought out things I don’t like in people I previously considered friends. I love Becky and want to be there for her I feel like after this wedding is all over I don’t even want to be friends with most of these people anymore. 

What do I do?

556,"So, I’m currently part of my college’s band on a scholarship. I help them do live sound. Now after having done it for two months, I’m having serious doubts about whether or not this is right for me.

I got in the band thinking I’d love it because I love music, but I feel like I’m starting to hate this experience.

Firstly, it’s really fucking loud. I love music, but I listen to it at a reasonable volume, and if I go to concerts, I wear earplugs. The band director must clearly be somewhat deaf, because he has the volume at very uncomfortable levels. I haven’t measured the dbs, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it was 100+ Not to mention that a good portion of the band is brass, so those shreaks and squeals make me wish I was dead.

Secondly, because it’s so loud, I can’t hear people talking. This is a nightmare for me. I can’t connect and make friends with the other people if I don’t know what they’re saying half the time. This is also really bad because I have to be receptive to other people’s instructions. And with my band, we have to be quick about solving problems and getting shit done in real time. I have already fucked up a handful of times, because I couldn’t understand what they were telling me to do.

Thirdly, I’m busy as hell. This program eats a lot of time out of my week. Now we’re getting so busy that we’re are doing performances out of town like 5 times a week (sometimes even on weekends when I want to be home studying/relaxing!). 

Fourthly, I haven’t had the “warmest” reaction from my peers there. Personally, I really struggle socially. I have social anxiety, but want to make friends and change it. Lemme tell you, it’s so hard watching all these people behave like such social butterflies, while I have to muster up the courage to talk, and when I do, it’s oft awkward and sometimes comes out as verbal spaghetti. 

One of my peers supervises me and the others on the crew, and he’s a fucking moody asshole towards me. One day he’s hot, and the other he’s cold. I work really hard, and I have made a few really fucking stressful mistakes, and I guess he has no patience for me anymore even though I’m a noob. A few times, he’s accused me of a mistake I didn’t make, so I’m kind of his scapegoat for things going wrong it feels like. You have no idea how this makes me feel. No one appreciates my effort. I did really well the other day, and he was still being an asshole.

Another one of the guys around me is a fucking douchebag. He tries to lord over me sometimes and gets me to do his work for him (I noticed this because he asked me to do something for him, and he went and sat down with some of the other band members) He has this air to him that he thinks he’s gods gift to earth. I can’t stand having to be around such a fucking tool all the time now. He also got drunk one night and was making fun of my outfit and I couldn’t defend myself because I’m such a pacifist. He seems to get a lot of female attention too, and this just makes me bitter. I’m trying to make myself available, but no girls seem to be into me. 

I also feel like such an alien compared to the rest of them. Most of them smoke/vape get drunk and have tattoos. I can’t relate to them on this, not judging, but I don’t feel cut from the same cloth. 

Fifthly, I don’t feel like I’m as talented. Everyone else seems to be on another level musically. I play guitar and thought I was good, but everyone else knows so much more than I do about this stuff, and it makes me feel like a fucking idiot sometimes.

I could keep writing and writing, but you get the idea. I’m really questioning whether this is a good fit for me. I feel stuck, because I can’t drop the scholarship, I need the money to pay for school. 

Next semester, I’m thinking about being a tutor, I’m really good at math, and I think that scholarship might suit me better.

574,"Just a little backstory here.

Myself and 2 friends have been living together for a few years now. The 2 friends used to work together but one of them recently got a new job a few months ago. We'll call him Tom. We'll call the other friend Jerry.

We all used to get along so well. We considered each other best friends and we could constantly hang out with each other. Ever since Tom got this new job, he's been acting differently. He's become a lot more uptight on the smallest of things and will randomly come home angry. Without telling us what's causing his anger, he just finds things around the house to get mad about and takes it out on us.

Fast forward to yesterday. It's that time of the month where our internet bill is due. Tom is in charge of internet, so he sends in a group chat that the total for everyone was $x. I had already paid a certain amount days before it was due because I thought that's what it would cost, but it ended up being a bit more expensive. No big deal, right? So instead of just asking for the extra money, he sends it back to me with a memo ""try again"". This money got put into my venmo wallet, at which I wasn't going to deposit it into my bank account just to send it back so I sent him that amount again plus the extra money to cover the bill. I told Jerry about this and he proceeded to pay his bill by sending an extra penny. Harmless joke.

Fast forward 12 hours to when he comes home at night. Jerry and I are sitting at our desks having a nice Friday night when Tom comes home and immediately starts going off on jerry and I about how us doing this fucks up his finances(this is the only bill he pays) and he even stooped to the point where he called me a dipshit for absolutely no reason. He then goes to his room after I ingore him.

About 30 minutes later or so Tom comes back downstairs and thanks me for picking him up something from Walgreens and proceeds to pay me all in pennies. He drops 154 pennies on my desk and just walks away.

At this point I've had enough. I'm not a very confrontational person, so it's sometimes hard for me to express how I feel in certain situations. But he really makes it hard to be his friend when he acts like this. I don't know if I want to continue to be his friend. It just seems like every time Jerry and I attempt to approach this issue with him it never seems to go anywhere. ",02Mar2019,1

The last five years of my life I have fought tooth and nail to improve my own life. I've gone from being homeless to living a middle class life style. During this time all of my friends have pretty much given up on life or have developed some condition holding them back. Some have poor health, some are going through a divorce, some are suffering financially, some just refuse to even try. Every where I turn every one is doing awful.

I'm always being hit up for large sums of money, I'm always asked about job opportunities, I'm always asked for help in their love lives. People I've never met before are asking me for help through my new marriage.  


I've tried helping, but nobody seems to really do anything with it. There is always a new excuse or another problem they cant tackle alone up ahead which has them coming back for more help.

580,"I am fourteen and a half. I have no siblings, no one my age to interact with or relate to me as I'm imprisoned in my house all day.

The main person I have an ""issue"" with is probably my grandmother. I can't do anything when I'm with her. I get slightly more freedom when I'm with my mother. She treats me like a child. I have the freedom of a six year old when I'm with her. Like, I'm not allowed to walk the dog around the block when she's home. There was a recent blood moon, I took literally three steps out of the garage to take a picture without her permission. And got scolded for I believe close to two hours.

 My most favourite thing to do is be outside. Walk around, ride my bike, be at the park. I love the outdoors. But I'm not allowed to be outdoors without supervision. All three of my parents/guardians are too old (and in incredibly out of shape) to do any of that stuff for longer than thirty minutes before their backs or hips and what not start hurting. And they don't even like the outdoors. Not that I want them with me to begin with. I want to be free to walk to school, or the store, the YMCA, ride my bike... Anything. Without supervision. Because I can handle myself. 

Clearly, they don't feel that way. But at the same time, they're too old to do anything with me. I wish they'd make up their god dang minds. Either let me be on my own, or do the things that I enjoy, because you can't keep me in this stupid house forever.

Staying in the house all day is driving me crazy, and making me depressed. I want to go out and do something. Believe it or not, I DON'T want to play video games 24/7 or browse Facebook like all you (my parents) ever seem to do.

I don't ask for much. I'm not a bad kid. They raised me to be incredibly mature, polite, etc. I don't get into trouble. I never have. I've never done anything to break their trust, besides the little white lies about say, something small like finishing homework that we've all lied about.

Idk anyone that does that, usually if someone says to me ""hey watch this movie"" I'm like sure and never actually do. so it means the world to me when she cares about the things I care about.

&amp;#x200B;

It just hurts so much though. I want to be mad or have negative feelings but I can't. I want to just not text her and ignore her when i see her and just not deal with this situation but that seems petty and weak like why can't i just deal with it. so I deal with it but it's just hurting me so much and it casts a shadow on other people i meet like that spark is hard to have with other people even when i get along with them. I had a date with a cute nice girl this morning and it was good but there wasn't much passion between eachother like i have with my friend. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hate how i can talk to this girl forever, she texts me first. she goes to the same small local college as me but shes not from here and she has no friends besides her bf.

I hate how i look at the bf like hes just a normal good guy, i've tried to talk to him once when i saw him at the gym but like the evil part of my brain makes me think about how i'm better for her and stuff and i hate that type of thinking, i don't want to be bad and stuff, i don't want to be a thorn in their relationship.

part of me wants to just tell her how it hurts to be so close to her but not be her guy and that i just have to go away. shes not a hoe, shes just a really nice girl. like one of the nicest people i've ever met. I just don't know how to deal.

587,"While on our last date (a week and a half ago), she had told me she would go to a show I was doing. The show was Tuesday and she told me on Sunday she wouldn’t be able to make it since she was going out of town. I just said no problem and asked when she would be back and that we should hang out then. She said “I think Friday”. I said “Cool, well text me when you get back and we’ll make some plans”.

She texted me the day of the show saying good luck and I just said “Thank you!” and I haven’t heard from her since. I did see on her Snapchat that she was back in town already though.

Should I wait for her to text me? Or should I text her? Also, was her saying good luck a way of reaching out for me to take the initiative to make plans?

I’m fine if she doesn’t text me and isn’t interested. But if she is interested and is expecting me to text her, I’d definitely like to reach out. I do believe she’s interested though because she would keep telling me she gets shy and nervous around me and told me she wanted me to stay the night some time (couldn’t that time since her cousin was staying the night).

Backstory: we became friends when our homeroom teacher forced us to sit together during all of our classes, we quickly hit it off and soon we were texting all the time, like everyday all day. Then he fell for another classmate and i was happy for him until he completely ditched me, well he still talked and texted me every day but it wasn’t the same. Then they broke up and we became close again, same thing happened with in a few months and when he broke up with his second girlfriend our relationship never really recovered completely, at least not for me. 
I do admit that i was in love with him like a year ago but he had a girlfriend so I wasn’t really hurt by him not reciprocating my feelings and they went away.

So today i was watching the clip of our prom to which we went together and saw us talking and acting like a couple and then o realized that i have a very soft spot for him, i always forgive him and I’m ready to wait for him whenever he’s not his usual self. I don’t know if it means I’m falling for him again. 

I need your advice, should I distance my self from him or should i just wait for my feeling to go away. Confessing is not an option, he doesn’t like me i know that, I’m not his type by any means physically especially. I’m very confused and frustrated please help",02Mar2019,1
589,"My SO and I recently moved into a new apartment building and have had a handful of strange interactions with our next-door neighbor. Nothing too serious, but just enough interactions to leave us feeling unsure about her.  

She texted us the other night around 9pm and asked if we would be home the next day because she had a favor to ask (and then accompanied the text with this emoji 🙃 which for some reason always makes me uncomfortable 🙃). We said “sure, what do you need?” And she asked if we could call her. We were in the middle of a movie so we told her we were busy, but if she could just text us details in the morning, that’d be great (this isn’t her first time asking us to call her). 

The next day, she didn’t text but around 7:30pm just after we finished dinner, she knocked on our door. We were both a little tipsy and were totally thrown off 🙃

She politely started saying that her computer is so slow and she needs to do some online banking, and wondered if she could come over to use our computer the next day so she doesn’t need to keep going to the bank. She said her OS is so out of date and really slow and her “online banking is only in the latest browsers.” (She also told us she’s a freelance graphic designer for a living)

I know I had a visibly confused face. We stumbled over our words but basically agreed to figure out a time to do that the following day. 

We are regretting agreeing to this and wondered if anyone has any advice? We don’t feel comfortable letting her use our laptops but are we just being jerks?? Any thoughts are welcome. 

tldr version: our neighbor wants to know if she can come over and use our laptops to do online banking because she said her computer is too slow and she doesn’t want to keep going back and forth to the bank. What do?

My brother who is 19 years old is lazy and dislikes the family for no reason. Never had a job, doesn't do housework, doesn't want to talk to anyone in the family except me, can be very disrespectful  and many other things. I can't help but think he has depression. I've asked him a few times if all was okay and if he needs any help and he claims he's fine. He is constantly borrowing (and not paying back) money from me and my brother. He owes me and my brother hundreds but we don't mind too much as he's our brother and we love him. 

My dad pays for our college and accomodation and gives us spending money (spoilt rotten). But recently my dad has been talking about cutting off the 19y/old brother money wise as he's been spending it on cigarettes which is a HUGE NO NO always - but especially for us as our mom died from lung cancer as a result from smoking.  Usually I stand up for my brother because I genuinely believe he has a great heart but that he just has a load of mental health problems. But I have BEGGED him to stop smoking and to give dad a break but he just doesn't listen. 

Right now I'm supporting my dad's decision to cut him off financially.

My family are constantlydo fighting with him and I understand why but it also breaks my heart for him. I feel like he's going to snap any day now. 

I feel like an asshole is because I'm his only ally in the house and recently I've been also fighting with him. 

I feel like nothing is going right in his life and I can't imagine what impact this could have on him. I know the comments will just say ""he can get a job"" but easier said than done in his case.  I honestly feel like he could turn to drugs soon too which is another worry. At least if he has me to lean on, he'll have someone in his corner.

Does anyone have any advice for me? I need help. How to I motivate my brother to work or even seen help? How do I convince my family that my brother may have much deeper problems than we thought originally. ",02Mar2019,1

I worked my goofy foodservice job to pay for my liberal arts degree ( Associates of Arts). I made great personal strides and finally finished the degree in December; though not especially useful, I am proud of my degree. I greatly enjoyed my schooling, though I had a very difficult time with math and feel I will probably not pursue a STEM degree.
 I cannot get more than 16 hours at my cooking job, and I feel miserable and embarassed with so much free time. The problem is I don't know what to do next. 
A big part of me wants to try my hand at a building trade such as carpentry or electrical work, though I have zero building/trade experience. Another part of me feels like a failure for stopping short of my lofty educational goals. 
I feel like those around me are beginning to view me as a loser or ""less than"" for not having a steady occupation or field of study. 

I'm almost 24 with no real skillset aside from cooking and I'm afraid I couldn't hack it working with seasoned construction workers, I don't want to be a burden to my parents anymore, and I don't know how to get hired on as an apprentice with total ignorance of all things practical.

602,"So I went to the ER two days ago due to severe pain. Got a CT scan and everything. The doctors thought I may have ripped a hole in my intestinal lining, hence the scan. The ER is always busy, so my dad visited me at 3pm and stayed with me until he took me home at 11:00pm (I'm 19 and I don't have a car). It turns out that there's no tear, I'm just really constipated--as in, so much so that if it continues, something could rupture. The doctor also said I had a bladder infection, which I'm not surprised about.

Now, I have crippling self esteem issues and ever since I was diagnosed with Crohn's at 14, I've just felt like a burden to everyone due to my medical issues. Once I found out that my dad had wasted half a day of his time plus money on both an urgent care copay and an ER copay (I don't want to know how expensive that is) to just have the doctors diagnose me with constipation, a non-serious issue, I broke down in tears because I felt so bad.

This morning, I was waiting to at least get the antibiotics for the bladder infection. I'm not surprised that I had it because honestly, it'd been going on for months. Since it didn't actually hurt that bad, I didn't tell my dad anything because again, I didn't want to waste his time and money. But my dad finds out that the doctors didn't prescribe anything for the infection, and said there was no infection documented. We both heard one of the doctors say I had an infection while at the ER.

Now I want to go to urgent care because I'm 100% sure I have one, since I've had a few before, and I just want to get rid of it.

Anyways, I work with this girl that I had a crush on. I also write music. So naturally I wrote a song around her personality and based it off our conversations and jokes we made while working. So she was basically the inspiration for the song. I probably wasn’t ever going to ask her out just because she’s a co-worker and she has a bf and she’s in her senior year in high school (she’s 18, i’m 20).

I wrote the song before I knew she had a bf, and I add lyrics that fit the context of the song. I tried to explain that to her before I gave her an mp3 to listen on (ik, dinosaur right). She was lile “ok cool”. I also asked for her number so when she listens to it she can text me and tell me what she thinks

She seemed interested in hearing it. She said that she wanted to and that’s the only reason I did this. 

I gave it to her like a week ago and the yesterday, which was the next day I came to work, a manager spoke with me. Gave me back my mp3-player and told me that it made the girl feel “uncomfortable”. But I wasn’t in trouble or anything because the manager knows I’m into music and I told her I’d back off (which I have and shall continue doing)

I was a little shocked because I honestly thought she’d like it. I even tried to explain that some of the lyrics may not have been authentic because it’s just a song. But I guess it still freaked her out.

Should I apologize to her or just let the whole thing go? I don’t feel I’ve done anything wrong, because it’s not like I forced her to listen to it. But I hate when people get the wrong impressions of me, thinking I’m some weirdo,especially when it’s people who I view as friends. I feel it was definitely a big misunderstanding. My intentions were to try to let this person hear a song that I wrote that was inspired by them, and if a deeper friendship or relationship came outta of it, cool, and if not, then no harm no foul.

On Friday we had our midterm. I got to our classroom first (as I always do) and started just reading over notes for some last minute studying. She gets there and walks past me to her seat, sits for a few seconds then gets up and leaves the room (as she always does, I assume she uses the restroom), but this time I noticed she was carrying herself differently than normal. She usually walks so damn fast I swear she flys, but this time she almost looked like she was wondering and wasn’t really sure where she was going. 

A few minutes later she comes back to class and pulls the professor in the hallway, they chat outside the room very briefly and all I hear is the professor say “that’s fine, you’ll be okay”, the pretty girl then came back in the room, got her things, and left, all before class actually started. 

I got worried about what could be so wrong the professor would let her leave so early she misses our midterm. My friends told me this could be my “in” and I should ask her on Monday. They all said just say “hey i noticed you left early on Friday, i was just wondering if you’re okay?”, but i don’t want to bother her or creep her out.

I guess i should also mention that I’m autistic so not only does anything social go completely over my head, it also makes me uncomfortable, because of this assume I’m just generally bothersome to avoid actually being that way.

626,"After giving this job a shot for about a month, I couldn’t take it anymore. 
The work is very vigorous but I make $9/hr. I was supposed to be making tips as well (it’s a cafe) but my manager didn’t start giving me tips until an entire month of me being there. They’ve been negligent about giving me my paycheck as well. 

I do have another job. I only took this one up because I had a lot of free time on the weekends. 

The girls I work with are all in high school (I’m in college), they’re catty, rude, and lazy. The customers are really awful as well. I’ve had many jobs and never seen people behave this way when getting a drink from somewhere. 

After an awful shift today, I can’t take it. I NEED to quit and I’m going to text the manager tomorrow. 

My issue is this: I work Monday, Friday, and Saturday of this week. I can’t handle another Saturday. And after everyone finds out I quit?? They’re already understaffed. 

The manager is a really really sweet person. I feel really bad about how difficult it’s gonna be for her to work on the schedule with how little people there are. 

What do I say? How do I get out of these next few shifts? Do I tell her about how awful the other people who work there are?? I need advice !!",02Mar2019,1

628,"Hi everyone. This is a throwaway account just a heads up.

I’ve been having some problems with my roommates. I don’t know if I’m just being self-absorbed/selfish or if they are gaslighting me. Just a little background, I consider these three people to be my best friends because I’ve been relatively close to them since I’ve started college.

I would also like to add that I make a consciousness effort to be a respectful roommate . I ask everyone if I can have a guest over, I clean up after myself, and I respect everyone’s stuff. I’ve had shitty roommates in the past and I definitely do not want my roommates to feel like I have in the past.

We moved into our apartment back in August and everyone uses my kitchen stuff. I brought all my pots, pans, silverware, etc and literally everyone uses them without asking me for permission. I’ve mentioned a couple times that I would appreciate it if they would ask me but nobody seems to care.

Another thing is that they’ll just waltz into my room when I’m not home to grab something that they need. 

I started dating this guy right when I moved in and we’ve been going strong for almost 6 months now! Considering I’m an adult who likes to be healthy and safe, I keep a box of condoms in my desk drawer for when he comes over.

One day, my roommate goes into my room when I’m not home (didn’t ask for permission), goes to look for the 3-hole puncher (which wasn’t even hers) and sees the box of condoms. My other roommate then told me she called everyone into my room (WHILE I WASN’T FUCKING HOME) to look at the box of condoms I had in my desk. I get home and then she is SHAMING ME for this. Not even a week later, she has unprotected sex with a random guy at a frat party. That really irked me but I don’t like to cause unnecessary drama so I kept my mouth shut. 

Today kind of pushed me over the edge. I work at an amusement park here in California. Two roommates have passes to this amusement park and one of them can be “signed in”. Since I work at the park, I get in for free. I worked late last night and got up at around 8am this morning. I usually stay in my room until 10am and then talk to my roommates in the living room. Well, nobody was home today, which I didn’t think much of.

Then, I saw on one of their Snapchat stories that they were all at brunch together. Without me. I texted our group chat asking why they didn’t invite me because I finally had enough.

Their responses followed with 
“we though you worked today!” 
“You seemed so tired when you came home last night!” 
“Sorry, it was a last minute thing!” 

And then they went to the amusement park together without me. 

I started sobbing. We all have each other’s locations for safety reasons so they knew that I was home and could hav asked me. I called my boyfriend and told him what happened and he will usually tell me if I’m being dramatic, but even he thought that was super shitty of them to do. 

I don’t know if I’m really asking for advice, but I guess can somebody validate my feelings over this? I didn’t grow up with a lot of friends and I thought it would get better once I got to college but this is my third year and it doesn’t seem to be getting better. I also don’t want to tell them that I’m angry because I still have to live with them until May.

Thanks.

633,"I keep masturbating and doing sexual activity with guys after a break up with my gf left me feeling worthless. My friends always say I'm not a man (an insecurity of mine) and it caused me to take a submissive role in the bed room and in life. Everytime I do sexual activity I go deeper and deeper in this hole and I can only pull myself out of it for a day at the most. 

My balls hurt and my dick is always sore so its affecting my health too.

I started journaling and it helps clear my thoughts. I'm trying to get emotionally dependent on the gym like I am to sexual activity so that way I can just transfer the addiction to something at least healthier. Then with the gym I can reach a body I like be more masculine and then the emotional dependence can fade.

639,"This is a little bit of back story for context. My girlfriend is 24 and has been going through a divorce for about nine months. She's living with her parents until the divorce is finalized, and we started dating about three and a half months ago. Her mom is way over controlling and appears to be doing her best to keep us apart from eachother. This is a 24 year old woman who isn't allowed to go out more than once a week. That's how controlling her mother is. 

Anyway, she let me know early on that plans aren't always set in stone because of how chaotic her life is right now. I was ok with that, but she would always wait until the last second to cancel plans. The most recent example is that she cancelled plans five times in a row. One time was because she was scared she might upset her mom. Then we were supposed to go to the gym together, but she said she couldn't go. I saw her at the gym the same day and I got mad and stormed out. A couple days later she cancelled gym plans again, and the next day, her mom asked her not to go out when we already had plans, and she didn't because ""[her] mom was nice to [her] that day."" A couple more days later she cancelled plans saying that ""[her] family depends on her,"" whatever that means. 

I lost it and told her I was done, and I eventually hung up on her. She called back to ask me to not break up with her, and I obliged.

Ages 7-13 was struggling with burgeoning anxiety and my parents’ profoundly messy divorce — Mom said if I go see my dad, she’ll disown me, never got to know him, etc. 13-18 was heinous acne and suicidal self-hatred, 19-22 was depression/anxiety + alcoholism and being bullied, and 22-26 was living alone in the middle of nowhere with my ex girlfriend, smoking shit loads of weed, going through various antipsychotics and mood stabilizers that left me paranoid and generally not much better off than I was when I was 21 and having nervous breakdowns in public. Except now I have outstanding hospital bills and went from 180 pounds and fit to 163 and skinny. 

I now live in my (supportive) brothers tiny office, sleep on a futon, and drive Uber eats. I invested the last ten years and every ounce of my being in furthering a career in a field that’s proven to be impenetrable for me, and now I have no friends, no career, and no purpose. Anxiety and depression caused me to drop out of college, so I don’t have a degree, either. My friends were all lost because of isolation, manic episodes, or depressive episodes. 

Narcissistic/borderline mom isn’t supportive, dad I didn’t know died of brain cancer years ago and left me nothing. I’m crippled by student debt and abysmal credit, pursued by a collections agency over library books I still have but never returned, interest racking up on the student debt, etc etc. My life is all but ruined in just about every conceivable capacity.

CRAZY COINCIDENCES. but that’s just me reading too deep into things. i find it interesting though lol. anyway, we met up and one thing led to another and we ended up having sex. we’ve done it like 4 times now, and it’s honestly great. but we don’t text or talk to each other unless it’s for sex. he works a lot though, and he’s always having to leave town because of work so i know he’s busy most of the time. and my time is consumed by school and the gym. so we’re both pretty busy. i’ll text him if im horny and sometimes he’ll be available but most of the time he’s working. but when he’s not working he’ll text me and ask if i wanna do something and by something he means sex lol so we’ve become fuck buddies. i thought i was cool with it at first but now im not sure. i feel like you can only have sex with the same person so many times before some type of feelings get envolved. and i’ve told myself so many times that im not looking for a relationship nor do i really have the time for one right now but it’s like the more i think about, the more i realize i think i might actually want one...with him. it’s honestly making me really sad. it’s not even him or his actions it’s more of a mental thing IM putting MYSELF through. i can’t really explain it. i don’t get jealous of anything he’s doing because who am i to get jealous. but when i think of him being with another girl it makes me uncomfortable. he also does things like hold my hand while he’s driving or grabbing my thigh or holding my hand during sex, &amp; that makes me feel like he doesn’t JUST want sex but I know it most likely means nothing. truth is all we do is fuck, he takes me home and i don’t hear from him until he wants to fuck again. that’s really it. and im trying be okay with it because like i said, the sex is great but i know deep down i want more.

657,"My friend (we'll refer to her as **K**) knows that me and her ex (we'll refer to *him* as **L**) talk sometimes, and she always forces me to send every conversation that we've had to her (we don't see each other in real life, just through texts and calls). I think she thinks that we're going to end up in a relationship, but I know that that's never going to happen, because we're just friends and I don't even want to date him (and I know he doesn't want to date me, either). 

I'm actually bisexual and crushing on a girl who is straight..... so that's how my love life is going right now. And even if that girl wasn't straight and wanted to date me, I'd still say no, because I have to get my shit together in terms of depression/anxiety/self harm/ADHD, etc., and that's going to take a long time, because it's really bad right now, so I'm in no way ready for a relationship.

 **K** also got annoyed because **L** is friends with one of my friends ( who is going to be referred to as **R)**..... who lives in a different country. **R** is either demisexual, aromantic or asexual, or a combination of two or more of these (she's still figuring it out), so again, it's very unlikely that they'll end up in a relationship, and I know she considers him as just a friend as well. Then there's the matter of **L** and **R** living in completely different countries. So........ yeah. That's pretty unlikely.

So, what do I do to get **K** to see things from my perspective? She's friends with one of her friends' exes, and her friend is okay with it (her friend and her friend's ex had a bad breakup, because he dumped her), and **K** and **L** didn't have a messy breakup. It was just because their views didn't match up, and they didn't feel like they could be together. I don't want to have to stop being friends with him, he's a cool dude, so is there any way to explain things to her from my point of view so that she understands?

Also, yes, **L** knows about my depression, anxiety, ADHD, and about my self harm, and he knows that I'm bisexual and crushing on that girl, and he told me that I probably shouldn't date until I've worked things out because it might be too stressful on me (again, he said that as a friend), and I already wasn't planning to date anyone until after I'd worked this out, which is probably going to take a long time, and I don't want to make it even longer by stressing myself out even more, so I agreed with him. So I *know* that he's not planning on asking me out, because even he thinks that I should stay out of relationships for now, and I agree with him.

Also, and this has nothing really to do with the rest of this post, but **K** is pretty needy, she asks me to hang out almost every day of the week, and I decline every time because we're always going to a shopping centre or something, and while I'm good at hiding how I feel, and I can even make it seem like I'm enjoying it thoroughly, I could be feeling completely drained of energy and tired and anxious on the inside, and I've told her that, but she still won't stop asking me. I've told her that we can go to my or her house instead, and she's said no to that every time. But my mental health really isn't good enough right now to spend hours pretending to have fun at a shopping centre. And I mean, sure, at the beginning maybe I'll have fun, but it'll go bad pretty quickly, with all the people walking around me, having to act like I'm having fun, it all freaks me out. So there's that. And she guilt trips me every time I say no - ""I'll be so bored if you don't come"", ""I can't do *anything* else and I won't have anything to do for a whole day if you don't come with me"" - even though she knows exactly why I decline it every time. Apart from that, my phone is constantly blowing up with texts and calls from her at all times of the day, even when I don't have my phone, like in the middle of the night, etc., and I've told her that I can't answer her then, but that still doesn't stop her.

And while I figure all relationships see sex ebb after the first flush, I began to get restless.  I raised the issue with her and she says she's recently discovered she is ""grey asexual"" - she even sent me literature to read up on.  From what I take from it, she experiences sexual desire only some of the time.  Months or even years can go by where she doesn't experience any sexual desire, she says.

It's a serious relationship and we both care about each other deeply.

But I'm unhappy.  I don't know the best course of action yet.  I do know we would remain good friends no matter what.  She has illuminated my own life in ways I can't fully describe.

I asked her and she said that it does not bother her because she likes having sex but it was his idea. He told her he has been looking at her since she was 11 in this way but knew he couldn't touch her so he bought her underwear and revealing cloths instead. She never noticed this. He got her to agree partly by bribing her with shopping trips and gifts in return for the sex. She has even said that she gets whatever she wants now. But what really worries me is that he thinks they are in a relationship and wants to stop using protection and get her pregnant. She is scared of the idea but doesn't want to say no because of how possessive he is. She is thinking about doing it just to make him happy and abandoning the baby. I've talked to her and she will not stop doing this with him. She has no romantic feelings for him but he is her only close family. If I report it, she will have no one and will know that I went behind her back because I think I'm the only one who knows. But if I don't, I'm worried that it will get worse and she will be stuck like this forever. And.....it's really selfish but she is my only real friend and I'm really her only good friend too. I am the only person she trusted to tell. If I report it she will leave and I don't think I can live without her. She is a good person besides this.

I need advice. I know this is disgusting and I should just tell the police but I don't know how to help her without ruining her life. But if I don't I'm scared that I will be charged for not reporting as a mandated reporter. I feel like a terrible friend. Please help.",02Mar2019,1
663,"I met my ex girlfriend best friend we had a laugh talked well I talked a far bit about her my ex (her best friend). Well she was a pretty good listener and I dont know what else to talk about with her.

She kept saying if we met first we would be really good friends stuff like that. I suspect she was into me we really hit it off we had quiet a few similar interests.

A friend of mine wanted some advice from her so I gave him the phone to ask her he asked and then he diverted the conversation when she said like me and ***** are friends. He said well your the bi****s friend so this is mest up!  she got really angry I immediately took the phone off him deleted the message and said ignore him she got angry saying dont say anything like that about my friend and she threatened him saying I'll get you beaten up and I reponded with a ok.

She messaged a couple hours later saying that wasn't very nice, I justified his words by saying that he was looking out for me and he didn't do anything wrong and then she responded saying well it's in the past and I said yes it is.

She then said yes it is so dont resent ****** (my ex) and I was like what! I'm over your friend and she responded your really not you always talk about her.

I reponded saying the only reason I talk about her is because theirs nothing else to talk about with you she then replied saying then we shouldn't talk at all I reponded with a ok.

After three days she said I'm telling her best friend(my ex) what my friends said about her I  haven't yet reponded.

 the ironic thing is my friends and my ex never met and don't even know each other! ",02Mar2019,1
664,"I have a major problem of getting all anxious when people do mildly illegal stuff (smoking weed, torrenting movies 17 year old dating an 18 year old etc.) I'm not the most steetwise/out there person in the world and I completely understand that thinking people aren't going to do stuff like this is completely unrealistic. 

It just annoys the fuck out of me that knowing something about that about someone overrides my entire perception about them and makes being around them hard when it shouldn't fucking matter. It makes me feel like some uppity ponce who expects everyone to follow the law to the letter. I know as I get older I'm going to come across people who do way worse shit that I'm going to have to turn a blind eye to, so Reddit, what advice do you have on how to not give a fuck?",02Mar2019,2
665,"For people who have made new friends when they in their twenties and onward, can they be as close as ones people made in childhood that they grew up with?

666,"She posted something about ""black girl magic"" on her wall. Imagine if it was ""white girl magic"". IMO black girl magic is basically a way of saying that black women are superior to women of other races. How do I confront her about this?",02Mar2019,1
667,"I have a few reasons I am about to change psychologists, does anyone have any input on how to make this a little easier? I'm unsure if I want to start with a new slate so to speak, or get a copy of my record sent to the new location. I am concerned the new location might come to a biased opinion from reading the notes of the place I am leaving. Any thoughts would be appreciated! Thank yall for your time! ",02Mar2019,1
669,"So, on Friday I started to talk to this girl more than I'm used too and I'm starting to get to know her. I'm with her in every class so I get to see her for most of the day. In math class, we were on khan academy and since I was done and she was struggling I decided to help her. She was basically making me do all the work but it was ok since I didn’t care. We were almost laughing all the time doing it. For some reason, it seemed she didn't know how to do anything I was trying to teach her how to do the math ( Diameter, Radius, and Pi ) but she still couldn’t do it even with the calculator. In the next class, I asked if she was just joking and she said yes. Then I realized all she wanted to do was spend more time with me than usual. I think she maybe likes and I just wanted advice from you guys. ( We are both 13 )",02Mar2019,1
670,"Sorry if the formatting isn't correct I'm new to reddit.

Recently I have been feeling so stuck. I realized the reason I'm so insecure about myself and my actions are because I expect other people to have my same mindset. I judge people and criticize them in my mind instantly. I have mean thoughts about strangers who I have not even met before. This leads me to worry so much about what others think about me, my actions, my looks, and what I say. When people try to talk to me I think in my mind they're only talking to me because so and so reason. I am selfish and often only interact with others when I need something  from them. I am petty, condescending, rude, and get jealous easily. I know I am a horrible asshole but I do not know how to change myself. I have met amazing people who are so genuine and authentic that it makes me loathe myself and how I act. I am constantly self conscious and care too much about what other people think. I want to change myself and not be a piece of shit but I don't know how. I feel as if I'm just stuck in this toxic cycle and I don't know what to do. I feel like I am drowning. If a person wants to be healthier they eat right and exercise. But how do you change your state of mind? How do you become a better person?

I'm sorry if this isn't very coherent. I am not the best at putting my thoughts into words. Ty if anyone replies to this. ",02Mar2019,1
671,"My wife and I recently purchased some land to build a home on. I have a very highly rated builder in mind, and have already had a meeting with him that went well. However, my older bro who I have a very strong and good relationship with is the lead project manager for a multi-national commercial construction company. He worked his way up from swinging a hammer at a local company to where he is now so I know he knows what he is doing. 

I mentioned using a builder my brother knows and he said he would be a good builder. I half kidding mentioned I would rather give my brother the $20,000 GC fee and have him build it than the guy I don't  know.  I was somewhat surprised when he sounded interested and said he would make some calls for me to see if he thought he could swing it. 

I know there is no way in hell my brother would ever actually take the full $20,000 from me and I would probably just be responsible to take him on a massive spending spree at Cabelas involving new guns and hunting stuff. 

Getting to the the question, I know my brother would do just as good of job if not better than the random guy I don't know, and would most likely save a substantial amount of money. but I'm concerned about going through this processes with my brother.  You always hear people say never conduct business with family. Has anyone been in a similar situation? Would you recommend using my brother or a random company?

TLDR: Should I use my brother who's a GC to build my home or another company?",02Mar2019,0
673,"Okay guys, so this is my first reddit post and I just need some advice and life lesson help. Okay. So this can be a pretty long story so I’m gonna sum it up for what I can, a few years ago I lost my dad, he was in a motorcycle crash and died a few days later. I got a large sum of 150k$ and it was put into an savings account, I went down a horrible path due to not being that close with my father and we had just began rekindling a relationship even a rocky one at that. And he was ripped away. So me being an angry lost teenager turned to the hood and drugs, not exactly being a thug per say but hustling drugs and constantly doing them. Anything. But my enemy was cocaine, I was literally spending 1500$ a day and doing about 20 grams of coke, a gram would be split into two lines for me. And I met this woman, and we vibed really well, atleast for the most part, she had a thing where she’d loose her temper and start throwing them hands, cause feisty women are like lioness. But anyways she got me off the drugs cold turkey after about 7 months of straight doing them. And I ran out of money and instantly started looking for work, but that’s a slow process in a small town and one day about a month ago she said, “I can’t stand you anymore, you’re a piece of shit and a waste of time” keep in mind she woke me up to this, and literally up and left. No talk or anything. Just in the snap of a finger she was gone and I didn’t even get a word out. And we kept talking and stuff and she said she just couldn’t be around me all the time anymore, that it was boring and I was getting on her nerves even being around her. I have tried everything for this woman and I bought her clothes jewelry food 3 phones, got her nails done every 2 weeks, she had everything she needed and when the money was gone she just kinda bailed, and she insisted on me letting her go through my social media’s and I let her, and she made me take screenshots of everything and send it to her, and I did because I really loved her and wanted things to work out in time. And she would always call me a liar and a waste of time, for accepting friend requests from women and men on social platforms and freaked out on me for making an Instagram. Then after talking with my best friend who told me to leave that b****, she hit me with the I love you boo and I flipped saying I don’t want that fake love and shit, and that if you can’t trust me why do you wanna stay exclusive and she flipped out saying again your a waste of my time and just other hurtful things. She’s been sending me snaps of like music videos of her lip singing shit like “I don’t think you really understand that we’re through” and “Club Ready with the friend! 😍” with her and another guy, and she sent it to me. And posted it on her story and when I asked why she was trying to taunt me, she said I’m not and that was the end of it. And I’m hurt. I just need some advice for getting past this situation, like I really loved her and my mind is just kinda lost. Like if she wouldn’t have helped me get off the drugs I could very well be dead, and just all the good memories eat my mind, while the bad ones make me die. ",02Mar2019,1
