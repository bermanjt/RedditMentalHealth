0,"I’ll try to make this as short as possible. 2018 was a horrible life changing year with family deaths and many other things. I’m an only child and only grandchild, my grandpa was the one who passed, he left his wife, my grandma who has late Alzheimer’s. My dad quit his job and moved in with her for 4 months to take care of her while looking for a nursing home for her. When my grandpa died, a week later my grandmother on my moms side died. There was so much going on that I had to handle with my parents and I didn’t work all last year. 

I thought I was ok until July where things hit me and I got depressed and stopped doing anything fun really. It also triggered my anxiety to act up and panic attacks. 

Fast forward to now, I am terrified of evrything, I’m hyper sensitive, I cry for evrything and it just a little, I’m talking uncontrollable crying and throughout the day. I’ve stopped enjoying things I used to love and I don’t like leaving my house bc I’m so scared so staying home makes me feel safe.

With all this I started looking for a job doing what I used to do and got one, well tomorrow I start and I have to drive to a training class that’s about 1.5 hours away from me (my job tho is local) and it’s an 8 hour class. I’m terrified, that I will start panicking there or start crying. I really want to try but my parents think I probably shouldn’t take this job. My parents are even going to drive me to the training (which is embarrassing as I’ve never had them do this for me in my life)

Any suggestions on what to do? I have already called a therapist to start therapy ASAP. I’m just terrified of tomorrow.",15Jan2019,1
1,"No matter what I do, I just CANNOT wrap my head around geometry. I can understand algebra for (the most part) pretty okay. But there's something about geometry I just can't grasp. I've looked over the work and I tried memorizing it, but nothing seems to be working! I do my homework and I get almost all of the answers messed up, I barely pass my tests because I don't remember a single thing. I don't know what to do! Why is this so confusing to me? Every other subject is perfectly fine, even if I need a hour or so of studying it over and over to understand it. I just don't get geometry! What's worse is that my geometry teacher never fully explains the work, we never go through it together. She always wants us to find it on our own but everyone is always working alone, and if I ask questions they're GOING to call me stupid! (Before you say ""no they're not!"" Yes. They are. Trust me on this.) I just don't know what to do and it makes me want to cry because I feel so stupid!",15Jan2019,1
2,So basically my friend's girlfriend broke up with him and it later came out that she did it because my friend kept trying to touch her when she didn't want him to and he kept saying he was going to abuse her.

3,"I feel the competition in my life from everything and I want to know how to stop and just do my best and be happy with it.

The only time I really talk is when I’m with my friends and even then I still have trouble with expressing my feelings and things on my mind out of fear of what they might say.

She suffers from terrible anxiety and depression and just a few weeks ago, she finally got the courage to ask out the guy she likes to a dance, who also happens to be the best looking and most popular guy at school. She made a sign and met up with him at a coffee shop to ask him. He said “sure” and then immediately left. Now, a few weeks later, and a week before the dance, he is pretty much unresponsive to any texts or flirting she attempts, and she is falling back down into her early signs of depression, and I just don’t know how I can be there for her.

So, this literally just happened and I’m a tiny bit drunk. My family is renting this house, I’m an 18 YO boy in Brazil. 

Me and a buddy of mine went out drinking and we didn’t have a key to the gate to the house, that faces the street and everyone can access it. So because we didn’t have a key to the lock, we decided to jump over the gate, and thats when shit happened. 

My fat ass broke one little piece of wood ( 30 cm i think )of the gate, and I’m scared shitless that my parents are gonna know it was me and unleash hell on me. And even worse it’d be if the lady that is renting us the house make them pay for it.

I’m positive that no one saw it, there are no cameras. But can the fact that it was only us here fuck me up???  I don’t know if fixing that would be expensive or not. Should I text the lady saying that it was broke? Help!!",15Jan2019,1

11,"Hey everyone,
I’m currently a Junior in college and i’m at that point where i have to decide what i want to do with the rest of my life and i don’t know if i’m ready for that. My problem is that I change my mind on what I want to do every month. 

I change from wanting to own a bar, to wanting to create my own clothing line, wanting to paint, or wanting to write and direct movies. I call myself “creatively frustrated” cause i get frustrated if i can’t find ways to express myself (paint, draw, write, etc). I also day dream and thinking about different stuff ALL the time no matter where i am or what i’m doing, i know it’s a bad thing to do but I just can’t sit down and listen to someone talk for an hour. 

I doing a double major, marketing and information systems, just because it’s a safe route since companies need a marketing team and someone that knows about IS. 

I was hoping one of you know what I can do in order to have a good job and also let me express my creative side. If you have any questions i’ll be glad to answer them.

Thanks!",15Jan2019,1
12,"Some background: I grew up with a single mom, and my grandparents helped out A LOT throughout my upbringing. I am extremely close to them. My mom still lives in the same town as them and tends to be their majority caregiver even though her other siblings live close too. She talks a lot about wanting to leave and do other things, but insists she has to stay there as leaving would devastate them. 

I left for college, about seven hours away. Then I moved about nine hours away to start a new life with my bf when he got a job out of college. We JUST broke up, and I’ve been distant from my family because they keep asking questions and feeling bad for me, which I HATE, and I’m not even sad about the break (it was mostly me). I also have been distant because I wanted to have a solid plan before I tell them what I’m doing. 

My grandma sends me a letter every week and i just received one she wrote before my mom even told them bf and i broke up. She figured it out herself I guess. In the letter she basically is begging me to come closer. Saying they don’t have many years left (grandpa is 93 and grandma is 90). This KILLS me. My mom has always said she didn’t want me to feel obligated to stay close and that’s part of the reason why she does. I had ZERO intentions of moving back to that awful state. I’m trying to move in with a friend which would be about 13 hours away from home. 

Does this make me a horrible person? When everything is good, I try to FaceTime them every week. I’ve been coming home semi regularly because I’ve always been in college and decently close. This chapter though if I move and get my first big girl job (engineering) I probably won’t be able to come home much (id have to fly). How am I supposed to deal with this? How am I supposed to tell my incredibly old grandparents that they don’t mean enough to me for me to move back? I’ve always wanted to get out of state and trying to start a life there now honestly makes me sick to think about. I just have no idea how to handle this. ",15Jan2019,1

Hey Reddit,

I have been in a pretty weird spot in life where i have to question a ""friendship"" i have and its really hard to figure out what to do. So my mom and my friends mom are also ""friends"" and somehow they ended up making an agreement that this friend will be living with us on school holidays due to their parents being oversees and them going to college in the US. Me and this friend only talk whenever he is coming to stay with us and we have nothing in common, we don't hate each other or anything but it just feels like this friendship was super forced on me and it kind of leads me to feel like im being taken advantage of most of the time. This friend is extremely selfish and doesn't share anything with me but i always end up sharing and helping them for some odd reason, this can be in regards to food, money, or just moral support. Yesterday they ask me to drive them to a friends house to hang out, the house was a whole hour away so i said no. They told my parents they would come back later today and told me to free my availability for this evening to pick them up so i cancelled my plans only for them to tell me at 9pm they will be back tomorrow idk if im just transferring anger or if it is justified.",15Jan2019,1
15,"I had been saving up to buy a gaming computer for a year.I already knew my mother had negative veiw on videogames but I thought I would be able to just do all this behind her back.

My plan did not work out very well.After I deposited the money,my mother started asking questions.(My mother has access to veiw my bank account). I tried to be honest with her and just tell her what it was for. 

Just now she came downstairs and tells me if I built this computer she would throw it away.Now I have no idea what to do. I could just transfer it to my father's account and have him buy the parts. But then when I end up actually building the thing she will throw it out.Should I try talking with her?

My mom and me have been fighting over stuff for the last few months,she has problems with my tone and ""attitude"". I have a issue where I always try to get the last word in a argument.

17,"So I matched with this girl on tinder who saw me at a university event. She told me over text how she saw me and liked my boots and what I was wearing to one of her friends. Eventually I added her on Snapchat and we ended up talking a little bit over break. She flirted with me, called me cute many times, and all that good shit. She showed interest. One day she texts me and says that she can’t bring herself to flirt with me because she says she made it a goal for herself to not hang out with her ex over break and she didn’t do that. She said that she doesn’t want to see me right now so that she can be happy on her own for a while. 

I gave her space for a couple days and offered to take her out to eat at somewhere that isn’t the university. She said she appreciated the offer so much — apparently a lot - but it was not enough to get her out of the crud.

A) too afraid to tell me she doesn’t like me 

B) pulling my leg while she’s fucking other guys

C) she genuinely likes me and needs emotional space",15Jan2019,1
18,"So, I’m at uni right now (first year, in halls) and will be moving into a house with a few friends from my course next year. However, one of these friends isn’t really a friend, they’re just friends with my other friends. And the problem is I’m not overly fond of this person. 

Said friend has a variety of problems, none of which are necessarily their fault. They have fairly bad depression which manifests itself in them being over the top acting excitable and bouncy to make up for it, made worse by what I believe is Aspergers. They are often extremely loud at sudden times (which makes me jump X) ), and very chatty. Chatty unfortunately includes talking very openly about their sex life when nobody was on that topic previously, and it’s something I personally don’t want to know about other people, so I find it uncomfortable to have it in my face like that. 

I think what I find most frustrating about them aside from finding them generally loud and a bit intimidating and obnoxious is that they won’t ever accept help and are constantly making suicide jokes and joking about how their life is run on negativity. They’re always putting themselves down but won’t accept compliments if people try to help them be positive. They also won’t go to the doctor about their depression.  I’m scared to ask them to be quieter or stop talking about their sex life all the time as I don’t want their depression to worsen. 

I think it’s more of a conflict of personality: I’m quite a socially awkward person, and on top of that an introvert, and tend to get along better with quieter, more reserved people. This person is very much my polar opposite and I’m worried that I won’t be able to stand living with them when we all move in together. The presence of others makes it more bearable but I’m concerned about it since we’ve all paid deposits and stuff already.

My question is: do you guys have advice about living with someone you don’t like and/or how to tolerate them? I currently tolerate them to the best of my ability and as much as I would love to help them with what’s bothering them, I know they won’t let me and I’ve had too many cases in the past where I’ve expended too much of my own happiness and energy trying to help others out of depressive funks and been drawn into one myself (I have ADHD and can get depressive bouts, so not ‘true’ depression, but counts.)

Many thanks for your time. Also let me know AITA for thinking this about them? I feel that this is all on me and not their problem at all but I don’t know. ",15Jan2019,1

20,"Hi, I am a college male sophomore that recently took a dive in my last semester due to hanging out with a group of friends that were not good for my mental health and also dealing with issues of my mental state.

My parents are not going to help me at all because there own financial issues. I tried working while in school to help pay my rent but that was too stressful and I was basically living paycheck to paycheck. any suggestions? I could go back to dealing since I used that to pay off the rest of the 3rd semester doing it and I was making a grand a week doing it but the stress of going to prison was terrible.

It first happened last night and I asked him if he remembered kissing me so, today. He had no recollection. 

Wondering if he'd do it again I went over to him to cuddle him while he was asleep tonight. He did it again, started kissing me passionately then put his head back down and appeared to be asleep.

22,"Hey Reddit. This may be a mix of venting and seeking advice. I dont really know where to start, but I will try to make it relatively short so hopefully someone will answer.

The reason I write this is because lately(2-3 weeks) ive been feeling extra sad. Often crying when im trying to sleep, and sometimes I have to keep it together to not cry when Im with people. Hopefully this post will lead to some advice to get me through this extra tough time. 

Im 24M and I feel sad most of the time I am alone. Almost all my adult life, I have always felt that in the back of my brain I am always sad. Some info about me: single, studying Computer sciene, living with my parents, no job, have a good group of friends, 2 really good friends, 2 really kind parents, no drama or bad childhood.

I have been struggeling with anxiety since I was a teenager. No panic attacks or something, just nervous/afraid of uncomfortable thing, and a lot of overthinking. Now that I am older, I have understood that most likely Im more of a coward than others. 

I have tried therapy 2 times, 5 years ago for 6 months and antidepressants for 6 months 3 years ago. Didnt really help. The terapy helped out of a tough time. I have friends that I can talk to, but I dont like it. I have never been suicidal, but I often feel it would have been nice if I just could go away. 

So whats really the problem? Im a virgin. Before the last year or something, it really didnt bother me that much. But now, I am thinking about i everyday. And it makes me more sad. The anxiety + really tight foreskin(phimosis) have done that I just have taken the love-part of my life, put it in a box and never open it really. Because of my penis problem, I have thought that I just cant have sex. Recently, I finally had an operation on my penis, didnt remove it all, just cut it more open. The operation didnt solve the problem, but it is still early so I am trying to stay postive a little more. Im going back to the doctor to check in March. 
So there’s that.

Another thing, Im having a crush on my best ladyfriend. Known her for 15 years, and because she have helped me when Im feeling down the last year, I have gotton some feelings for her. I have known her for too long to say something to her about it, I just want to get rid of my feelings for her. 

I really should not complain. I have a really good life compared to many other. I am not ugly, i feel that I have a good personality, I am not struggeling financially and I have many good friends and family. Im trying to think positive, but right now life is not cool. And it is annoying that I always get these tough patches. I feel that I would feel more wholesome happy if I had a girlfriend.

So, my questions would be something like: 
how to stay positive and keep trying? 
How to get a girlfriend or get laid? 
How to really be happy when Im alone? 
How to be stronger mentally? 
How to get rid of my feelings for my crush? 

This got a little depressing, and way too long. 
Im sorry for that. I just feel really sad and hopeless right now, and cant sleep :( 
As always, I am grateful for any answers.

23,"I've always had difficulty speaking. Either I get too nervous and can't get a sentence out, or I'm too confident and blurt something out that shouldn't be said. I stopped talking to all my friends from my hometown because they kept making fun of me over something bad I said when I was 13, and I've gotten more and more ashamed of it as I've gotten older. I've also called people racial and homophobic words when I was angry with them. I'm not racist or homophobic now (this was 11 years ago), but people still remember kicking my ass.

I've had doctors tell me I didn't have autism, which is the only lead I've had in trying to find out what's ruined my life. 

Along with my speech problem, I have another weird ability that science can't explain. I've done a lot of research and books straight up say it's bullshit when people claim to do it. People accused me of staging it and stuff when I showed them, and it's much harder to do when under pressure.

I often wonder if I've been dead or dreaming in a coma since I got a concussion at seven years old. I've looked into having schizophrenia. Maybe I'm just delusional. But then other people wouldn't be able to see it too.

I've spent entire months without social contact hoping to basically go into a coccoon and come out more mature and able to talk to people correctly, but it doesn't work.

24,"TL;DR I'm suspecting mom has Borderline Personality Disorder, obviously she won't go to the doctor. She's a contradictory person that has toxic behavior but at the same time she's been helpful to people. Her attitude had been increasingly toxic to dad until he's on the verge of breaking down and could only told his troubles to me. I am confused at how to approach this situation.

. 

Hello, I'm a first time poster on mobile, and using pretty much a throwaway account for extra caution. Please redirect me to the more proper subreddit if this is not the place for asking advice regarding this situation. 

Sorry if anyone else had experienced this! This is going to be quite a long post too so I'll be thankful if you are following the whole ride with me.

So before I start with my problem, I'll be explaining a bit about my situation. I've been diagnosed with anxiety, and I've pretty much had settled the problem with my own self because at one point, it gets destructive. Fortunately, my anxiety resolved pretty well after getting some med prescription, and having a (fortunately!) supportive family despite living in a country where going to psychiatrist is pretty much a taboo.

At the same time, however, my parents were in an incredibly heated argument for some time. I'll be honest that perhaps I'm biased to my father from now on as I have a lot of same views with him to prioritize logic over everything. It's one thing that helps me to get by my anxiety, despite seemingly a cold way to approach the situation.

Now here comes the trouble.

Mom is asking a divorce. We're a devout Catholic so this is pretty unthinkable. She had a lot of regrets about her past, that are pretty much unresolved (""[Dad] is late to come at a [specifically important event]!"") and making it a fuss even after almost 20 years had gone by since the event. Complaining about him doesn't give her money (despite already finding clients for her and sometimes giving her about $10.000 out of nowhere in lump sum for several times a year) and such. She's basically breaching his privacy at some points, and dad, trying to be the more sensible one, is letting her win at some parts.

However, several days ago she told him that he never contribute to the family. Despite dad apparently had giving up so much and risking his career at some times too. He never told mom about it, saying that ""why should I made you guys bothered with the complicated things."" and pretty much kept many problems out for himself. It was only after I'm living for 23 years and he just basically told all of his problem now. He was clearly breaking down.

On the other hand, my mother is a very kind and nurturing person. At least to the others outside her family. She's helping a homeless man who had a stroke and almost dead to the hospital and giving him a good old life in the retirement center. She's also helping someone on a life support and even went so far as to go to overseas to get a feeding tube (that has to be replaced every 4 months) for this person bcs the said tube isn't available in my country. 

So obviously she's not always horrible. Even to me. But at the same time she's always saying that ""Nobody in this world doing such failure/any degrading words as you did!"" I used to consider that as a hard love, but soon I realize that mostly she's just using me as an emotional punching bag. 

At an instance she did not asked me whether I want to take over her work. She just suddenly gave it to me one day despite I've never been wanting to do it and just give it to me since she's ""already tired and wants to retire already"". But at the same time she's also criticizing the way I did the job (it's just a bookkeeping job btw) and saying that I had a totally big ego for not wanting to listen to her. So pretty much she still had control over everything at the job and 'not retired yet'. Funnily enough she's even thinking about expanding the business and she's going to open up a new office (lol) by the next two months.

Thing is, it's hard to be in this position. Lately my father also been confused and seemingly lost at what to do in his life (despite the fact that he always has a way to do things and understands things that you don't usually knows. He's pretty much a genius for me). I told father that if he got out of the house (since the last argument, mother is pretty much shooing us both 'for not wanting to do anything as family together') I'll follow him.

This is evil but as I never felt like I have a mom, I never really had a 'mom figure'. But she has also done a lot of things, and I'd like to help her back because after some searches, I found that she may have either Bipolar or Borderline Personality Disorders. However, she felt completely sane and not having any trouble so telling her to go to psychiatrist, much less drinking a med, is impossible. She did tried to go to the psychologist and kept on blaming father to the point that the psychologist is not even bothering with his point of view.

So I'm not sure what to do about this. My dad is already tired and exhausted with the situation and I'm honestly tired of her too. I'm feeling tied on the whole situation too and I have two younger siblings that's pretty much also under her control and I'm fearing that she's going to use them as her emotional punching bag in the future.

28,"I'm 20. I've always had a few good friends, but I've always met them at school, and I've never really had friends outside of that. 
Each time I've changed of school (high school, then going to university, and now I'm doing an Erasmus year) I've met great people I really got on with, but I can't see them much anymore as we've all moved to different cities. 
I have always took quite a long time to open up to people. Very shy and not very talkative at first and then with time I really open up. Also, I'm really not good at small talk, it makes me feel uncomfortable and quite bored. I find it hard to find people with who I can have really enjoyable conversations. 
Nearly two years ago I met my actual boyfriend. We get on really well, talk a lot, and have deep and long conversations I've never had with anyone else. He's a very interesting and smart guy. 
We both understand each other as we don't really like big parties, or drinking, or being around big groups of people. We prefer chilling out with one or two people, because you can really talk with them and get more intimate, but it seems that loads of people of my age think they can't have a good time if they don't get wasted ? So those moments are quite rare. 

We've moved together to Portugal. I'm doing an Erasmus and he works online. I've met nice people but have found it difficult to make friends as most erasmus people just want to party a lot. 
For the moment it's quite ok as I go to school and still speak with other students. 

Next year my boyfriend is going to go back to university, and I've decided to try to start as a freelance graphic designer (I've been studying graphic design for 3 years) because I want to try to earn my own money with what I love and I feel ready for it. We will be moving to a new city quite far from my friends and family. 

I'm now coming to my real problem : I'm afraid to really be lonely. The only person I'll have is my boyfriend, and I love him to bits but I don't want  to depend on him too much. I'll certainly be working from home and he's the only person I'll really interact with. This scares me a lot. I think it's important to have other people I can talk to /hang out with from time to time. But as I don't really like going out and I'm shy, I don't know how I can met them ? I find starting friendships is quite painful, I have to talk about basic things and can't be myself. I'm afraid I'll just stay at home all the time and not see anyone. 
Has anyone been in the same case when stopping school ?

29,"I went to one of the best colleges in the US for the business I wanted to start. Unfortunately, the city of the college (and state, and region) is pretty mediocre for it. My plan was always to move to a city that was better for my job.

Fast forward to today. I’m 27. I took a job in the city after college and started my business on the side. I was lucky enough to be able to leave my job and work on the business full time last year. But, I’ve kind of maxed out how successful I am in the city, where I’d be able to do much better in a better city.

2 problems. 1. My business is very relationship intensive. It took me 5 years to get it to the point where I could do it full time, and I’d have to start from scratch in a new city. I was also extremely lucky I got things this quickly. 2. My fiance loves the city. She’d leave if she’d have to, but I’d feel pretty shitty for making her do that. There’s one potential city that she LIKES, but nothing compared to our current city.

There’s one final thing. I had a pretty bad injury in high school. Cold weather makes it very painful. Any city I’d be able to move to for my business snows, but I live in a city now that’s colder than any of them.

I’m stuck. The pros of moving to a new city are: a chance of being 2 or 3 times more successful than I am now (in terms of money as well as business size), less pain (but not none) and a lower cost of living. The cons are I’d have to restart the business from scratch, take the risk it doesn’t kick off this time, and make my fiance leave the city she loves. I’ve been going back and forth on this for days.

32,"Let me preface this by saying I know what shitty thing it was that I did, I’m trying to be a better person and I am horribly ashamed of my actions. 
For context before my best mate and his ex started dating me and the ex had been seeing each other and despite having a girlfriend of my own while they were together I always had a feeling of a missed opportunity with her. We remained good friends throughout the relationship but there was always unspoken chemistry between us.
Over a year ago my mate and his ex broke up, and over the next 6 month me and the ex became quite close and eventually one night drunkenly slept together. I felt like I needed it to happen once, that we had ‘unfinished business’ or whatever. Whatever bullshit reasons I have to to excuse that shitty action. At the time my mate had a girlfriend, another way I justified it to myself. 
It became immediately clear to me and the ex that it was a one off and although there had been genuine feelings before, afterwards we both knew how wrong what we had done was so we agreed to never tell anyone, especially not my mate as it would only upset him. 
But now I am so racked with guilt. I don’t want to tell him, not because I am scared but because I think it’s selfish. The part of me that wants to tell him is the part that wants to get it off my chest for my own peace of mind. Telling him will only upset him, me and the ex are never going to have a relationship or sleep together again and he has moved on from his ex so it seems like there is nothing to gain. 
Is this a stupid justification? What should I do and how can I deal with feeling so guilty? It is keeping me awake at night even now ",15Jan2019,1

Anyways I’m gonna make this short and simple. My stepsister is super hot. Like really hot. I’ve always thought she was hot, and as a result your boy here would wack it from time to time of the thought of her. Yep. 

Anyway, she rarely visits us though (“us” being my dad, my stepmom, and me). But when she was here, my fantasies ran wild. But I plan to keep them as just fantasies. However, things changed. She’s now living with us, and it’s become a problem. I can’t go a day without getting a massive boner and having to jerk off. Anytime I wanna go downstairs and eat, she’s there and as a result I get a hard on. I wanna tell my dad something real fast, she’s there and I get a hard on. I simply wanna go walk my dog, she’s there and I get a hard on.

Point is, I can’t be around her without thinking about her. It’s really become an issue. I try to stop thinking about her, but can’t because you can’t just blur someone out when they’re under the same roof as you. And some of you may say, “Then don’t jerk off!” I wish it was that easy, but by the time I can get back to my room I’m already too horny to just let it go soft again.

35,"Hi, first time using this subreddit, just looking for other people's thoughts on this issue.

So we moved into a new apartment last year and everything was fine up until this point. Last month we took a long vacation, during which the landlord had a maintenance worker come into our apartment to do some work which we ok'ed. We usually shut off most of the electricity before we leave the house for a long time with the exception of the refrigerator. The problem is when they came in they had to use the electricity so they turned some of the breakers back on. but when they left they turned everything off including the refrigerator. So we came home to a fridge full of rotten food and the water got all over the floor. 

When we reported it, at first they were understanding and said they would come clean it up on Monday. But 2 days later, they go a complete 180 and the landlords now making shit up and they're now saying they never touched any of the electricity, and we turned it off ourselves. They're also threatening to charge us for the damage. Any advice on how to handle this situation would be appreciated. Sorry for the long post.",15Jan2019,1

38,"Hi Reddit, 

I’m not entirely sure if this is the place to ask this, but I’d like some advice so hopefully it’s okay. TLDR at the end.

I get nose bleeds, no not the awkward anime ones, legitimate I sneeze my nose will almost certainly bleed. The bleeding can last anywhere from 5 minutes to around an hour. 
Sometimes it’s a little tickle, sometimes I’ll go through a while tissue box trying to get it to stop.

When I was a kid it was kind of a cool party trick, if I didn’t want to be in class all I had to do was breathe out too quickly, my nose would bleed and I’d be sent to the nurses office. 

But now I’m an adult, it’s not fun anymore. I wake up with my bedsheets looking like someone was murdered, blood in my hair on my face everything. I even have one of those plasticity-type things (the ones people use for kids who pee the bed) over my mattress to stop it getting ruined. 

If I make it through the night and want to eat breakfast, too bad, opening my mouth to get food in it apparently causes too much stress on my nose and it’ll bleed. 

I can be standing at work, smile at a customer and to their pure horror, have my nose start bleeding like I’m out of some possession movie. 

The bleeding is almost the pleasant part because it causes side effects. Anyone ever swallowed a blood clot? Because I have, it’s Super disgusting. 
It gives me headaches, makes under/back behind my eyes hurt? 
I lose sleep because I can’t fall asleep if I’m bleeding and I wake up bleeding. 

I’ve been to my doctor about this, had blood tests done, apparently and my iron levels are low (shocking I know). 
He also cauterised it Twice before sending me onto a specialist who then also cauterised it. No dice, still bleeding. 

Is there anything else I can do? Does anyone else bleed like this and have any idea what’s causing it/have a way to stop it? 

Thank you for reading 

TL;DR: 
My nose is bleeding reoccurringly and intermittently. It’s messing with my life, I’ve seen a doctor, what else if anything can I do? ",15Jan2019,1

I just had a question about the hiring process of some jobs and was wondering if this is a bad sign.

Later that day, I received an e-mail from the recruiter to schedule a time with the team for this week for the second interview, I was given hours/days that worked best for them, and selected those as they worked best for me as well.

We’re now coming up to the days that I selected, however I haven’t received any confirmation of an interview time. 

Should I be concerned about this? Should I reach out to the recruiter again? I’m nervous I may have screwed something up.

50,"Good day to good people of reddit who subscribe to this. I suffer with mental illness, I've been diagnosed with Bipolar, PTSD, severe depression,  anxiety and a panic disorder.  I'm a single mother who has been trying to get ssdi since 2009. My only source of income has been welfare and on January 1st I learned my funds were cut in half. Needless to say that pushed my mental illness over the edge to the point I was worried I'd harm myself. So I seeked help in hopes I could get some intense therapy over the weekend, new coping skills and a hospital stay under my belt. My mental health referred me Southern California hospital @ Van Nuys. They tell me they're sending a ambulance to pick me up. When it comes I'm told their taking me to the Hollywood facility. They leave me in this hospital which is a zoo. The worst place for someone in my mental state to be. To make a long story short this hospital discriminated against me, they neglected me and treated me so inhuman deprived me of meds. It was so bad that I had 7 panic attacks  and came in with chest pains at a 2 pain wise that turned into a 10. It took 7 hours for blood work and to get a ekg which they did in the waiting room exposing my breasts. I went in this hospital wanting to hurt myself and do to inhumane way I was treated , I was now having suicidal thoughts. Needless to say once I get to the mental facility not even a hour later I'm being sexually harassed by a person of authority. He was asking me questions that I felt I had to answer and I notice he's playing with himself. He also asked to see my vagina. It's now almost 3 am , it's been 12 hrs since I left home. During this time not one person has gave me anything but a aspirin that I had to beg the previous place for. I have a history of sexual abuse and that staff member unleashed the demon from my childhood. So I went to these places to seek help all to be broken down more than I already was, from all the neglect and mistreatment I endured. I didn't feel safe in this facility and with each moment I'm becoming worse. I filed a complaint against the staff member, checked myself out against doctors orders and now I'm seeking a attorney. I tried Gloria Allred and a firm she's connected to, and I also wrote to the #metoo movement.  This whole experience has traumatized me so much that I've been unable to leave my house and I now fear people with authority over me. There's so more to this in fact 9 pages worth of details. If anyone has any advice or suggestions or knows of a good attorney in Los Angeles County that handles sexual harassment,  personal injury,  and discrimination.

53,"We’ve been together 2 years. I love her very much and want to spend my life with her. Lately however, she has been acting like a totally different person than the one I fell for. She comes from a well off family. Both parents are divorced but equally wealthy. I come from a pretty broke family myself. 

The past few months, we’ve been living apart and I’ve noticed her behavior has become totally different. She has become classist, money obsessed and puts herself on a pedestal every chance she gets. 
Whereas she only makes a dollar more with her new job, she keeps telling me she can’t pursue certain renting/home buying options  because I won’t be able to afford them and the burden will fall on her. 
She has been looking at buying a house, which has made her think she’s the bees knees compared to anybody else our age. On the other hand, she is using money set aside for her by her family that she didn’t know about until 4 months ago. 

She takes every chance she can to put down people without an education (Which I have miraculously made it through without). I want to go back to school but I have enough experience in my field to justify a solid paycheck with room for advancement. She told me I’m an exception because she has given me an honorary degree and that makes me better than everybody else as well.
Her mom isn’t so much this way. Actually her mom and I get along very well and agree on nearly everything even when my girlfriend doesn’t. Her mom is a business woman and we see eye to eye on a lot of things, especially importance of money and skills vs education.
Her dad, on the other hand, is an alcoholic lunatic who has threatened to disown her if she isn’t making  100k by 25 and a millionaire by 30. At 30, he was making less money (inf. adj.) than we are now. He started a successful business only because his parents funded him through 6 DUI’s, 10 wrecked trucks and a bankruptcy or two. He also hates me because he says I’ll never be anything working in my field (Rec cannabis administration) and insists the only way I will become successful is to become an electrician. He smoked weed up until his late 40’s when he remarried. Honestly I don’t even smoke weed anymore, just manage 2 companies.

She just recently rekindled her relationship with her dad a year ago, after not talking for several. 
Despite her mom and I telling her it is toxic, she insists that she wants to maintain the relationship with him. However, I’ve never even heard these things come from her mouth until the past few months. I know it’s not her mom because her mom sticks her neck out and her shuts my gf down every time she says something to that degree. 
I love my gf and I know she is chemically half her dad, but I don’t want to date her dad. I think he’s a hypocrite and douche bag. I can’t see this relationship going further if she continues to go in that direction. How do I talk to her without her losing her mind on me? I’ve tried talking to her about other things she has been different about lately and it’s usually met with a burst of anger and self pity. 

Tl;dr- girlfriend is starting to act like a classist turd. I think rekindling her relationship with dad is to blame. Don’t want to date her dad, just the girl I fell for.

Earlier in the night we went out to a bar and my mother tells me to stop putting that face. We decide to instead go to Buffalo Wild Wings. As we get there and start walking to the restaurant my mother starts criticizing me, telling me to look up and walk straight.

We sit down and order food and beer. My parents start talking to me about graduate school and things like that. I was pretty much silent and didn't really want to talk I guess.

My mother is talking to my father and I'm just sitting there next to my mother. And all of a sudden my mother puts her arm or hand on my shoulder, like a hug or embrace? She just...touched me. In an ""affectionate"" way, and...I just flinched. All I did was flinch. It just really startled me and I didn't like it, so I just...got startled and flinched. I just shook it off? I just shook or jumped up as if I was startled, I didn't touch her.

I used to cuddle with my mother as a child and enjoyed her touch. But now as an adult...I just don't really like to be touched or touch her..

And my mom gasps and my dad says ""He doesn't like to be touched."" and then my mom says ""You know what..."" and I mean, I think that's what she said. She tried to knock over the beer, or something, the beer did spill a little. And she runs out of the restaurant crying.

My father is furious with me. And he runs out after her. I'm freaking out so I start to chug my beer. I then order another beer which was stupid. And my dad comes back and is furious at me and tells me how much I hurt my mother and says this is exactly what happened at graduation..

At my college graduation, I also made my mother cry. She came up to me to give me a hug and kiss and flowers, and...I just pushed her away. It was a stupid thing to do. And the best day of my life turned into a nightmare. My mother was crying and our whole family was just so awkward and fucked up. The rest of the night was just ruined all because of me.

And I start having flashbacks to that graduation which was 8 months ago.

So then my dad and I grab our food and take it to go. We then leave the restaurant and get in the car. I then immediately start drunk crying saying how sorry I am to my dad and he says he is sick and tired of this and is doing the best he can do, and he is screaming really fucking loud. He is then speeding and looking for my mother, and we find her walking in a parking lot.

We then pull up to her and I run out of the car drunk crying saying how sorry I am and that I love her. And she refuses to give me a hug. We then stumble back into the car.

And I'm wailing and crying like crazy. It was a living nightmare and my mom is crying saying how she is sick of this and tired of my behavior.

We then get back to the house...and just sit on the couch...and eat our food and watch the colbert report. Things settled down...and everything...was okay.

I then go to my room, and my dad knocks on my door. And says that they aren't mad at me or disappointed in me. I'm still crying like crazy, and my dad tells me not to be too hard on myself. And later then my mom comes to my room and I give her a hug.

And that was pretty much that.

I told my cousin all of this and he says I should be more affectionate towards my mother. And that I should touch her and hug her more.

I just..don't like to be touched. I don't like touching my mother. In fact, I don't even know if I love her. I mean, I would be devastated if she died. But I really just don't want to touch her. I mean, when she came back from the airport I gave her a hug. And I sometimes ask how her day is.

I don't know.

I keep making my mother cry. I really shouldn't have pushed her away at my graduation. But at buffalo wild wings...all I did was flinch...I guess maybe shook her arm off of me? I didn't touch her or anything...I just shook as if I was startled, which I was.

Family therapy is not an option. My parents don't have the time or money for family therapy.

I know I need a lot more therapy. I need so much therapy. I see my therapist on Wednesday, thankfully. I just have so many issues I need to deal with.

tldr I keep making my mom cry and I feel terrible

I had a conversation with my girlfriend and she told me that she’ll be fertile for a while longer and she got checked for it to make sure. She really wants to have a kid with me and she just thought 10 months is long enough cause she’s never been in a relationship that lasted this long in her life. 

She agreed and accepted my decision to not rush the relationship. Me and her are gonna keep having safe sex and she’s gonna stop thinking about us getting married right now. 

I still want to do something very special for her but not something that’s too generic or expected. She said she’s gonna do something with me on my birthday this year so I want to do something in return. Any suggestions ? ",15Jan2019,1
59,"Hello,

I was sitting with my friend (M) today doing work when another person (M) came with this girl and said hello to my friend and they started talking. I have no clue who these people are. 

Somehow the conversation turns to someone passing gas lol and while I was busy working I overheard my friend's friend say ""it was that guy"" referring to me, jokingly. I ignored it, but do you guys I think I should have retaliated? I get it's a joke, but seeing as we are strangers to each other I don't think it's appropriate to talk about others like that, especially right in front of them. 

We were in a college building, with many people around us, and I don't think it's fair to cause a scene. I think if it's a one time it's better to ignore it, but if it kept happening with the sly insults then I should fight back. 

What do you guys think? Was it better I ignore someone in this case? Or should've spoken up and told this dude off. I suffer from anxiety issues as well so I understand if I come off as insecure. ",15Jan2019,1
60,"I’m trying to flesh out my feelings...

I’ve known my friend 2 years. First I tried to stay away because I knew I’d fall for her. First night of classes she came over and stuffed her number in my hand, said call me. So I did but she didn’t want to study like she said. Then I we we’re out early days, with a mutual friend and she was telling them that she’d never date inside the same school group, and looked at me. So I took it as a hint she wasn’t interested and pulled back, kept everything professional. Confusing I know.

Then she started asking me to do things and we ended up spending so much time together that I fell for her. There were a few months over the last year where we’ve had solid breaks from each other, I never stop thinking about her for more than a day, although my feelings fade a bit the moment I see her, BAM hit by a train...I just want to kid her and hold her and a million other things. But because I have self control I have her a hug.

I literally find almost no one attractive because of her, sometimes sexually. But okay, I have some eccentric tastes and she shares every single one, and humors 90% of my quirks. I always want to make her happy, I want to be honest and say you mean so much to me, but gnat would scare me so, I don’t.

I took her out a couple months ago hiking and while we we’re out she looked away from me and said “you know you should plan a trip sometime...and we can go together.” I did and she continues to say yes. Right at the beginning of December she suddenly said let’s go at new year, but I tried and all the stuff we planned was closed so no luck. Last week after about a month break from each other we just drank and talked for 6 hrs, and we’re having dinner Friday.

I’d want to see her every day if I could. It’s not that I just want to sleep with her, it’s that I also want her in my life. When I look at it from the point of view from other female friends I have, it’s completely clear cut, this isn’t normal for friendship. But when I spend time with her I feel frozen.

TL;DR: I have really strong feelings for my friend and just think we’re spending too much time together. I don’t know how to tell her when I’m in so deep and she do important to me. I mean we’ve said we’ll still be together in 10 years. I want to tell her that I’d like more, but don’t want to lose her. I don’t know what to do.

61,"Hey everyone. Something’s been on my mind a lot lately and I figured it might feel good to get it all down and possibly hear some other people’s input. Some quick background about me: I am 26 years old and I ended a 4 year relationship almost exactly 1 year ago. I have a full time job that I love and I have some good friends and exercise regularly, eat decently well etc. Lately I find myself feeling anxious about finding a girlfriend. I have thoughts like: “I’m getting close to marriage age so I should find someone soon” and “If I don’t find someone soon all of the good ones will be taken”. I feel like it puts a lot of internal mental stress on me subconsciously. I’ve been trying to just live my life and enjoy myself with friends, hobbies etc. I’ve taken up some new hobbies and group activities that I really enjoy— but every so often the anxious feeling and thought about finding someone comes back. I often find myself wondering if I need to be proactive about finding someone or if I should just “let it happen”. I’ve lately been trying to adopt the mindset of letting life take its course, but i also worry that if I don’t take action to try and meet someone, that I never will. If anyone has some advice or life experience to share that they feel is helpful, i would appreciate it :)",15Jan2019,1

64,"Hi, (m20) I live by myself and have a 1.5 yr old ball of energy (my dog). Until now I have attended college full time while working part time on the weekends and have been able to take great care of my pup because I spend just about all of my free time at home with her.

I am working in public accounting this spring as an intern and then finishing up school in the summer and fall. For those who don't know, spring is the busy season in public accounting and I'll be working as much a lot, being away from home for 12-13 hours at a time most days of the week. The money is going to be fantastic but I'm worried how this is going to effect my dog. I've had her since she was 8 weeks and she is truly my best friend, and I am hers as well.

She gets anxiety when I am away even if she is with other people such as my sister if I ask her to watch her. For this reason I can't leave her out of her crate when I am gone because she destroys everything, and I mean everything, but only when I'm gone.

I am looking for suggestions on solutions to this problem and am pretty much open to anything other than rehoming. This internship lasts until April but I plan to graduate and will hopefully get a full time job right after. The busy season only lasts January-april so all other months would only be 40 hour work weeks. ",15Jan2019,1
65,"Let me tell you what happened. It’s kinda long I’m sorry. 

So about a year ago in February I met a guy on Tinder(to me it isn’t important how me met), he was 24, I was 20. We started talking and instantly clicked, even just by texting I felt a really strong connection. About a week after texting all day long we decided to met, he told he would come pick me up and take me out to dinner. I went outside and I remembered I was so nervous cause he has really handsome. 
Anyways when we got to the restaurant/bar we talked a little bit and then about 5 minutes he told me “your eyes are so beautiful” and kissed me. I know mayor red flag. The whole night he kept kissing me, I got kind of tired of it so I just started asking him random things, he was so weird, he talked to me about his crazy ex and his obsession with porn when he was a teenager. He was just weird but I liked it, he was different.
We went out a couple of times after that and I swear I could feel that he liked me a lot, like for real.  He made me dinner on Valentine’s Day and just things a guy has never done for me before. We never had sex even though he insinuated it a couple of time. Also I didn’t want to pressure him into a relationship cause I knew he didn’t want to, he had just broken up with his ex. 

About a week later I noticed he started to act really strange, so I asked him what was wrong and he told me he wanted to tell me in person, I didn’t feel like it so I asked him to tell me over text. 

So basically we went out on a Friday morning and that night he had a reunion with his old school, he told me that he saw a lady friend that day and he felt things he had never felt for her and they kissed, and basically told me he wanted to be with her. The thing is he started crying when he told me this and said he was so sorry that he hurt me but that he really liked me and was falling for me. He said we could remain friends but I just couldn’t. 
To what I know they never dated or he hasn’t had a gf since. 

We haven’t really talked since, I added him on Instagram a couple of months back and he followed me back.

I have a boyfriend, we’ve been together for 6 months and he loves me so much, but sometimes I just don’t feel the same and it confuses me a lot.  So one nail drives out another hasn’t really worked. 

Idk I know it’s been a long time and I should just get over it but it still hurts to know how easy I can be replaced. 

Any advice would be helpful, thank you. ",15Jan2019,1

67,"Hello,

I am in the position to move out within the next 6 months. I have a couple options here:

1. I could move out within the next 6 months and rent a house. 

2. I could save up for 6 months after the previously mentioned 6 months, and I could have about $10,000, which would be a 5% down payment on a $200,000 house. 

Some things to consider are that I really, really want to move out of my parents’ house. Also, a $200,000 house wouldn’t be that great of a house around where I live, and it’d almost certainly have to be an old one that could have lead paint for all I know. 

The only reason that I want to save for a house is because now is the only time I’d be able to save almost my whole pay. 

I’m curious, will this work out? Will I actually be able to get a house once I’ve saved, or will it all be in vain? I’m a 22 year old male, and my credit score is around 760 on both Transunion and Equifax, according to credit karma. What will the payments be like? I make around $2,300 a month.

I recently began taking driving lessons from a local instructor. Yesterday, I finished my third lesson and completed the required six hours behind the wheel training. However, I don't feel comfortable continuing lessons under the instructor.  Over the course of three lessons, I still can not grasp the basics of driving such safely making turns. Because of this, my instructor gets frustrated and constantly berates me. For example, he would say that I don't practice and that I don't  listen, which is partially true, but can be justified. I don't practice because to my parents don't let me drive outside of lessons. And as far as not listening, I do, but it takes me a while to process and remember since I am anxious during lessons. I would try to explain this to him, but he just ignores me and says that I'm a loser for always making excuses. He would also occasionally hit the door, slap his leg, and even threaten to drop me as his student. This constant berating affects my ability to focus because I get overwhelmed and emotional for not being able to drive as well as other beginners. At the end of the day, I feel highly discouraged and emotional. I have three more lessons with him and don't really want to learn go. He is also supposedly an acquaintance of my father and I don't know how this will affect their relationship. Reddit, what should I do in this situation?

So im midway through my research at least when I hear a nock on my door. Bear in mind its boarding school so no locks. My brain goes into a panic mode i jump up, shut my lap top. All while trying to stand and pull my pants up. My english teach Mrs.M opens the doors without me saying ok. I dont have my pants on yet but my long shirt i was going to sleep in. I froze like an idiot to not be obvious. But didint get all my research in my “bag”. I was then lectured for then next fee minutes about being up past hours. I got the impression she saw my research because she never really looked at it. I pretended like there wasnt any.

No one really clicked and exchanged eye contact back to really tell they were the interviewer. So i sit there for another 45 minutes waiting for the interviewer assuming they have forgotten. So i email them back to tell them I could not find them and I would like to meet them again. They then say they were there all along talking to some other student. Now I feel awkward and dumb when I realize that person was the interviewer the whole time and I did not take initiative or realize to ask. Should I still go to another interview even though it looks really bad on my part to not have recognized them or even tried to ask?? ,15Jan2019,1
89,"About 6 years ago I moved from my hometown near Chicago to Nashville. I did this because I wanted to Go back to school and pursue a new career in audio engineering. Both the school and the city are well known in terms of the music and entertainment industries. I finished my bachelors and masters in 5yrs and then started working at the job I'm at now.   


Also, about 2.5yrs ago I met my current girlfriend who I've lived with for a little over a year. For the most part our relationship is great. However, recently some things have changed with her job and it doesn't look like our relationship is going to work out.   


I'm not really a big fan of my current job and I'm in the processes of finding something new. I also always had plans to grow my freelance business as an audio engineer and producer, which I've have some mild success doing for a few years. Originally we planned to move into a house during the summer which I would use part of as a studio helping me expand my business. I always felt that Nashville would be a good place to do this because of it's thriving music scene and large supply of great talent.   


Given that I am new to the area, I don't really have a friends or family. Really just 1 friend good friend other than my GF (who is very busy), which makes the inevitable break up that much harder. I also would no longer be able to afford a home on my own.  


All of this has caused me to re-evaluate my plans. I have decided I have two choices.   


1) I can either stay in an apartment in Nashville, look for a new job, and take a shot at the music business as a producer/engineer later on when I can afford a house. The negatives would be that I will have a constant reminder of my GF and a feeling of loneliness since I have no family or friends here. The positive is that it is a good city for me to try and build my dream of being a self-employed engineer/producer and it's cheaper   
2) Or I can move back to my hometown where I have many friends and family, and find a new job there. I can also still attempt to pursue a music career, it would just be a slightly less ideal city. It's also a little bit more expensive.

91,"So here’s the story. I’m in high school, and I’m friends with these two Mexican girls. We’ll call them girl A and B. The first one (girl A) has had an obvious crush on me for sometime, as I can tell when I interact with her and I’ve also heard it through various threads. The other girl (girl B) is someone I’ve liked for a bit, and I think she likes me too. Basically girl A heard from someone that I had a thing for girl B, and asked me if this was true and if we were dating. Being a pretty honest guy I told her it was, but that we weren’t dating or anything. She then replies with “that’s cute, but she doesn’t date white guys anyway” (I’m white). She then goes on to list a few reasons why I wouldn’t be good enough for this girl, and it seems pretty obvious that this could be jealousy-related. Anyway, that hurt a bit but whatever. However, now girl B, the girl I like, isn’t responding to my texts and I’m starting to worry that girl A has said something to her that’s untrue and/or to make her mad at me and ruin what we have. I’m not sure how to handle this, and would like some advice. 
(Yes I know this is very cliche, and as most of you are adults this is probably a very petty and meaningless problem. But I’m young and don’t have a lot of relationship experience, so I’m at a loss for what to do).",15Jan2019,1

Recently, an online friend if mine supposedly fell into a coma due to what he said was a gunshot. I do not know wether he is telling the truth, but he went on to say cryptic messages about the people he was involved with and how I, who lives in a completely different country, could be in trouble if I knew what was happening with him.
I honestly don't know what to do as I tried pressing for answers even though I felt like I shouldn't, all the while not knowing wether what he had told me was the truth as he had, every couple of months, mentioned how he got into fights and almost always was able to win, even saying how he was in a car crash not too long ago.
I'm afraid to think that he is not telling the truth, but I am also afraid that he is and I want to be able to do something about this. We have been friends for over a year by now and I truly don't know what to say or do...",15Jan2019,1
95,"I've debated for weeks to ask for advice on this matter.  Honestly I'm not sure if I'm able to help this coworker.

We work on a small workforce team (4 total), managing 250 employees.  I've been in my position for almost 2 years.  In November 2 of our teammates moved on to other opportunities and we hired 2 new people at the same time.

1 a man the other a woman and the woman (Susie) was helping with us on side tasks prior to getting the position.  At first Susie was amazing, kind and considerate- going above and beyond to show interest in how to perform a task.

Were nearly 3 months into her working with us and everyday her behavior gets worse.  At first they were small comments such as, ""I wanted to ask what the other teammates do as it seems like they don't do anything.""

Questions like that came up often where I would reassure her that all members are working together (one was as new as her).  We started them both off small giving them projects to do to fill their time and grow their skills.

About a month ago, I noticed she was breaking down in tears often at work.  She would make comments about how no one was noticing all the amazing ideas she was coming up with.  I talked to her almost nightly and encouraged her to keep down the same path.

I told her she was doing great things and she often received recognition for her work, ideas and overall contribution to our team.  Recognition came in many forms: awards, gift cards, thank you cards, candy baskets, free lunches and kudos in meetings.

To attempt to make this short I'll get to the last week.  She continues to come into work with an attitude.  This is expressed by her short and often rude comments.  Now that we've been working with her for months now we see the signs.  She gets flustered quickly and will (for lack of a better phrase) blow up.

Last week in a meeting after a coworker commented on appreciating the opportunity to lead a meeting (that she was included on) she broke down in tears and had to leave the meeting for 10 mins.

Our manager pulled her into a conference room and talked to her for an hour.  When she returned it was my time to leave and she walked out with me to my car staring she has reached her breaking point with our other newbie Paul.  I asked lots of questions and suggested it maybe a misunderstanding although she disliked that comment and grew angry.

Today she argued with the team about which team mate was to the ""left"" of her.  I'm not kidding whatsoever.  She claimed that from her angle she was to my right however it didn't matter and our team was only trying to explain that when going in order of our seats she was technically to my left as we face away from each other.

She became hostile and made comments like ""next time you should explain directions before you tell me the person to my left...""  we were assigning tasks and my boss said get with the person to.your left and we were all sitting at our desks when this occurred.

Lastly, during another meeting where we were learning new possibilities she told the trainer she would complete the task at home later tonight. The issue is we're all still learning and it would be better if everyone had a chance to perform the duty at least once in front of our trainer.  

When I informed her I felt our manager would want us to work together she again grew angry and made comments like ""oh,, okay well we can waste more time tomorrow.""  I explained it's not a waste f time when were all learning. 

I understand more than ever after these last 2 weeks that shes looking to ""do more"" to gain the recognition.  And that's not how people more forward at our job.  I honestly don't know why she makes things so difficult.  She started to cry again before I left today saying ""I'm just going to stay and work a little longer"".  

Am I missing something here?",15Jan2019,1
96,"this literally just happened.. ..

But my dad can only focus on the low Cs. He didn’t even tell me that he was proud of me. I just feel like a loser, even though I know I’m not.

100,"So my dad and I bought a house on the ""bad"" side of town (it's just a really ugly looking neighborhood) with his girlfriend and everything has been alright so far. The neighbors we have except for two all have each other's numbers, there's a neighborhood watch that we're reestablishing, all around good people. Well, that was until this guy came around. He was wonderful at first, he and his mother own a thrift store down the road and they lent us so many items and furniture to help us get off of our asses (lost almost everything in the move due to bug infestation) and watched the house when nobody is home. Now that we finally got the power on, got the internet going and the security cameras up, his help isn't needed anymore but he still insists to come over. My step mom and dad allow this to happen, because he's like 24-26 and has nothing really going for him at the moment so he comes here to do his school work. He was kind, like too kind, then things just got.. Weird... So NYE, I get a little drunk because why not, I'm at home and didn't want to drive, and he came over. I stayed away from him initially because I wanted time to myself to reflect on the past year and make mental notes of what not to do, but he kept checking on me. Eventually, I go upstairs and watch the ball drop and then I head off to bed for work the next morning. He comes into my room, sits on my bed and says ""we need to talk... I think you need to hear it"", so I pop my head out of the blanket and say ""what?"", his reply: ""I want to let you know that if C*** isn't licking your (dirtiest word for vagnia known to man) that I will gladly do it with a smile on my face""
I looked at him funny and said ""get out""
Next morning, I'm walking to the bus stop (another story, didn't know busses didn't run that day) and he comes running up to me. This is where a part of my soul just dies. This dude seriously thinks I'm going to have sex with him. He won't leave me the fuck alone. He kept talking to my deaf ear, seeing I had earbuds in AND ACKNOWLEDGING IT, but KEPT TALKING. NOW IT'S DAILY! He follows me everywhere! He runs into my house all the time, he never knocks on doors, he just walks in! He stole my birth control and told me ""good luck"" knowing I'm sexually active, he comes into my room while I'm sleeping, he laid on my bed when I was sleeping and got pissed when I ran out. I told my parents but they completely ignore me, they told me that he doesn't mean harm, I'm over exaggerating, but nobody just FOLLOWS YOU AROUND FOR 6 BLOCKS WHEN YOU'RE WALKING YOUR DOG. I have tried to get a DVP on him but since he hasn't physically harmed me with a police report showing so, there is nothing they want to do.

So as the title says, my dad has an anime-style visual novel downloaded to his PC that from what I understand, has a lot of sexual content and emphasis on fetishes in particular, and it's really really weird to me, especially my mom and dad are married, and as far as I know, aren't planning on divorcing or anything, but he'll sometimes just play the game when my mom is watching TV in the other room and me and my siblings are at home, and will flick to another tab whenever somebody comes by to hide what he's doing. 

I probably wouldn't have given it a second thought if it weren't for me seeing a scene in the game for about a second where a woman's boobs were exposed, but it's really starting to weird me out, especially since I found out the name of the game the other day when I had to use the computer for printing, googled it and found out more, and now I just can't get it out of my head for some reason. I kinda half-expected him to like porn, being a grown man and all, and I'm pretty indifferent to porn myself, but knowing he likes hentai and visual novels in particular is just a bit weird to me, especially one that covers as much 'territory' as the one he plays does, and I just don't know how to feel about it. 

I feel like I need to talk to someone about this, and I thought about asking my mom about it but I feel like it's just going to create a very awkward conversation between me and whoever I talk to about it, especially if that person is a family member who knows my dad and I don't know if I'm ready for that, or what will come after.

When I started college, I was at a different university studying pre-medical science. I was very depressed at this school and hated it, especially because I am type one diabetic and it was a huge party school, it felt like I had nothing to do ever...and then going into second semester my best friend of 13 years (who was also at school with me) was killed in a car accident. I freaked out and changed my major to business because I just wanted something easier and less daunting. My head was in the wrong place. I ended up coming home because I became so depressed. I began to take classes at a local college. Things then got worse, as I became so depressed that I developed an eating disorder and was then hospitalized for anorexia. I was still taking classes and doing OK in them at the time. I then transferred back to a big college, with renewed hope for medical school after being in rehabilitation. I got to school and found myself working with animals out of therapeutic purposes all the time, volunteering at vet centers and rescue shelters just for fun. I then concentrated my major (biology, I switched back from business) in zoology, because it felt nice to get to work with animals medically. I thought that was it. I'm now in crisis mode because I have a pang in my stomach that is telling me to go to medical school, but college has been a big fuck up for me. I tanked my GPA to a 3.2, I've been all over the place and am now a junior (feel like I've wasted so much time), I barely have any shadowing hours/volunteer (despite volunteering at a hospital two summers ago and shadowing a pediatric oncologist), and I just feel like I can't make it at this point.

118,"I don’t know if this is considered a legal issue or not but here it goes. I am in an online Master’s course and it’s my last class. Every week there are two discussions where each student must write their post to the discussion prompt and to facilitate a discussion, other students must respond to each other’s posts by Monday (12 a.m.) There are only three people, including myself, in the class and to receive points for the week’s discussions, besides posting my response by Thursday, I have to respond to both of the other students on Monday the latest and vise versa. The problem is one of them is late on their original discussion posts and puts them up on the forum on Monday evenings where I have to scramble to respond in order to get my full points. They are probably not getting a full score for the discussion since they’re posting their original discussion response late, but what irritates me is that I am having to continue doing school work at night time due to their tardiness. 
HERE’S THE KICKER :
I noticed that they were posting both of their original responses to the discussion question rather quickly. The work is also exceedingly well written. Even more, this person is responding to other people’s post very quickly. I got suspicious and I decided to copy their discussion post responses and the responses to classmates on Google and everything has been plagiarized. I mean almost verbatim to where 95% has been copied and pasted without citing the article they’re getting it from and are only citing the references that the author mentions within their work. I began to go through the previous weeks posts and sure enough everyone of that person‘s responses have been plagiarized. I don’t know how they are getting away with it without the teacher catching on, but it may be because we only have plagiarism software to check weekly paper assignments. So evidently the person is plagiarizing everything else but their assignments because that’s the only work we have to turn in where software is used to detect it. I have even had a few past classes with this person and looked at their other discussion responses from those and sure enough, they are plagiarized as well. I don’t want to be a jerk, but this person is making my life difficult by having to work late in the evenings to respond to their plagiarized responses so I can get my full points. Besides that, I work hard and it’s not fair (I know life is unfair) to me and the other classmate to have someone stealing someone else’s work and claiming it as their own. It makes me want to notify the professor of their activity. This is the last class of the Master’s program and it would be a pretty big dick move to do. Should I just attempt to directly email the student and tell them it would be wise to stop plagiarizing, tell the professor, or leave it alone?

When I talk to him sometimes, it’s like he is not aware, sometimes he answers one minute later, like information process time. Now it’s getting worst, he’s saying nonsense in an angry way, saying he has mics in his head, people with talkie walkie messing intentionally with the frequency of his mic, saying local radio does that too, all that is the evil plan of the judge that sentenced him etc lot of nonsense, thinking people want to harm him. 

He was under strong medication behind bars, like things that almost made him a vegetable, all the time sleeping or feeling weak, that’s why he hates pills.

He is not living in reality, doesn’t want to hear about going to a doctor or taking medication. Only thing he wants is to talk to a lawyer cause he wants to sue the people that put a mic in his head... sounds like paranoia. 

If it happened around you, how to get someone like this to see a doctor without having to physically force him ?

For now he’s cool with me cause I’m the one who doesn’t treat him like he’s crazy and hates my other brother who told him straight that his story was crazy. I feel like I need to find a way soon before he hurts himself or someone else, even tho he’s not violent, don’t want to take that risk.

It feels like this has happened to me again.

My friend’s (25 F) been dating this dude (30 M) for 6 weeksish + he had a nervous break on her. Lying, saying he was in the military, he was going to die before she saw him next, he cursed at her + blamed her for her past sexual abuse, said very perverse things about her lady parts to her while in this rage, etc.

Days later she finds out it’s bc he has bipolar. His dad died suddenly last year + he got out of a long term relationship... I feel for him. BUT he doesn’t want to medicate his bipolar or see a therapist or any form of help... That’s scary no? He had no memory of his fugue state + I’m confused why someone w that diagnosis wouldn’t at least pursue help? Isn’t that a liability for work and everything else?

I was her should to cry on during this. But now weeks later it seems they are back together and she isn’t really talking to me.. it has me worried and sad that she doesn’t feel she can talk to me about it.

I have to work over the next couple years to save up for more school, but I have absolutely zero  experience, zero references, and no significant skills. With a resume as blank as mine, I’ll probably end up making minimum wage. However, my partner insists that I should aim for higher paying jobs because I’ll have a four year degree with a good gpa. How realistic is this? From what I’ve heard, having a BA with no experience is essentially the work equivalent to just having a high school degree, so I’m hesitant to get my hopes up. ",15Jan2019,1
126,"So my girlfriend learned this year she may not graduate unfortunately. She is stressed about what will happen after this school year ends, I guess she talked with someone who was in the Navy today who told her she could retire in 20 years and be living great with a lot more money than the average person working full time.

She does not want to join the Navy and I don't want her to either as I couldn't imagine being away from her for months or years on end after we have already been in a long distance relationship for a year. Thankfully we will be living together in May, she seems to think that the Navy will provide her with a lot more money than if she got a full-time career after going to college.

She said that no college would accept her if she didn't graduate, even though she could do an online school and retake her senior year and most likely graduate early then go to college, she seems to think her only option now is to join the military and every time I try to discuss it further with her she says that she said she isn't going to and doesn't want to talk about it anymore. I trust her but I also stress a lot about little things, I do believe her but my mind won't let me stop stressing.

I couldn't be away from her or dealing with her being away for months on end after us already being in a long distance relationship for a year, I love her more than anything and want to support her but I don't want her to join the Navy when she doesn't want to because she thinks she is at Rock bottom because she didn't graduate high school. It wasn't even her fault that she isn't graduating, the school messed up her schedule. What do I do? What options could I tell her about that will actually prove to her that she can be successful still? Does the Navy really pay all that much? She is EXTREMELY talented in art, painting and drawing, is there anything she could do with her talent, something she loves to do that would pay her a good bit I can tell her about? She also loves makeup, both casual makeup and stuff that would be used in movies, similar to that show Face Off on Syfy is there anything she could do with that? Anything I can say to her to prove that the military isn't the only option? I just can't stand the thought of her being away for so long for 20+ years and I know that if she joined she would see that the Navy isn't actually as amazing as people say it is. My uncle thinks I will be a failure because I didn't join the Navy when I am going to school for Computer Science which I know will pay better than the military.",15Jan2019,1

I felt really sick, and my heart dropped into my stomach instantly, and knowing i’m an emotional guy I cried shortly after. She was the first girl out of many who I’d genuinely like for once and I knew what we had was real. I haven’t spoken to both my friend and the girl for around 2 weeks now.

135,"Spanish guy writing so be careful with grammatical errors!

So how do I start, In my 8th grade I started dating this girl wich we are going to called Miranda, we started daiting but never really knew each other, we just knew we liked each other as a friend and then people started to talk about stuff so we just went with it I guess.

With this relationship I felt more anxious than loved but its easy to see the problems when you see back on a broken relationship, and there is ton to be found.

We started doing kinky stuff even if we were underaged wich I knew and know is wrong but we did it anyway cause we were dumb little kids, looking back I feel kind of manipulated, even if I was into it and she looked like she loved me, I cannot help but feel like she used me just to experiment a boyfriend, and I dont make this assumption out of my head, I asked her about our situation and she said that ""we are going to break up one day"" and even if it is and it was true, it still hurts and makes me feel like if she just looked at me as a temporary thing.

After a year and a few months, she broke up with me, told me it wasent the same and a lot of things that I found to be true, so I didnt give any problems and just accepted that we were done, as much as I wanted to keep a straight face through the day, I couldnt help but feel misserable.

Next day I go to school, she hugs me and touches my hair and I just cant help but feel sick, she makes me feel like shit and then just does like if we werent nothing, and even if she is the kind of friendly person, I found it really weird that she did this to me the next day we broke up.

A few day pass and I call her out on what the fuck she is doing because even my friends were confused, she tells me that her parents told her that ""she cannot love someone else if she doesnt love herself"" and I say that she should re-think this and decide.

Next class, we are together again as a couple, and just feel misserable again, she told so many reasons why we werent meant to be and now she is here again, I gave her the option and I dont know why I did.

After realising all of this shit, I decide to break up with her and end with this, she cries and Im sad, but its for good, or thats what I thought, few day passes and she starts throwing shit at me with her friends, and this just heart breaks me cause I didnt do shit when she broke up with me and I just felt awful.

And after that happened, I didnt say anything, I didnt stand up or talked with my friends, anything, and I regret it so much.

School is over, we go home, vacations, back to school and she acts like everything is okay, and I act like everything is okay, and my friends talk and laugh with her, and sometimes I do too and feel sick and horrible, her friends treat me like a friend sometimes and everytime someone has asked me about me and her I just say that we are fine but Im not, and I hate it so much but how could I say this to her, something that happened over a year ago, and now I gotta be with her for 2 years more.

We also went to a camp with our class and said some nice words meanwhile we did a circle on the fire and she said ""I hope you all have a great time and if I ever did you wrong, please forgive me, cause I want to be there for you""
and this just made me anxious, is she talking about me? What is she is not? If she is thinking about someone else then that makes me angrier cause that means she think she did nothing wrong to me that time?

Anyway, if you guys want more details about this tell me but my question is: 
What do I do?

136,"So this year has started off in the worst way for my family. On the 2nd day of the new year, we experienced a death in the family. The death in question was my mother's boyfriend of 6 or 7 years now. He unfortunately suffered from a heart attack.

So for some background information.

I live with my grandparent's and my mom lived with her boyfriend for a few years now. Everyone got along great, but that's not the focus of this post.

With the passing of my mothers boyfriend, it left a huge rift that my mother alone cannot fill. She cannot afford the place she is at and is at risk of getting kicked out. Her landlord is pressing her so he can start showing others the house she is in. My mom is practically losing all of her belongings and more because she just cannot afford all of it. They had 2 dogs and my mom is unwilling to part with them which is going to put an even greater financial burden on her.

Recently I had a thought. What if I were to move in with her. It would put me back on being independent and moving out on my own for a few more years but I cannot let my mom suffer alone. 

Should I offer to move in with her for awhile or would there be a better option possibly that I dont see. (Also, sorry if my story is scattered. I'm bad at telling stories.)

A few quick concerns to state:

I'm nervous of what will happen, if I do choose to move in with her, in a few years I decide to move out, what if she still cannot afford it. This might sound selfish, but I dont want to be held back a majority of my life because of this. I want to help but I'm frozen with indecisiveness and need advice.

139,"This post could get long, so I'll spare you the details.

Long story short, life started off good. I was accepted to grad school. The next thing you know, I start meeting up and eventually meet my then girlfriend, now wife. 

She got me arrested and charged with a felony that no, I did not commit. She claims she wasn't the one who ever claimed to call the police on me, etc. Long story short, I was given probation with a chance to have it dismissed (however, not expunged, which is about as catch 22 as it gets).

I was thus kicked out of school. I now have close to $200,000 worth of debt with an 8.9% annual interest rate, with no degree, credentials, and nothing to show for. And in case you are to ask me if I can use any of these credits or re-enroll in such the program, sadly, the answer is no. I've checked with several lawyers on this matter and it's hopeless at this point.

 I now am on probation, have no degree, am being supported by my parents (as well as my wife and child), and am going back to school.

I'm to graduate in accounting this December. Things are supposed to be turning for the better now, right? Wrong. First off, the state board can literally deny me the right to become a CPA which would become so depressing, considering it's a huge accomplishment in both prestige and pay. 2)It will cost me eight to ten thousand dollars just to hire an attorney to defend me before the board. And 3) I'm bored in all of my classes and cannot see myself doing this for the rest of my life. It is more boring than watching paint dry, although I seem to be average in my classes.

It's pathetic that I'm being supported, went from almost being established to being completely dependent, and not being able to muster the strength to work because my deepest sentiments are that life should be much more than clocking in for somebody else at the expense of your time and life just for minimal pay. 

I don't know where I'm going with this, but deep down, this is an honest cry for help. If it wasn't for my religion, I'm quite sure I'd be down under right now rather than typing out this Reddit post.

147,"I'll try to make this as clear as possible, but essentially my wife and I are looking for some advice on how to handle a situation as we plan our baby girl's first birthday.

My wife wants to have a big get together for the party, primarily other friends with kids, other couples, some people from work, etc, and family - her parents, and my parents (divorced, both re-married, step-parents to come as well). We are looking at 40ish people, so we need to rent a hall for the party. 

The first complicated matter is my mother and father do not get along that well (he's nonchalant, she makes issues out of nothing), even though they've been divorced over 3 decades. My mother won't make a scene, but finds things to complain about to anybody who will listen.

The second complicated matter is one hall we are considering - it's wildly large enough to host 50-60, in great shape, and is extremely reasonable in price. It checks off all the boxes we need and then some, and it's run by a local non-profit.

My wife gave my mother a courtesy heads up on the plans (if she doesn't know she tends to get upset and criticize a lot) and my mother rose a big stink about how her work is related to the non-profit and she doesn't want anybody knowing her family connection to my wife and I (we could care less). To not give too much away, my mother's work is related to a cultural group of people, and the non-profit is run by the same cultural group.

Our concern is that it's being blown out of proportion - the rental would be on a weekend, when the centre is closed, and would be the only private booking - and in our name, not hers. She says that she won't go to the birthday party if it's at this specific hall.

My wife is upset that her MIL is trying to control everything and is taking our best option off the table, for what we perceive to be as a non-existent issue. We'd be more apt to consider her concerns if they could be reasonably articulated, but at this point we don't get it at all, and want the focus to be on family time with our little girl.

160,"Let me start off by introducing myself. I'm a 20 year old guy from Brazil who studies Law (about to begin my 4th semester in a month), really likes videogames and has a loving girlfriend. I'm gonna try to cut the bs and not make this any longer than it has to be... So basically I'm only here 1 reason: I don't know what I should do! Like... literally!

I have recently started an instagram page because I thought it could be fun and maybe I could grow it up to monetize it, but I just realized how much time consuming and psychologically annoying it is to gain followers and maintain the page. It reached a bit over 1k followers but it doesn't have that much engagement (people don't comment or like as much) so now I'm kinda drifting away from it. My trouble is figuring out what kind of useful and productive activity I could resort to. I've thought about doing YouTube, but then couldn't decide on a niche. Music but I can't play instruments. Other ideas for instagram but... it's just so shallow. I've done a very tiny bit of streaming on Twitch in the past and actually quite enjoyed it, but I'm not nearly as motivated by gaming as I used to be 2+ years ago.

Maybe my problem isn't something other people can help me with, but if you have been where I am now, let me know. Give me some light on the subject. Is there anything I can do to try a bit of everything? From music, to instagram, to youtube or twitch, etc. I guess my goal is to be productive with my time during my holidays (and subsequently throught the year if it works!) and earn some money/develop skills.

Also, I don't mean to brag and I hope I don't sound like a jerk but I see myself as a fast learner, and as someone who could really go far in life. I think I will. I hope so. But right now I can only count on your advice. Sorry for the long post, I'm pretty lost.",15Jan2019,1
161,"TL;DR: Grandma is in hospital (not life threatening), dad's siblings not pitching in to help.  


If you're in elderly care, family counselling/mediation- I would appreciate some realistic input.   


So some time back, my grandma got hit by a car. She's 87.   
 TLDR&lt; it means her hip is busted and she's gone for 2 surgeries to fix it. She spent about 1 month or so in the hospital, and now stays in a community hospital home to recuperate. 

She has been nothing but difficult.   
\- she refuses to eat hospital food

\- demands we visit her EVERYDAY- if we don't, she calls up the relatives abroad to lament that she's miserable and wants to die

\- wants us to bring her contrabrand meds- refuses hospital meds at times

\- misses rehab/physio sessions because she's lazy and refuses to walk to get better

  


Because my aunt/uncle are abroad, the bulk of the work falls to my dad. His youngest sister can't cope with the work (bringing grandma for appointments, buying food, bringing meds etc) because she's lazy and also has a mental health issue. Her husband is rich, so she's never worked a day in her life, and squanders his money away. She claims she helps him in his work even though she doesn't.   


She always pushes work to my dad and mom (recently retired and works on taking care of the house).  


My grandma was never kind to my family. She used to stay with us and it was a nightmare. She would use our domestic helper/cleaning lady to clean her friend's homes, she would THROW OUR UNDERWEAR ON THE FLOOR, claiming it brings bad luck, she would never treat me or my mom nicely, calling my mom an outsider and often trying to pitch my dad against her.  She also tried to commit suicide in the past and then demanded my mom take care of her, even though my mom had to take care of HER mom, who was dying (and died) of cancer. Her own children (grandma's i.e) all shirked the work/pushed it to my dad/mom.  


At this juncture, it's clear my dad and his siblings only put up with her because they are acting out of guilt so they can allay their consciences when she passes. But his siblings don't help! They just push the legwork to my dad, even though he has a fulltime job. They are all either unemployed/retired but use the excuse of living abroad ($200 for a round trip ticket to come here, btw) to shirk their responsibilities. They barely help with the bills. My dad has to pay for grandma's health bills out of HIS OWN HEALTH INSURANCE. My dad doesn't have amazing health either, having had open heart surgery and cancer in the past.   


But 'cos ""he's the oldest"" they've been pushing all the work to him, it's ridiculous.   


Right now I pay for all the bills in my household and am the main breadwinner, so i've offered to help my dad but he doesn't let me help, even though he's so fucking tired by the end of the day.   


  
What should I do????  
The background matters, so I've included the info below.  


BACKGROUND INFO:   
My dad is the oldest of 4 siblings- he works in sales and doesn't earn a lot and works from 9am-7pm everyday. He's very traditional and Asian, so he's always concerned with taking charge, saving face, looking good. He's always reluctant to accept help and isn't good with communicating his feelings, even when asked nicely.  
Here are the profiles of his siblings:  
The second oldest: his sister (migrated abroad)  
\- Bossy, aggressive and pushes work to my dad.

\- Has 4 children (all abroad)  
\- oldest is a bum  
\- second oldest is decent, has a family but is very busy with inlaws  
\- third is married to a tycoon but also too busy with inlaws

\- fourth is a firecracker and impulsively gets into relationships and is too caught up with their career  


The third oldest: his brother (migrated abroad)  
\- Passive aggressive, grumpy and loses temper easily. 

\- Has cut ties with people in the past and raged cold wars with family members that have lasted for decades. 

\- Has 2 children  
\- son (abroad) is the richest amongst all the other cousins and is grandma's favourite, but he doesn't do anything to help at all. 

\- daughter- has 4 young kids and husband is consumed with work

&amp;#x200B;

The youngest: sister

\- Mentally unstable- has had a drug problem in the past

\- Ridiculous temper and prone to outbursts of violence

\- Intensely selfish   
\- Lashes out and pushes all the work to my mom- even though she's unemployed and could help out, physically and financially (rich hubby)

\- Has 3 children: the two older ones work full time with their dad, the youngest is in high school.

Without going into a crazy amount of specifics, I recently started my dream career! I’m currently in month 9 of a 12 month contract. Knowing the hiring process in this field takes a while, I began throwing out my resume in anticipation of needing a new job in 3 months.

So an exciting career opportunity has come up that’s unfortunately created mostly stress for me. I’ve been offered a position that I would LOVE to take, but it requires me leaving my current job 2 months early... it’s clearly stated in my contract that I have the right to leave early, but I don’t want to create any bad blood or step in anyone’s toes. My current job has truly launched my career. They took a chance on my on I want to be loyal and honor my commitment. But this job offer is a good one that I’m scared to pass up.

What should I do? Leave my current job early and risk creating bad blood? Or honor my 12 month commitment and hope that my loyalty pays off?

I am a manager at a McDonald's restaurant and a few of my company's other stores are hiring at the moment. One store's restaurant manager used to be the 2nd top dog at my restaurant, and we know each other pretty well. 

The problem at hand: my gf has been out of work for a few months and definitely needs a job. She has worked at both a Subway and a trendy cafe in the past, she has great food service experience. A third store in the company has deemed her unsuitable for a job at their store for reasons unknown (got an interview, couple days later it was no bananas). Would it be appropriate to ask the first store I mentioned to at least give her an interview and see what they think? I was going to ask my boss if they would consider her at my location, but they already Unsuitable'd her application at my location (any McDonald's AU hiring managers would know Unsuitable'd). 

TL;DR: Considering asking a sister restaurant in the franchise to interview my gf, is it appropriate and if so how should i go about it.

172,"TL;DR at the bottom

Hello reddit, I'm making this a throwaway since I don't want family finding me. I'm not sure as in what options I have and I'm in such a sad and confused mind state and I can't think clearly. I've cried about 2 times today already. 

A little backstory or whatever, my parents are immigrants and they don't get many good jobs since they're not residents. My mom currently doesn't work or have a car but she wants to make income. My dad works at a restaurant but gets under payed and he has the position of 3 people. Bosses are total money hungry people from what I see. My parents are married but separated. I was born in the US. 

I live with my mom and 2 of my 3 brothers in a house but we rent. Landowners are jerks and annoying. Also, 3rd brother works at a camp and has everything paid for. Can't move with him. Went to college for a semester but can't afford it since my high-school self screwed up. FAFSA is a pain since mom doesn't have her ITIN renewed and brothers don't want to take us to the offices. My 2 brothers are money hungry-ish and I think they're bums. They're almost in their 30's working a regular job. 

My problem is that I'm 100 percent sure and know for a fact that my brothers will abuse of me financially once I get a job and they won't give a crap. I can try finding my ways to get to them and let them know they're wrong but out of my 19 years that I've tired talking to them or suggesting something, they never listen. I can tell my mom to tell them something, but they still won't listen. They also don't really talk to my dad, so that's a no as well. I don't know how to drive and don't have a car. Everyone is always busy and I never get a chance to learn. I'm still applying for jobs so I can start somewhere. I don't want to end up like them for sure.

On the other hand, my dad also rents but he's renting a room from someone's house. It's not that big and he's given me the option to move with him in that room. He has planned to pay everything for me while I gather myself and buy a house between the both of us. Doesn't seem like a bad idea, but I'm not sure about that since transportation could be a problem, depending on job hours.

I do plan to head back to college ASAP to get my masters in Psychology. I'm also talented and many people say I have potential. I do dream to become a rapper, but not your basic money, sex and hoes rapper but not also some crazy lyricist. Maybe something along the lines of catchy and influential rapper. I don't want to promote negative things. I also make beats and what not. I've competed several years in a religious competition and have gotten first place last year for a rap I did. A rich, entrepreneur wants to shoot a music video for my rap and told me to contact him whenever. I plan to enter the contest again this year and see if doors open.

All in all, I'm just not sure as in what to do. Sorry my thoughts are all scrambled and what not. I want to be successful and become a better person. I don't want to end up like my two brothers. What are my best options or what can you recommend me to do? Anything helps! Thank you for taking your time and reading this. It means the world to me. 

TL;DR
19, parents separated and immigrants, money hungry brothers will abuse me financially when I get a job, can't tell them crap, dad suggests to move with him, he pays all, we buy a house, college is expensive and I messed up in high school, I'm talented in music, not sure what to do or path to take. A lot more details if you read but ehh.

i just don't really feel hungry, and i can't eat much anymore. i understand that that's because of the ""shrinking stomach"" issue. i've tried to work with it, but i can't seem to fix anything.

on a daily basis, i have maybe a meal and a half, with a couple snacks. i have cereal for lunch (because it's the easiest thing to eat in a chaotic high school cafeteria setting), i have about half a dinner plate of food for dinner, and then i'll snack a bit in between.

i'm not even against the healthy shit. if someone gives me an apple or a carrot or something like that, i'll eat it. i like fruits and vegetables. however, i do often just eat what's available, usually just chips (tortilla chips, pita chips, etc.) or just some type of cracker.

179," 

First I am sorry for the long ass story and if this is the wrong place to seek what I am looking for.

So this goes back a long ways around 10 years ago and has honestly always been bothering me in multiple ways. With the new year starting I have decided to improve my life in every aspect possible and feel these demons should be addressed in other ways than me upset in my head. I myself am 28, still live with my mom whom I am very close to and her husband whom I am usually courteous of but blame for many of the negative moments I have had in my life. I suppose I finally bring this up because the two are arguing and I have been trying to be supportive for my mother but the truth is I have a lot of resentment in my heart as well and am confused because, I feel it conflicts with the kind and compassionate person I would like to be.

My story starts with the fact that my mom is one of my best friends as well. We are very close, talk about relationships, watch anime together, and generally try to spend at least 1 day a week with each other. When I was growing up my mother and father had a very divisive relationship. They seemed good for each other, my father was generally not violent, worked a respectable job as a programmer, and would cook dinner every day for us. They basically grew up with each other since they met when she was 16 and he was 19, my mom had me at 18 and together they put each other through college, bought a home, and eventually made it. My dad is a immigrant and choose to stay over going home to his country and has lived in the states ever since. However my father also had made it very clear he did not enjoy spending lofty time with either of us and would prefer to be working out. My dad has always been an athletic person and has had a problem dedicating much of his time to the sports. I can not blame him for this, I understand it is both his dream and his passion, however it did leave a drift between my parents as my mom is the type of person who needs to be loved. She blames it on her hard upbringing of being abused by her mother as a child, and in my opinion her father did not do very much to fix or save anything. Honestly the issue of my grandfather is also a divisive topic among my family as some members see him as the person who did everything he could for the family, while others see him as someone who enabled the abuse of basically everyone.

My mother and her current husband met 11 years ago at a bar. Some back story about him is he has 3 failed marriages, makes much less money than my mother, but he does generally give my mom the attention she needs. He's not a terrible guy, does not beat her or anything but I do feel like the relationship is toxic and has affected my life as well. He works around 20 hours a week, contributes 40k to my mom, she makes 3 time that, and does some of the harder house maintenance duties such as tending to the garden which admittedly is a nice garden but for the most part my mom cooks and cleans as well. The reason I feel their relationship is toxic however is he is quite controlling IMO, as when they got together my mom basically changed who her friends were, and what she did on the weekends. He works as a performer in the bar they met and she generally only goes to that bar when he works. For the past 10 years she basically has gone to the same bar to have fun while her husband works and has fun as well. What I feel was most toxic however was he forbade her from talking to my dad ever due to some jealousy I suppose but this has been very ingrained into her spirit. If she ever speaks to my dad she has to do so in secret. When I graduated high school and college (which is a whole other topic i'm resentful for Ill address in a moment) I had to celebrate with my parents separate. My mom would not even take a picture with my dad when I graduated college in fear that her husband would be upset. (This was 3 years ago and it still hurts me to this day) The nature of how they got together is also a issue I have resentment for as I blame the guy for basically splitting up my parents. My mom had cheated on my dad before they split up which made him go through a tough time dealing with alcohol and suicide which I tried my best to be there for my dad. A few days ago my mother and I had a conversation about cheeting which I told her was trash and said anyone who cheats can do nothing to justify it, and in terms of relationships are trash. I think this hurt her and she got really defensive about the issue, but also admitted that she would not have the courage to move on and seek her own happiness if she did not have her current husband to support her emotionally during the time. Hence why I understand it was both my mother and father's fault their relationship failed, I still blame him.

So most recently they started arguing due to her husband wanting to see his son graduate from bootcamp. From my understanding my mother offered him many times to purchase him a plane ticket to see his son graduate but he refused until the last minute when the plane ticket was twice as expensive. This had upset her as they just got back from a trip to NYC, she offered multiple times, and I suppose overall feels taken advantage of. They had plans to see him a few months from now and My mother offered to purchase his ticket now in exchange of the future trip but she states he said he would go to both weather she likes it or not and he would leave her if she has any problems with it. My mom calling him in his bluff told him to do whatever he wants which he responded that he is tired of her being controlling of him, that the ticket was only $1000 so he did not understand what the big deal was, that she would not understand since it was his son and not me, and that they would have the cash if she was not as supportive of me as she has been and told her to make me live with my dad so that they would have the cash. (I understand I am a failure when it comes to becoming an adult and am working on it) Fortuneatly for me she has defended me stating she has spent more money on him in their 10 year relationship than she has on me in my entire life. I am not sure how true it is but my friend and I do routinely reference the ""cheddar biscuit"" joke from the Boondocks as in the past 10 years he has gone to Europe twice, Hawaii twice, Amsterdam, Spain, and many more places. Both my father and I have never been to any of these places which is also sort of a source of resentment for myself. Growing up I was always told my college would be taken care of so it became kinda a shock when I was told that I could not go to the college I wanted, had to pay on my own, and was fortunate that my mother was helping me out by letting me live rent free. (Which is true, that is very helpful) but that somehow does not erase the fact that this dude got to enjoy all the perks of my mothers hard work while I had to struggle during college. My mom would say she would help me out more if I quit smoking weed which to be fair I did not and understand where she is coming from in that regard. I did not start smoking weed until after the divorce though and feel that it made me much less anxious and upset at the time and sort of just turned into a habit. (I have not smoked in around a month since I decided to make my life better this year). However for many years these facts made me very salty towards my mother who cheated on my father and abandoned my educational progress so she could IMO spoil this dude who I felt was very toxic.

Yesterday he stated he would find an apartment, which today he returned saying he needed some time to gather the capital and find a place to stay and would stay in his truck in the drive way. This made me feel a bit sorry for the guy but honestly I'm sure he is doing it to elicit that reaction. I considered taking him some food and a blanket so he would not be cold in his truck, but then I did remember he told my mom to kick me out so he could to on another vacation which kinda pisses me off.

180,"Im a 22 year old male and im guilty to say im starting to really resent my family. After some falling out with an ex and a struggling financial situation ive had to move back home after being self sufficient for almost 3 years so I could start school again and start getting my life on track.  For the past 4 years getting my degree in computer science and getting a good career going has been my number one priority. Its always been my number one goal to build a loving family of my own and to be able to provide for them in every way I never was, but its been a complicated path with zero support. My parents have never once offered to help me pay for tuition or books that ive been paying for out of pocket and always deny when I ask for help, yet they always seem to come up with money to gamble, buy beer, spend $100’s a month on toys for my niece, and various other bullshit. They dont even know my major or that im in school this semester, they simply dont give a shit to ask, since very few of my family member have ever graduated high school much less college it was never encouraged in high school. Yes they’re providing a roof over my head but Im still independent on everything else including food (not by choice) and my stepdads only allowing it to not piss my mom off . He’s constantly hounding me to get a full time 40+ hour labor job so I can move out all the while being a controlling insecure husband to my mom, the dude gets jeolous if I play with my niece because her attention isnt on him. I feel like a ghost in my own “home”, stepdad literally ignores me and ever since a family member passed my moms been off the deep end and treats me different and doesnt speak to me much. 

As far as extended family goes ive always been the black sheep as well, while my sister (28) has always been the favorite. My grandparents never put any effort into getting to know me growing up and my granpa treats me like a stranger, yet theyve allowed my uncle and sister to mooch off of them continuously and do nothing but praise her and her unemployed boyfriend. All the while ive recently began a serious relationship with an amazing girl who treats me great, is really down to earth, and working while going to school for her second degree. My mom avoids meeting her and none of my family asks about my life so of naturally they wont ask about her and its making me feel horrible because im already practically part of her family and she hasnt even met mine. Ive fully stopped going to our occasional family gatherings and holidays since im straight up dismissed as if im not even there and Im honestly on the verge of just cutting contact with anyone outside of immediate family once I get my life back on track.

I hate complaining and im entirely happy outside of all this thats been eating at me for the past 22 years, I keep myself busy and outside of the house most of the time. I went through a long period of depression and social anxiety that I believe stemmed from family and had a period of drug abuse that I worked so hard to overcome, im completely sober (Ill refuse even a beer most the time) and I just feel like the one thing dragging me down is this. My friends love me, I stay productive, i work out, ive got hobbies, im trying to better myself every day but none of this seems good enough, I just really dont know why. OFF MY CHEST.

185,"So, I'm 16 years old. About 5 years ago my mom received a stone to the head and was diagnosed with dyslexia and chronic tinnitus with vertigo. That changed her life forever, and mine too since I had to drop out of school to take care of her. I spent all those four years locked away at home taking care of her since she fell down everywhere and couldn't drive properly. When we were all finally back on our feet I re entered school, but something wasn't right. I didn't feel like I quite belonged there. I've always been a loner, I've never had any friends, and the fact that I was locked away for so long contributed to it even more. It took almost a year to get them on my side, but I finally got both of my parents to agree to switch me to homeschool. We were all convinced that I was better under their care and supervision 24/7. They are firm Catholic believers, so am I, but never radical in their way of thinking or just crazy like most religious families. They enrolled me to the Seton Home Study School, a Catholic homeschooling basically. It worked out well at the beginning, we were all excited for this new adventure. It turns out it wasn't at all what we were all expecting. The fact that I spend so much time with them only seems to be driving us apart even more. I've been ignoring school for two years now, doing nothing but playing videogames all day and occasional doing my chores. My parents raised me with all the love and care a son could ask for, I would say they even spoiled me too much at some point, but now every single thing I do makes them so mad I drive them to call me things like parasite, good for nothing dickhead, shit eater even. And the worst part is that I am fully aware of all the wrong things I'm doing, but can't find the motivation to change anything. I can't say I'm depressed or suicidal, but I start to change, I'll do school again, I'll do my chores daily, all of them, I earn my videogames. But a week or so passes and I return to being the disobedient, lazy ball of grease that I am. I'm tired of this vicious circle, everything seems to be crashing down on me. The last thing I want to do is to lose my parents trust and drive them away form me. That will be the day I'll end my life, since they're all I have. But there's always this rage within me, rage of not doing anything for my life, and yet that rage turns into nothing.

My skin is naturally on the pale side so seeing a whole different side of me was mind blowing. My parents were not a fan of me getting a spray tan, and I felt hypocritical because I always used to look down on these ""fake girls"" that had these super dark, orange spray tans (in my defense mine aren't nearly as bad as theirs). But now I feel like I am one of these fake girls. It's been a week since I've been pale again and I feel awful. I know the obvious solution would be to just keep getting spray tans, but it takes at least 30 mins for the whole ordeal not counting driving, it's pretty pricy, and not even to mention that my parents hate it.

She usually talks to me about her problems which I'm happy about and always glad to listen and try to give her advice. She self-harms and I always tell her not to and give advice like to do other hobbies instead. I feel like she 'fetishizes' self-harm because she has a social media account and posts pictures of scars and meds but idk. Whenever I try to vent to her, she just makes it about her again. She doesn't really care when I vent to her and I just feel miserable.

&amp;#x200B;

 She likes to talk behind people's backs which I feel really uncomfortable about. If I don't text her back within an hour, she sends me a bunch of texts asking ""are you there??"" and I get really anxious and guilty. She has also went through my photos and texts without my permission and sent screenshots of my very personal stuff to herself. Every time I try to talk about something happy, she brings the subject back to depression. I'm fine with talking about depression but I prefer talking about positive things in life. I'm trying really hard to fight my depression but when I talk to her I just fall back down again.  Depression really sucks and maybe she can't control her constant negativity, but I don't know how to handle it. We don't have much in common other than being depressed and I hate to say that I don't want to be her friend. I feel like I'm not a nice enough person to be her friend.

200,"I[16F] have this friend[16F] who is constantly lying about things to me. We have always been really close and we did everything together. I trusted her and that's why I actually believed all the shit that she told me. One thing that she does like every day is she will mention how something happened to her (always in a class that I don't have with her), that made her really happy or sad or something and then I would go and ask her about it she would smile like she was hiding something from me, and say ""Oh nevermind"" or ""None of your business"". I could tell she was doing this just to make me curious about ""what happened"" because if I didn't ask or care then she would keep bringing it up till I said something and she would just be like ""Oh nothing!"". She would say stuff like this every day and it is quite frankly annoying. She always also mentions how she was ""on the phone all night"" or ""constantly texting someone"" or was ""soo excited to hang out with them after school, making it sound like she had this awesome social life. The weird part was when I asked who the people where she said she forgot, or that it was none of my business. She said they went to a different school but when we got into Highschool, our school was the only high school around there. One person, in particular, she would talk about was ""this really cute guy"" that she said she would stay up all night texting and calling, but for the first month of constantly talking about him, she said she just couldn't remember his name. After a while, she said she remembered it, but didn't want to tell me. One day she left her phone (which she is super secretive about) open by me, so I looked through it to see if everything she had said was really true, and not surprisingly the only people that she texted, called, and had contacts for were me, a few other friends that I know, and her family. I never told her that I snooped but did tell her that I didn't believe that the ""really cute guy"" was real and the only way I would beleive her was if she showed me her contacts. Of course, she refused, and she got mad and kept insisting she wasn't lying, even though there was no proof that she was telling the truth. The whole story doesn't make sense because I am literally the only person she hangs out with outside of school and we have 3/6 classes plus lunch together and she only hangs out with me.

She,apparently was visiting Germany in a few months with her father and was getting to know the place. She initiated a conversation with us and later after they (Germans) left, she had a talk with me. She liked me and insisted that I take her number down (weird). I didn't mind coz I've never dated before and nor had I ever approached women.I was like ,""Yeah,cool"".

 

Later that night I did text her and she didn't reply.And next morning , I put out another saying 'Let's have food together' and she said she was having a busy day. So, over the course of the weeks,I tried getting her to meet me. She would say sure and that was it. When I asked her ""when?"" there would be no reply. Also, from our initial meeting, she seemed pretty pissed off at me for listening to modern music. She listened to some old music and cringed at any other choice of music. I once used drake lyrics in a conversation and she got mad. I got a message ""I don't listen to drake"".

I probably was a little pushy and probably that conveyed to her that she could do better. So,I got mad and deleted her number. A girl who would post memes as her whatsapp status all the time couldn't reply to messages. I had applied Mark Manson's ' It's either a fucking Yes or a No principle. That was the end of it ,until in the next semester (Engineering college) our sections are near by and now we see each other often as we pass by. I just ignore her but time and again I feel guilty for doing that. I now feel that I should now talk to her and end it verbally and maybe ask her a feedback as to how things went on with me. Yeah, moving on is still hard for me. So,what should I do ? What would be the best thing to do now ? Any tips on how I should date in the future.

I can’t figure out what I “want to be when I grow up.” It’s not like I have no options, I just can’t pick one. 
I started college with a major in radiology. I applied to the program my second year and didn’t get it. I got discouraged and switched to psychology to be a school counselor. Then I shadowed a counselor and realized how little counseling they actually do. 
So, I switched to English to become a high school English teacher. 
But I was kind of nervous about it, so with much persuasion from my then boyfriend, I switched to nursing. I was super nervous about it but my mom is a nurse and I like the idea of helping people so why not? 
Two weeks in nursing school later; I dropped out. Definitely didn’t like that. 
So, I went back to English to teach college. I stuck with that for a little while as I was substitute teaching. 
Then, 1) Kids are assholes. 2) I subbed in a special needs class and I loved it. So, I considered doing that. But I then realized the responsibility I would have being responsible for these kids education. This interests me and terrifies me at the same time. 
Finally, someone suggested OTA (Occupational Therapy Assistant)  school because I wouldn’t have some of the same opportunities with special needs kids. SO, that is what my current major is in. 
I really like the idea of it, but the actual thought of going through the school terrifies me.

We went through the same cycles of me telling her to find someone else, she telling me it hurts when I say that, and she would say at least to just have a chat. Then when I stopped chatting she said she went into anxiety attack and so, so we began talking again. 
She wants me to love her back, I don't feel the same. I have so many responsibilities now that no other 22 year old would have. Now she wants me to come to a hotel again, cause she doesn't feel it's wrong. But wouldn't that be wrong to play with her feelings for your pleasure? ",15Jan2019,1

223,"A guy added me on Facebook and we had 100 or so mutual friends, he was a upperclassmen when I was a freshmen, and I know of him. Irs a small town. I accepted and he asked for my Snapchat. I'm not big on Snapchat unless I'm sending pictures to friends because there doesn't need to be any effort put into it. I ignored his first few messages about Snapchat but tonight after the third time I gave it to him and told him I don't use it much. He told me I should snap him. I haven't...lol.


I work at a grocery store and the other night he came in. It was later so it wasn't busy and he decided to come to the lane I was talking to the cashier on. Something went wrong with cashing in a coin slip thing so our supervisor had to come over to help. He only had a pop but it took like 5 minutes just for that. Meanwhile, he asked if we were hiring. My supervisor was focused on getting it working so she said ""I don't know hunny, ask her."" and pointed to me. I told him where to put a application in and he said he'll be back. I felt like we we're both thinking the same thing and I could feel a little awkwardness in the air. Haha. To me, it seemed like he purposely asked if we were hiring because of me. I told the cashier about him before he came to the lane we we're on so that entire situation of my boss telling him to ask me was ironic because she didn't know about it. Lol. Given we just talked about him we thought it was funny. While he was there we made eye contact and he just friendly smirked. He doesn't seem like the type to work in grocery store so he may of been subtly messing with me about the hiring.  I thought he probably saw me in person and was like ""nah I'll stop messaging her"" but to my surprise today he added me on Snapchat and wants to talk more. I don't thinking the only girl he messages. The few people I talked to about him had different things to say. 


I don't know him well. He's not unattractive but not my usual type. I'm kinda neutral on him. I've heard a lot of people say when a guy asks for your snap then he's just trying to mess around.  I'm 18. He's 20. I don't know if I shoild continue on. Does it seem weird to anyone else that he asked if we were hiring? Does it raise res flags if a guy is dead set on getting your snap?

So this morning one of the biggest television networks in my country had sent me an email asking to apply for the new season of one of their biggest shows (Bride &amp; Predjuce) 

i just want to put it out there that i didnt apply! 
i applied for another show as a couple back in 2016 and somehow they found that application, loved our story and invited us to apply for this show. 

i done what they asked, filled out all the information and let them know when i finished! 
another person from that channel had messaged me saying they have been trying to call but vouldnt get ahold of me
(im in the middle of the ocean on a cruise so yeah, no cellphone towers) 
i explained that and they were happy for me to arrange a 45 minute phonecall the day we can back to homeland! 

FOR THE ADVICE 
my parents dont want a bar of it.
(that kinda is the whole point of the show actually) 
its about a couple who wants to get married but the parents dont approve. 
remember i didnt apply! 

i called my boyfriends mum as soon as i got the first email and she was so excited for us!! she even said she was so keen to play the evil mother in law even though were like bestfriends 😂

i dont know what to do
this is honestly a once in a lifetime opportunity for us, we would be stupid not to take it!

233,"Hi all, so for background info I am 29 years old working as a library assistant at a university and my girlfriend is 25 years old working as an x-ray tech. We've lived together for about two years now in a freezing New England town and our relationship is pretty solid. Her father recently passed away and my younger brother has recently been experiencing a mental health crisis that might be borderline personality disorder, so needless to say we've both been very stressed/depressed and could use a holiday. 

It sucks because we have a long-weekend holiday planned for late June, but other than that we only have about five dreary, dismal, cold months of solid work weeks to look forward to. On a whim I looked into what a four-day weekend (missing a Friday &amp; Monday of work) might look like in February if we were to skip town and head to Fort Meyers, FL or somewhere else warm and sunny. 

I think we could potentially afford it, but the problem would be convincing my gf, in addition to getting time of work. I feel like she would enjoy getting a vacation, but she is definitely the opposite of spontaneous and likes to plan ahead, always wary of planning things last-minute. And I think she could get time off work easily enough, but my bosses might have a problem with me taking two days off (seeing as I already took a day off this year for January to attend my gf's father's funeral). 

I don't want to be reckless or do anything that might endanger my job and/or relationship, but at the same time I don't want to live in fear of what could happen or what other people might think.

241,"Not sure if i am asking in the right sub-reddit, but here goes nothing:

&amp;#x200B;

A little Back story: 

&amp;#x200B;

My(M23) Sister(F18) has been in a long distance relationship for almost like 3 1/2 years with her BF(M18+-) in Egypt. She met him in an MMORPG and had been in the same guild and stuff. In the recent years, she had been suffering from sever depression and was ""cutting herself""(self harm) and now she has been taken medicine to deal with it. I think she is self-harming to cope with her relationship, cause she had never done that before.  She lives with my mother and my other 2 brothers in the UK and I am living with my dad in Germany (I will explain why it matters later).

&amp;#x200B;

The Situation:

 

Last weekend my sister told the family she was going to Spain with here friend on holiday. You see, my parents are from South India, which means that they are extremely overprotective with my sister. Another reason is that the public image will get destroyed, because if a girl goes to a foreign country alone (without any family as a guardian), it is likely that she can get violated and abused (my dads perspective of the situation and I respect that, since there has been lots of ""abuse"" happening lately). My dad things that My sisters friend might bring some boys around and ""Have some fun"", which you know how it could end, and my dad doesn't what that to happen. So he asked my sister to give him the details of her friend (like phone number, address, parents contact), so he can be more assured and more confident once he knew what the friends Parent would think of this.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My sister act hesitant and I did not know why. So I was thinking of helping her out (because I am her brother and she was struggling), and told her the best moves she can play to convince my dad so she can go on holiday. The next thing she told me shocked me and I don't know how to react on it:

&amp;#x200B;

""I am not going to Spain. I am going to Egypt to see my Boyfriend. I said that so the will let me go. Don't tell Dad.""

&amp;#x200B;

You see, my parents don't know she has a Boyfriend and us siblings are culprits of this so called crime (from the perspective of my parents). That's why she is lying all the way through. Also her actions will affect us Siblings (because our parents will pressure us to be well informed about our sister). I don't think my parents they will be happy to hear that she is having a long distance relationship with an Egyptian dude. 

&amp;#x200B;

She is going to see him in End of march, she has booked everything and is ready. I tried to talk her out of it, and explained how important it is to be honest with this kind of matters (imo, love, romantic or not, is a very delicate/sacred thing, and honesty is very important here. There are enough people who dislike the idea of it because people like my sister pulling off this kind of show) and she said:

&amp;#x200B;

""I am not happy with my current life, I am tired of it, and it will give me hope if I meet him. I will let mum and dad no after I come back"".

&amp;#x200B;

Then shortly, her BF messaged me that there is no concern for me because he will ""protect her"", and he will even ""take a bullet for her"". An attempt to convince me, but I have no form of authority to decide if she can go or not.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a pessimist. I tend to see the risks more than others. I am able to critically think and simulate scenarios using previous experiences and peoples opinion (the better I know them, the accurate the scenario becomes). So I know how stuff will end up in the end. (at least 80% of the time).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The Dilemma:

&amp;#x200B;

1. I don't tell my parents

&amp;#x200B;

What will happen is that my sister will go without letting anyone know to Egypt. My parents will get worried and squeeze us(my 2 brothers and me) for info and howl us out to search for her. She can either be safe with her boyfriend (my guts is telling me something else), or he ""abuses"" and she comes back with a shame to her family (unfortunately losing virginity, especially to a girl, is not taken lightly in our culture), or even gets killed (its a different country, so it is more likely to happen, since she is a foreigner and no one gives a shit.) In that case, I would not be able to life with myself, since I knew what she is going to do and I didn't do anything to stop.

&amp;#x200B;

2. I tell my parents:

&amp;#x200B;

If I tell my parents, that will put my sister in the bad light instantly and I get some of the damage too since I am a culprit (which I am ready to take). I will be the one among my siblings to Subotage my sisters relationship (since my parents will most likely to cut all kind of connections, so she can't contact him any more). She might get a hell of a scolding and she be watched more closely than ever before. Most likely she will lose the access to the Internet because of that. Since she has sever depression and she tried to ""take her life"" once (Paracetamol overdose). She might attempt to ""take her life"" again. Since me and my dad are in a different country, its hard to deal with this issue when the problem arises. I don't want to lose my sister.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a saying that ""You should not snitch out of our generations"". Like if we do something bad, we make sure we clean it up so my parents (or other people outside our generation) won't notice anything. Basically cover up each other asses (I know its sound stupid, but that how we get a little bit of more than we are allowed to do). The point is I will break my word and my other siblings will see me differently. This is because I did it once, what will stop me to do it again (turning a back on a sibling). They will stop telling me the secrets they have and it will be harder to access them for info. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I am not sure which one is the best way, but my gut is telling me that telling my Parents and turn my back on my sister on this one. This is because of some factors:

&amp;#x200B;

1. She has not been honest by 100% to anyone. (I assume I only know 20% of what is happening with my sister)

2. I feel my parents are left out in the dark for long time and it is enough. I can't bear to see them like this, worrying about my sister. (Since they have absolute no context about the situation at all). Its their daughter, their ONLY daughter, and its an effort to give birth and raise to just be let go of. 

&amp;#x200B;

She will never trust me ever again. (I will let my parents know that before I turn my back on her, so they don't rely on my when it comes to discussing stuff about my sister). 

I think I can live with the hope, that she understand me one day. I it will 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I am kindly asking those who are very experienced in life (or those, who know better than me), to give me their point of view, so I can refine my decision.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you in advance.

242,"guess this is a good place to ask? Feel free to delete if not. 

I work in a retail location with included pharmacy. So our past (amazing) manager was transfered to a bigger store. In his place, they offered the position to an assistant manager whose store closed down on maternity leave. She's a nice person, but there's some things she does that are starting to concern us.

She comes in at least an hour before the store opens, sometimes more. This is a store where you usually get in 15 mins before opening and everything is done. Not to mention that we open at 10 on sundays and she schedules herself at 5am. 5 hours before store opens! She also leaves early and late all the time. 

Barely any communication. The other managers, including me, have no idea what she does in the office that whole time. She's rarely ever out and when she is, she doesn't say what she's working on, just slips out. We all do manager tasks, it's not like everything is on her.

The communication she does leave is in the form of notes and passive aggressive to do lists.
Our last manager kept normal hours like us and was rarely in the office. None of the team is super young and we flowed like a well oiled machine until her. Now it's almost like nothing we do is good enough.

Are we overthinking everything because we had such a hood manager before or is there some red flags, something we should do?",15Jan2019,1
243,"So I'm going straight to the point. 

My mom was physically and mentally abusive to me and my older sister when I we were children. She had no problem with calling us names, hitting, kicking, throwing things ...etc. 

It wasn't yelling/a hit here or there. It was rage, anger and hatred.

She used to do all these horrible things to us when we did something wrong, complained and cried. I remember it happening now and then without any reason.

She also was incredibly caring and gave me anything I ever wanted. Every toy , nice cloathing, good school.  So I can't say she was all bad. I love her. She is my mother and only parent I have.

I still live with her. She acts like nothing ever happened. All smiles, happy family type of act.

There has happened alot more bad things in my life. I have kept it all inside bottled up, but it is now spilling out in these episodes of paranoia, mania, depression, delusional thinking and anxiety. 
(I suspect PTSD but I have not been diagnosed w anything)

So now I'm about to be 20 in July, I have no education, live with mom, isolated, 2 friends and I haven't done anything in 2+ almost 3 years. 

I'm at the point where I have already serious considered suicide and have a note. I will not kill myself because I don't want to disappoint my grandparents. 

So I thought of confronting my mom by about making a video where I just say everything I have to say. 

Should I do this?
What do I do if she dismisses it completely?
Should I wait until it is summer? The I could sleep at the local campsite.

There is a risk she will throw me out and I have no plan B. Sleeping outside is not an option. I have no money and own nothing.

248,"A bit of backstory. My biological father passed away around 20 years ago leaving 4 children. My mother remarried, gaining 3 stepchildren. My parents are both in their early 60s, eldest children being around 40, youngest mid 20s. they were hopelessly in love and both equally reliant on each other but generally independent with them both holding down jobs.

My mother was admitted to the ICU early last week with severe pneumonia, for the first couple of days we were preparing for the worst but she started to respond a bit better to the treatment and is now looking like she is on the long, slow process of starting to recover but is still very unwell. We have all been taking shifts being at the hospital essentially all hours around children, pets, and jobs, we are all emotionally and physically exhausted. On Friday my stepdad looks particularly tired and unwell while visiting my mother. Thinking it’s just the culmination of a week of worry and long hours at the hospital we tell him to go home to get some rest. After a couple of hours of not hearing from him we ask his daughters (our stepsisters) to go and check on him as we’re worried. He is found in the car on the driveway outside his house asleep and incoherent and rushed to hospital where they believe he had a severe stroke that has caused severe brain stem damage. After a couple of days of tests to check if there is any brain activity he is declared clinically dead yesterday afternoon and his life support turned off last night surrounded by family.

Now we have to come to terms with the heartbreaking fact that my mother doesn’t know that the love of her life has passed while she was unconscious in the ICU and that she was too unwell to see him before he passed. At the minute while she’s on a lot of pain medication and sedation she is pretty much unaware of everything that is happening but as she slowly gets better and more aware it’s only a matter of time before she asks where he is. It happened so suddenly that we don’t want to risk her having a setback because of the toll that the grief will have on her until we absolutely have to.

So I guess the advice I’m asking for is this: has anyone been in a similar situation at all? Does anyone have any recommendations or ideas or anything at all that we may not have considered while we start preparing ourselves? I know that we don’t need to be the ones that give the news to my mother and that the doctors and nurses can help us with that but we’re all terrified that she’ll stop fighting to get better when she knows he’s gone.",15Jan2019,1

&amp;nbsp; 

We were together 4 months and I left him a month ago and he has not taken it well. 

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

The day of he held me hostage in my car (said things like ""call the cops I don't care""), but didn't use actual physical force. Instead made it so that *I* would have to be the asshole and use force if I wanted to leave. 

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

90% of the time was me literally just sitting their looking miserable in silence. Then when the neighbors started to notice he said things like ""don't embarrass me in front of my neighbors"" 

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

He called me hundreds of times in the span of a few days. I was forced to get a new number and block him on all social medias.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

He has logged into whichever emails and social media accounts possible (large part why we broke up; I had already changed the passwords for most of them but I had SO many alt accounts it was hard to keep track of)

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

He took an uber 4 hours to my parents house at 5am the day after christmas demanding I speak to him. Cops were called.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

He threatened suicide. At one point he said ""I feel like I am going to hurt you"". Although, he has never physically hurt me before, and I don't think he would... 


I think he is more of a psychological warfare kind of guy. He is incredibly lazy and does most of his stuff from the computer, so idk what to think of the most recent form of contact.

251,"I’ve been with my boyfriend for nearly 6 years, and we moved in with one another in August. Ever since he’s moved in, I have not had a decent amount of sleep. 

I’m an insomniac and an extremely light sleeper. It takes me up to two hours to fall asleep once I get into bed, and every time I start to drift off I’m ripped from that feeling by an extremely loud snore. It also wakes me up after I’ve fallen asleep, leading to another extremely long period of trying to get back to sleep. 
Most nights I move to the couch, where I can fall asleep easier, but I’m super uncomfortable. 

The sleep deprivation is taking a huge toll on me, and our relationship. I know it’s not his fault that he snores, but I can’t help but feel angry at him for ruining my sleep. He also refuses to try any remedies for snoring, and gets angry at me when I ask him to change his sleeping position in the middle of the night (even though he goes right back to sleep after). 

What can I do to not be so miserable and also not be an asshole over something he doesn’t control? ",15Jan2019,1
252,"My boyfriend and I have been together/dating for over 6 months now. When we originally met, I was living by myself in an apartment getting ready to move in with my mother. Long story short, living with my mother was an incredibly toxic environment and I lived there for a few months until I landed my full time job. I decided to move to the same city as my boyfriend, so I could be closer to him and also have my own space back. I have noticed that my depression has creeped back into my life, likely due to the months of toxicity and torment I received from moving back in with my mother temporarily. Even though I moved to his city 4 days ago, I am still not the person I was when I met him. I am very irritable, not patient, and I have not been feeling myself. He keeps telling me he wants the ""old me"" back, but he also understands I may need some time to get used to living alone and in a better environment again. 

&amp;#x200B;

How do I explain to him that I have been feeling depressed, even though I should be happy? I ask this and it may seem like a dumb question, but how do I explain to him how depression works? He desperately wants to be a good boyfriend and he doesn't know how to help, because he doesn't have depression. Any advice?",15Jan2019,1
253,"I grew up in the most extremely left leaning places there is: California. Around the time when Trump was elected, I started to join the political conversation. I started watching CNN and quickly found a lot of things that I disagreed with that were being said (one example being the wage gap narrative). I then turned to outside media for my news, specifically YouTube. I started watching people like Ben Shapiro, and really liked his “facts don’t care about your feelings” attitude because I was extremely sick of all the political correctness stuff going on around me 24/7. I would watch hours and hours of videos across multiple channels. Although the videos I started with were political, I quickly moved on to topics like racism and other social issues. I thought I knew it all and I had figured out my truth. 

Last summer, I saw what I viewed as a racist post on FB. There was a black guy hold a sign that said  something to the effect of, “we have to stop whites from ____, so we can figure this out.” The person, “Aaron”, shared it on her timeline because she thought it was funny. I commented “classic” on it and it went downhill from there. I was jumped on by many people and soon it because a shouting match. I tried my best to respond intelligently, but at one point I was responding to five different people so I wasn’t the most precise as I wanted to be. It got so bad that I was banned from the post all together. I apologized over DM to one of the commenters I was going back and fourth with, but not Aaron. 

Aaron and I don’t exactly share the same social circle, but our circles overlap enough for me to be in constant fear about seeing her. About two weeks ago, I was at my friend’s house and our mutual friend got a call from Aaron. She was calling to ask what the mutual friend was up to, when my name was brought up, the mutual friend was told something like “oh we don’t get along we had a fight over racism on fb.” I was instantly sick to my stomach from guilt, shame and embarrassment. 

My views have drastically shifted for the better since this whole ordeal, but I still feel people will see me as a racist charlatan. The fear of even more people finding out about this is haunting. I’m at the end of my rope with this, and I can’t hold onto this demon anymore. I’m going to do something about it, I just don’t know what I should do. I’ve thought of a few options like writing a letter, sending a message or trying to see if she’ll meet up in person. But I’d like your opinion. 

TL;DR: I got into an argument with somebody about racism on Facebook, and I want to apologize. How should I? ",15Jan2019,1
254,"So I'll sum this up as quick as I can. I bought a cheap wallet and a new set of shoelaces from Target on Thursday. Total like $25 investment. Not the end of the world but still annoying. I left them in a bag on the kitchen counter and pretty much forgot about it until Sunday. 

On Friday and Saturday my roommate had friends over. 3 people the first night. 4 people the next. The second group was the same 3 people as the first, with one extra. These were the only people here through this entire time-span. The additional person sketched me out immediately. Maybe I'm just paranoid. I've been robbed too many times in this shithole city.  

I'm keeping my eye on this guy pretty much all night. Towards the end of the night we're all hanging out in the snow outside, he went in by himself for a little too long. I come in to see what's going on, he's already on the way out. While standing outside he's clutching his big coat in a weird way. I am super sketched out. 

The next day the bag with the wallet and shoelaces are missing. I remember my roommate had cleaned, maybe he threw it out. I tore open and dug through all the gross trashbags. Nothing. I tore the entire house apart. He said he never saw it when cleaning. I say someone probably nabbed it.

His immediate response is ""is the implication that one of my friends stole your wallet"". Uhh. Yeah dude. That's pretty much the rub of it. He asks ""why would somebody steal an empty wallet?"" Well, they call it petty theft for a reason. Why wouldn't they? It's a nice brand new wallet. Probably didn't even look in the bag, just saw a target bag with some shit it in and pocketed it. Who knows what else he might have nabbed and I'll never know until I need it. 

Conversation pretty much ended there. What I think the right thing to do is forbid any four of those people from coming over again. It could have been anyone. This is my house, I am the sole leaseholder. I've been here two years, this guy just moved in november. I already had to ban his one friend from coming here, and that's a whole other dramatic story. So we're already kind of on thin ice with each other.

What's the play here? What would you do? I don't want to risk a friendship over $25, but I will not tolerate thieves in my house.

We didn’t speak for years, last time I spoke to her was the end of 2014. Fast forward to about 2 days ago I messaged her on Facebook saying “drinks?? 🍻” she jokingly said only if you apologise for being an ass when we were younger, I told her of course I was sorry and she told me she was just joking and of course we can go for drinks. She didn’t reply until 8:30pm, our original messages were around 10:30am. She responded and we spoke about what we’ve both been doing the past few years, she asked for my number and she called it when I gave it to her and we spoke for about 30 minutes about our life goals, people we went to school with etc. she went to go make dinner and she went to bed shortly after, saying it was nice to catch up and we’ll talk tomorrow. I messaged her around 1pm saying hey how’s work going and she said very long, I asked her how long she has left and she hasn’t responded since it’s been a good 5 hours.

I have a neighbor next-door who’s a musician and is always playing loud music and singing. I don’t have a problem with it since I do my fair share of noise during the day (I’m a composer) and I feel that’s alright within reasonable hours.

Usually I wouldn’t have a problem with the last thing I mentioned but since he’s always being this loud and disrespectful then it simply pisses me off.

265,"Hi!

So, I'm currently on the third and last year of my apprenticeship that I do in a federal authority and I have a crush on this one guy for quite some time now. 

It was never something I pursued seriously because he is older than me (I turned 20 a few days ago, he is in his 40s), already has a son that is older than me and (luckily, to be honest!) hasn't shown any interest in me whatsoever.  It was just someone I found quite attractive and nice and who I sometimes daydreamed about, but I never thought seriously about dating him.

Therefore it was never really a problem, also because I was never deployed in the department he worked in (in my apprenticeship we go through a number of departments to get to know the whole office) until now.

So, since I'm in the same department as him he has also given me some tasks, one of which requires to go some facilitator's toolboxes with him. And I have seriously been procrastinating this for so long, just because I fear that I can't hide it.  
I mean, don't get me wrong - even though I'm going to see and talk to him more often now I still know that it's just a crush and I don't have any plans on telling him about my feelings or hope that we might date someday.   
I just wanna get over these feelings since I will be in this department for a while and I don't want things to get awkward. I also feel like I'm pretty bad at hiding my feelings and feel like when he looks at me he can read on my face that I have a crush on him.

Well I have the ability to realistically pursue one of those dreams in starting my own business. Starting my own business... tattooing. I've always been an artist. And when I was younger people would tell me I should think about tattooing. My own mother said I should really be a tattoo artist. Because at 13 years old I could draw portraits of animals almost like they're pictures. 

I dont have the time to go through formal apprenticeships. But what I do have is a mentor. A mentor who's been in the tattooing industry for 40 years.

To start off, I'd like to stay that I'm assigned female at birth but am actually transgender, meaning I'm female to male (FtM) and at the time of the assault, I was closeted; everyone knew me as a girl.


In 2014, someone I'll call Jerkface date raped me. Around the time this happened, Jerkface's mom (he was living with her) had reported that Jerkface had been stealing a certain prescription  medicine that can be used to date rape. After this happened, I had a miscarriage, thanks to my birth control working.


At the time of the assault, Jerkface was best friends with my transphobic ex, Harold. The assault happened in June that year and by February, Jerkface was acting insane and Harold and I had to call the police on him; he had a bong when the cops got to our house (that he was in without our permission just hanging out with our dogs) and after that, Jerkface blocked and (I thought, and Harold thought) he unfriended us, too.


The night I wrote this, Jerkface sent me a facebook message and I realized that I had never unfriended him because he blocked me before I had the chance. I'm very worried that he saw some things on facebook he and my ex were never supposed to see (they're both transphobic as hell) and I'm scared. There's a chance that Jerkface and Harold are friends now, and I'm not sure what to do if Harold catches wind that I'm transgender because he said some very transphobic things before we broke up. He knows where I live, and Jerkface was at my house once.

Hello. I’m 18 and Female and I didn’t really think me and my brothers grew up in a sexist household. We had church every once in a while and the rest of our family were religious (grandpa is a pastor) and while the church often WAS sexist, I thought we weren’t. The church we USED to go to didn’t allow women to vote for all church related votes blah blah blah. Anyway basically what I’m saying is, we grew up around sexist ideas but I always thought our mom and dad tried to tell us those were not the right ideals to teach or believe in. Until....

One of the the middle boys in our family started to become insanely sexist. I only noticed the last 6 or 7 years but we lived opposite sides of the world so it didn’t bother me much until he moved back in with me and my mom. I’m the youngest and the only girl. Every once in a while he would say something that was a bit off or scary, but was never enough for us to say anything. Until about 6 or 8 months ago when we would start to argue about it. He has said things like “I would hope the girl I date or marry had less sexual partners than me. I think girls should date only one guy but the guy should be able to sleep around. I think the girls should appoint themselves to one guy but the guy should be able to have multiple partners” He likes to say the “war on men” is coming and men should be aware. That women get money in divorces and it’s not fair. And today I heard him talk to a friend about how he’s cheating on his girlfriend. He also talks about girls like objects. “She’s Italian But she had light hair. Oh she dyes her hair for sure” which might not sound offensive but if you heard him you’d agree. Anyway, lately we haven’t been talking because I don’t want to upset my mother more than we already have with our arguments. She knows that he is sexist but she won’t do anything about it. He’s manipulative just like our father who doesn’t live with us anymore but my brother knows how to keep my mom under his wing. She keep threatening to kick him out but never will. 


I guess I just don’t know what to do. I have given up on him ever becoming a good person or doing the right thing. He’s become a nightmare and I tried ignoring it but I’m THE GIRL. Am I just supposed to ignore the fact he thinks I’m less than?

We are being memed and joked at for a problem we were never really a part of. How do I handle this? 



I recently became active in my country's esports community and joined a team. I knew that they needed new players because the previous ones left from internal problems with another player. It was all fine and dandy for us, new players, until something else happened.


One person in particular started to blurt out our team's name in the comments of a post from a (relatively cancer) Facebook group all about complaining and memeing people. People who knew him in my team started chatting with him and I just woke up to a post on top of the group with hundreds of comments encouraging an online fight between 2 people (1 from our team and the other is the person in particular I mentioned).


None of us really responded and most of the 500+ comments are them just memeing us. I went online to play just to see that we're the hottest meme in the community.


It feels bad to be memed at for a drama we, the new players, were never really a part of. One thing that hit me hard was a comment saying that we'll be laughed at in future tournaments.",15Jan2019,1
290,"** (TRIGGER WARNING)**

So the tldr: two dads abused me at different points in my life, and now I have a general distrust of all men, including my current SO.

So my biological father raped me. Multiple times. Before I was 5 years old and during. I've made peace with that for the most part. In fact, in comparison to the way my adoptive father abused me, I've handled it much better. The man who legally adopted me while married to my mom was manipulative, narcissistic, controlling, and would constantly belittle myself and my 2 half brothers. He and my mom divorced about 7 months ago, and he recently essentially claimed on Facebook he didn't have any kids with his ex, when he did in fact adopt me and thus, obviously, had a kid with his ex. That's obviously been bothering me.

My paranoia has risen in the last couple of months. This is somewhat of a trend with boyfriends and in relationships. However it's happening later than usual. So I thought I was doing better. But now I've been paranoid any time he's defensive over his phone that he's hiding something from me. Like a girl or something. He goes to school when I'm asleep, and I work when he's asleep. Our only time together, unless he's on vacation, is over the weekend. Even that will get cut short if he's sick or gets busy with other things.

Side note: I've dated two abusive alcoholic men as well. One was openly alcoholic, the other hid it.

Now my paranoia is including things like, ""He says he's sick, and I believe him. But what if he's sick because he's drinking heavy again?"" Even though I know he's not. Or I want to believe he's not? This was a warning sign I missed in my second alcoholic relationship, hence the paranoia.

I guess my issue is, do I trust my gut that's telling me he's hiding something? Or do I tell him my paranoia and anxiety are high and need support without telling him what I'm paranoid about? I don't want to go after him and find out he's 100% genuine, because as anyone with anxiety and paranoia can tell you, you can't always trust your gut. But if my gut is right and I'm blinded by rose colored glasses, how on earth do I tell?

Please help. This has been driving me nuts and worsening my depression.",15Jan2019,1
291,"Hi,

I am a 20-year-old British au-pair working in Germany. I’m bilingual in German, so communication isn’t a problem, and I have lots of experience with children (including previous au-pairing), so that’s fine too. 

What’s not fine is the host-dad. I arrived here just over a week ago and he’s been emotionally and verbally abusive ever since. Everything I do is criticised, mocked, or crudely imitated. He can be very aggressive, though he’s never been physically violent, and it scares me. He intimidates me to the point that I start shaking when left alone with him, and am often near tears after any interaction with him. He treats his wife (my host-mum) in much the same way. Being around him is like juggling with a hand grenade. 

Not only this, but I’m working 13-hour days, 5 days per week, despite German laws (and my contact) limiting an au pair’s work to 30 hours per week. Even on my 2 days off, I’m expected to do household chores and babysit the children, unpaid. 

I want to terminate my contract, but there is a mandatory 2-week notice period. I can’t imagine telling them that I’m leaving, then having to live with them for another two weeks. The host-dad will be so angry, and he scares me so much already. The verbal abuse would just get worse, and he’d be even more aggressive. I’m scared. 

There is no overseeing agency in my case, as the host family and I made arrangements through a website, so I don’t have anybody to turn to. I’m so desperate. 

Please help me.

298,"Hi everyone,

We have a rabbit of approximately 3 years old. 

Half a year ago, he had an infection in his colon. This has been treated successfully after a couple of visits to the vet

A couple of weeks later, he was ill again (shaking) for a few hours, which then stopped and didn't reccur.

A month ago he started bleeding when peeing, however not showing any other symptoms nor any change in his behaviour or personality. He was still playing and jumping around.

Since then, we have visited the vet a couple of times for his antibiotic treatment. This didn't work. After this, we got another antibiotic treatment for 14 days. The 14 days are almost over and it still didn't work. The rabbit is still behaving the same as earlier. Total costs up till now are ca. €250-300 ($300-350).

Now as both of the antibiotic treatments are over, the vet wants to perform an echo, which will cost another €70 excluding the actions or treatment that will follow after the echo.

We do not believe that the echo will find a solution. 2 antibiotic treatments didn't work, so what will be found in the echo? Maybe even nothing will be found, causing us to spend even more and still not heal the rabbit. He seems to be very vulnerable to diseases.

@reddit: what would you do in this case? We are really on a sort of dead end as we do not want to end his life, but also don't want to spend any more money if this will not improve his health.

Should any extra information be required, please let me know.

I have a crush on someone, and she said she really likes to talk to me, but there's a slight catch. Whenever we see each other in real life, she ignores me. She rarely texts back. I tried to back out of our 'friendship'( idk how to put it) but then she said she really likes me and all that stuff. We talked a lot(30 mins straight) and the next day she went back to ignoring me. She said she is busy and can't lift her head from studies and sleeps 4 hours a day and stuff. I think it's nonsense. She is always posting BTS fangirl stiff on her story and paints a lot(and has an art blog). I am not saying that she shouldn't be doing what she likes, but she should at least not lie to me if she doesn't wanna talk, it gives me false hope. So after 6 months of this, I confronted her, she said I'm a bad person and stuff and talking to me depresses her. I later told her about my feelings (didn't ask her out, so no reply about that).

I know that if I continue to push my skills as an insurance agent, I will be very successful. For that reason, I avoid putting myself out there because I fear failure in business. Quite simply, I don’t want to get distracted and lose my edge I have right now.

I have this horrible feeling inside myself that is a mixture of loneliness and self-hatred whenever I go to school and see all the pretty girls that I could be taking to. Loneliness because I rarely have social interaction outside work or school. Self hatred because I don’t like being like this; by like this I mean valuing career success over parties. Parties are cool but I always feel like I waste my time at them. Making friends is pretty much out of the question, because I’m so different than everyone else I go to school with(pertaining to my focus in my career).

318,"Hey all!
So, On October 21 ‘18, four days after my birthday (hooray to 24!) I woke up at 6 am to my apartment burning. My husband, dog, and one cat survived the ordeal with minutes to spare, although all of our furniture, clothes, some other belongings, and our beloved kitten, did not.
(If anyone’s wondering, even while writing this on 1.15, no cause has been determined.)
We moved in with his mother and began weighing our options. We ended up flying to Tampa the weekend after (we bought the tickets before the fire) and we looked at apartments and fell in love with one. We applied, and got approved. We began saving money, and I guess having few things to bring works better financially. It would be some clothes, our three gaming consoles, and other miscellaneous things. And, of course, just us.
Our date to leave is Feb. 13th and we already bought the one-ways.
A month ago, the neighbors from my old apartment called me to tell me I had some mail. I went over, chatted, and then opened this huge envelope to discover an acceptance letter. I’ve been wanting to attend John Jay for years. I called my grandfather, and upon hearing the news, he told me that he’d help us out with $300 a month for rent. And that was amazing.
We began looking at places that were local but everything was either too expensive, or within our budget but our combined salary amount was too low for the agent. Which is bullshit, btw, as our old apartment was $1,600 and we did fine. My grandfather begged me to keep looking, and I did. Nothing’s coming up. I even looked at the Bronx, where everything was also expensive.
I absolutely LOVE school, and I’d be entering JJ as a junior so I’d only have to stick it out here for two more years. Semesters start next Friday and I’m just at a loss. I also really want to move. The apartment is beautiful, and the location is great, and jobs are available, it seems.
My husband knows how much I love school so he’s been silent on this, only because he never wants me to feel pressured because of his influence. He wants to leave, I know it. But I really do want to as well.
Any advice would be absolutely great!

TL;DR: I have to choose between moving to a beautiful place and starting over or attending a university I love only for another two years and then moving.

320," A little back story here, I do apologize for the long read.. It has come  to my attention that I have been asking myself the wrong questions  lately.. Academically, I've never been a 'good' student, and it's not  because I lack the focus or discipline. In fact, I was highly focused  and disciplined in another area of study, one less practical. I had an  issue, obsessive thoughts, once an Idea fully developed in my mind, I  could not move on until actualizing it. I'm 22 and I am still struggling  with it. As a matter of fact, that has held me back a few years in  school. I am now alienated from the local education system, too far gone  they say, and so I have the 'opportunity' to apply for a degree in  Universities overseas. I know what I want to pursue, now at least, and  it is at least a bit more practical than my previous focus. Financially,  I remain dependent on my parents, no way I can earn enough money, fast  enough, to support myself academically throughout the process. I  realized, in my intense, obsessive.. focus, I missed out on the present,  and in a way, betrayed by parents financially. Their investments were  wasted for I had turned out to be a failed product in the local system,  and it can be, and should be seen as a selfish act on my behalf. Yet I  feel nothing. Only thing I regret was not being able to spend more time  on my focus, even up to now. I realize this makes me come off as a  rather insensitive person, and I will admit, I do see a problem in that,  yet I feel nothing. If my feelings won't impact me, then experience  will not teach me. The only way I can learn would be by analyzing this  through.

Before I move on, to remain objective I should state that I have two main paths from this point on, realistically:

1. Pursue  my desired degree overseas, which is rather expensive, and would lead  to me being much more of an emotional and financial burden to my  parents. The returns will take some time to come in, considering how  long-term of an investment it will be, alongside the deteriorating  relationship between my parents and I.
2. I get what I deserve. I forcefully forgo my desires and pick a really generic degree which,  even though is expensive, is much less of an investment than the first  option, maybe cheaper by a third, retaining my relationship with my  parents, pleasing everyone, yet remaining uncertain of my future due to  my obsessive focus, coupled with dissatisfaction. All I see is a future  where I'd choose to be left alone ultimately, and I am not sure if that will do any good to the relationship in the long run.

I  have thought long and hard about both scenarios. I am willing to make  the sacrifice for the 2nd option. I am just not sure I should, being torn apart by my new found self-awareness revolving around  self-development, objectivity, and a slight hint of masochism, tied with  the guilt I do not feel but ought to feel, and the concept of justice.

I  realize this may all seem like an overly stupid and  abstract/hypothetical scenario to you, yet it has become a reality to  me. I cannot, in any way, whatsoever, move forwards, from this point in time, until I find a way to solve this self-created problem of mine. For  my act of selfishness, I should be held responsible and be punished in a  certain way. How does one experience punishment? What would provoke an  emotion from me? Moving away from my goal. If I am to pick the first  option, will I be compromising my character, my principles in any manner  by bypassing punishment that is due?

And have moved from one side of the other with no money to our names and worked our way to where we are now however, money has always been a bit of a sticky point in our relationship. We have gone from barely being able to pay my bills to being able to pay bills, live comfortably and start saving. We have been trying to save for our own house/land for the past 2 years, we had around $10000 saved up but ended up using that for our wedding party last year and since then we have been trying to save but keep getting nowhere. We’ve had some medical bills/vet bills/substantial lawyer bills due to visa application etc. and now we are nearing the deadline for our block of land deposit and have nothing. 

My husband has very little interest in how the house gets run as in, he transfers his part over to cover expenses and leave the rest to me to put money into savings/pay bills/pay credit cards etc. and I don’t feel like he fully gets the cost involved in some things. I’ve recently suffered severe anxiety and depression due to a trauma and have picked up a hobby of making homemade goods and selling them at local markets. This isn’t necessarily making money/barely breaking even to be honest but it is helping me but my husband has now cracked up about the fact we have nil savings and is blaming me. This is a common occurrence where majority of organisation of the house/lives/banking/cars etc. gets done by me and he is oblivious to it unless it directly effects him. 

On top of that he keeps telling me that I am the only one that can fix my mental health and I need to try harder. 

Now comes tonight where everything has reached a climax, we’ve argued it out for 2 hours and now he doesn’t want to be near me and is refusing to sleep in our room because he wants to be alone. 

Is my marriage ending because I can’t get my shit together? Am I being selfish by spending money on a hobby that I thought was helping my mental health? Are we going to miss out on the opportunity to own our own home because I wasn’t smarter with our finances? 

I’m sorry if this reads as gibberish as I am on my phone and emotional ranting but I feel like I am broken, my life is broken and it is all because of my own doing. ",15Jan2019,1
323,"So to start off with, 6 months ago I got dumped over text by my now ex after 2 years and 4 months.

That messed me up, and what messed me up further was what was said after. Without going in to too much detail, it has resulted with my self esteem being at an all time low, and the return of anxieties that I hadn't felt in years. I'm getting over the break up but the last bit is still a struggle with myself.

Anyway, I've started talking to this girl I met at uni over the past month and a bit, and I think I might be developing a bit of a crush on her. It's confusing because I'm really not sure, and I can't tell if she would like me in the same way. We've gotten fairly close I'd say, there's already a high level of trust that's been established both ways. Just the other day she asked me to ring her because she was getting overwhelmed and wanted to calm down.

Either way though, I'm confused with myself. I feel emotionally vulnerable, and unsure. I don't know if I would even be ready for a relationship, or if it's even just the best thing for me. But why am I thinking I'm feeling like this? I don't know how to handle it.",15Jan2019,1
324,"So, I'll start this with a review of 2018, last year wasnt a great year for me... I had been down in the dumps at the start due to failing a module at university, alongside that I was also in a relationship that wasn't particularly brilliant during the year. University and the relationship have been somewhat stable for a while but they aren't the full point of the story. 

My mother who I am quite attached to went through a rather turbulent time as she began to self harm due to various reasons, which were partly caused by me indirectly alongside issues that I also feel impacted by.

I have a disjointed family to put it nicely, it's rather difficult to be able to have relationships with relatives without it becoming family politics alongside a terminally ill grandfather whom most of the politics revolve around. I haven't really kept in contact with my family due to this, I try when I get the opportunity but its rare.

I was quite poor last year so I had to borrow off of my mother which I didn't realise put her in quite deep debt (I wasnt able to get a job and when I did it was an awful job which required me to travel 50 miles to be treated like garbage which I left as mentally I couldn't cope as it was around 12 hours a shift).

I feel like I also give up a large deal of who I am to be in this relationship. I love my partner I really do, but I can't help that feel that I might not be in the right relationship. I have things I want to do in life and I've had to put them aside as my partner says that if I want to do them then my partner will not be in my life e.g go on a friends holiday where my partner will not be invited. Alongside many other things. 

Part of me also thinks that I don't really have any true friends bar one, most of them seem to care when I'm either about or when they're lonely. Don't get me wrong I get invited to things but I feel as if I'm a burden especially because I have to ask my partner to make sure that they won't get mad with me. 

I won't lie sometimes I think if this whole thing is worth it. Which is a hard topic to bring up to family, especially my mother who had to see her siblings corpse when going to check up on them to find out that her sibling had commited suicide. 

There's many more things that have happened prior to this but I'm not really comfortable talking about them. 

TL;DR

Family issues, relationship issues, friendships and feeling down in the bottom of the dumps. Is there a way out without making one of these factors worse?

329,"Hi all, 

I'm a little lost in life any any advice given would be a great help. 

I am 24, currently working in a warehouse where I would have been working for nearly 7 years. From here I have learnt different skills such as admin, customer service, warehouse NVQ level 2, customer service short course and have just recently been asked to be a team leader. 

In 2012 I finished my A levels achieving two A's and b at BTEC level. I went to uni to study forensic biology. However I was only there a few weeks as I didnt know if the course would be right for me and I had just started working and really enjoyed that at the time. Also, if i would have stayed i would have had to start paying for my course, as i didnt know if it was right I decided to drop out. Now years on I really regret my decision to leave and often wonder what my life could have been if I would have stayed at uni. 

I'm seriously thinking about going back but wondering if that is the right thing to do. I would be 26 when I start my course, is that to old to go to uni? I would be 30 when I graduate. I'm also unsure what to study. I feel like I have missed out on an amazing oppunity and I don't want life to pass me by with more regrets. 

Has anyone else been in a similar situation or offer any life advice? Thank you.

344,"Me (M/20) Her (F/20)

I have this friend that I talk to everyday- we confide in each when we’re down or stressed out, we talk about virtually everything from small talk about daily life to history, books, current events, etc. I initially started being attracted to her about 2 months after we met. I just thought we had a lot in common and I appreciated how much time and effort she put into our friendship. So I told her and she said 1) It’s been awhile since I’ve been in a relationship and 2) I mostly just see you as a friend. So after that I have tried for months to ignore those feelings I have for her but they are still there. I guess I just keep mistaking her interest in our friendship as anything more, but it’s just difficult for me when she does things like:  She stays up until 3-4AM talking to me on the phone or sending me messages when she knows she has work the next day at 9AM or 12PM (Depending on the day), I casually recommend a movie and she watches it within a week (That has happened about 5 times), I told her I liked a book by Seneca, and she told me how much she liked it too after she finished it, 2 weeks after I said I liked it, I didn’t even recommend the book to her (A book?!). This may have been totally benign but she told me on New Years before she left, “Oh, by the way I wanted to tell you, meeting you was one of the best things that happened to me in 2018, so thank you.” When she becomes upset or emotional I’m there to listen to her and be there for her (and vice verse too, it’s not just a one-way street), when we hangout she sometimes gives me gifts spontaneously, we use cutesy nicknames with each other. And again, we talk every day. If not in person, it’s through the phone, and I sometimes wonder how much we get done just given the walls of text we send each other.

So it’s incredibly difficult for me to stop having feelings for her, especially when I see how much she cares about me, all of these previously mentioned things  happened roughly after the first time I told her I have feelings for her. But I’m afraid to tell her again because I don’t want to make things awkward and ruin a friendship like this. At the same time it feels like there are bricks on my chest and I don’t know what to do. Should I tell her again (with the intention of seeking a relationship), keep trying to ignore my feelings for her (Maybe they’ll go away eventually), tell her I’m not asking for a relationship but just letting her know these feelings still exist and I just want to be transparent(?), or something completely different?

347,"Hey, thanks for taking time to read. This may end up being a bit lengthy but I'm really in need of some advice here. 

My friend (Meg) and I are in our mid-twenties now and we've been best friends for almost 15 years. She's got a whole load of issues. She raised her 3 younger siblings because she has alcoholic parents, she was groomed and abused at one point in her late teens, and lots of other terrible things. She's certainly gone through a lot. Due to all this she has lots of issues with her mental health and now she's started abusing drugs as her way to help cope and this and then caused her to be fired from her job. Now she can't stay sober long enough to get any work. So she's struggling, always has been, and I've been there since we were kids, doing what I can but without getting too involved. 

It's been getting really hard to stay by her side as she's gotten worse- probably for the last 2 years or so. It's gotten to the stage now where I feel like she's keeping me around so she can get things from me, not because she considers me a friend any longer. 

For example, because she just sits in her house doing drugs all day, I always try and invite her out every couple of weeks so she can get out and do normal things and take her mind off of her shit. Sometimes she's had no money to do these things in the past so I'd let her borrow it and she'd pay me back. But now she doesn't even bother paying me back. And when I ask her for my money she say she's got none because she's had to buy something stupid like a new TV or whatever.

It's my birthday in a month, we've been friends for 15 years so she knows this. A few days ago I called her to confirm everything as I'm having a small house party with my bf and closest friends. I'm providing most things at the party so it wouldn't cost her much. Anyway, she told me she can't come to my birthday thing because she booked a tattoo so she can't afford it. 

She's  not supportive about anything I do. She doesn't like me talking about anything good in my life so if I mention my job, or university or my boyfriend she'll just bring me down about it. She'll say I shouldn't be with my bf because all men are horrible and he'll turn out to be no different and how getting a degree is a waste of time so I should just quit and save my time/money. 

Another big thing is her cancelling on me. We'll make plans an a few hours before she'll text me saying 'i'm not coming' with no explanation. Then I won't hear from her for days. In fact, I probably don't here from her at all anymore unless I reach out to her. Then she'll go on social media and talk about how she's struggling to go on because she has no friends and no one to support her. I know she's suicidal and self harms as well, but I'm always around and always have been so it makes me feel like shit when she doesn't acknowledge that I've been the only person by her side all these years.

It sounds trivial but it's lots of little things like this that are all beginning to mount up now. I also know she always has some money cause she sells drugs to her friends so makes some money from that. I've wanted to give up on our friendship a lot of times in the past but then I'm reminded of the good things about her. She's been a great friend overall for the past 15 years, she always used to be the person I'd turn to for help. I know she's very sick but I'm not sure if that's becoming an excuse to fuck me around. 

She has lots of good things about her and that's why I feel it's so hard to just give up. She so fun to be around when she does finally make an effort to hang out. She's intelligent and capable of doing anything she puts her mind to but she's just wasting away doing drugs and shit. 

I don't know if she's doing these things to me on purpose and using me or it's part of her illnesses. I don't know if I should give up trying and walk away or continue to support her.

352,"Here's some background information:

I started high school  (single sex) (13 years old for my country) and I met this student and we become friends. Later, we find some more people to make a friend group and eventually we got one and I am confident that this friend group will be an unforgettable one. However, little did I know I will be soon be spiral down into a period of depression...

The problem was that I was a really annoying person who says stupid words and my friends really hated me because they gave me every chances and I dont take it seriously because I was like : ""really, surely they are kidding me"" . However I realise that its real when they start blocking me and run away from me everytime I am near them. The worst part is that if I report to the year coordinator, they will find a way to win the argument and I get punished while they don't which is really unfair. At this point I was so pissed off and depressed because no one wanted to help me, i am all by myself and I was really considering suicide as an option. 

Just as when everything is hopeless, I received messages from 2 of my friends from the group that avoided me, telling me that they feel sorry for me and they always defended me whenever they are talking about me behind my back e.g ""whats wrong with him (me), he has done nothing wrong"" They also revealed that everytime they defended me, they were threatened to get kicked out. I asked who was behind all of this and they say that this person  (ill just call him XY) really hated you and convinced the rest to join him. At this point I was really angry and wanted to break his legs so bad. I also wanted to confront him but I remembered that I am not allowed to approach the group because of the year coordinator's consequences given to me.

Out of the blue, something happened that I never expected: XY left the school during my 3rd year in high school and I was so surprised. Then my group apologised to me and we are cool again.  I dont really accept their apology but pretended to for the sake of it. However, I really thanked the 2 friends who backed me because they really gave me hope in a really messed up situation. whenever I decided to watch films or hanging out in malls, those 2 friends are my first choice.  As for the rest I was really careful and be cautious for they were the ones who backstabbed me. 

Couple of years later (5th year in high school), my friends told me that XY said sorry to me and he wants to be friends with me again. He really regretted bullying me because he was just a young kid and was stupid. However, I never accepted his apology and wish that he can shove it up somewhere because he messed up my high school life and my personality and character is no longer the same. Now I am really a quiet person in contrast to the first 2 years where i am not scared to speak. I want to say anything but like I said I need to be careful. Everytime I lay down on the bed to sleep, I am always haunted by him and it cannot go away. Also here is the thing: Yes i was annoying but that shouldn't matter since we are ""friends"" right? Like I seen some of my friends doing weird shit but they dont care at all. One thing is for sure, they are ""fake friends"". So overall, my question is that: should I be friends to a person who bullied me badly but apologised or just ignore him. Also, once I enter university where I can find new people, I am thinking of ending my friendship with the people in the group except the 2 friends because there is no point being friends with backstabbing assholes so should I?

354,"Ok, so this is a throwaway account, I usually don't share my feelings and ask for advice, so please bear with me if I ramble for a bit, this is new to me.

So a little background:
I'm male [25] and my sister is [29] (we do not live in the US if this makes any difference).

She has a history of being problematic, getting herself into debt, neglect responsibility, lie constantly and a bit of drug use (though, I would not classify her as a drug addict).

Needless to say she has caused quite a bit of trouble for our family, mainly my dad, by being dependent and someone always needed to cover for her debts.

In the last couple of years she is dating a former addict to drugs and gambling, who really seems to help her get her head straight.

Really, that guy is taking his life very seriously, and it made a great impact on her.

But, a few months ago they had a falling out, I'm assuming that it's because she started turning back into her bad habits (no drugs though, that's what I know for sure) and they sort of broke up

That sent her into a rough patch and she and my dad decided it would be best for her to go into treatment in a closed facility who can help addicts (both physical and emotional addicts, she falls more to the latter category).

About a month ago she was kicked out of that facility for being problematic and causing too much trouble for the staff and not accepting treatment, and came back home.

All in all she was there for 3 months out of 9-12 months that the staff told us the process usually take.

END OF BACKGROUND.

Today, me and her casually talked and she started telling me that when she was 7, our cousin used to touch her (he was 10 or 11 at the time, so a kid himself), and that at 17 she was at her friend's house (he was her introduction to harder drugs, but as far as I know not a bad person, just someone who did drugs at age 18-19)

He went out to buy something while she was supposed to sleep over (she was really close with his family, so felt at home), one of his friends who was there beat and raped her.

She says she does not know his name, or remembers how he looked like, she repressed a lot.

My cousin grew up to be a criminal and was killed when I was 16 or so by a bomb placed in his car

And my sister's friend (not the rapist) died from an OD about a year ago

I never know any of this, I am kind of a closed person, never had friends really and when I was younger just felt depressed and stuck in my own head.

I never saw or knew any of these situations, but I didn't bother finding out either, all I saw was a sister who from the moment I can remember was argumentive, kept fighting me (a lot of time physically, too though I am much bigger then her so I never hit back or saw her as any thret)

All my life I always felt like a pushover because I tend to keep my emotions aside (there are times where I can feel almost emotionally numb, or if I'm not I really want to be) and do the logical thing (it's generally to avoid being involved with problematic people, involve them in my life or let a single confrontation make me angry and violent)

And I really do not know what to do right now.

What do I say to her, what to do next.

I'm sick of just rolling with life and try to tough out hard situations logically (there we're many, not related to my sister), it usually mean to get kicked down and just dust off and go on.

All my life I felt defeated by life, and I don't want this asshole who fucking raped my sister to just live life. It's not fair.

I don't even know if it's possible to find him (only hint to the guy was the friend who OD'ed) or what the hell I want to do if I do find him.

But I just feel so helpless, useless and lost again.

I don't even know what I'm asking here...
Maybe I just need to hear some outside perspective on all of this...

357,"First post, not sure how this works really. Let me know if I’m breaking any rules here.

I’ve been trying for a while now to gain traction for my various art accounts on social media, but I’m  struggling to figure out the best places to start out. It’s just really frustrating to be stuck at the same amount of followers with no real way to get out there.  I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations to which sites would be the best to start an account to sell art (Etsy, etc.). Or would it be more beneficial to create my own website? If so what programs work well? 

Note: not trying to promote myself here, but I felt that advice from real people with experience is better than all the ads and clickbait that pop up with a google search ",15Jan2019,1
358,"So I was dating this girl for a long time, and we were really in love. Then one day she up and leaves me. Saying that she's not happy anymore and she needs to make a change. I was absolutely shredded and the months go by. And she starts the whole ""let's just be friends instead"" stuff with me. And I go along with it because I still love her, despite knowing how unhealthy that is. She tells me at about this time that she's seeing someone, which I did not handle well at all. So I kind of dissappear. I stop returning her calls, I don't see her anymore. Not because I'm angry, but because it hurts me too much to think about her with someone else. Never mind actually hearing her talk about it. So after all this I decide to go on a few dates and try to move on. But no one measures up to her. I know that seems picky but Im having trouble putting into words how similar we were.
So I give up on that, and decide to just do nothing for a while. After a few months she calls me, saying that she's upset and worried about be because I've been avoiding her. I agree to meet her and I find out that her new relationship ended almost as soon as it began. I still hate hearing her talking about it though. That last part happened a few weeks ago, and since then I've been thinking more and more. And a few days ago, she tells me that she doesn't know what she wants, and that she feels cruel to saying that to me. Now all of this has brought up a lot of stuff that I tried really hard (albeit unsuccessfully) to bury.
Shes been alot more close to me lately, I might be reading into things that I just wish were there. And I've been, for the last few days, contemplating going over to her place (formerly our place) and just telling her how I feel. And that I want to try again.
But I'm so afraid that if she doesn't feel the same ill push her away. But if that's the case then ill just be were I was a month ago.
Anyway I really need some perspective on this because I really love her, and I'm torn between laying it all out there and possibly losing her completely, and saying nothing and watching her move on.

359,"I work for a mental health charity. I'm more admin but I also work with people. I'm part time, I'm the only admin and tbh, I'm overworked. Most of the people they hire can't work the computers a lot of them think that their email is connected to their specific computer, and I've often been called to their desk as their unable to access a webpage as ""I usually press this button and it just opens up"". Obviously, this is not my job. I have also installed 5 new computers, software included during my working hours, I also have to answer emails, phone calls and walk-ins as well as manage an art therapy course, and of course administrate the organisation (paying the staff the bills keeping the building going).

They ask me to do all of this as it's a small organisation so we ""all help eachother out"" which roughly translates as making me do they work they can't/won't do. I don't pass on my work to anyone as no one else is able or willing to do it. This means that when people load work onto me, some of it doesn't get done very fast. I have tried to explain this multiple times in supervisions, through multiple emails and to both managers.

I also have a mental illness, I have had to have time off because of that and have a disciplinary letter on file as my mental health was not a good enough reason for time off. Again, for a mental health charity, and the length of time I have been with my condition, as well as the severity means it is classified as a disability. 

I am trying to get help for it to, but I have been messed around by my colleagues,one second they are too busy to see me as a patient, and then one of them said they would see me for CBT but now she has changed her mind, said no, and I didn't hear from her for over 2 months. I told both managers and they seemingly did nothing but tell my colleague she had to see me in some other way (but my colleague has already told me this way would not work for me, so I'm not that excited by it tbh)

I cannot face going back to work and I don't know what to do. I have applied for other jobs but I'm not sure how understanding they will be of my condition. I have also rang the dr's for a sick not from work as I'm too scared to go back. I feel depressed and empty thinking about it. I can't sleep because I'm so scared of having to return to a place of work that treats me like shit.

What do I do, should I call my managers and tell them I intend to get signed off sick? Should I let them know how I feel? I have tried my hardest to make this work, but nothing I do seems to help and I don't feel listened to. ",15Jan2019,1

363,"My mother passed away two months ago from breast cancer. She was wheelchair bound for the last six years of her life and spent her free time researching and collecting occult items. She was a class A hoarder and had her bedroom and bathroom full of stuff she thought had powers, when most of it was just someone's art. She bought an ""evil native American amulet"" online which is obviously a scam. No tribe was specified, and it's made of metal when they didn't have forges before European people colonized them. There are also satanic symbols carved onto it. She thought it made her more intelligent and confident, and she loved having it around.

I'm an atheist (and she also claimed to be one), and I don't believe in any of this stuff.

My self confidence bad as YouTube rewind 2018 and I get bullied a lot. The only reason that I dont change school is because I feel like I wont have it much better there. 

I cant talk about this to my mother, she is a little too positive and would probably say something along the lines of ""Dont worry, you can always make new friends!"" while my father would probably just say that I am only imagining things.

369,"Hey everyone so my bf and I have been together for almost 3 years now...and we have a 3 year old kid. Yeah. So when I met him, I was going thru what I can only think was a manic episode. I am not an outgoing, confident person. While going thru that phase, I felt a huge wave of confidence taking over me every day. I tried hard to look my best, I made a lot of new friends at work, and I attracted my bf. The bout of confidence ended about 3 months into our relationship and I was completely back to my old quiet, introverted self when I became pregnant. We began having problems left and right about everything, combined that with my now, unplanned pregnancy and depression and it was hell. We had absolutely no connection and even less sex. He always claimed he couldn’t do it because “of the baby” or any other excuse. 

I also caught him talking to women online and there was this specific friend he always kept mentioning and comparing me to, I felt. In his words she was amazing because she was assertive, classy, stylish, and positive. I was none of those. That hit me pretty much in the heart and I’ve never forgotten about it. We talked about it in couples therapy but he insists he doesn’t and never has had other feelings towards her. He never mentions her anymore, but I know for a fact he follows her on social media. 

Fast forward to now, everything seems a lot more stable. We broke up about a year ago but decided to try again about 3 months ago. We both attended and will attend therapy for both and individually. I’m going to school, work, and have a plan whereas before, I was very unhappy being a SAHM. My mood doesn’t seem to be depressed all the time, i feel like I’m content with the way things are now. In no way am I assertive or confident, let’s get that clear. So I’m in a better place mentally, but I’m still not his type correct? 

Actually I’m not his type at all. I know what he likes in women and I have 0 of those qualities both in my personality and on the outside. Yet he says he wants us to be a family, he loves me, he’s happy. I can’t see it because his actions contradict everything he says. He’s always been a huge liar and a good one too although he knows that i know him very well now so he doesn’t try it anymore with me, but he lies everywhere else to get his way. I just can’t shake this feeling in my gut that he’s only trying this hard because of our kid. When I’m with him, I’m treated more as a roommate than a girlfriend. 
When he tells me I love you, I feel nothing and I have a huge problem trying to say it back. 

This hurts me deeply but I feel like we both have to accept that our beginning was a mistake and that we’re now just trying hard to force a relationship because of a child. Can everyone please tell me what they think? Is my intuition right? ",15Jan2019,1

372,"Hey Reddit I'm here solely because I don't know where else to get advice from and I'd really appreciate your advice because right now I am lost.

So my siblings (18 M and 19 F) have still not completed high school, my brother is in his last year whereas my sister ""graduated"" but is going back into my brother's year to repeat and try to get good grades. 
That's where the problem stems, they both have bad grades due to a variety of different reasons with the most prominent being the fact that they expect to be given everything on a silver platter and not work for it. 
They never try to accomplish anything to the point that my brother blames my mother for his recent weight gain. My dad has a slight temper issue and suffers from diabetes and hypertension so my siblings never confront him, rather deciding to cowardly assail my mother with their complaints. My mum takes the assault and sugarcoats the requests so that my dad doesn't do anything rash.

They're always talking behind my parents backs and I'm always telling them how my dad went from homeless with 7 siblings to a stable middle class family and that angers them to the point that they constantly bully me and I tend to ignore them, which leads them to think I have a superiority complex.

Back to the main point, my siblings came to my mum about 3 hours ago and yelled at her saying that my dad and her ruined their lives (just so you know my mother is the kindest soul in the world and is constantly handling their shit).
My mother suffers from a great deal of heart issues, has gone through several procedures and medicates daily.
My siblings started their verbal assault and my mum started crying and saying that her left arm was going numb, to which my brother called her a drama queen and turned his face. Thankfully I  rushed in and got her aspirin and her medication in time and her condition is slowly stabilising. 

But what scares me is the fact that they're so sociopathic that they don't give a rat's arse on whether their mother died or not and they bully me on the fact that I actually care for my parents.
I'm lost here, what I want is for their toxic arses to leave and never come in our lives again, but my mums to compassionate and still loves them.

374,"So I'm using a throwaway, clearly.

I work for an amazing company that's doing really, really well. We just bought a suite of new iMacs to replace some old ones that we've had for awhile. 

Last year we did the same thing. So there are some 2017 iMacs in the office mixed in with 2015s and older. And a handful of 2018 iMacs waiting to replace the old ones. There are more computers than people, but we have interns seasonally who fill the empty spaces. As the old computers are replaced, they wind up in a box somewhere or just left wherever they were last used and never touched again. Perhaps they'll be donated?

So here's my fuck up and why I'm looking for advice.

My mom just took over her own business and needs a new computer. I'd been thinking about taking one of the old computers and gifting it to her for some time. Not trying to be malicious to the company in any way, but they don't use it and she definitely could, so what's the harm?

Well I did take one on Friday. And gave it to her over the weekend. We factory reset it and set it all up for her. She's very excited.

Today I realized that **I took a 2017 computer which was totally fine and would be used for an intern coming in a few months**. At least one other person in the office noticed ""there was a new one that worked fine at this desk"" and kind of questioned it, but ""meh'ed"" it off for now. I've been internally freaking out all morning.

I have some options:

1) Come clean with my mom. Say I shouldn't have taken this computer, it was the wrong one, factory reset it *again* and bring it back some night, hoping nobody notices.

2) Come clean with my bosses. Say I took a newer computer home for my mom thinking it was one that was scheduled to be replaced. Beg for forgiveness.

3) Replace the missing 2017 with another 2017 from the other side of the office that hasn't been used in several months (and who knows what kind of tangent that might cause...)

4) Play dumb and pray it all works out.

5) Other ideas?

I know I'm a fucking stupid idiot. I do love this company and I love my mom and I just took the wrong computer, thinking that it could be replaced and that would be that. Nobody's hurt in the process.

375,"Morning!

I am looking for some advice as a white American working for a Chinese owned business (in the US). 

Some background: I have been working for a science company for about 3 months and it turns out that I really like it a lot. Most all of my colleagues are Chinese citizens and English is not their native language. There are some language difficulties occasionally, but it hasn’t really been a big issue. As an example, the person I work closest with has issues understanding if I use slang or speak too fast. So, I slow down and use (mostly) proper English. Nbd. 

My question stems more from a cultural understanding. I would like to know if there are more subtle cultural issues I might not know about. “Don’t be an asshole” and “Not everyone is American, ya ignorant twat” are already covered. I am more worried about \*accidentally\* being an asshole and having no idea I’m being offensive. 

For example, Chinese New year is approaching. We get off of work (yay!), but what does that mean for them? 

Are there rigid ideas of hierarchy? What is a typical Chinese work ethic? Would they be offended if I try to learn Mandarin (which i can only guess is the language they use because they just say “Chinese”)?

Any advice for me would be helpful!

Alright so, this ""dude"", I'll call him Nick. Obviously that isn't his real name. Nick and my SO dated her freshman year (she's a senior now) and he left her after a month because she didn't kiss him. Fast forward a year, we fall in love and start dating within a month of knowing each other. I never liked Nick, he just had a very bad personality. But I trusted my girlfriend with my life, I knew she wouldn't do anything. 

Then about 3 months ago, Nick and one of my girlfriend's best friends start dating, and break up. They dated for maybe too months. Nick tells Haley (I'm going to use that as my SO's name now) that he dated her friend because she reminded him of her. I'm mad, but again, I trust her. Then they start talking more, and she tells me that they're friends again. I personally don't understand how you can be friends with someone who broke your friends heart like that, but oh well. 

Then about a 2-3 weeks ago, me and Haley split up. She said the work load was too  overwhelming for her. I believed it, she was a very busy person. So I let it happen. But then. Oh my God. But *then* we fast forward to today. And Haley's friend is confronting her this morning, and I was right next to them. Haley's friend says ""Are you sure you're just his friend? Because friends don't kiss."" And my heart shattered.  I turned to her, and asked ""You kissed Nick?"" And she said yes, but it was an accident. Or not her choice, whatever. She claimed they were hanging out after school and having a deep conversation when he kissed her. Now idk about you guys, but I think there's plenty enough time to cook your head back from a kiss.

She also takes advantage of me and this other friend of ours every chance she gets but she can also turn into an angel in a minute and make us laugh uncontrollably so we never know what to think of her.
I think it would be better for us both to cut her off but we have no idea how to do it, since she's a master at manipulation and will only use this to turn against us, especially after how the rest of our class have cut her off.

We only started noticing something off after we noticed she hated people out of jealousy. Not the usual trash talking, but deep hate. I can't help but think she secretly keeps judging us too. Her main motto is 'Every man for himself' and that honestly summarises her character. 
I understand her behaviour because that's how she was brought up and that's the people around her who have affected her this way but it can get too much for me sometimes.

If this was online then I honestly feel it would be much easier for me and my friend to cut her off but since we have to see her every day (for school) with her sitting beside us for 5-ish hours, we have no idea what to do. Any advice?

383,"Hello everyone! 

I recently graduated with a B.S. in Biology and was planning to pursue dentistry. However, after taking a gap year to really evaluate the decision, I don’t think dentistry is my “passion” rather a logical life choice. (It’s a stable and lucrative and something I haven’t questioned in a long time.I enjoy the focus and precision it requires but I worry that the tedium will outweigh the stability and money) After speaking with my old advisor she recommended I look into patent law and become a lawyer. This is a completely new realm for me and despite doing research on the topic I still feel very lost.

I have been applying for entry level position at firms that do patents and other related work, however, I have not been very successful. I’ve spoken to quite a few lawyers here and there (none who do patent work) and they all dislike what they do. They discourage me from pursuing law but can never elaborate as to why they feel this way. I know the way in which practicing professionals felt about their work greatly influenced my decision of dentistry over medicine. I would greatly appreciate hearing the thoughts on this career choice from someone who practice patent law in STEM.

My questions are if I were to pursue a career in patent law what subject area should I focus on to make myself most attractive to potential employers. I was initially considering pursuing a duel J.D./Ph.D degree in life science (pharm/ antibiotics/ biotech) however, from what I can tell people in this field have extensive lab/research work under their belts (that I would lack) so I’m concerned that I would not be competitive in this subject area. Additionally, from what I can I can tell it seems tech or engineering would be the better focus and I would only need an M.S./J.D., but my question would again be what specific area within these fields is worth pursuing. Also - if generally the patent field in STEM is as over saturated as other fields in law. These are questions/discussions I was hoping to have with a mentor once I was hired somewhere but like I mentioned I haven’t had any luck.

Currently, I am considering pursuing enrollment in a 2 month long program to obtain a paralegal certificate so as to add to my resume as well as expose myself to the legal field and gauge whether it truly interest me,however, I wonder if this is a waste of time and if i should just focus on the DAT (dental admissions test) to enroll in dental school.  I know everyone says I’m young and have plenty of time but I know I will need more schooling in whatever I want to pursue so I would like to start that process ASAP.

Just as a side note the reasons I’m considering patent law are : that I would like to stay in the general field of science as that is something I truly enjoy, I like the idea of constantly doing research and having to learn/be in know (one of the reasons I’m not fully sold on dentistry), I have worked in a lab and done research and feel that it’s not really for me, and finally the idea of being at the forefront of innovation sounds appealing to me.

384,"So, my dad never liked doctors and always tries to avoid getting checked out. We suspect he has something wrong with his bowel but he refuses to go to the doctor. Every time I ask him ( it’s on the phone, we live in different countries) he pretends not to hear me, or gets angry and changes the subject. 

My parents live together but their relationship is strained and when my mum asks him to go, he basically tells her that he will die soon anyway. 

His symptoms according to my mum are: frequent visits to the toilet even through the night (constantly  pooping/diarrhoea), blood in stool, pain (apparently dad has been taking a lot of paracetamol for a few months).

So about a few months ago I met a great friend from streaming (what I love to do) and world Voice chat in discord all the time, chill, play games, etc. I helped defend him against an old group he had that tried to bully him with texts, stalk him, etc and he wanted nothing to do with that old group he use to hang out with.  Well once that was over he had lung cancer and went into surgery. During surgery his mother and step father tried to kill him for his money. They tried to pull the plug on his medication tube and even sent some of his family members to do so.  He did make it out successfully thankfully but later learned he now has a brain tumor. His own mother put a bounty over his head cause he went  into hiding since he was being hunted down.  Long story short they captured the people seeking him out, went to court the other day, and he won the case. 

Now for my issue, over the course of this time, a few months, I have been in discord none stop cause he ""sees"" and ""feels"" things or people trying to hurt him due to the tumor. It makes him hallucinate really bad and all I ever hear is how they want to kill him, hurt him, the voices screaming, etc. I've talked him out of suicide so many times. But it's been so draining on my end.  He can't get help cause he only has money for the surgery and is basically crazy. I've slept under my desk at home for a month now with the camera on cause it makes him feel better.  The thing is, is that he has nobody else, no family at all, just me and one person kind of taking care of him/scheduling treatments.  Idk how much more I can take.  Im 22, in college, can barely do what I want anymore and stuck at home most of my days cause he can't handle it.  It's starting to ruin my life. But what do I do? I feels so bad by dropping all contact with him cause I know he will end it the day I do that and surgery is probably 2 or 3 weeks away.  Im not sure how I could handle knowing I killed or have then hurt themselves due to the ""voices"" I feel so trapped and strained to do what i once loved... ",15Jan2019,1

He talked to her almost exclusively on Snapchat, which was a red flag to me because he never had daily conversations with anyone on Snapchat ever before. I mean. This girl had the yellow heart by her name. Which apparently means they were the most snapped person to each other. And there were a lot of video and voice calls between them. So I asked him about it. He denied that anything was going on. He asks me to trust him. So I brush it off. But I notice things that led me to believe she had feelings for him. So I told this to him. Which he denied. And told me to stop worrying. At the same time, we were having problems in our relationship. He was being very distant and cold. And it made me think I’d done something or that something was going on. I have anxiety and he mainly blamed it on me and my anxiety and mistrust, citing that I made it hard to live with me. We’d argued several times. Even on our anniversary. I begged him to be honest with me about whatever was bothering him. He kept denying anything was going on and the only thing bothering him was how I was acting. Well. Last night he admits to me that way back before our anniversary, they both admitted to each other that they have feelings for each other. And at that time he said he made it clear to her that he was in a relationship and they apparently agreed nothing was going to come of their feelings. He admitted that since then, he hasn’t felt ready to tell me, trying to “figure it out for himself” as he puts it and was afraid of how I’d react.

I am not sure why I act like this or how to stop it. I try to think the opposite, that I should go or do what I'm currently thinking about skipping out on, but I always find a way to justify looping back around back to the thought process that started it all. IE, ""Oh, I have Logic or Human Nutrition today? It's just a lecture and the quiz/exam isn't today so I can skip."" This has led to me to dropping out of not one semester, but three. I have wasted my families money to the point that they won't pay for my tuition and I am not angry nor complaining about that. I have only myself to blame for the decisions I made that led me to that particular outcome. I am so reprehensible that when my 25 yr old sister passed away unexpectedly in 2016 I used it as an opportunity to  justify skipping classes and dropping everything. She passed away in October and yet I was skipping classes that semester before she had even moved. I lie to the faces of the people I love when I tell them that school is going good or that I am job hunting/have interviews but yet nothing I tell myself has any true weight behind it.

411,"I am having trouble making a living and I don't know what to do about it. Here's a bit about me and what I'm doing to make things better.

&amp;#x200B;

I am in my mid-30s. I graduated from the University of South Florida with a degree in Economics. I started the anime club there in 2002, it still operates. I grew up in Germany where I went to an American high school and I speak German. I have visited more foreign countries (including Bahrain, Guatemala, and Japan) than I have American states. I survived some very bad years (Mom attempted suicide, took care of mom through triple-negative breast cancer, grandfather killed himself, another grandfather died from old age, being fired, 4 wheeler crash, etc...) despite being diagnosed with General Anxiety and Major Depression. I have had trouble focusing on a particular expertise because I find that I am talented at many things. I'm a pretty good person, I think.

&amp;#x200B;

I am single with no kids, but I am not concerned about this at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

My work experience includes operating and partial ownership of two companies: an RV park chain catering to oil fields and a solar system sales and installation company. The RV park business died with the oil boom in 2014 and the solar company died when the US put 250% import taxes on Chinese-made solar panels at the end of 2015. Before that, I had a high level clearance job at a uranium enrichment plant doing super-detail oriented work and leak testing. I was fired from that job because I did what I was told (long, bitter story). I am currently a Logistics Technician at a cannabis grow in Boulder, CO. I have the responsibility of supervising contractors for every harvest, maintaining inventory, packaging, and transporting product). This, unfortunately, does not pay well enough to live where I work ($12.50/hr and the company has made it impossible to get more than 35hrs/week) and the company is going through some bad changes.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently planning on moving to western Michigan (near Grand Rapids where cost of living is lower than Colorado, but still nice) with a great friend I made here in Boulder. I have friends in the area and my roommate has lots of family there. We will share whatever living space we move into. This will cut expenses down. I hope to buy a property quickly with a USDA loan and that should cut my expenses a bit more while putting money towards myself. I do my damnedest to think through every financial decision, big or small. I have no debt. 

&amp;#x200B;

My problem is that I have found it tremendously difficult to get a worthwhile job. Even my current job was obtained after sending out 214 applications (I kept a spreadsheet). I created the RV and solar companies with a partner (did not make money on these). I am certain that I only got the uranium enrichment job because of nepotism (thanks, cuz!). I have essentially no contacts. My high school friends are spread around the world and I don't know them any more. My college buddies work in unrelated fields and are also spread around in places I don't want to live. I have LinkedIn and a variety of other social job hunting accounts, but there isn't much more there than what I have already listed. My roommate and I plan on making a YouTube channel, but I do not count on that being successful enough to live on.

I am near my wit's end trying to figure out what to do with my life. What more can I do to get a decent job? I'm not asking for much, I think. I have a good resume and I succinctly describe my experiences with a cover letter with every job application. Am I stuck with entry level jobs because I have no connections?

On top of the noise, the apartment is constantly hotboxed with weed to point where you’ll cough and your eyes will start watering upon entering. Upon talking to the leasing agent she said “weeeell we do have an open apartment but we can’t move you because we don’t have anyone to take your place.” Upon asking if I could terminate the lease she said I could but I’ll have to pay the rent for the entire rest of the year which will be around 6,000 - 7,000. For a place I can’t stay at. 

She’s been made aware several times that they’re both smoking and selling weed which is an immediate eviction according to the lease and security has been called at least 5 times due to the noise.

The only thing preventing me from calling the police is that we could possibly all be charged with possession since they leave their drugs and paraphernalia out in the common area and I know they aren’t going to take responsibility for it and the apartment would deny any knowledge of it even though I’ve reported it several times.

420,"This might have to start with a backstory and a few details to provide appropriate context:

- I have one friend who has had some bad mental issues (bipolar, depression, multiple personality disorder, history of self harm) and I'll call her SWT in this post

-Multiple friends and aquaintances of mine have a history of self harm

In early eighth grade, I was barely holding up my friendship with SWT, we've been friends for nine or ten years, and she had begun to almost kind of ignore me, at least from my perspective. You see, I'm an introverted person, and I have social anxiety, general anxiety, and low confidence, and barely any self esteem. When she started to ignore me, I thought that she didn't like me anymore. It was making me incredibly anxious and hurt, and I was becoming depressed as a result of the stress of unrelated factors and SWT. Since I was used to being around self harmers, I soon started to hurt myself. Unsuprisingly, I started to become suicidal as time went on. Months passed, and I eventually got medicine in late second quarter, I then stopped my harmful ways for now.

Skip to now, I'm so anxious, I'm afraid I'm going to lose my friends when/if they move to another school. I'm also afraid that they hate me, but they insist that they don't. I haven't told a single adult about any of this. I'm a very secretive person, and I refuse to tell anyone else besides the few friends I've told. I'm scared that I'll fall back into that depression if I get any more anxious, what should I do?

I'd go into more detail, but I have limited time to write this, please forgive me.

Then I realized that she was just using me because she didn’t want me to tell anyone and didn’t want to talk to me or hang out with me after school. My parents said I should tell her I’m not going with her and find someone else. I told her and she seemed genuinely upset and I look like a big douche. They’re not forcing me to go to prom but they really want me to and now I don’t have a date. I’m not going by myself, everyone’s just gonna think the emo loser couldn’t find a date. None of my friends are going either. The only other girl I would want to go with would never go with me.

I just don't know how to keep a conversation going with strangers.

Sorry English isn't mother tongue so there could be some inconvenient expressions.

I got the problem that there are many things I can hardly remember. Very common problem, right? But I got the feeling that it's really different for me.

A few days ago I had friends here and I asked ""How was Silvester?"". They told me we already talked about that topic via phone. We also talked about Silvester last year. My gf said it was very cozy last year, we had our best friends here. But I didn't remember. She said we went out on the balcony to see the fireworks. Still didn't remember. She said we saw the neighbors kid on the other balcony. Then I remembered. But the rest of the day is still under shadow.

When I am at work, sometimes I need to visit coworkers I don't know (I'm in IT Support). So I look their names up in the phone list because there are pictures of everyone, so that I know who to speak with. When I arrive the department I completely forgot the face of the person's I just looked up.

It sucks because often I give promises in my company and don't keep them because I just forget about them. Also I do the same mistakes again and again.

But other of things I can memorize completely. It seems pretty random which things I forget and what keeps in mind.

I did some checks for my short-term memory and I was always average or better... 

I have a lot of bad memories of my childhood. Some strange shit happened there, won't go into detail. I don't know if that is connected with it.

Do you think it is a mental health issue or am I just dumber as I think?

I hate watching the cycle, I try to be the voice of reason, but she will defend her feelings or deny having them at all, even though all of her actions like having bags packed to move into his apartment kind of deal and telling her mother about him point to the opposite.

That being said, it's her life. I dont wanna argue with her or hurt her feelings when shes happy, I just want to be supportive and IF things go south, be there for her through that as well.

432,"Please tell me if this is the wrong sub. Also, sorry for my english


I'm a 18 years old male struggling to ""quench"" his sexual desire. 
In the past, I used to masturbate to porn as a form of getting rid of it, but now I'm aware of how the porn industry commonly mistreats women. I also can't masturbate with only my imagination (without ""looking"" at something) because of a ""mental condition"" I have. No, it's not porn addiction, it's just a weird and specific thing I rather not go into details here.


Real-life sex would certainly also work, but I don't know how to find a sexual partner. All of my friends hookup with other people at bars/clubs/etc, and I'd rather not try anything with a woman who might be under the influence of alcohol, since I won't be sure if there is full consent involved. The fact that I'm a little bad at telling how drunk people are probably makes it worse.
Surprisingly, everyone seems to only meet other people for hooking up at alcohol-related environments. And I'd need to meet new people, since I don't already know potential sexual partners.

I tried spending some months without doing anything to ""satisfact"" my desires, but it seems that, with time, the ""need"" only gets worse.

I also tried searching for amateur porn, ""glamour models"", and naked women magazines. All of those three have problems:

-Amateur websites seen to have lots of leaked stuff. Reddit subs sometimes don't, but many people post there sell stuff (for me this seems too much like professional porn). Even on subs that you can't post merchandise, you can always create a profile that sells content and post free stuff there to ""gather followers"".

-it's hard to find glamour models that didn't have stuff leaked. Also, when I search for it on google I sometimes find women who look like they are underage, which is very disturbing.

-all magazines I found were involved in lots of controversies.



*TL-DR*: what should I do about my sexual desire? Should I find a way to ignore it? Should I find a way to have sex? Is there any place I can found ethical content to masturbate to?

442,"I am a 16 yo girl and I live in Texas with my mom, as I have since I was four. Unfortunately, me and my mom's relationship is not the strongest. Some days she is great and is the best mom I could ever ask for: funny, nurturing, understanding. But others she is just a completely different person. She will go out on weekday nights and come home drunk. But because she is an alcoholic, she doesn't seem drunk. Like no stumbling and no slurring words. But she gets so unreasonably mad at me and everything else in the world. During these times she will bring up things I did months ago. E.G last night she started to screech about me making a 79 in physics last year. She also likes to call me names like whore, slut, bitch, and cunt. Which she says in all serious and never even apologizes for it the next day. She comes storming into my room and throws around my things while screaming how I never do anything around the house. She encouraged ( I wouldn't say forced, but very strongly urged this) that I get a job, then gets mad when my work schedule conflicts with her personal life. She wanted to take me to austin to look at St. Edward's next weekend, a college I made very clear I was not interested in going to even before her idea of road tripping, and although she was completely fine with it when I told her I was working both Saturday and Sunday of that weekend during the day, that night she came home wailing about how I always ruin her plans. She has kicked me out of the house on many of these nights, and last year I even had to stay with my grandparents for two weeks.

The divorce between my parents was not as ugly as some, and it was left to a pretty mutual agreement. I am as close to my dad as you can be to a parent you only see once every two weeks, but we still talk a lot. I have told my dad about these nights and how I wanted to live with him. He and his fiancee seems open to the idea. The only problem is that my father had a series of a couple of strokes last year, and is still on disability from it. So I don't know how financially able he is to take care of me. I am sure that he would be able to make it work, and he really wants me to live with him. I just think that if this case was taken before a judge, his lack of financial security would surely be a blow on his case. On the other hand, my mother's other ex-husband - whom she is currently in the process of divorcing- has lots of texts, audio recordings, and videos which show my mother screaming and throwing up on her nights. I was actually really close to this guy and I know he would testify on my behalf with those things.

Now this section of my inquiry is more a personal discretion that anything else. My mom's parents, are very financially and emotionally supportive. My grandma is probably my best friend. They gave me my car for my birthday and they pay for my private school and when my mom would work night shifts at the hospital, they would always open their doors to me and I would stay with them.

445,"Backstory (question is below):
After the Global recession I went into a deep depression around 2008.
Resorting to drugs to help cope and pass time. 
Being high allowed me to conjure thoughts of grandiose goals. The catch was I didn’t feel like pursuing these goals unless I was high.  

I was taking meaningless jobs that last 6-8months. Longest one was 2 years. Just to support my habit and also the amount of time it took to score drugs. I Also got into relationships and hid my opiate addiction from all my partners. 
Around 2014 I confessed to my then current GF about my addiction. I sought help and eventually got off of self medicating and now I’m at a methadone clinic. I’ve been stable for the passed 4 years and also held my profession for 4 years. During those past 4 years of getting my life together I chose to be single fearing a relationship would take my focus away.

Question: 
I know it’s cliche to say it’s never too late. 
I’m approaching my 40s and live with my parents. 
I seriously feel like I’m picking up where I left off 9 years ago,2009, before I lost myself in drugs and aimless pursuits to get by  financially. 
At times I feel positive and have so much gratitude that I’m not dead or out on the street. Then I go to family parties or friends parties and see all the Success, progress, and achievements they’ve made. In my circle there is no one that can relate to what I’ve been through. 

What advice can someone give to help a person from feeling alone and not like a loser at times? 

I’m not the type to give up but I am the type to get paralyzed by my fears and anxieties. Then in those moments I feel like it’s too late to be successful.

So. I did a stupid and took out a loan for $700 to help a friend.

Said friend was at risk of eviction, due to health issue/fmla stuff. she's supposed to have really close family that loves and adores her but, none of them could help her with this somehow. It got so bad she was messaging me crying over the stress and physical issues from the stress, begging me to help, asking me if I can take out loans. I did not want to do this and I didnt have the stability to do this but, I qualified for the total amount through two different cash advance places with her there with me. When this happened she and I wrote out an agreement stating that she would pay back the amount minus $100 that I used for myself. She's made one payment in the beginning. Then she lost her job.

During the process of all of this she made a suicide attempt that put her back in the hospital. She was still friends with me but daily talking about the stress and frustration while I attempted my best to help her find work. It got to the point she was asking me for rides places and to do things with her during times that I have to sleep so that I can function at my job. After a while of that she started messaging me and then responding immediately again with ""I don't know why I bothered asking, I'm sorry I bothered you"". 

A few months ago she messaged me that she couldn't deal with it anymore she was leaving and would not tell me what was going on, wouldn't tell me anything. I finally got it out of her that she was going to a shelter and she didn't know if she expected to live through it but she told me to expect a check for $1,000 in 2 weeks. Since then ive seen posts about her new job and we have talked once on our birthday (we share a birthday). she's removed me from Facebook or fb decides to do it on its own and I sent her a message this morning asking how she was hoping to start a conversation about everything.


So here I am, I'm unable to make payments due to my own situation, the loans are accruing interest monthly and she seems to be dodging. What do I do at this point, she has enough health issues and is fragile, I'm worried that pushing her could cause another break down but I can't afford to pay back the loan myself and she is currently working.

Do those things ever go to credit? Should I get a lawyer I can't afford? Try small claims court? How do I even discuss this with her now? No I dont know the current total, I've been too scared to go in and find out as I've never had these loans before.

Tldr: took out a loan to help a friend, seems like they're trying to ditch on the loan now that they have another job. still worried pushing will cause distress enough to try another suicide attempt. 
I know I shouldnt have done this but hindsight isnt going to pay this loan.",15Jan2019,1

451,"First post, I apologize for formatting (I'm on mobile), but I really need some insight on what could be the biggest decision of my life. I'm currently studying audio engineering and jazz performance at one of the top music schools in the country. 

I want to make it clear that academics, although stressful, are not why I am considering dropping out- I have a 4.0 gpa, Dean's list, all that crap. I also have a full scholarship to this school (50,000/year), which I do not take for granted and is probably the biggest reason I have to stay in school. I know that even if I drop out now and try to come back to studying again in the future, it will be impossible to get the same kind of money from a prestigious institute. 

Besides some typical (but very real) mental health problems everyone seems to have and bitch about (anxiety and depression for me), a main reason I am considering dropping out is because I hate music. Yes. A music student who hates music. My parents more or less forced me to play classical music throughout my childhood. 

When I was about twelve, I actually began to enjoy some (different kinds of) music for the first time, and began to write my own music. In the years since then, this passion has gradually faded again. Music makes me feel nothing. I can't listen to music for the sake of listening to music- Im too therotically analytical about it and miss the whole point most of the time- emotion. 

In addition, my social life is horrible. I've made no friends at school and spend my weekends alone on campus doing work or dicking around doing nothing. The only thing I seem to care about is my girlfriend, who lives far away and I rarely get to see, although we do the best we can with the whole long distance thing. 

I've always had a super selfish messed up view about playing music. I don't enjoy playing, but I guess I take pleasure in being able to do it, if that makes sense. It's always been something I can do to impress people, but I'm getting sick of that now and it seems unhealthy devoting my life to something I hate just to get attention/validation from people. I haven't really been able to write any music, aside from a few things here and there that I forced myself to do, in years. I have no inspiration or motivation to. 

I've had some pretty serious mental health and drug abuse issues in the past (overdosed while trying to kill myself twice), and it seems like staying in school is only a countdown until I completely melt down and do something stupid. I know not many people will probably see this post, but I don't know who to turn to who will take me seriously and give me an unbiased not sugar-coated opinion. ",15Jan2019,1

I owe around $60,000 in college debt and I want - need - it gone as soon as possible. I'm also a few thousand dollars in credit card debt. I make regular payments (much more than minimum) on all of these accounts. $200 here, $350 there, every month. But that's about $1500 a month in debt repayment, and that's **before** rent and food and gas. By the end of the month I have about a thousand dollars to my name, and it isn't even really mine because of the tens of thousands of dollars I still owe various banks and the education mafia.

I'm almost getting desperate. I'm *seriously* considering prostituting myself for money; the only reason I haven't started is because I don't even know where or how to begin.

I have a best friend we’ll call her Mary. She has a brother we’ll call him Josh. There’s me (F23), I’m married (M25). 

So, Mary and I have been best friends for about 7 years now and her brother Josh and I have been friends since then also. We are all really close and all usually hangout together. Josh and I clicked really well from the start and have a little of a past. We use to always flirt and everything, we’ve kissed on our drunk night outs but nothing more. He has always liked me since way back when. When I say like I mean “in love” I never pursued our relationship any further or anything because I didn’t want to mess up the whole friendship thing and his height. At that time I was single. 

Fast forward some years, I now am married for 3 years have a 7 month old baby. Josh, Mary and I have kept in touch all these years but Josh has a gf  and all of our feelings were put aside. 
Recently, we’ve all been hanging out a lot like the good ol days. My husband stays home because he hates going out. Josh recently told me since we’ve been hanging out and everything more it brought everything back and he likes me and told me he always has even when he was with his gf. He’s always had a thing for me. Him and I have been talking a lot and hanging out (not alone) as a group of friends, and he really really likes me. He knows his place and knows I’m married and have a kid. My relationship with my husband isn’t all that great, but we’re working on it. 
Since, we’ve been talking a lot everything sparked up for me too, he’s literally the perfect guy that I could ever ask for and more, and I’ve always known this. 
My dilemma here is I also love my husband, I’m married, and have a child. I know that we can work on things but we’ve been working on things for 3 years now and he’s barely doing what a mans suppose to do. The real reason why I have pursued anything with Josh is those reasons I just listed AND because he is 4’11. I’m 5’2. He’s the same height and size as my 12 yr old brother. ",15Jan2019,1

460,"First: Thank you for reading this. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: Exceptional GPA, decent working experience but still not job after 4 months. Will be broke in march. What should I do? 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 24 y/o male  and will graduate as a Business Lawyer (Bachelor of Laws LLB) in 15 days. I finished all my exams a bit early in late october 2018 / early november 2019. Since then I'm constantly checking the job market and applying (on a daily basis). I also went to 2 job coachings.

&amp;#x200B;

My GPA should be around 3.3 which is exceptional because with law it's usually 1.0 or 1.3. Our semester GPA is also 1.3. I even got honoured by the president of my university and my country in addition to a scholarship for talented students. 

In addition to this I was constantly working since early highschool \~ 20 hours a week. Internships and jobs because my single dad is unable to work since a few years and I'm the only one earning some income since then. I even managed to pay off my dads 20.000 € debt with working 60 hours in my 3 month ''vacation'' each year and getting myself and my dad out of poverty. 

&amp;#x200B;

So it's easy to find a good job with a useful degree, good GPA and some working experience? 

&amp;#x200B;

**Oh boy was I wrong** 

&amp;#x200B;

There aren't many vacant jobs in a 100 km (62 mile) radius though so I only sent out \~33 applications. I thought this was because of christmas but it seems like the trend goes on. I only had 2 job interviews in those 4 months. And I just got rejected by one because the second job interview went pretty bad (they said they are going to give me feedback today but now they said they are interviewing other people and I have to wait 2 weeks so it's basically a no). 

&amp;#x200B;

My savings are gone by march this year and then I'm basically broke because the scholarship is also going to run out and I have to pay back student loans (round about 30000 €). I was sure I was going to find a job in 5 months. But time is running out and I'm devastated and scared because my dad and I are probably dropping back into poverty which I could not bare because he was so happy that I managed to get us out. I'm still working a part time job but it will not be enough to keep our tiny flat so...

&amp;#x200B;

**...I have no idea what to do and I'm desperate for some advice.**     

&amp;#x200B;

Should I drastically increase the search radius which would mean that I will lose my girlfriend though and I could not watch my dad anymore and my anxiety would also not be that happy about moving so far away because I never travelled in my life.

I always hangout with the same guy friends i made when i joined the university and i do not make any new friends in the university nor talk to any others in the gym (5yrs). I know 2-3 girls as acquaintances as they are in the circle. When i'm introduced to a hot girl i always second think the whole conversation we had later like ""did i say the correct thing, did i sound rude"" etc. Of-course im afraid to go up to girls alone and talk. Lately i have been depressed. Bit of backstory.

I had to stop working to start on my university education as i'm not a person who can balance uni assignments and work and do well. Few months along down the road my dad fell ill (kidney issue). He had to get surgery and now hes recovering but he still needs to see the doctors every few days and he cannot work. He is staying with his sister since its closer to the hospital. Still the issue hasn't been solved yet. My mom is scolding and making me feel guilt since i do not have a job to support her and it makes me so sad but i'm not a person to show it. I'm getting this reminded every few days and also she has started telling other family and friends that i'm useless that i don't help. Since i don't show emotions nor go to talk about it she thinks i don't care and i cannot go to argue with her. I can see my mom is angry with the world with what has happened and the slightest wrong thing i do in house i get scolded.

In the mist of this i was introduced to a girl by a friend. I have been chatting with her since then and i feel like that she likes me more than i'm into her. She doesn't know what i'm going through. She makes me smile on the saddest days with random jokes but the past couple of days i haven't messaged her as i have been very depressed. I don't feel like messaging her when im sad. I feel like universe is trying to say that i'm not meant to be happy. For the 25 years i haven't met anyone who was interested in me like her.

465,"I (18F) am considering getting a GED over sticking out my high school education. And as I have special circumstances, let me give some backstory.

I grew up homeschooled from grades K-10/11 due to my parents not believing in the public school system and our lifestyle. We would move every few years due to my dad’s employment. Entering into high school I maintained my grades (A’s and an occasional B) but fell into a depression. I was 14 years old and had life knock me on my ass. My dad was in the middle of a manic bipolar episode and had to be hospitalized in Feb ‘14, my uncle committed suicide in Apr ‘14 the day before my moms birthday, and my grandfather died in May ‘14. I fell into a depression and struggled with school and motivation. We were living on a bus (converted to RV) at different campgrounds and family and friends driveways and everything was uncertain. In 2015 my family moved to TN into a house after my dad found a great job and that summer I never left my room and fell into self harm and just slept all day. My siblings and I remained homeschooled the next year. I got a job in Jan 2016 and in the fall my dad was laid off. He was unemployed for almost a year and during that time I started working more and not being disciplined as much as a 16 year old should be. My mom was a stay at home mom and still schooled my other siblings until she found a job and my siblings were enrolled in school for the ‘17-18 year. I was not and should’ve been. I was working about 35 hours a week or more and still trying to do homework. I had practically dropped out.

I felt so ashamed and stuck and was just consumed with hopelessness. In the summer my mother and I agreed I should quit my job and enroll in school as a junior and just get done. 

However, the transition from homeschool to public school in your high school years aren’t that easy. My transcript wasn’t from an accredited school and I had to take a test for every credit that I had earned up until halfway through my junior year. The school didn’t give me any advanced notice of these tests and I had to take 8 tests with no time to study the last two weeks before school started last August. I failed both of my math tests and my science test. They didn’t accept my PE credits. They didn’t tell me I even needed to test for personal finance. 

I am now enrolled in school with a 3.8 GPA, taking most of my classes with freshman, and have to enroll in online school as well (which is accelerated and fits an entire school year into 1 normal semester and costs $150 per quarter). I will have to take online classes this summer and pay for online classes again next school year to be able to graduate “on time”. 

In reality, if I had graduated “on time”, I would have already been in my 2nd year of college by now. I’m not going to graduate high school until I’m almost 20. There is tension at home and I’m starting to make plans to move into a house with two other roommates.

So I’ve come to my question, should I just finish my junior year and take the GED so I’m able to start taking college courses, or should I stick this hell out and finish my senior year for the diploma? If I stayed that would be another $1,000+ for high school credits that could otherwise be applied to college or to a vehicle or other bills. 

Any advice would help. ",15Jan2019,1

Hey everyone, I am in the most complicated situation of my life, and can't seem to break out of it. I'll try to keep this short. 

There are two girls in my life, let's cal them Cassie and Hope. 

Cassie and I have been friends for about 5 years. 2.5 years ago we started dating and lasted about a year. We broke it off after having a long bout of communication problems. 

Hope and I have been on and off for about a year and a half. Hope actually works as a contractor for a business I run. We have always had a very deep connection since we met, and when Cassie and I broke up, Hope and I started to have a bit of a relationship. But severe drama with Cassie after we broke up really hindered my relationship with Hope, and we quickly stopped seeing each other romantically. 

In a weird turn of events, Cassie and I became close friends again a few months after we broke up. She absolutely adores me and I really do love her back. She is so kind and very available to come hang out and spend time with me. We have been toying with the idea of getting back into a relationship. But she found out about the relationship I had with Hope and it causes constant arguments since I still work with Hope, so I have not felt comfortable getting back in a relationship with Cassie (as it is not fair for either of us, and I understand why, but also because I am unsure if our relationship will really last.)

Hope and I have feelings for each other, but I think she is really turned off by the idea that I spend so much time with Cassie. Hope jumps in and out of short relationships but seems to always be very interested in me still. Our work relationship is simple, so we often do a bit of work and then spend hours together hanging out. But we have been unable to cross back into anything physically romantic past the occasional cuddling on the couch. 

So bottom line, I love both of these girls. I don't 100% know what Hope feels anymore for me, and I know I could be with Cassie if I wanted to (although I am worried about her trust issues and our communication skills together), but I feel hung up on what was never really finished with Hope. There is not near future circumstance that I can see which would lead to the exit of one of them from my life unless I either forced one of them out, or one of us actually got into a relationship. Obviously this is about as simple as I can define the situation, but I am tired of feeling stagnant with two people I really care about. Hope just jumped into another relationship with a pretty strange guy, so not a lot I can do with her until that perhaps blows over, but usually these things don't last very long. 

Based off of this description, what do you think I should do? I feel like a total asshole but I am honestly just trying to do the right thing.

480,"My Dad treats my brother better than me because he is everything my father wants him to be. Their personalities are similar and they have more in common. My brother is a ""manly-man"" kind of guy who likes sports and what not. I'm the opposite. I'm more on the softer side and like things that aren't very macho like reading, writing, and playing the guitar.

Whenever I make a mistake or do something I wasn't supposed to do like forgetting to wash the dishes, my father hollers at me and goes ""WASH THE FREAKING DISHES!!!"". However when my brother does it he goes, ""Oh don't forget to wash the dishes."" His tone and demeanor is much different with him. When I do something, it's World War 3. There is a lot of favortism going on.

Him and my brother both pick on me and call me names like, ""Punk"", ""Sissy"", ""Weakling"", etc just because they think I'm not manly enough. It's very hurtful. Whenever I try to stand up for myself, they say I am too defensive and too combative. I fail to see how standing up for myself is being defensive. I feel like I'm being ganged up on and attacked, so I am defending myself. Also oftentimes when I try to stick up for myself, I get yellled at.

My father is very critical and judmental of my behavior and my interests. He thinks all the things I like are stupid and wrong. For example, I like to watch the Ellen show. One time when I was watching it, my father goes ""What are you doing watching that stupid lesbian?"" Whatever my brother watches, (Sports and Sport Talk Shows) my father praises it.

My father does not like my personality. He always tries to tell me how to act and how to behave. I wish he would leave me alone, and let me be myself. He never tells my brother how he should behave.

This has been going on for a really long time. The favortism.

My brother gets away with a lot more things than I do, because he's the ""golden-child"". Whenever I make a mistake or do something wrong, I get yelled at and berated. But, when my brother does something, my father is much softer.

I really don't like how I'm being treated. He treats my brother better than he treats me. It's like my father respects him more because he's more like him.

I feel like I don't deserve this treatment. I feel like I am responsible, respectful, I have a 3.7 GPA currently in high school, I don't party or get into trouble, I don't do drugs, etc. I feel like I am a good son. I feel like I don't deserve my father's treatment.

Advice would be very appreciated?

485,"I should probably give backstory of myself so people who read this can understand my situation better. I'll try to keep it as direct as possible without the timeline details being too confusing so bear with me please.
I grew up in a family of eight children. I was the awkward middle child. My father was a successful engineer and my mother was a full-time housewife. I love my parents, but unfortunately, I'm the only child who wasn't given the opportunity to go to school. At all. My older siblings got to go and when I was born my mother decided to homeschool. When she passed away (I was 13) my father sent my younger siblings to school while I got stuck filling my mother's shoes at home. Now, my mother taught me for only the first few years of my life. I was about eight when the teaching started to disappear and up to her death there wasn't much focus on my studies. I assume she had her hands full with everything.
At 19 I was working two jobs and got my GED on my own. It was rough. I've never been taught how to write an essay and so many other things that may be common knowledge to educated people. However somehow I managed to pass. I had no life direction for the longest time and just did my best to get out of that house which was my cage. Due to not being raised properly I struggle a lot when it comes to dealing socially. I started to work at PetSmart and became a dog groomer. I love working with animals and it's a passion of mine. But most groomers are only in the field for 10-15 years due to their body breaking down. It's an intense and fastpace job that takes an extreme toll on the body.
Currently I am 26. I've recently moved into an apartment with the most amazing, strong, and gentle hearted man. I see a bright and a lifetime relationship with him. Especially after going through two long term abusive relationships I know I'm the luckiest woman alive. I know eventually we'll want to start a small family and I need to be able to do my part to support us. Now, and later. Grooming isn't stable enough as a career and I have the desire to do more. I want to help. I want to feel fulfilled in my work. 
In 2018 I spent most of it trying to find my next step in life. I went on ride-alongs with animal control to see if that would be a good fit but unfortunately I do not think that I would be able to emotionally and mentally handle what comes with it. I've been trying to look into wildlife or wolf biologist. I've also been looking into becoming a vet assistant or vet tech.
I'm wondering if there are any jobs with animals that I have not heard of that could be available to me. My other passion is Japanese and I'm trying to teach myself how to speak it. It's a dream of mine to move there or visit frequently. I've already been once. My oldest brother is a programmer who makes video games in Japan and he is a huge influence in regards to the love that I have for that culture.
I have been feeling depressed and discouraged. I feel like most of my life was wasted while I was stuck in a cage. I understand that it's never too late but I'm 26 years old and definitely feeling the heavy pressure. If anybody has any advice at all for me even if it's a job outside of dealing with animals I am more than welcome your input and insight. Or even if you just have some life advice every little bit helps. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this I hope that it was easy to understand. I apologize if my writing may come off a bit muddled.

Thank you so very much",15Jan2019,1

Here’s a breakdown of my progress so far. I have a shitty transcript from some college I did in 09/10 right after HS, but since I moved I started taking classes at a community college in my current neighborhood. I’m finally ready to actually take college seriously— should I just go to another community college in the area and start fresh or is are my grades not as big of a deal as I think. I’d prefer to stay at my current school. It has a really good nursing program and is just convenient.


I have a tendency to drop classes pretty much anytime there’s an essay due so I’m going to try to really overcome that anxiety about writing this time around. I placed low in math but since retaking some basic math class I know I’d do better a placement test this time around. Retaking the classes are an option too, but my college’s website says the recent grade will be used for your adjusted GPA. I just don’t really understand when adjusted will be used over regular and if the withdrawals will matter.


Thanks! ",15Jan2019,1
487,"So, my story is a bit complicated. I am 20 years old college student from the Czech Republic. I live in a cheap shared flat 300 km from my family. My dad used to run a really successful business. However, during the 2009 economic crisis he had to borrow a lot of money (by a lot a mean a LOT) to stay afloat. I don’t know the details, I was 11. Long story short, the company went bankrupt and my father started drowning his problems in alcohol. My stay-at-home never worked a day in her life mom started doing the same. With the added bonus of antidepressant and two suicide attempts. My dad is a really smart and charismatic man so despite his addiction and debt we stayed afloat till now. We lost our house but could affort rent so we didn’t become homeless at the very least. Two years ago he started working with this huge international company and it looked like things were looking up for us. I just graduated high school and decided to go to college. Side note: college is free in the Czech Republic. I have a part-time job but still depend on my parents for money. The rent is crazy high in any major Czech city and the wages are low. A few weeks ago my dad was fired because of his addiction, basically gave up on life and moved in with his parents leaving me, my mom and my little sister to take care of ourselves. He calls every once in a while saying that he’s working on a new project and that everything is gonna be okay but he’s not exactly the most trust-worthy person right now. Without his financal help, I’m screwed. The Czech Republic has a complicated education system and there are many types of high schools. The one I went to is supposed to prepare you for college and that’s it. With only a degree from this high school you’re pretty good at jeopardy-like quiz shows but realistically you don’t have any practical knowlege. If I dropped out of uni, I would be forced to work in retail or at the very best be a secretary for the rest of my life. What should I do? Should I drop out now or take my chance and trust him but risk ending up getting evicted for not paying rent?",15Jan2019,1
488,"Kinda desperate here, need someone else's opinion. I can't really think straight because I'm having a pretty bad depression episode in the bathroom right now.

So I'm a Junior in (Illinois, USA) High School, 16 yrs. I'm in a sophomore earth science class; last year I took Physical Science, which is the 'special kids' class that covers 4 different fields of science, one of which being earth science. The teacher, we'll call her ML, knows this and usually has me work alone in group projects, labs, and long term homework assignments. I should probably note that I have an accommodation to type all my notes. I type much faster than I write, and google drive makes it much easier to keep everything neat and organized. It is literally illegal for a teacher to not allow me to type my notes. Continuing: ML is pretty chill, as she is retiring next year. Often, class time was taken up talking about the cabin that she built, hunting, current events in the earth science community, etc.

We are now into week two of our astronomy unit, and she was giving a good lecture about the big bang, and the evidence supporting the theory. I'm an auditory learner, so I don't always look at the front of the room. I don't think ML knows this, nor would I expect her to. Towards the end of the class, about 5 minutes left, she was finishing up, right on time as usual. I pulled out a sheet for my next class and started working on it. She comes up to me and tells me with a stern voice to put it away. I do so, and say sorry in a sort of hushed tone. She says ""Your sorries ain't cuttin' it anymore. See me after class."" I was half thinking 'oh shit', other half wondering about the ""your sorries ain't cuttin' it anymore"" part. I have been good about paying attention throughout the year. I had one time early last semester where I came into class reading the campaign for my DnD group (I'm a DM), but ML motioned me to close it a minute or so after morning announcements, so I did. Again, that was early last semester. Maybe there was some time that I forgot about.

So class ends, and I go up to ML's desk, not thinking much of what would happen. I thought wrong. ML gives me the death stare, and waits for everyone to leave. Then, she starts yelling at me. Side note, I omitted a few sentences due to them being rather vulgar.

ML: ""What are you doing in class?""

Me: ...

ML: ""What are you doing in class?""

Me: ...

ML: (yelling) ""What are you doing in class?""

Me: (mumble) ""Homework""

ML: (yelling) ""Speak up!""

Me: ""Homework""

ML: (yelling) ""Then why are you in this class? If you want to do other work, then drop this class and take a study hall! So what's it gonna be? Are you gonna stop or are you gonna drop the class? If you don't stop, then I will walk down to your \[School office\] and drop the class for you!""  
Me: (something between talking and a mumble) ""Sorry. I'll stop.""

ML: (yelling, while motioning his next class to wait outside) "" You don't really care about this class, and all you do is slack off! You're just telling me 'Screw You' aren't you? Well, Screw You!""

Me: ...

ML: (still yelling) ""I want you in here at \[30 minutes before school starts\] tommorow morning and you better give that lecture back to me better than I gave it.""

Me: (mumble) ""ok""

I walked out, giving a instinctive ""Have a good day"" not realizing it.

She knows about my notes accommodation, so I understand why she might think I would be frequently off task.

So, I'm asking whats the best course of action here?

It goes without saying that I'll try to be better with staying on task, but I don't think I was bad to start with. I know that ML was probably having a bad day, but this yelling at doesn't seem like just a bad day.

Dropping the class isn't an option. My parents would get on my case. It's worth noting that I don't have a study hall, and I can't really drop any classes without worse reprecussions from my parents. I work on homework during my lunch hour, but don't usually get it done. Last night was a busy night, I really only have one super busy day every month or so, and yesterday was said night.

Do I talk to ML today and explain how his request is unrealistic? I think that I could win the logic part of the arguement. I mean, she is retiring next year and has taught explicitly earth science for her 20+ year tenure at this school, while I just heard it for the first time today. Nobody was taking notes during the lecture.

Do I just skip tomorrow morning and hope for the best during her class, do the lecture that I'm not even remotely prepared for, or play my cards with my parents and try to skip a day and hope it blows over?

489,"Hey guys, I’m a 20 year old girl and this year will be my 7th year in remission from anorexia (whoop whoop). Despite the fact that I’m now a lot stronger mentally, know how to ignore self-destructive thoughts and not let them turn into maladaptive behaviours like skipping meals or compulsively exercising, there are tiny little triggers every now and then that really wake up that mean monster inside my head. I have a male friend a couple of years older than I am who said the other day that he would never date a girl who has thicker thighs than he had and that ‘skinny girls are always the way to go’, and his mates agreed with him.
I’m a relatively short girl (5 ft 4) but my natural build is quite a curvy hourglass and I’ve got slightly bigger arms and thick thighs. I work out very regularly and weigh around 140 lbs (size 6). Despite my body dysmorphia, I know I’m not fat, but I worry that my friend’s opinion is what all guys feel and that my friends and family are only being protective over me by telling me I look fine. I feel like most of my friends are always criticizing themselves, either trying to lose weight, get a six-pack, get rid of their big arms or fit back into their old jeans, or are basically just constantly trying to reach some or other physical goal when exercising or eating and I feel guilty that I don’t want to do the same anymore. I’m trying to exercise because it feels good and eat intuitively but the comment my guy friend made makes me worry that guys only want girls with long legs and skinny arms and that I’ll never be that.

505,"     So, obviously there is a girl that i really like. I’m 19, I’m in college and I met this girl in my biology class. We sat next to each other every day and by the end of the semester we were hanging out. I took her to an amusement park just as the semester had needed. I wanted to have some fun with her before Christmas break because she was leaving to go back home.

     We went to this amusement park and I think she had as much fun as I did. She liked all the roller coasters. After we hung out in one of her friends dorms a while before I went home. The next day I went to hang out with her before she left. So we just literally hung out in her dorm room for a couple hours. Her roommate was gone so it was just us but I couldn’t quite bring myself to make a move. I really like her so I didn’t want it to seem like I had just came over to get some action.

     She hugged me bye and left to go back home. I live close by so I was staying here all Christmas break. She was being pretty flirty and talking to me a lot of messages and face time for the first week of the break. We didn’t talk as much the following weeks but I figured she was just as busy as I was with the holidays. Then we picked up and started talking a lot again. I was reply excited to see her when she got back so I thought I’d send a letter to her dorm room to be waiting for her when she got back.

     I drew her a picture of a bear, our school mascot. When we were hanging out in her dorm she had me doodle several things because I told her I was good at drawing. She told me that I should draw her a picture for her to hang in her dorm room. So I thought it would be cute to send her my drawing and a letter. I was really excited for her to come back and get my drawing, and also for us to see each other again.

     She sadly stopped responding to my messages and wouldn’t answer any of my facetimes. A week or so went by and then I got a message saying she met a guy that she likes. She said she wasn’t sure that she wanted to keep talking to me because of it, but that she felt bad about it. I didn’t reply because I already can get insecure and I just told myself she wouldn’t want to hear from me.

     Then she texted me again when she got back to campus telling me thanks for the letter and drawing. She said she would understand if I was mad and never talked to her again. So i texted her and told her she was welcome for the drawing. I also thanked her for letting. me know about meeting a guy instead of just ignoring me.  She didn’t say anything so I added that I didn’t hate her or think badly of her because of all of this. She said she was glad to hear that.


     So..... I’m now at a place where I still really want to talk to her but i’m not sure that she wants me to. I don’t want to be that guy who won’t leave her alone after she told me that she thought she didn’t want to talk to me anymore. I also want to see her again and keep hanging out.....

I've tried to talk to him, but he gets really defensive really quickly and then just melts into a puddle and starts apologizing. Afterward, he'll be extra nice for a day or two and then go right back to his previous behavior.

I'd ask him to move out, but he'd be homeless, phone-less, and car-less if I were to stop supporting him financially.

512,"I am an IT engineer with 4+ years of experience and my GF is studying/practicing medicine in the US, she is looking forward to settling down there since she has to appear for the exam if she plans to move to Canada. 

She holds an Indian passport while I am a Canadian Citizen. As per my research, there are 2 options, TN visa which I need to renew every 3 years, or find a job and apply for H1, then GC and citizen.

Does anyone have a personal experience or if there is a lawyer around how can help with following questions,

1. What is the most efficient way to move, with a TN visa or any other means?
2. Can I work for the same Canadian firm earning CAD, while living in the US? Do I need to apply for any visa in this case?
3. Will I be able to take advantage of free Canadian health care?
4. It is easy for Canadian to secure status in the US?

514,"My bf keeps saying that men cannot just be friends with women and that the sole reason for men being “friends” with a woman is because he thinks she’s attractive. He’s constantly repeating it. He has female friends of course, just as I have male friends whom I am in no way attracted to. When I brought up that I didn’t understand why he would say this or what he even meant, he said “oh it’s not me, it’s just every other guy”. That was obviously annoying😂 if he keeps saying it, in my brain it means he feels the same way. I just don’t understand. Is this a common guy thing???

515,"Throwaway because people I know follow my reddit.

So recently (mostly this week) I’ve noticed myself replying to people around me without thinking about it at all. It’s usually just small/meaningless talk, but it seems to be getting worse.

For example, yesterday a co-worker I don’t know too well made a reference to RDR2 I wasn’t paying too much attention and was sticking with the smile-and-nod routine. Then he asked if I’ve played the game (I never have and I don’t have any interest really) and, for some reason, I replied with yes? It didn’t have any sort of consequence of course, just a few minutes of awkward, “what did I just get myself into” panic.

It got even worse today: I was sitting beside my girlfriend in class and we were working on a note. (Some background information: usually if one of us says something is cute, we’ll banter around for a bit saying, “yeah, you!”) I again, wasn’t paying attention, and my gf said, “this looks like shit.” 

**For some fucking reason, I decided to tell her, “yeah, you!”** More background information - my gf is super self-conscious, to a point where she can be self-destructive, and I try to be really supportive of her. I wouldn’t ever dream of calling her something like that, so I have no idea why I subconsciously replied with that.

We’ve brushed it off a little, but this seems to constantly get me into conversations I don’t want to be in. 

Is there any way to stop myself from this really? Is there some kind of therapy or exercises I can do to train myself to stop? Any help is appreciated.

**TL;DR: said my girlfriend looks like shit by accident while on autopilot, desperately need help on stopping myself from talking without thinking because it’s happening more and more.**",15Jan2019,1
516,"I had sex with this girl 3 times , fully using protection, I never actually came when I was having sex with her. I only came at the very end when I would masturbate so she could give me a bj , however the sex lasted like 2 hours and at the end I had to masturbate for like 45 minutes to cum.
The second time we had sex I asked if I could put it in her for 1 push just so I could know what it felt like. I checked if the penis tip was dry before and it was so I put it in once and I took it out and put on a condom I know I did not come in her and I doubt I pre came in her otherwise I would have felt it, I did not masturbate before this aswell so even if I did pre cum there should have been no semen, as usual the sex lasted 2 ish hours , didn't come untill I masturbated , the third time was pretty much the same except I used a condom completely.
After a while she says her period was late so I started panicing she said it was 18 days late so we waited like 4 more days and she took a pregnancy test and it was negative. On Christmas Eve and Christmas she took 2 more and told me they both came out negative , but I was still paranoid. I asked her if she got her period and she said ""no I don't know why"" so I said I'm going to tell my parents , she quickly said no and told me she had period symptoms which was weird because she should have told me when I asked if she got her period, she said she had been having them for 2 days as usual. She normally gets cramps and acne , which she had. On 26th of December she said she got her period and it lasted for 5 days, she told me she promises on her life she was not pregnant, etc.  She said it was late because she was stressing, eating more, travelling to Spain and because she was going to an all girl's school  and the hormones where going crazy(we're both 16 btw).I really hope she isn't pregnant but I do have OCD so I do tend to obsess and overcomplicate things a lot, do you think she's pregnant or not?",15Jan2019,1

Food that is brought from home by employees for lunch/snacks since we were here for 12 hours or more. We have had a food thief in the past and had addressed it and for awhile things were going good. Yesterday I got stir fry from the cafeteria—which is not cheap, didn’t eat a whole bunch because I wasn’t too hungry. I put my fork in the container and placed it in the fridge without a label-my fault. Went home and came back less than 12 hours later and someone had eaten my half eaten rice, didn’t finish it tho, and put it back in the fridge. We get ice cream from administration every two weeks and it’s stolen frequently too.  Food items that are labeled get stolen too.

522,"Not sure what exactly I'm looking for by posting here but I'm sitting on my lunch break unsure of what to do. I write here just to say that I'm sad. I have a beautiful girlfriend who loves me dearly, a playful and healthy cat and loads of family members who thankfully are also healthy. I'm physically healthy but that's it I think. 

I stopped going to College after a few semesters due to finances and depression about 6 years ago. The following year after I left school was the best year of my life. I spent pretty much all my time working out and getting in shape. I lost 100lbs and looked the best I have in my entire life. The year after that I managed to land a job paying $35k salary. Nothing crazy but for someone who dropped out of school that's more than I could've asked for. Over the last couple years I've gone up in ranks with my employer and actually received a promotion. I now bring in anywhere from $55k-$60k a year depending on my commission. I have friends who are in debt from school with a degree struggling to make $35k a year so I have no room to complain when it comes to finances. 

However, no matter how much money I bring in, I'm still miserable. The line of work I'm in is very demanding and a lot of responsibility weighs on my shoulders. I come home from work with not much energy or happiness. I guess I do a good job faking it because my girlfriend and my family don't say they notice my decreased energy. 

So here I am, on my lunch break, googling ""I hate my job"" and hoping some fantasy job genie comes out of no where to save me. I'm smart enough to know that's not going to happen so I decided I'd type to y'all instead. Thanks for reading if you did. ",15Jan2019,1
523,"I'm finishing up winter break after my first semester of university. Everything about moving out has gone alright, except for the fact that I can't seem to stop losing weight.

People told me about the possibility of having the ""freshmen15"" weight gain, but I didn't worry about it. I've always eaten when hungry, and stopped when full. I thought LOSING weight would be the least of my issues. 

Within a month of classes, I'd lost 10 pounds. I don't know how - I woke up early every day to have breakfast. I always ate lunch and I always ate dinner. When I first noticed my weight dropping, I started drinking soda to pack on the calories. I admit I don't like the dining hall food much but I always found a way to grab a second serving. I knew I had to put on weight, yet I kept losing.

So, I started eating foods slathered in gravy. I added in a second dinner comprised of 600 calorie microwave chicken pot pies every night. This seemed to be the tipping point where my weight stabilized. The semester ended. I went home for break satisfied that I wasn't losing. I've still eaten Christmas-y food like pies and lots of meat over the break, and I've kept on drinking soda as a buffer. I even expected to put on a few pounds before returning to campus. 

I stepped on the scale today and found out I've lost another 5 pounds.

I have tried to talk to my friends at school about it. Most of them are struggling to lose weight. I was told they wished they had my problem, and so I let it be.

This has never happened before. If someone could please tell me where to go from here, I would be so grateful. I am currently underweight and it's beginning to affect other parts of my health beyond just my energy. I have no dietary restrictions. Is there something I'm missing? If someone else has gone through something similar, how did you approach it? ",15Jan2019,1

526,"My current job is in a department of 7 people in a small office, a department of which I've seen built from the ground up literally since the first month it was established 3 years ago, We're part of a larger organization of departments, but physically separate from everyone else in the building. Because we're in such close contact with one another for 8 hours a day every day, we've established a bond between each other over the years that I genuinely haven't found anywhere else in my career. We've had our bumpy moments, as things go, but we're all total nerds for the same things, we all make each other laugh, we all make sure to put humor into every day we're here. It's been the best job I've ever had. 

However, long story short, over the past 3 or so months it's become increasingly clear that my job is stagnating with little to no sense of long-term growth in sight. This has prompted me to begin the process of laterally moving to another department within the company that has  that opportunity for growth. But leaving behind my friends like this is breaking my heart, particularly with my boss. They've become the only friends I have aside from my SO and a few college friends I'm still in contact with. Aside from my boss who has been beyond amazing through this process, none of them know that I'm planning on moving. Her and I just had a 1-on-1 meeting about this and I nearly cried when she started talking about the ""Once you make the decision, there's no turning back."" type bits, which prompted me to write this at my desk. 

I know I should be excited for the change, I can't help but feel a tremendous sense of abandonment on my part. As if it's a bad thing to grow and move onward and upward. To leave them behind while I venture off and explore new things in my career. Am I wasting a good thing here? I feel like I just need to read other people's stories to gauge what to expect. Idk.

Note: I’m NOT mad at the cat. It’s not his fault, animals rely on humans, it’s our responsibility, he is just a little guy. My bf is who I’m angry at. 

- It’s a sphynx cat. Special breed yes

- he spent 1200 on it while we were struggling financially without fully knowing everything even the negatives about this breed

- I wasn’t up for this. I did NOT want this kind of cat. 

- he got the cat from a breeder, cat had beginning respiratory the day he picked him up and drove him home, cat really fucking quickly became severely ill and looked literally dead for 3 weeks or more. It has been maybe 8 months since he’s had this kitten, and from day 1 to now, the kitten still has SEVERE DIARRHEA. Breeder told us apparently all the cats had giardia, so we administered medicine for two weeks. Cat becomes healthy, active, drinks and eats well. 8 months later cat still has severe diarhea pls keep in mind 

- the cat oils EVERYTHING we have. After me sleeping under towels for 3 months, I bought myself a fucking nice ass sherpa blanket for 60 dollars. I wasn’t freezing every night now. Two months later, my blanket has brown and yellow stain blotches the sizes of tennis balls in multiple spots from this cat sleeping under it while I’m not at home. ALSO, my clothes, bed, blanket, and everything I basically fucking own smells like a musky 40 year old man who just went to the gym and has been resting on his couch for two hours and hasn’t moved a muscle. No shower.

- we bought brand new towels because WE HAD NONE, and (remember the diarhea thing?) the cat must’ve sat on the towel because there is sitting the same fucking colored diarhea stain on the towel that I wipe off his ass every single day five times a day. I WIPE HIM. THE PERSON WHO DIDNT WANT THIS KIND OF CAT. I told my bf hey please put this away so the cat doesn’t stain it if he sat on it because he sits his ass on everything we own. Bf complied but, days later. That night the towel had no stain, and it hadn’t been moved at all. Same spot vulnerable in the air, it was folded. 

- the breeder gave my bf one month free vet visit. I urged him a hundred times pls fucking G O. He did not. 8 months later, of spending hundreds of dollars on over the counter medicine, and me screeching at him for being a bad pet parent and for being irresponsible, HAS NOT TAKEN HIM TO THE VET YET. tell me I’m not being insane and that a normal, good pet parent would take their cat to the vet way before this bullshit.

- lastly, my bf throws the cat to me. I wipe his ass if I don’t want my blanket and my clothing and my couch and tables to smell like diarhea and to have golden brown streaks on them. I feed it, I give it attention because my bf is fucking lazy and doesn’t realize cats need to play. It’s still a kitten. I currently have MY cat binx, who I can say is obsessed with me. He was a feral kitten I rescued. I rigorously ran him of energy for hours a day and at night, no matter how tired I was, because I knew I’m all he has and it’s my responsibility to cater to his needs. He is now a happy cat who still is very playful but most importantly, healthy. The Sphinx cat, my boyfriends, relies on me to play with him because my boyfriend doesn’t. He counts “waving a butterfly teaser toy while he lays in bed for ten minutes” as rigorously playing and interacting for the day. 


I’m literally sick of dealing with this I’m sick of dealing with a cat that I didn’t sign up for and that is thrown at me because my bf doesn’t wanna deal with it. He says he’ll take it to the vet and this and that but his ass does NOT carry it out.  I signed up for MY cat. I have taken my responsibilities very well as best I can. I feed him and love him and I tire his energy out to the point he will flop asleep next to me for HOURS, and wake up like a new cat. I take him to the vet every time I sense somethings wrong. 

TL;DR my bf got a sphynx cat without talking to me, I’m now the one suffering responsibilities and repercussions of it being sick months later

532,"Quick backstory. Me and this guy have been friends for a little over 5 years now. Over the last 2 years those we have become close friends.  We used to hang out all the time, travel, talk regularly, and he even made me his son's godfather. However recently things have changed and I think its due to this incident...

We were both traveling in his car a couple months back headed home from a night of drinking on the town when he fell asleep at the wheel of his car (I was a passenger). His car ended up overturned and caught on fire, and was subsequently totaled on the scene. We were both transported to the hospital but there were no major injuries, we were lucky to be alive thanks to a passing Samaritan who helped get us out of the car. Anyway, He ended up getting tickets for the accident which included a DUI charge because they suspected he was drinking. Even through all of this I still supported him, and helped him through it all. I've been to all the court hearings, even helped with celebrating his birthday (because he didn't have a car to get around I was the designated driver), checking in to make sure he's ok, etc.

However as of late he has been distant. I reach out to him to check in with him and the conversation seems like it irritates him or he doesn't want to talk, he doesn't reach out to me at all unless he needs a ride to court, I tried to hang out with him a few times and he has either turned me down, stood me up, or just out right hasn't texted back.

I know getting into an accident and totaling your car cant be a good feeling at all. I'm sure he's going through a lot of emotions with everything that's going on. I cant help but feel like I should take some of the blame for what happened. Or that he may actually blame me anyway for what happened to him. I just don't know what to do or think really. I'm kind of exhausted from reaching out to him and when I ask if everything is OK, he says yes and that's it. I don't push because I feel like if he has/had an issue with me I've given him a chance to address it with me.

Even though I'm going through my own depression with no support I don't want him to feel like I'm not there for him which is why I reach out to make sure he's okay. I'd like to think I'm doing the right thing but maybe its too late, this incident may have been the end of a friendship.

At this point should I just stop reaching out and let him go through what ever he needs to go through and hope he reaches out again? Or just accept the friendship may be over?",15Jan2019,1
533,"I’m going to divide this into two sections: the main story and the examination of our relationship. Sorry this is so long but I’m stressed af.

MAIN STORY: I have a female friend and we’ve been friends for going on 6 years now. We’ve had some ups and downs in the past, but pretty much she means a lot to me and I care for her. She doesn’t maintain work, a stable place to stay or have her own vehicle. I drive her around on occasion and have bought her fast food, etc in the past when we’re hanging out. Its important to note that throughout the duration of our friendship, I’ve maintained an amazing job with great pay. Financially speaking, I am in the best position of anybody that she knows. Anyways, whereas we used to talk every single day, she’s stopped talking to me as much lately unless she needs something. I’m aware of this much more than I think she is. So, right before Christmas I had bought her toddler son a trike. I was going to drive it over Christmas Eve as a surprise. Well, she sent me a message on about 22 Dec. to see if I could loan her 20 dollars. I agreed because I know that she probably needed it and actually gave her 30 instead of 20 in the spirit of the holidays. I also gave her her son’s gift at that time as well. I thought that would be it. Day after Christmas, she calls and wants me to bring her a jack for her car because she has a flat. I don’t have a jack, so no. She calls on the 28 Dec. asking to borrow another 20. I didn’t respond fast enough and she says that she found somebody else that could help her. Day later she asks for something else. Then she’s dead silent until yesterday. Yesterday she sends me a message asking me to buy her a CAR. A fucking CAR. But “not an expensive car. Just a cheap car she could pay me back for.” No. Fuck no. Just no. So I called her and told her I’m not buying her a car, she started faking tears and was saying that she needed the car so she could take her kid to daycare, go to work and pay rent. I explained that I’m trying to buy a house and I have things going on in my own life and that I’m not buying her a car. She was like “I’m sorry I don’t tell you how bad things are in my life. I’m sad all the time. I just won’t call you for anything anymore. It’s fine.” Like she victimized the whole thing to make me look like a dick because I wouldn’t buy her a car. We reached a conclusion where I wouldn’t buy her car but she also wouldn’t throw away a 5 year friendship over this bullshit. Today she asks me if I’ll give her a ride twice a week so that she can pay somebody rent. I don’t know what to do. I want to see her do well. She needs to pay rent so she can have somewhere to live but for me to go get her twice a week so that she can pay rent doesn’t make sense to me. Somebody told me I should try to think about whether or not I’d do this for a male friend and I’m almost confident i wouldn’t. But with her I want her to succeed and establish something because I’m honestly afraid that one day I’m going to wake up and find out that she killed herself  or something and I’ll blame myself because I didn’t help her. What should I do?

OUR RELATIONSHIP: This is long and I’m probably venting here but I’m going to try to condense the relationship down a lot. I met her in 2013 when I was in high school. We had a decent friendship. We’d argue a lot and I honestly figured that after high school, I’d never hear from her again. I graduated class of 14, she found me on Facebook and began messaging me and we became even better friends. We would FaceTime every *single* night, she talked to me about sad and messed up things in her life, we were close. During this time, with all the communication I began to fall for her and she knew this, however nothing ever really came from it. We had a lot of conversations about us moving in together, setting future goals, getting married or becoming a “power couple,” however, we never even do much as went on an actual date (just pipe dream conversations I guess). There was a point that still bugs me and seriously fucked up my self esteem and sent me into a depression, that was when she told me I was ugly and that while she would happily marry me, she would exclusively sleep with other people because she doesn’t find me sexually attractive. However, from about 2015 forward (to this day), She would tease me by sending nude photos (like a lot) regularly and this just became a part of just regular texting. Towards the end of 2015/2016, she kind of got mixed up in drugs and ended up dating bad guys. It was towards this point that I began to notice the direction her life was headed in. She was doing hard drugs, staying with guys that would beat her, she would disappear for weeks and began being very promiscuous. Eventually she stopped using hard drugs after we had a serious heart to heart, she even left her boyfriend and moved back in with her unstable mother. At some point she discovered she was pregnant and asked me to Uber her to her boyfriends house so she could tell him. I did. I also ubered her back home as well. Months go by. She has the kid. I see her in the hospital. After she has the kid, she tries to do things better. She begins working (not often but more than before), she also stayed off hard drugs and just smoked Marijuana (which is still a problem, I’m anti-drug). I joined the military for a few months towards the end of 2017, got injured and came home. First phone convo we had in months while I was at the airport in San Antonio airport waiting for my flight she tells me “I can buy her pussy now if I want for $75.” She tells me she fucked some drug dealer for free weed, then he offered to pretty much pimp her out to his friends for cash and that’s what she had been doing.  I was flabbergasted. I never thought she’d go this route. It also let me know how much she thought of me that she would even offer that to me, our friendship was deeper than that. I come back home to Missouri and we start hanging out more. I buy a two seater car and we go on drives around the cities, etc. I buy her food when we hang out, she wants me to meet some of her friends I drive her over there and hang out for a while. After I got back home, everything seemed right again. She had a job (again, not long) and moved in with her grandparents, she was taking good care of her son, etc. This lasted about 7 months. We then stopped communicating as much and she began to get depressed and needy. She had to move out of her grandparents house after a disagreement and then out of her mothers house after an incident and then moved in with some guy she met. The only time I hear from her anymore is when she needs something. Money, a CAR, a ride somewhere, etc. But I do still care about her as a friend. 


TLDR; My female friend has asked me to buy her a car. I said no. She tried to play the victim. I understand that her life is in turmoil and sucks sometimes but I’m not buying her a car. She then asks me to give her a ride twice a week to pay rent if I can’t buy her a car. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want her to end up homeless or anything but I don’t like being taken advantage of and only being thought of when I’m useful. This comes after she’s asked me for money multiple times in recent months as well. What should I do.",15Jan2019,1
534,"Hello, I've been a long time lurker and I finally worked up enough courage to post here.

A little more information on my situation,

Literally all I want in life is to live in a decent apartment in a safe area, work at a job I don't absolutely loathe, make enough money to pay my bills and have extra money leftover to do things like buy a new gaming system, go out to dinner, or take a vacation. Maybe I want a few cats or a dog, but that's it.

I'm afraid that I won't be able to get a decent job without a Bachelor's (or higher) degree, but I'm also afraid of being unable to get a job with a Bachelor's (or higher) degree and being stuck with a huge debt. I'm afraid that if I go to trade school I won't like the trade and will be in debt because that's what happened to one of my siblings (my parents pressured them into going when they didn't really want to). 

I have an assocites in general studies (was pressured into going to community college by my parents despite the fact that I'm not sure what I want to do) and thankfully I have no debts as of yet. One of the few reasons I went to college despite not knowing what I wanted to do was because my parents claimed that any degree, even an associates, would get me a full-time job I could live off of (though I have yet to find one of these careers). 

So my question is, where do I go from here? Do I go to a 4 year college to pursue my interests (biology) and hope I get a job, do I go to a 4 year college and pursue a tolerable career (public history or library science) with slightly better chances of having more jobs, or do I go with a trade school (IT career) and learn a trade that I might end up hating, but has a much better chance of getting me a job? Should I keep trying to get a full-time job with just an associates? Or are there other options? ",15Jan2019,1
535,"So I met my father. After over 30 years. I remember him as a child. He was an addict but he is sober now. It was beautiful and he is lovely. He was so happy to see me tears and all. I’m elated to have him back.

It has been a few days now and I have not heard from him since. I’m not upset I know that he is overwhelmed. His whole family has been wanting to hear from me. And they are lovely too.

I guess I’m just wondering if anyone has advice for moving on with our relationship. With all the loveliness of course there’s still the awkward new parts. Especially since we have a bad past that lingers in the air like an elephant in the room. I have voiced that it is nothing to me and I know he believes me.

537,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

It's a lengthy situation but  I will do my best to paint a clear picture in as few words as possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am 32 and am currently living in a house with my parents, my 36-year-old sister, her husband, her 5-year-old son, and my 5-year-old son. I personally bought the house, with my sister as a co-signer. I and she currently split the mortgage payments equally. My parents are retired and get minimal SS retirement benefits (because they are immigrants) and are basically unable to support themselves so I and my sister share that responsibility. In return, our parents watch and babysit our boys and take care of the house. 

&amp;#x200B;

A year and a half ago I met my husband who moved in and lived with us while we were dating for about 9 months last year. I and he both agreed that we want our own family nest and want to live separate from my family.

&amp;#x200B;

We rented an apartment a couple of months ago which he pays for because I still am paying for half of the mortgage/bills for the house my family lives in. We were very gentle in breaking the news to my family so they don't get too upset about it and they all relatively took it well except my sister who stopped talking to me for a month. More issues came when I told my 5-year-old son and because he grew up with my nephew he sees him as a brother, he refused to stay at the apartment without the nephew. So for the past couple of months, I have been going to the apartment on some nights after my son falls asleep for the night at the house and stayed at the apartment, my sister takes boys to pre-k in the morning. On weekends whenever my sister permitted I would take both boys and stay at the apartment for one of the nights. Never staying at the apartment with just my son and my husband, my nephew always with us if my son goes. My husband who is staying at the apartment all of the time now is understandably upset because I am not there all of the time. And I feel I am constantly in a battle with having to choose between my son and my husband whom I both love dearly. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to move completely out but don't know how to convince my son to be without his cousin. The boys have been doing everything together since birth due to our living situation with my family and my son's biological dad not being in his life. Now, I don't know how to split them up without breaking their hearts. But I also cannot go on living in both places and having to leave my son behind or my husband. 

&amp;#x200B;

To add to my stress, I am also pregnant. I and my husband are expecting our little one in a couple of months so I need to figure this out now. Continuing on partially living at the house with my family is out of the question. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ideally, I want to live with my husband, my son, and our future newborn, without having to financially support my family and visit them on weekends and holidays or such, like a normal family situation. But, I cannot break the financial ties at this time as my parents would have no way of supporting themselves and I do not want to be selfish and put the whole burden on my sister. But I at least need to figure out a way of how to move out completely WITH my son but without my nephew. If you have any advice at all I greatly appreciate it.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!",15Jan2019,1
538,"Well I don’t really know where to start. So I met my best friend at University at our halls of residence. Since day 1 we’ve been inseparable, we basically spent every waking moment together and when we weren’t together we’d be talking to each other on WhatsApp etc. We lived together for our second year at Uni as well. We went through a lot of shit together, when there was drama with our other housemates we would always be there for each other. Honestly, I don’t know what I would’ve done without her.

During our 3rd year, we lived separately. This was because we were both doing year long internships in opposite sides of the country. This put some strain in our relationship because seeing each other was really difficult, but we made it through and we still spoke everyday throughout. There were a few times when we had disagreements cause she’d promise to go on holiday with me so we could spend time together, but then later she’d tell me she couldn’t go anymore because she had no money. But the annoying thing was, she’d have no money because she’d go on a holiday with her other friends and be upfront with me about that being the reason she had no money. I left it cause I’m not the type to argue. Although it did upset me. But it wasn’t enough for us to fall out about. 

When we went back to our final year, things were really weird because even though we were back in our Uni town, we barely saw each other. We decided not to live together because she wanted to live with her course friends, which I wasn’t that bothered about. I would always say that I would make time to see her, which I always would when she wanted to see me. We always met up at my house cause she always moaned about how much her housemates annoyed her. I got on really well with my housemates and we spent a lot of time together. I think this really pissed off my friend. Towards the end of our final year, she always blamed the reason why we didn’t see each other was because I never made the effort to see her and she took no blame in that. This really annoyed me because she would always blame me for everything and it baffled me that she thought this. I was the one who would always invite her around to my house so she could get away from her housemates, I’d always invite her whenever I had other friends over or whenever we had pre drinks. But she was the one who chose to not come. She never invited me when she had friends around to theirs, and it was honestly an embarrassing experience whenever her friends would be like “oh yeah we’re having people around tonight did she not invite you etc.” My friend would always make up some lame excuse of why she didn’t invite me etc. Again, it bothered me but not enough to fall out over.

Over this summer, we grew even further apart. There was such a double standard in our friendship. For example, she’d have a go at me if it took me an hour or two to reply but she would always say that I was needy whenever I would pick up on her not replying for me for days. I invited her out for dinner one week as we hadn’t seen each other since we left uni. She replied two weeks later basically just making a joke of it. I haven’t spoken to her since. I’m done with having to make all the effort and getting nothing in return.

tldr; I’ve not spoken to one of my best friends from uni in months. 

Do you guys think I should cut it off completely or do you think I should try and make up with her?

540,"for context, we have been friends for over 10 years. i know this kid since freshman year highschool. We are both immigrants in America and he always had a hard time fitting in because hes different (I'm Iranian and He's Jamaican) but he used his difference to his advantage and started accepting himself and was doing so well in life. Hes one of my best friends. We've been through a lot together and at this point we are like brothers. We both are very spiritual people but hes always been a little more extreme with that stuff but honestly it never caused a problem until now.

 He has a child and is living with his girlfriend in her house. sometime last week he stopped going to work, went to a tattoo shop and got a tattoo of a star, some sort of moons and flames right on his FOREHEAD. he started saying how he IS God, He is Ra, He is Jesus Christ incarnate and how everything is him. He kept saying he created everything and everything is a part of him. Ive used psychedellic drugs before and i get that and I understand it to a certain point. In my trips ive felt god in me and got in touch with my godly self and all those experiences I had was within a certain spiritual frame. THIS IS DIFFERENT. He has never tripped ever. He only smokes weed. He started being violent towards his girlfriend saying that if she ""disobeys"" him he has to ""discipline"" her.  two days ago he was running around the neighbourhood without a shirt or shoes. We live in the east coast and currently its freezing outside. somebody called the cops cause they thought he was crazy and the cops came and tazed him and took him to the hospital. When he got discharged I went to see him. He was calmer but he still said the same things as he was saying. He also said getting tazed was part of his ritual. 

His girlfriend called me today and shes worried to death about him and I am too. we dont wanna turn him in but at the same time I have no idea what to do. I called up another good friend today and Im meeting up with him tonight just to talk about what to do but any advice is appreciated.

I (30, F) used to hook up with a friend (28? 32? M. No idea. Didn't ask. Didn't care). Sex-wise it was mind-blowing. One of those magical situations where our bodies just KNEW how to fuck each other. Everything else-wise it was a cluster. Like, I actively hated this guy, but would hate him even more if he wouldn't come over and smash.   


Several years later we're chill but he moved out of town and we've gotten on with our lives. I saw him at a party a few weeks ago and my brain and body are going nuts. I mean losing track of myself in the middle of the day, VIVID wet dreams that I wake up panting from, the whole thing. And it's not like I'm not getting laid. I'm in a happy open relationship with a person I love very much. I just really want that D. 

&amp;#x200B;

The worst part is that I'm going to coincidentally (I swear, I'm taking a class) be in the town the dude moved to in a few months. Obviously, the solution is to hit him up when I'm in town. Or it should be? Back when we were hooking up on the regs he had this weird complex about me falling in love with him. As noted, I didn't love him. I still don't love him. I never loved him. Like... bro, can we just bang? I'm afraid if I propose this he's going to go all crazy again. We have a lot of mutual friends and I just don't like drama in general. I just want to hook up when I happen to be in town and go back to my life.  


Any advice on how to say it? Whether to say it? Yes, I could just find some other dude, but 1) I know this guy is good, 2) I know this guy is safe, 3) my body really wants this particular dick right now. Honestly, I have no motivation to deal with strange dudes. I'm old, I'm lazy and I don't like complication.  


So what should I do? Just forget about it? Find some other random hook up? Say something to him and see how it goes? How do you proposition a guy who acts like even a casual hello is a marriage proposal? I won't even need to spend the night! I have other arrangements for a place to stay and would have every intention of getting the fuck out ASAP. This should be the easiest thing in the universe shouldn't it?

545,"I, (27F) and my housemate (23F) are not seeing eye to eye at all these days. She has started seeing a boy that is locally infamous for his drug use and bad decisions. My mother has known him and his family forever and has been kept in the loop about him over the years. She told me he was begging her for money just weeks ago... and that he didn’t need to be around my daughter (9F). I refuse to put her in any kind of danger. There’s no room for negotiations there. Anyway, everyone that knows this boy has advised her to stay far away. He’s a jobless, carless, couch surfer (20M) with 2 kids under 3 that he’s obviously not supporting. She’s a good kid... fresh out of her first and only relationship of several years (High school to late last year). She’s just graduated from Cosmetology school but still works at Sonic. Now, her relationship and risky behaviors aren’t my business, BUT i don’t want him around my child... I don’t want him in my house. I feel as if I can’t trust her because of how she’s completely disregarded everything we’ve talked about and jumped head first into the shallow end with him. She had promised to hold him accountable in doing better until she was sure he was trustworthy. She did not. The way my lease is set up, she rents a room from me and I’m the lease holder. I don’t want to have to kick her out but my quality of life has decreased due to the depression of losing my closest friend (roomie) and the anxiety of not knowing when he’s in my home... even after I’ve told her he’s not allowed overnight while my daughter is there.

Background: My brother is 26 years old. He lives at home with both of my parents and grandmother. He’s tried living on his own and always failed because he is trying to chase his dreams of being a musician and doesn’t make enough money to survive on his own. 
At a young age my brother was diagnosed with Tourette’s. He has always felt like an “outsider” in our family, even though we try to include him in everything we do. Because of his Tourette’s, he has HORRIBLE anger issues. He’s also morbidly obese and (in my opinion) horribly depressed. He does have a girlfriend, but they’ve been off and on for a few months and are already discussing couples counseling.
My parents always told us to not argue with him (even when he’s 100% incorrect) because of his explosive personality. Over the years he has become more irrational and out of control. We have begged him to see a doctor, and he has gone a few times, but after he gets medication, he takes himself off if it because he feels he knows when to stop taking his meds (high dose of anti depressants). 
I was just informed by my other sibling that he was at their house the other night and he became belligerent and irrational during a casual conversation (he was sober, he never drinks) and it escalated to where they threatened to call the police on him because he refused to leave. His response is they needed to leave (from their own house!). He finally left, but left my sibling shaken and terrified. This is one example of his rage. My father once took his phone out and recorded my Brother’s outrageous behavior.
We are at a crossroads. I don’t think we have time to sit around and wait for therapy, because there’s no guarantee he’ll stick with it!
Is there anything we can do to help him? If my parents kick him out, he’s stubborn enough to walk out with nothing and freeze on the streets and my mother would never do it. Would him being institutionalized be beneficial at all?

I hate going to class but I love being in class. I’m not sure if that makes sense but it’s the best way to describe it. I love learning and I find the topics so interesting. Once I’m comfortable with someone, I always can make them laugh and smile.

People still tell me that they adore me and aspire to be like me. My girlfriend says that I’m the funniest and most caring person she’s ever met. My friends sometimes will randomly tell me how much I mean to them and how great I am. I guess it’s just hard to see it in myself. I used to see myself as an actual god among men. Now, I feel so worthless. I always worry about my girlfriend cheating on me. I know that she isn’t and I also am aware, even if she was, worrying and questioning her wouldn’t help the situation.

I’m not sure what I’m asking for here but I just don’t want to feel alone with this feeling. I want to be the sarcastic asshole that everyone loved and maybe I still am... I just have a hard time seeing it. Has anyone else been through this? How did you get out of it? I started anxiety and ADHD medicine about 4 months ago and it helps for sure. Just was wondering if maybe there’s more that I can do.",15Jan2019,1

I know I’m financially able to move out. I have saved over 2k in the last 6 months of working, and by the time I move in I’ll have held my job for a year. I just got a raise.

563,"So I'm ""friends"" with this woman who has 3 kids and another on the way. She is homeschooling them but refuses to actually teach them anything. They are 5, 6, and I believe 8 and none of them can read, they don't even seem to know their basic shapes. I've been trying to get some kind of authority to deal with that but that's just a side note so you better understand the situation.

The kids are constantly yelled at and verbally mistreated. One of them got yelled at for asking for a healthier snack. They constantly get screamed at and they seem to be filled with anxiety to even do anything. Everytime I come over they always want me to play with them and the few times I've babysat them it was some of the most fun ever. They all are super sweet and just want to play board games or have me run around with them. One time the oldest mentioned that he really wanted to read harry potter but can't read and his mom refuses to read to him at all. I kinda want to start going over there and reading the books to the kids because I want them to have a fun and good role model. Problem is I rarely get asked to babysit them because she pushes them off on her family members all the time and when I come over to see her she will yell at them for even talking to me.

564,"So I’m in a Mock Congress club and have been since last year. 

There are conferences every two or three weeks where each school writes a bill or resolution and then students will write speeches stating their position on the subject and there will be questions, motions, etc.

I was really busy last year during the week so I couldn’t go to any of the conferences but I wanted to try and go to some this year.

Well I’ve told my teacher I could go to the one upcoming tomorrow with the intention to just test the waters and see how the process goes for a later conference that I might actually speak at. The issue is, he asked me what bill I’d be writing on and I told him I didn’t know yet.

I have to give a speech! We had a speech meeting today which is where I told him I’d probably go but I didn’t have anything written up or anything. He told us at the beginning of the year that people going for the first time could be sort of observers, etc but it seems like I’m expected to speak and I’m completely terrified and unprepared!

I want to back out but not many people are going to this one, just me and two others, and I don’t know what to do! I don’t want to act like a coward and just say I can’t go now (I probably couldn’t even think of a good reason why not) but I reeeaaallly don’t want to go now. I regret raising my hand.

I have to give him a permission slip in order to go tomorrow (which I don’t know if I have) so maybe that could be an out?

I dunno, I’m just really stressed and don’t even think it’s practical for me to go at this point. Does anyone have a suggestion for what I could do? 

I would appreciate any advice.

She makes it  extremely difficult to hold a conversation with her. I constantly have to try and keep it going but she never adds anything to it apart from generic responses such as '""yeah"" or ""no way really"" etc. Our conversations never go any deeper than small talk. There are only a handful of topics to talk about over and over again. Then we run out of things to say then it becomes awkward and makes me not want to spend time with her which I feel guilty about. I don't know if she is aware of this but I do know other people feel the same way when they talk to her. When she wants to make plans I find myself making excuses because it's painful to find things to talk about.

572,"Hi everyone I am 32 and my wife is 31. We’ve been married for six years, dated three years before that.

In college, I was raped by two women who held me down and sodomized me and forced me to perform tasks on them. I tried to report it to my school but they not only dismissed my story but they also began to inquire if I was the one who had been doing the raping. I dropped the matter because I was getting vibes that if I pursued it that it would end up badly for me.

Ever since then I have held in all the pain, frustration and anger from that event and not telling a single soul until last night. I thought I could trust my wife to listen to and believe me but I guess I thought wrong.

What happened was we were discussing the new Gillette commercial and in a debate about it, I said something along the lines of “well when I was raped it was by two women; and when I tried to report it, it was to a female counselor at the school, who dismissed me and actually threatened to investigate me for potentially raping someone”.

She flew off the handle and accused me of making it up so I gave an excuse to blame women for my rape. I mean no shit I blame *some* women for it - the directly ones involved! But I don’t think it’s reflective of all women.

I confessed the full story to her including all details. It wasn’t easy for me since I’ve never opened up to anyone before; not my parents, not a therapist and certainly not any of my male or female friends.

This has left me extremely emotional and sick to my stomach. The one person I trusted to believe me and have my back has accusers me of making it up to “further my irrational anger towards a stupid commercial”.

578,"Recently him and I got into an argument about this. He says that all I do is give him one-word answers and that I don't like talking to him. He's not wrong, but I don't know how to talk to him in any other way. He doesn't seem to take any interest in the conversation itself, just the idea of having a conversation. He calls it ""being social."" He rarely remembers anything that we talk about in the conversations at all. In addition, whenever we do manage to have a discussion, he has a very poor understanding of what I am trying to convey. He misses jokes, doesn't understand sarcasm, and generally misses the point of what I mean to say. He also tries to turn every discussion into an opportunity for him to give me advice. I appreciate that he wants to be fatherly and give me advice, but his advice is literally the most vague, useless, and obvious stuff you can think up. When I try to explain some project I'm working on, he pauses the whole conversation and tells me something along the lines of ""The most important thing is to never give up,"" as if it is a breakthrough that will change the course of whatever I'm working on. I don't expect him to have answers to everything, but it seems to me like he poses whatever vague idioms and phrases he can think of as advice in order to seem like he does have an answer. Overall, I now tend to not give much weight to conversations I have with him because they do not have any substance and go nowhere.

581,"Hi everyone,


I am a 23 year old male and kind of struggling right now with my life. I could really go for some advice. 

I recently returned to Seattle after some complications involving getting my Bachelor's degree. I worked really hard to complete it in four years but it didn't end up going my way and I kind of had a burnout. I have been stressed out for a while and need some time to think for myself. I moved back with my parents and I am somewhat at a loss. I will  most likely be returning next year to complete my Bachelor's degree. However, in the meantime I need to sort out some questions. Advice/help would be greatly appreciated.

Career: My bachelor's degree, when it is completed, will be in history. I don't have any internships, however and am kind of at a loss what I want to do. In the Netherlands, where I got my degree, there wasn't of opportunities for internships during my Bachelor's. Although I really like history, I don't want to do my masters in it. The Bachelors felt too stale and mundane and I was constantly sitting down and reading articles. Ideally, I would like to go and do a masters in the U.S. where I could set my own path and own direction and make valuable connections. My interests are wide, but are all related to people. Some of these things include: History, Politics, Social sciences, Technology, Management. I am not a huge fan of business, but I like management because it involves people and leadership. I want to be able to help people. Any advice on this? 

Place to live: So I was born in the Netherlands, but have also lived in the US for a while. My mom is American and my dad is Dutch. I have lived and moved ten different times in my life, across two different countries, so I have seen a lot. I can deal with a lot of change. However, I am also constantly searching for a place to settle down. I have lived in the Netherlands (Hoorn, Haarlem, and Nijmegen) and in the US (Florida, Texas, and Seattle). I moved back to the Netherlands because I didn't think I was really American. However, after moving back to my country of birth, I quickly realized that I was more American than I thought. None of the places I have lived in before I really loved. Seattle is nice but the weather really gets me down and it can be hard to meet people. Florida and Texas were fun but too hot. I have never been to the Midwest so maybe I should give that a try. I do prefer the East coast to the West coast, though.

People: I am a natural extrovert and have a hard time holding back at times. I can be intense for some. However, because I've moved around so many times, I don't have a lot of friends and I have lost contact with many of my friends over the years. I naturally desire to connect with others, so this can be really hard. I often feel lonely because I don't have the opportunity to sit still and be tethered to a certain place. College in Europe was tough too. It was hard to connect with others, though this also has to do with myself and personal problems in regards to my family. What do you think are the best places for people who desire to connect with others and where it's easy to make friends? 


Thank you everyone. I hope someone can help me out.

I asked him what he would want me to do to lower the sound level (I use headphones all the time and go to university 6h a day so I'm not home that often).

My feelings continued to grow despite my lack of power in this situation. We still continue to talk a lot.

The vacations comes and with it the hope that her love would fade, spoiler it did not so they are going out. I continue to think about her.

Despite everything i still love her and needed to say it, so i brought up all of my courage to say it to her, so i said it even if i knew it couldn't bring anything good. 

She was really surprised and she said ""Oh no..."" with pity in it. We talked a bit by message and she said she had no problems staying friends and that she has no problems with me, nothing really changed for her.

596,"My husband &amp; I visited his family recently, he was reluctant to go as he feels he is the black sheep of the family &amp; we haven’t seen them all together for quite some time but see them individually a couple of times a year however I wanted to support him so I was encouraging him by reassuring him I would be by his side...I felt apprehensive too but I was very conscious of controlling that &amp; reassuring myself we were there for each other.
Once we arrived the first day was lovely, my husband was getting along really well with his siblings &amp; having a great time. Then his mother arrived &amp; everyone was getting along until my husband &amp; his siblings started disappearing &amp; leaving me with her. She was obviously very uncomfortable as was I, it was becoming obvious they were avoiding her &amp; I just happened to be the only one left to deal with her. 
I spoke to my husband &amp; asked him to please be aware of the dynamics, that I thought treating her like that was very passive aggressive &amp; that I didn’t appreciate being left alone to counsel her...sure she has her own issues but she did her best as a mother. He apologised &amp; reassured me he would be more aware. As the day progressed his sister said my husband had told her I was getting annoyed at him for being left alone with his mother, which was true but I was embarrassed &amp; even more annoyed that he had shared our private conversation to his siblings &amp; their partners. I spoke to him again quite angry this time telling him I was furious he had shared that &amp; that my patience was wearing thin to which he shut the conversation down like a toddler saying “Fine we just won’t see them again for another decade”....I was hurt, angry &amp; shocked that he tried to put this on me when I’ve always supported &amp; most times instigated reaching out to his family plus the decade comment was overly dramatic, it’s been 4 months.
We end up coming home &amp; when I was calm I told him never to share private conversations we have &amp; that I felt he didn’t have my back at all or even care how uncomfortable I was feeling because he was revelling in no longer being the black sheep or isolated because now they’re doing that to their mother. He said he understood but he was rather dismissive.
So his mother messages me wanting to clarify a family story that was told by his sister which I didn’t think was much so I asked him if he got the same message &amp; he said yes but wanted me to send it to him. I did because he is my husband &amp; we’re meant to trust each other, anyway he was on his phone messaging more than usual so I had a feeling something was off so I looked at his phone, yes I shouldn’t have &amp; take responsibility for that &amp; I saw he had messaged it to his sister where they continued bitching about her.
His family don’t really know what loyalty is, one of them is always on the outer &amp; they use this kind of drama to bond &amp; manipulate each other but I really don’t know what to say to my husband now after asking him so many times not to share what I’ve told him!? I’m fine owning up to reading his message but how to express I don’t want to be drawn into their drama &amp; I feel horrible that the message his mum sent to me may be used to further manipulate &amp; conquer &amp; divide.

597,"I’ve been depressed since I was 11, after the death of my father (suicide, manic bipolar depression). And, aside from a couple of (undiscovered) failed suicide attempts, I’ve tried nearly every day since to get better. Therapists and psychologists and hospitals and programs. Exercise, socializing, cutting ties, picking up hobbies, dropping bad habits. No alcohol, no drugs, no unprotected sex, no binge eating. No frivolous spending, no untidy living space, no late nights, no sleeping until 12. Traveling, education, no education, job change, moving across states. Speaking my mind, staying silent. Cooking, and cleaning, and working, and dying. 

My hobbies are strewn around my room like carcasses. It doesn’t make me happy to read. It doesn’t make me happy to watch tv. It doesn’t make me happy to do yoga, or cook, or paint, or sketch, or write.

I’m turning 21 on Thursday. 

A decade of misery. 

There is not a single person alive who knows how hard I’ve tried or how long I’ve struggled. 

If it hasn’t gotten better by now, I don’t see the point in trying anything else anymore. 

I always wanted to ask my therapist if, after a certain point, she ever can’t help but think that maybe her clients should just be allowed to end it. But I know she’s legally obligated to say no, so I don’t ask. 

None of you are legally obligated to say anything at all. But, hand to god, if I can just find one person who will stop bullshitting me, who will tell me straight up, “if you don’t want this life then don’t have it,” I’ll end it tonight. I’m past waiting. I’m past trying. The most peaceful thing in the world to me right now would be to die. 

“Tomorrow might be better,” what horseshit.

Someone please tell me I need to go. I’m tired of people saying no. I’m tired of people pretending I have a valid reason why I should stay.

Just tell me so I can know if I should look at the sunset or just crawl back to my room and sleep away another day. ",15Jan2019,1

601,"Hey guys,

so in october of last year I finaly managed to get into university after overcoming some obstacles and currently studying philosophy and history as subjects to teach as a teacher.

I few weeks ago I started to realize that, while I really love philosophy as a whole, I hate studying it. I never would've imagine that it can be this math oriented (logical analysis etc., I suck badly at maths). It's really hard for me.

This whole thing throw me into some kind of midlife crisis. I'm 29 years old, got my abitur to be able to study at universities not even 1 year ago and never had a real full-time job. Just part times while doing school at the same time. And now that I'm able to study I feel like I can't just try out different things as time runs out. Yes, there are people older than me studying but they have long work experience etc. Now I feel I have to study something well worth the long way it took me to even start.

I'm heavily interested in different fields but, AFAIK, I can't do them. And the fact how hard philosophy is for me I even doubt my intelligence.

- Astronomy: To bad at Math

- Psychology: To bad at Math

- Gamedesigne: Pretty much needs programming skills = Math

- Detective/Cop: Close to age limit / some past medical issues which could (most likely) eliminate any chances completely

- Writer: To risky

- Surgeon: Most likely complicated as hell/to dumb, takes ages to finish

Those are pretty much paths I would've chosen before teaching and now I feel I'm stuck with teaching but I feel like there is no subject besides history I could see myself enjoy teaching. Philosophy was one I'd love to teach, but studying it just sucks. It's no fun at all. In addition, teaching requires students in my region to learn Latin, no matter what subjects you choose. And my brain has a hard (even harder) time learning something, when I feel there is no point in doing. So that's another con point for teacher.

I'm seriously lost and am worried more by each day that I can't find subjects that I will enjoy studying and teaching or even another career path which might fit me better.",15Jan2019,1

My symptoms are:
•Misunderstanding things (I can't read facial expressions very often and don't always get jokes. I sometimes also hear words but can't understand them)
•People can't always tell when I'm joking
•I hate things out of place (I nearly had an actual breakdown once because I thought I'd have to wear odd socks)
•I sometimes get very scared when something's out of place (such as seeing a stranger knock on my door)
•I hate when unexpected things happen and fear them
•Can get an extreme butterfly sensation in my stomach (can last for days and prevent sleep)
•Fear social situations (sometimes drink before them so I can go to them)
•Notice little noises and things which can cause anguish
•Very impractical (can't do some basic things but succeed in school)
•Restless (constantly fidget if I have to stay still)
•Can't concentrate on one thing for periods of time
•Am easily distracted by little things
•Sometimes fear losing control of my body and think everyone hates me
•Generally weird - not very good at interacting with people and can make weird noises and blurts (they're not really impulsive I just can't think of any words to say). Am also told I'm very immature

605,"Backstory: During college I became very close friends with one of my classmates (lets call her Jane), and we have remained friends 2 years after graduating. She lives one town over from me, we have a ton in common, and I would say she is my best friend. 

Jane also has a solid friendship group of three people she has been friends with since they were kids. They are all very close, pretty much the ideal friend group - they go on trips together, share an apartment, etc. I see their instagram posts of them all hanging out together and it makes me wish I could be a part of that.

Jane has invited me to hang out with the group a number of times. Every time, they all pretty much ignored me, with Jane being the only one to make an effort to include me. I couldn't involve myself in most of their conversations because it was all inside jokes or conversations about stuff they'd done before or people they knew from school. 

They also seem to have a general dislike of me. One time I was hanging out with Jane and one of them called to ask her if she wanted to hang out. When she said she was with me, they sounded mad and half-jokingly called Jane a snake, as if hanging out with me was a betrayal. Another example is when Jane invited me out with them one time, one of them said ""why is SHE here?"" as soon as she saw me. 

I still hang out with Jane on my own, but I can't help feeling like I'm second best because I will never be a part of her inner friend circle. The obvious answer would be to make more friends of my own. But I come from a small quiet town where there are no social clubs/groups for young people. I've finished college, and there are no people my age where I work. So I really have no social opportunities, other than Jane. ",15Jan2019,1

608,"I work at a large furniture store.
I am registered as someone with a permanent disability due to mental health issues. Over the last year, I've been in a rather tumultuous relationship and it has exasperated my mental health stuff and as a result I've called in sick several days over this in the last year. 
This Sunday, my partner kicked me out of the apartment we are staying in together. 
I was supposed to work from 10am-6pm. I texted the girl I was on shift with at 830am saying ""Hey lovely, I had a terrible last few days and I booked myself a therapy session this morning because I really need it. I'm still going to try to come in today but I'm going to be late. I should get there by 12"" . I only told her that much because we are pretty good friends at work and she's expressed to me before that she's battled with depression.
The Sunday previous, we had also worked together and she had texted right at 10 saying she was feeling unwell and running late, to which I said no problem. 
So flash forward again to me saying I will be there at noon, and she replied no problem just tell the manager on duty. I did just that and texted that manager and said ""Hey, I have an appointment this morning, so I will be a bit late, I should be there around noon"".
I specifically left out the therapy part because I didn't want that to be public knowledge.
Then the girl I was supposed to work with texting me again, saying she asked another girl to come in and cover for me and that if I needed to take the day off, I could and that she hoped I would fee better soon. 
So I took the day off.
On Saturday I was scheduled to work again. I came in and the first person I saw was the janitor, he immediately asked me if I was alright, I have a pretty shitty cold right now and thought I looked a bit rough and that's why he was asking. 
Then I walk by three of the sales people, who all stoped to ask me again if I was okay and said that they hoped I was feeling better. Again, I assumed I looked like ass and it was about me being sick.
Then on my lunch break, one of the sales people, who I honestly really really like, came into the break room. Now this guy is a bit of a weirdo but the sweetest and best kind of weirdo. So anyways, he asked me if I was okay and then went on to say ""you know people my age (he's 64) feel the way you do too"" and then he goes on to talk about depression and starts saying ""this is about your relationship right"" and asked me some questions about my partner. All in all, he was very sweet and just trying to comfort me.
However, it's clear now that my personal business has spread across the entire work place. This of course makes me quite uncomfortable and I'm pretty distressed about it. 
What can I do about this now? I'm upset that this got around the whole work place and I am upset that the girl I work with obviously told at least one other person. I also don't know how to feel comfortable going back now...",15Jan2019,1

Asking for an advice, trick or something.

We have a community of about 120 homes in a suburban area, but not too far from the city - right at the city boundary. We are considered an unincorporated area. In our community there is quite a number of rentals. One of them seems to be rented to a small-time drug dealer. How do I know he's a dealer? Well, I am confident 99% he is, based on my experience and reports of other neighbors. The things we observe about this guy do not fit into normal order of things. And I literally saw him dealing, but of course I can't know what was dealt... Hence 99%.

Police have been notified. They in their turn passed the info to the narcotics team, with whom I had conversation as well. But nothing seems to be changing.

612,"Hi there,

Well, a lot happened recently. So I will try to first briefly describe the situation and highlight some issues.

**About me**

I am a 15 year old teenager in high school. I live in India and currently going through the angst phase or so I believe. It's the teenage crisis, I guess. I have a history of negligence and abuse. Some that went for years and turn into severe trust issues, depression, social anxiety and pessimistic self loathing personality.

**About family**

It's probably not trustworthy coming out of a teenager but my family has lots of issues. To back that up, my dad needs mental healthcare more than me. He is overprotective (that's fine) but he is an idiot and a compulsive liar which makes him prune to poor decision making. He stopped me from playing sports, eating what I wanted, locked me up inside home and some other stuff from first grade. I had asked him many times to consider my opinion or feelings when he takes any decision regarding me but he blatantly ignored them many times. He depends on me emotionally and have always been like that. He is childish and have broken my trust countless times. When my sister died due to drowning (possible murder but not confirmed or investigated), I think he broke down. A year later, my mom died due to cancer while being 6 months pregnant. That was it, I guess. He would cry and ask me to console him. Well, I was a 7 year old kid that time. So, what would I do? That wasn't really ""good"" for me (I don't wanna go into details,  I guess). He would brainwash me every day into thinking that no one needs me or everyone will leave me just like they left him. Well, a lot of fight and stupid arguments happened. He wasn't/isn't stable both emotionally and mentally. He would use guilt tripping to make me do certain stuff even if I didn't want to. Other family members were kind of similar. I suggested him when I was 8 years old that he should put me in boarding school but he declined. I asked him to change schools and put me in a better program since the current school that I was in that time wasn't exactly good. He put me there because it was convenient for him. Well, again a lot of weird quirky issues and stupid arguments but in the end, I have changed 6 schools until now and it wasn't exactly a smooth ride. I and my family have nothing in common as far as interest/culture/food/belief goes. I am non vegetarian while they are all vegetarians. I am an atheist while they are all bunch of religious twats that practices prayers and use smokes/blessings to treat herpes. What kind of joke is that? Similar story with my relatives - some believe in babas (priest), some are smoke/prayers, some are into homeopathy and temples. I think my major loss of trust from my dad when he and his family decided to hide the remarriage. Yeah, he remarried and come home one day with his new wife and son with no information whatsoever. It would make me feel a bit better if his wife were the same as him but she and his son had been talking about it for months and knew about me and my school pretty well. My relatives did the same. They lied. They had a two day wedding while I was alone at home. That happened 2 years ago. Now to make things worse, the new step mom is autistic (I think she falls high on that spectrum) and bipolar possibly. She is also a failed highschooler and from a very backward tribalistic community. Her son (not biological son since her husband had some fertility problems that weren't revealed until later on which made my idiotic dad get her pregnant since he fucking thought she was the one who couldn't get pregnant). I don't wanna continue to talk about this. This is just depressing but there are a lot of minor issues as well. They were fighting every day literally until her son (actually her brother's son) left and got back to his family. There were so many fucks and there are to this day. 

&amp;#x200B;

One more incident I would like to add - My cousin sexually abused me or kind of raped me when I was 4-5. That possibly made me Bi, I guess...first gay experience...

Another thing would be my dad likes to take me jokingly because he has on multiple times for years ignored my health issues related to my depression, anxiety, asthma, skin problems, weight, constant headaches, insomnia and occasional auditory hallucination at night which made it much more harder to attend school since mine started at 6:30 am and I would sleep at 3 am - 4 am.

**What happened in few months?**

Basically I broke down, I first tried to get into hospital since I was fed up with bullshit and couldn't take it anymore by salt od. The LD50 for salt is 180-220 g for an average adult. I ended up taking a lot of it and puked for hours. Got into hospital. Still, they didn't take me seriously when I had been asking for help for the past 2 years... I get up and study for the mid-terms. I basically just got through it somehow but the stress from those left me more stressed. My first suicide attempt with a school tie and a door. Look up partial suspension (basically blocking carotid to stop the flow of blood to brain). It broke. That was fucking bad,  I guess. I took a knife and started cutting. Family wakes up in the morning and sees blood. They finally freak out and then fuck, those retards start guilt tripping again. If it was someone not emotionally dead, things could have become violent then...so we acted like nothing happened after wards. My dad finally takes me serious. We see a bad fucking psych that is a fucking idiot. I had used up all my energy. It was just fucking enough. I was dead serious on killing myself and stopped going to school. My family instead of supporting just took everything I could use to kill myself from my room and denied any order that come for me. I seriously don't understand what the fuck is wrong with these people. I would spent my time on forums and research more and more ways to die. I would drown in a bucket of water every day to see if I can hold my breathe for a little longer and get some water inside my lungs. It was painful but I was determined, I guess. Ligature strangulation, plastic bag, tourniquet, SN, and some other minor methods. I tried them all. I wish I had a place to hang. Anyways not relevant, I guess. Other methods were out of reach or required going out which I couldn't due to my social anxiety and lack of any tall buildings.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I personally believe in right to die and that it should be legalized for everyone regardless of their situation/health.

So, what I want to do now - 

1. Die using painful method/unreliable shit since that's all I can access (I will make sure to do it tho. I am already emotionally dead and some minutes of pain ain't worth everyday of it)
2. Get help but as I previously described, my family ain't much of help neither are relatives. If I do get it, I would have to struggle on my own but I just don't have any life left inside me. Even if I do get it, I don't have any energy to consider going back to school that sucks balls. It's just not for me. I would like to somehow get more control over what I can/want to learn. If that's possible somehow, this option might be lucrative for me. 

Sorry. I think there are many things I haven't been able to provide and the post is kind of messy but I don't have any resources on me and I just don't have any life. I am taking my last chance here. I can see why life can be good/beautiful for others but for me, the happiest moment of my life spent sitting on my computer table working on some open source project or watching youtube videos alone. And now, I just don't care enough about that shit anymore. Yeah depression might be temporary and this feelings may change and I experience better things But the opposite can also happen. It's a calculated risk imo. Anyways, It's 4:30 am here.....

Let me know if you want more info, I guess. ",15Jan2019,1
613,"So, let me first start off by saying that I was diagnosed with severe major depression about 3 and a half years ago. I feel that I getting much better. However I can’t seem to shake the feeling of having no urgency to do things or having interest  in doing the things I used to love.

There is a thing that I have decided to devote my time to. I made an agreement with one of my city council men that I would help him and give him ideas on how to get the community more involved. We made this agreement at the end of November. I still have yet to contact him back. 

Last semester I had failed one class and barely passed two others (this was my first semester in college). I am now on academic probation. I didn’t do any of the assigned homework or extra curricula. I felt as though something was holding me back from doing it. I didn’t feel that I needed to do it I suppose. But, I knew I could do it if I put some will into it. I didn’t of course. 

These two things are very important responsibilities that I have dedicated my life to. Yet there is absolutely no urgency to do any if it.   I feel like it is the depression to some extent, but I also feel that that is an excuse. I could do anything I wanted to yet I don’t feel it, if you can understand what I am trying to say, I don’t fully understand this myself. 

This same feeling  goes for things that for want to do outside of my responsibilities like hobbies or things I want to do. Like writing

My questions would be what should I do to combat this? How do I go about doing that? Another question is how do I get off my ASS and just do things? ",15Jan2019,1

616,"Hello, my name is Kevin Torres I’m 21 and from Miami and this is my story, I been on Reddit for Years now bit only really read through stories but here is my situation in life right now.

Its been 3 years since my father left my mother and I because of problems that my parents always had.

Since then I had to work 60-80 hours a week to be able to maintain the house and pay all the bills, until recently in March.

On March 29 I was admitted to the hospital because I kept feeling strong pain on my left shoulder which was when I was told that I fractured my shoulder. The fracture was not conducted at Dominos, which was where I worked. 

Being that I worked at Domino’s it was pretty difficult to work when my job description is stretching dough and making sure the store is running correctly. 

This prompted me to not be able to work at full capacity as I normally do, I couldn’t work properly for a month until I was instructed by the doctor that I could take the sling off permanently.

Halfway through the month, my hours were cut because I wasn’t able to perform as I normally would. Day by day I was getting more and more stressed and anxious because I wasn’t getting put on the schedule and not making enough money.

My mother doesn’t work because unfortunately she doesn’t have papers and has been down on her luck when it comes to jobs. Making me the only person able to work and pay all the necessities for the household.


Because of this, I did a incredible stupid decision of stealing from Domino’s, I know that under no circumstances is it ok to do so because it is breaking the law. But because of the situation I was in and the thought of going homeless and not having money to maintain the house and my mother.

After my arm was healed, I was told that we can no longer do overtime and that made me worry even more. So feeling back up against the wall and not finding any jobs at the moment, I decided to continue to steal. 

On August 17 I was discovered by Loss &amp; Prevention and admitted to it and then on August 23 I was arrested and charged with Grand Theft 3rd Degree and had to get bail out which was $5,000.

My court date was a month later, and since it was my first crime I was able to do a diversion program which consist of going once a month for 6 months  and paying back the amount by 6 month as well as doing a anti theft class which I already completed

I understand that I got the best possible outcome and I do really appreciate it, but I’m struggling to get enough money for rent, food, insurance etc. 

I haven’t been about to get a decent job because of the charge being on my record until I get it dimissed so I been in and out of jobs just barely being able to maintain the house. Unfortunately I haven’t had work for the past 3 weeks and do not have enough to cover for rent and food. I managed to get some to scrape by until this month but I don’t have enough to pay for my phone bill soon.

I know what I did was wrong in very sense but staying only one night in a jail cell was enough for me to know this is not a place I want to be in. I truly learned my lesson and I have come out of this a better person. Being young and in this position made me feel overwhelmed with all this responsibility piled on top but I know to always take the right choice in life from now on. 

Now I don’t know what to do, I try so hard to be positive and work every day on getting a job but because of my record I can’t really acquire that. 

Thank you for sticking through and reading this, I know it’s long but I wanted to be as transparent as possible so I can convey to anyone reading this my genuine emotions and intentions. If you have any question I’m be more than please to answer them, and thank you in advance for anything you may decide to leave, wherever that be in comments.

Calls her when I'm not home. Deletes the text messages. We've talked about it and he knows it upsets me but he keeps talking to her anyway. I'm jealous for the first time in my life and I don't know what to do with it. Angered and agitated worry.  I don't think my jealousy comes from my insecurities. Its because he's got a side chick huh? ,15Jan2019,1

627,"Hello, Im not sure if this is the right sub for this but I thought I would try anyway, My story does involve pornography so please proceed at your own risk… I have had problems with pornography for a very long time, when I was maybe like 10. Me and a buddy were on my parents computer when somehow we ended up on multiple porn sites. (I really don’t know why they let us on the computer because there was porn on it, but it was not from us I went through the hard drive years later.) The fact of the matter is some of those images stuck with me. Flash forward I get a computer for my birthday, probably about 12 maybe 13 and I got a computer, I have no specific dates really, and I’m not really sure what order some of this stuff happened. Long story short I ended up back on porn again, (who would’ve guessed). One time I searched nudists into google images, unknown to me nudists often post pictures of their entire family with them. I don’t have a razor sharp memory, as you can probably tell. But I do recall a photo where a family was standing sideways right next to each other making like a human staircase. This is the only image of this type I can recall, but I do not doubt there were others like it. My second Concern is that one time I was on site an ad popped up of a really short girl next to a naked dude. (The site was used in memes for a short while, at least I think this was the site I was on, I’m too afraid to go back and look now, here it is in a meme [https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/comments/5wogl5/my\_broker\_estimates\_that\_there\_will\_be\_a\_surge\_in/?utm\_source=reddt-android](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/comments/5wogl5/my_broker_estimates_that_there_will_be_a_surge_in/?utm_source=reddt-android) This doesn’t reflect my opinion, just the first one I found. ) I never really got a great look at it because I believe I quickly closed it out. But I’m worried that could have possibly been somebody underage. I never really thought about this until a few months ago. I feel mortified that I ever did this and I feel like a monster.

and another part of me just tells myself I really just need to go to college for a career that will be promising. 
I know there are degrees that are art related, and I was interested in the animation one but I’m not sure how well paying those jobs are and when I looked online it seems all those jobs are located only in the big city near me (Toronto) which I would hate to travel to every day and would also HATE to live there / raise my kid there lol. Just not a fan of the big cities as a parent. 
And I know there are other degrees that are art related but I’m not sure what is really all out there. I just want to give my son a good life and have to really think of some sort of career to go for.

633,"I have an ex friendship that's clouding my mind up a bit and I can't honestly tell if I'm being manipulative and truly abusive or if things are fine and I'm just assuming blame.

Back in August I spent a lot of time, energy and money to throw myself a birthday party and it was honestly quite stressful, as I'd been working full time and I am not the most social person on earth under most circumstances. I invited several friends and one friend in particular gave me their gift and I reacted to it thankfully but quietly as I had with everyone else's. The party was very discordant and messy so it was hard for me to be hyperbolic about anything.

The friend then admitted to me that they felt like I wasn't prioritizing them or giving them enough attention, and that I under-reacted to their gift that they spent a lot of time and energy on. I was very tired and fed up, and the friendship was honestly very draining so as honestly and directly as I could, I explained that I work very often and that I don't always have time or energy to make plans or time with certain friends, and that I may hang out with other people but it is simply because I know them differently or we interact differently, and it is more convenient/time efficient/generally easier.

The friend then stopped talking to me and apparently made a lot of vague posts on social media about me, claiming that 'people that don't prioritize you aren't worth knowing' and all sorts of other privileged nonsense and vitriolic messages.

I keep a blog where I'll process my thoughts and post about my coping process so I can have it to look back on, and to use as reference when I'm discussing how to cope with my psychiatrist or when I want to communicate. This friend kept taking these posts VERY personally, even ones that aren't and ones that weren't about them, and would constantly use it as fuel to create vitriol against me in their social circles.

I haven't posted or spoken about anything relating to them in months. They've still sent me anonymous hateful messages and they've recently asked me for advice again about a personal issue non-anonymously, so I gave them my take and, to be clear and transparent with them, I sent the posts that were about them and what I meant and how it wasn't so much about them as it was for me to look back on so I could reflect better, and that I wish them no ill will, but think our paths should still remain separate. They haven't responded yet but they still appear to be taking shit I post anywhere out of context and making it a personal attack on them; an attempt to 'hurt them', to quote them directly. They also claim that I'm pretending to be wise and soft and kind but I'm really a bag of dicks. Outside of this friend, I have apologized and made up for literally every instance of bad blood I've ever had and hold a healthy diverse social circle outside of them.

Am I a bad person for putting my coping babble on a semi-public blog? Is their reaction justified? Am I a bad person for being blunt with them and saying yeah, I can't prioritize you but that doesn't mean I don't like you? I honestly just don't know anymore and I want some insight.

I've tried to be unbiased in my tellings here. I know I have some faults and I see how the friend escalated to the level they did, but I really don't know anymore if I deserve this or not.",15Jan2019,1

638,"Hey everyone, I just need some good advice right now because I’m a little weirded out. The title is a bit complicated, so I apologize for that.

Edit: I didn’t realize how long this was until now. Scroll to the bottom for details, sorry. 

My ex-boyfriend and I broke up earlier this school year. He said that I needed more experience and wanted me to date other guys first, and then said he wanted to date me in the future after that period of time. He regretted what he said and pleaded for my forgiveness the next morning, stating that everyone in a relationship fights but always make up and to give him a second chance. 

We broke up nearly four months ago. I blocked him on every social media platform right afterwards. My account has been private up until last summer which was when we were still dating.  About a month and a half ago or so, this random guy started following me on one of the apps. He only has four followers, so I assume that it’s someone I know’s spam account since they have the same exact name. But he is following one or two people that I know personally. I don’t follow him back. 

Every single story that I post, he sees it. Today, he messaged me something random out of the blue and calls me by the nickname that only my ex used to call me. I’m a little surprised and confused but go along with it. We text for a bit, but he takes a long time to reply. 

His responses are really vague and he doesn’t touch on specific details, such as what grade he’s in, etc. I do the same just to be safe. From the texts, he mentions my ex, one of his friends, as well as mentioning a few friends from other schools, but does not bring up any names. It’s all really vague and seems a bit sketchy because he’s not following anyone besides from a few select people and mostly famous pages. There are no photos of himself either or of his friends. 

Am I wrong to believe that it’s him? I feel kind of dumb posting this but I also know that he’s done a lot of weird things in the past when we were together. Was it a way for him to see how I was doing after he broke up with me, as he knows I blocked him from everything? But I also feel like he used this account in order to apologize to me ‘formally’ without revealing himself to me, as the breakup was really bad. 

He’s done a lot of questionable stuff after the breakup too, such as dropping by my house (which is over thirty minutes away from his) while I was away to leave a box with a photo of us when we were together, and the day after our fight (as well in the text messages) he mentioned that he will always be there for me and will come support me at my sports events, services, and even to my high school graduation. 

At this point, I feel like this was an attempt for him to make amends with me and to potentially be together again, which I am 100% not planning on doing. I got creeped out and removed my profile picture, photos, highlights, people that I followed, and tags. I made a new account in which I only allowed for family and very close friends to follow, but I don’t know if it’s the right move. His friends (who are really good people) still follow me on the old account, which is why I’m worried he might see my stuff. 

TDLR; I think my ex boyfriend made a fake account in order to get in touch with me but I don’t know if I’m just being paranoid. the entire account is super sketchy and vague. I made a new account but am unsure if I should just stick up for myself instead of hiding?

640,"I have been friends with her since we were 15 (we're in our 30s now). When we were younger, she confided in me that she cuts herself and that she was trying to stop (also while seeing a therapist). She would call me when she had the urge to do it and I would talk with her on the phone or come over if I could. She hasn't been cutting at all for the last 15+ years. 

She recently went through a very traumatic year and she is in a terrible place mentally. She's refusing to go to therapy; she thinks she deserves to suffer. This weekend, I found out she has been cutting again. This time even worse than ever before. She has been carving words into her skin. 

Top priority, of course, is to get her to go to therapy. She needs professional help. Help that I cannot give her. But should I even approach the subject of her cutting? I know she knows that I saw the words and I don't want her to feel self conscious or feel like she needs to hide. But I want to let her know that she can call me whenever she has the urge. I want her to know that she has a support system. I have already told her that in the context of general mental health but is that enough?

Or should I just keep trying to encourage therapy and not mention the cutting at all? Or is even that too much? I don't want to make things worse for her either.",15Jan2019,1

Last one being we can head back to my place. She was driving and was without hesitation down to come back to mine. We hooked up and it was great as well. After about an hour she mentioned she had to head home when I came back from the washroom. Mentioned it was late and could stay if she liked but it's cool if she felt like leaving. Showed her out and said see you soon? Which she replied definitely. I made a little joke and she giggled.  she messages me when she got home saying goodnight and such blah blah.

Hi. Im a 22 yo male university student. Im studying outside my country. Or at least im trying to be. Ive wasted 4 years of university already, in which ive only taken 3 exams. Im only still in university because I lie constantly and thats bought me more and more chances that I keep on wasting. My fathers finally tired of my bullshit and has told me that I have 3 more semesters to graduate before he cuts off all his spending on me. Then I would go back home since my student visa will be revoked from me (and I have no money anyways), and I would lose my chance to start another career in university again; but I would be living with my parents. So I would have an easy, parasitic, meaningless life. Which Id like to avoid.

It is theoretically possible to graduate on that time . Long story short, I would have to take 5 exams per semester to be able to graduate on time. 

Some info on me - I have no friends I can call in for help because I have crippling social anxiety (self-diagnosed admittedly). I never put in enough effort in my life to correct that. I only brokenly speak the local language because I studied it from books and tv but never practiced it with anyone because I have no one (same with English).  My hobbies are watching series, gaming (fortnite mainly), reading manga and reddit. Im slightly overweight. Im otherwise healthy and I have alright levels of energy. I have no outstanding ability or disability to speak of, other than I have no social skills. I cant be trusted with freedom, but I have lots of it. Im good at following specific commands other than ones given by myself. The more specific the command the better I can follow it. I was top of my class in high school since I had other people tell me what to do.

To clarify my immediate goal is to graduate. That’s what I need advice on. If I need to change myself to do it ( he says for the 100th time), I will. This time I mean it ( he says again). I just need to know how, from someone elses perspective. Ill work on atoning for abusing my parents generosity like the bastard that I am after I can achieve that.  Any advice other than save up and get a therapist? Please help me fix my bed a little before I lay on it.

643,"Hello all, 

Over the years I have had a general disinterest in my academics. In ES I took some advanced classes because I placed well on some standardized tests, anyways I was a straight A student all of ES(not really special but still) then when I hit MS I started to decline a bit, my grades were mostly A’s with about 1-2 B’s, then when I started HS my motivation seemed to disappear. I started getting C’s (in a county where  if you get less than an A you’re scrutinized)and I lost all motivation to do my homework and I’d always find myself playing catch-up at the end of the quarters/semesters. I’ve developed a bad work ethic and I need help to try to turn this around so I can salvage my senior year grades and hopefully attend a university I like in the near future. I have worked a job since my sophomore year and I’ve always put forth my best work leading to promotions and raises but I’m not too sure why I can’t use that work ethic in school. I always find myself giving up early and just not caring about the repercussions of my actions. I’ve always been a good student, never argued w/ teachers, never skipped, never late, etc. my only issue being my general lack of motivation. 

If anyone has any advice for me that’d be much appreciated as I hope to try to turn my year around and attend a school of my liking(hopefully not too late). Thank you

645,"This is gonna be long as hell, but I need to get this out of my system

I’m a 20 year old guy, I study mechanical engineering and I can’t find a steady long term relationship.

I’ll start with some background; I’ve been with a lot of girls, and when I say a lot, I mean around 70 or 80 in the last 4 years, most of them short term or just hook ups, nothing longer than 3 months, so confidence isn’t an issue.
Now I know I sounded like a manwhore there but please hear me out.

The important bit is that I’ve only ever fallen for one, 3 years ago. That’s a whole different story that’d take me about 3 hours to type, so another time, but fun fact: she was my 8th girl and the reason why I went on a rampage, chasing the same feeling I had with her. There’s a lot more to it than that, but moving on:

I’m posting this because I’ve noticed a pattern in certain scenarios with girls, and actually my last 4-5 last relationships ended the same, one after another.

You need to know the following:

After being with so many and not giving a damn about most of them (there were a few times that, now that I think about it, ended in pretty much the same manner as the previously mentioned), I’ve decided to slow down. A lot. I want a real connection. Not just a few matching opinions.

By this, I mean the first two of those girls, one in march and the other in april, then the next one in october, and the last one (which is ending pretty much right now as I type this), each in between a week and two weeks long, simply *cease*.

I started them off in different ways, that’s the worst bit. I’m not your typical hows-the-weather talker. Pretty much all of my conversations are deep, non-meaningless, and happen only when I think talking isn’t a waste of time (firmly believe in not wasting energy, and in “when you speak, you only say what you know, but when you’re silent, you learn something new). Conversations deep enough that most people react like “hurr dur u a philosopher or somethin bra”. 
Sidenote: I write my own quotes and have about 450 of them, so if you’re interested in reading, and of Yugoslavian descent, hit me up so I can link you lol

I understand people so much, I predict a lot of events in my friends relationships simply based on info about them and the conversations they told me about.

I’m emotional as heeeeell. Namely, when I’m with a girl, she receives 600% of my attention, and definitely never feels neglected even while not sitting next to me. And, given my experience, I know all the little spots to kiss around the ears and neck.
I’m very passionate in everything I do with girls. Eye contact, body language, holding hands, kissing her hand while it’s in mine, just to name a few. 
I’m the funny guy in my friend group, always love a good laugh, because I find a laughing environment of people I love therapeutic. Also, I’ve been told I’m attractive. My shortcoming is that I’m not at all tall (172 or 5’7) just so you don’t think im some narcissistic prick here pushing a craigslist like dating application lol

On top of that, and I was having this conversation with someone today: ”Usually it takes 30 minutes for me to explain one of my opinions completely. Explaining how I feel is like adding another dimension to that. I wish someone could just look me in the eyes and give me a knowing look, but that never happened”
So just imagine a tsunami of emotion in an ocean of thoughts. 

Back on topic: those relationships started *as relationships*, and promising ones at that. But after 10 days or so of bonding and getting along perfectly, I either get literally ghosted with no warning, or a sudden breakup message. I’ve tried everything in between going out of my way to contact them when they’re ignoring me and going straight to them so they can see I actually care, but none have done any good.

Multiple things have been occurring to me as possible reasons for this: 

-karma for mistreating some of the girls that I know deserved better years ago?

-im too deep of a person and that dejects people from me: imagine swimming off shore in GTA. At one point, you simply can’t go any further, and you turn back alone or the game does it for you lol


Thank you if you’ve stuck to the end, I’m very interested in what you have to say, and am happy to answer any questions.",15Jan2019,1
646,"So I’m currently applying for my dream college. I have a very good chance of getting a really good scholarship because of my high school grades. I’m not from the US, but this college is my country’s equivalent to an Ivy League. It has several campuses all over my country and there’s one in the city I live in, but it’s a small campus and that’s where the problem is.
Since the campus is small most of the majors are incomplete and I can only do a year here and then I have to move to another campus to continue studying. 

The career I want to major in is not complete so I would have to move to another state.
The thing is my mom doesn’t want me to move because she doesn’t want to be alone. Her mom recently passed away and now it’s just the two of us. She is divorced and she hasn’t dated again ever since I was born. 

I completely understand the fact that she doesn’t want to be alone, but going to this college is a great opportunity for me and it has always been my dream to go there, that’s why I’ve worked so hard to get good grades through high school.

Something else that bothers me is that she wants me to stay with her forever. She expects that I go to a local college, I get a job somewhere in the city I still live in and I continue to live with her forever, I mean even if I get married she expects me to continue living with her. (That’s kind of normal in the city I live in). But I don’t want that. I want to be independent and move out. Not just out of her house but out of state and maybe even country, because I know there are so much more opportunities out there. 
My city is really small and there are not a lot of opportunities in here, so that’s why I want to go somewhere else.

I have tried explaining this to my mom but she doesn’t agree with me. She says there are opportunities here, and well yes there are but is it bad wanting something better? She says family comes first before anything else, and me moving out of state means that “we’re breaking out bond and you’re cutting me out of your life”. Of course I do not want that. I explained to her that I would be studying out of state for three years because I can still do one here where I live, but still disagrees.

She wants me to go to my country’s equivalent to a community college here in my city. But this one has a very bad reputation, I’m talking about teachers not showing up to classes, failing students if they don’t like them, threatening to fail you if you don’t pay them.

There are some other colleges here and they’re not bad, but I really want to go to the one I’m applying to, because there’s a really good chance I get a scholarship.

Some people have told me I should just move out, but it’s not easy for me because I’m still underage (I will be 18 months after college begins), so I guess I would need my mom’s permission for moving out and there’s no way she’s going to agree. 

Another option would be switching majors. There are only four complete majors in my city’s campus and I guess switching to one of them would  be the best option but still not what I would want to do because I really want to major in computer science. But this would allow me to go to this college.

What do you think I should do?

Thank you for reading!
