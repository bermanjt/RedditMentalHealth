0,"25 year old male. 6‚Äô2‚Äù 210 lbs Caucasian 

Was prescribed 30-0.5mg alprazolam (Xanax) 3 weeks ago. Went through those in a week. Went back to doctor and got 60 more 0.5mg pills. I went through those in 10 days taking around 6 pills a day. 

I ran out on Thursday midday and was cut cold turkey. That night I was having weird experiences. That Thursday  night was having visual disturbances and had crazy vivid dreams. Friday woke up dizzy, shaky, anxiety high coming in waves and feeling out of it. Symptoms continued through the day. Last night my sleep was better and less vivid dreams but woke up this morning still out of it. Anxiety is higher than before and I‚Äôm still having vision disturbance and agitated.

Is this withdrawals. I know I abused the Xanax and took too much for never have taken a single benzo my entire life till I got prescribed. How long will this last? When will I feel normal again? Am I just gunna have to ride this out till my brain balances itself out again?",06Oct2019,1

4,"So I get extremely anxious around people I dont know but if it's a 1 on 1 I'm perfectly capable of social interactions and having a good time.

However when it comes to messaging someone (singulary) I feel like I just cant. 

I fear that if i were to get in a relationship, this is what would make it sour and i dont really know how to overcome it and pop up and make conversation in text. I want to just talk and type for hours but its just the initial point.

I'm not referring to friends I've known for years, I'm on about getting to know someone who is new to you.

Any advice?",06Oct2019,1

7,"Hi everyone! 
 
So basically I'm 23 with only 1 ""friend"".  We were only friends for a few years in middle school and we weren't even that close before I moved 1,000 miles away and didn't talk until I started college. I have always found him a bit strange to be honest but it was nice to have someone to talk that I always overlooked it. Years have by since we started again and honestly he's still my only ""friend"" no matter how hard I try to put myself out there to make friends. I constantly question our friendship due to me being more like a therapist for him Every. Single. Day. and then when I have a problem he either doesn't say anything, only says a few short words, or changes the subject back to himself. I suffer from bad depression because of a bad childhood but I try to not let that stop me from doing things I love it's hard truly but it's been going on for years. But someone can tease him for not having a GF and he's ready to jump off a bridge. The guy is never happy in life, no matter what. It's honestly gotten so hard for me to be around that kind of attitude. I'm tired of feeling like I'm the only trying in this friendship. He already showed me once that he's more than willing to leave me if he has too, he once had a gf who was uncomfortable with me and he stopped being friends even though we are so far away from each other. Even if I am having a decent day he somehow knows just the words to say to bring me down. With all that being said, he's still the only person even if he doesn't care I can vent to. I just don't know if I should end this relationship at this point or not. What do you think? 

Sorry for this being so long",06Oct2019,5
9,"It takes me an absurdly long time to learn even the basics of something, with me even spending around three thousand hours (tracked on Steam) trying to learn how to build levels in a game.  
I assume a similar amount of time has been spent trying to figure out color theory, and I still don't know that much.  
I also really suck more than others at the start of learning something, behaving like an idiot.  
I always need to ask questions to understand, but I ask way too many, so much to the point that I annoy the community of the thing I'm trying to learn, and I'm either ignored or banned.  
Despite the hundreds (or even thousands) of hours spent into trying to learn things, I typically don't learn anything.  
Is there a way to learn more efficiently? And yes, I have tried looking up a plethora of YouTube videos and books surrounding some of my hobbies I'm trying to learn, including programming, and art.",06Oct2019,0

And she also asked me to help her babysit some kids while their parents were at service.

I wanted to get out of there but didn‚Äôt want to let her down because she really nice to everyone and everyone likes her,so I made some lame excuse like I had to leave, got my hoodie, and booked it

11,"Alright, just to give some information about myself, I'm 18 and female. I live at home with my parents who are divorced and I still switch between houses during the week and weekends. I attend community college and I work at a grocery store as a cashier. 

In the past couple of months I have had a lot happen and it's all been extremely, extremely overwhelming. Everyone has sort of been all over me and on my back about things and I need to be alone. I just need to be away from people and parents and work and school. I'm planning on just going somewhere, I don't know where, for a day or two. 

I have my own car, so wherever I go, I can get there on my own. I live on the line between two states, so I can get a little further in a different place if I wanted to, instead of staying in the state that I'm in. Hopefully that makes sense. 

I plan on sleeping in my car for the night or two, I don't plan on staying in a motel or anything like that. I just need to be alone. Are there any things that can be done about this (like with police or anything) or things I should be aware of before doing this? It might sound stupid to do this, but God I just need to get away and I don't know how else to do that.",06Oct2019,3

14,"So, there's this person I know. We're friends. Have been for several years. Were slightly better friends in the past but, you know. We get on. But I'm always left confused by one thing about them. They hug me, all the time. Now, I don't mind. It's kinda cute really. I let them do it, it's cool. But is it normal for someone to hug you basically every time you meet? I'm pretty sure they can be a little like this with other people, but not to quite the same extent and I must admit, this behavior sort of baffles me...

16,"So I am in high school, and I was walking out the door to go home for the day, and one of the stupid baseball boys (you know the type) were sitting at a bench by the door. I am about to reach for the door handle, when the leader of that group goes, ""Hey!"". I kind of disregard it, because maybe he is shouting in a jokey way to one of his friends.

I keep walking away, and he shouts, ""hey!"" again. At this point, I turn around because there is no way he isn't calling out to me.  I ask him what he's yelling about, and he says, ""my friend wants your turn-up"" or something like that. I ask him ""what?"" and he repeats it. 

I'm not sure whether he was joking or not, but none of his friends laughed. They just stared at me. Usually if they're joking, they all laugh and make  fun of the kid. They didn't do that. it's around homecoming time, but they didn't ask me to homecoming.

I hate the kid who is apparently asking for my number, so I just spun on my heel and left. They are the kind who if you tell him no, he lies to the whole school and calls you a lesbian. So I just left with no comment.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is first, was I too rude in rejecting him without really rejecting him? Second, was he joking?  Third, what should I do if he tries to ask again? Fourth, does asking for my turn-up mean my number or something sexual? I know it also means getting frisky on the dance floor but that doesn't apply to this situation. Should I apologize? I'm usually good at reading people, but this was plain confusing.

I thought being that it was my daddy her spouse that passed away that she would be there for support but boy did I ever guess wrong. I have 2 siblings one half and one blood sibling and she has even turned them away from me. I never got along with my half sister but I did my blood brother until all of this. I'm just wondering did I mess up somewhere down the line. Sometimes she makes me feel like I was a failure. Sorry for venting just need advice. If you reply back thank you so much. If not that's okay to. Not looking for sympathy. Just wondering what everyone's thoughts on this is. And if it has happened to anyone of you.

22,"First of all: I'm not very confident about my body. I'm 6'3 tall and I only weigh 160 pounds. I try to work out and I have gained a little muscle mass but I'm still thin.  About my face ... I don't think I'm ugly but I'm not a sight for sore eyes either.

My Problem is, that I never had a real relationship or at least a women flirting with me and at this point in my life it is incomprehensible for me how to achieve such a thing at all.

I had a girlfriend when I was 17, she was my first big love but I was just some pastime for her. We kissed twice and that's all the physical interpersonal interaction I have ever had with her or any other girl. And now it lies so far back in the past, that I don't even know how it happend anymore. All I still know is that I was devastated, when she broke up with me. 

After that I was friends with a girl at my school. We hung out a lot together but when I asked her if we could be more than just friends, she stopped hanging out with me. 

I also tried online dating but after 2 extreme embarrassing dates I stopped doing that for good. 

I also went on a lot of parties and talked to a some girls but they always kinda seem to lose interested after a few minutes talking to me (or they get distracted by someone else that's more entertaining than me). Which means I never had more than small talk with a women.

I've also asked the girlfriends of my friends to give me any tips but all they say it that it will happen eventually, but that doesn't help. 

I think 2 years ago I've started to become depressed and anxious and now I get nervous around women. I think it's due the fact that I lived with my parents all these years and isolated myself from other people especially women (except my friends). But don't get me wrong I'm capable of talking to women but I don't know what to say, that keeps them entertained. 

2 months ago I tried tinder. After around 500 swipes , if finally got one match and she even answered when I wrote her. I chatted with her on tinder for some time but after all these years I didn't expect much from it. 

But after a month or so, she asked for my number and we started writing more intensive. She even sent me some picks and voice mails of her to let me know she was a real person. For one tiny moment I thought that's it. Finally a girl where I might have a chance. 

But when I asked her if she wanted to meet me in real life everything went south and she stopped answering. This was my first contact with a women in years but it hurt so much but at least this made me move out of my parents house...into a shared flat  with 3  girls and 1 guy. They are 7 years younger than me and studying but I'm kind of a late bloomer anyways. 

I honestly don't know what to do anymore because I really don't know why I should go to work. I have a well payed job in IT but I don't know what to do with the money.
This whole thing is starting to affect my life in a very negative way. I don't care for my job my family and friend or myself anymore. 

I honestly don't know what to do. Despite my fear of women, I don't have a problem talking to them on a platonic level or if there is a good reason. As I mentioned above women los interest in me after a few minutes of talking which means I won't be able to find one at a party. 

Can someone help me please? I have literally now idea, how to get a women interested in me and this fact is driving me insane. So far I have wasted 10 years of my life and I can't do this anymore. I just want to know what is wrong with me?",06Oct2019,2

35,"My friend recently got a new boyfriend in March. It‚Äôs the first relationship for both of them and they‚Äôve gone really slow; by slow, I mean they‚Äôve only kissed 4 times and had 1 make out session since March. It was only last week that things heated up. Since they got together, my bestie has started changing and tho she denies it, it‚Äôs evident that he‚Äôs on this pedestal and she prioritizes him over her friends and sometimes family. I understand that it‚Äôs normal when it‚Äôs the first love and all, and I‚Äôm trying to be patient and supportive. But I can‚Äôt help shake the feeling that something is odd with this dude, maybe he‚Äôs just odd and harmless, but maybe he isn‚Äôt. 
For one, he absolutely refused to let anyone know where he lives. Like DEADSET. My friend knows and she‚Äôs been there tons, but he‚Äôs always straight forward and rude about it. I accidentally learned of where he lives when I was browsing Snapchat‚Äôs map feature and saw her in a place I didn‚Äôt recognize; she got mad at me and I‚Äôm sure he was too, and even though it was an accident and I didn‚Äôt intentionally snoop, it caused a major deal. Tomorrow we are meeting at a cafe for our friend‚Äôs birthday and my friend has to meet us there because she‚Äôs spending the night at her bf‚Äôs place, and we can‚Äôt pick her up like usual because he doesn‚Äôt want us to know his address. As if we are the type to stalk üòí. 
Secondly, he refuses to let his meet his friends. I‚Äôve never asked or pressured, nor am I particularly interested since he‚Äôs awkward and quiet with me, but when my friend jokingly brought it up, he refused and said his friends weren‚Äôt interested. I‚Äôm pretty sure he thinks we are odd balls. 
Thirdly, he doesn‚Äôt try to get to know us. The last time I met up with my friend (and she was with him, as usual for I am sure they‚Äôre never apart) he looked at me and jumped from his and left. Didn‚Äôt say hi or anything and I swear it took 4 seconds for him to leave. Whenever he‚Äôs around, he stands awkwardly next to her and looks like he would rather be anywhere else. Doesn‚Äôt really interact or show emotions and I‚Äôve joked that he‚Äôs like a robot sometimes. I‚Äôm always left feeling unsure of what to do, and while I think he shows emotions to her, for us, it‚Äôs clear that he doesn‚Äôt try. 

Am I unfounded in this? I know I can‚Äôt say anything to my friend, and I know my place is to support and stand by, but I can‚Äôt help but be plagued with worry. I don‚Äôt know if this are red flags or not, but I have experiences with bad boyfriends and I don‚Äôt want to the same for her.

Her place was fairly clean and she seemed organized. We used a condom and that condom did not tear. Before the sex I had a very quick look at the upper side of her genital before turning off the light and having sex afterwards. She didn‚Äòt have anything there, visually at least. But maybe I missed it. Afterwards it was too dark to see anything.

Now it‚Äòs ~7-8 hours later and I am starting to think about it. I asked her and she said that she was clean.

**Warning: This post talks about the sex life and the sexual thoughts of a underage teenager. If you are uncomfortable by this, you have been warned**

I'm reluctant to share my age but I guess it would help. I'm 16, turn 17 in less than a month. I'm in my senior year of high school and I'm from the US.

Ok so. I don't really know how to talk about this. I feel like my thoughts surround sex. I feel like if I don't have a task at hand and my mind can wander, it always wanders to sex. I feel incredibly sexually frustrated. But I'm so young that I don't see my sex life as a priority so I try to suppress it but it's just controlling my life.

I used to date a lot in middle school and early high school. Until I dated a guy who ghosted me and filed a false harassment report instead of being a normal human and just telling me they wanted out. He was my first real sexual relationship, however, it was incredibly....conditioning? I don't know how to explain it. Even from when I hit puberty and started having those feelings, I had a high sex drive (still do obviously). So when me and him started to have a sexual relationship, I was very eager and willing and excited. I had a high drive and I would try to hook up nearly everyday and every chance. Except, that slowly died. The thing is, he hated doing anything that wasn't pleasurable for him. We never fully had sex as he did not want that but he was fine with everything else. Okay, I respected that. Except, he never wanted to reciprocate. Our sex life was entirely me giving him oral. Any ""mutual"" pleasure was just kissing. I tried to get him to do more. Like, I tried to get him to kiss my neck or my breasts and he would complain the entire time, reluctantly give in and make a big deal about it, and make fun of me if I enjoyed it. So those never lasted longer than 30 seconds (I wish I was kidding). He refused to touch me below the belt and laughed or visibly cringed at the idea of returning oral. After a few months, my drive just sizzled out. He had a matching drive and would push me to do so but I mostly tried to get out of it as I no longer found pleasure. Towards the end, it felt more like a favor as he would beg and make me feel bad for not being in the mood. Since then, I've had major trust issues and chose not to date again in high school. I also have horrible insecurities surrounding my body and have a distorted view that sex is only about his pleasure and my pleasure will only come in the form of penetration. 

Since I choose not to date, I only have crushes. However, when I would develop crushes where I wanted a relationship or it stemmed from emotional, I'd run for the hills. So now I only have sexual crushes. I currently have four guys that I semi know (intentional as it limits contact allowing me to not let the crush grow) that I have crushes on.

Here's why I'm here. Over the past two years maybe, I feel like these crushes consume more and more of my life. I have fantasies and I'll switch the fantasies between the guys once I get bored. It's literally all I think about.

I like to drift off and daydream. I used to about lots of things. Now I can't actively daydream unless its a sexual one. And I daydream whenever there isn't anything at hand irl. 

I can't meet a guy without immediately considering whether or not I'd sleep with them. I've considered trying girls just to have a release but I ultimately go against that since I'm pretty straight and I just can't be aroused by a female. I can't even leave the house without making sure I am, ahem, presentable because I have this irrational thought that a one night stand opportunity may arise. 

I don't see a single emotional aspect to sex. I think about it all the time and I'm to the point where nearly any guy could proposition me and I'd probably say yes. 

I used to watch porn but I never do anymore. It does nothing. I tried erotica, nothing much. I prefer to fantasize. I don't do it for masturbation either. I just like to think about it. I get aroused by the thought of it but nothing more. 

Sometimes I think its just sexual frustration and if I got it out of my system then I would be better. But I'm pretty certain that's not true and if anything it may make the obsession worse.

Is this hormonal and normal? Will this pass? Please, I really want advice. I feel like it's becoming a real problem but I don't know if its just hormones or something.",06Oct2019,1

46,"Freshman year of high school, after being told by my former best friend to kill myself, I was ready to become reclusive. I didn't want to be hurt again. Then after freshman first day, I got on the bus and put myself out there with someone. I introduced myself and shook his hand and from behind him this girl peeks up and shouts ""you look just like my friend in band!"" This wild, beautiful curly haired girl. I felt my heart skip a beat. I fell in love. 

She and I started talking at school and we were becoming friends. But it didn't last. I couldn't for the life of me act normal, I was sporadic and crazy and no one really liked me. At some point I tried to flirt with this girl. After about 3 months of this she and I did something extremely stupid. We started sending nude photos. Illegal, gross and wrong. I still had trouble being a good person at the time and I pushed it. I pushed her... I regret this time we shared everyday of my life.

At some point in the school year I moved and she blocked me from talking to her. But I kept pushing. I wanted to be better to her. It wasn't good. 

I spent maybe a year not talking to her until I was assaulted. I thought ""she went through the same thing. She's the only one who understands."" But I met someone else. A guy who I was friends with. This person had been through assault and did their best to not only see me through that pain but also help me be more womanly as I'm transgender and had no outlet. 

I once again lost control of my emotions and started trying to be with this new person in my life but they had a boyfriend and I was pushing it. They told me they didn't want me in their life anymore and I crumbled. In desperation for my happiness I got back in contact with that girl... the girl from freshman year...

She and I started to reconnect a little but it was terrible for both of us. She still hated me. 

Recently as a year ago I text her again... and she forgave me... I felt no relief though, I can't forgive how disgusting I was to her but she wanted to be friends so I just let it happen. 

Cut to now, I recently spent the night at the home of her and her boyfriend. I saw how happy they were and I was happy for them! I thought I was letting go but she told me that I was her best friend... I told her I loved her and she said it back, of course in a very different way. Now I'm dealing with this pull towards her, towards this incredible, kind, forgiving and loving person. I don't want to hurt her again by pushing my feelings. I want her to be happy and I want the same for myself. 

I asked her if she wanted to stop talking to me or if it'd be best if she did. She said she'd take a few days to think about it but... I think I need to let her go. I know that doing so will hurt, myself and I think her as well, but it might be best so that I can protect her and myself. 

I'm confused and scared. What should I do?",06Oct2019,1
47,"Hi. First year university student in a very competitive pre-medicine selection course (around a thousand enter, less than 100 leave and go into med school). I currently only have one more paper I need to do well in to have a solid chance, but I'm currently extremely burnt out. I no longer feel extremely motivated despite really wanting to get into medicine,  and get very distracted when I try to study. Ok, I might be tired, but when I try to head out for a coffee or something, I would feel very guilty about all the work I'm missing out on, or I would be discussing answers with my friends on fb the whole time (and essentially never get a rest).   
I would really appreciate advice from someone who has been in this kind of dilemma before. Thanks!",06Oct2019,1
48,"Bit of background. I went back to my hometown for the uni break, and had plans that night to go out with an group of friends from high school and uni.
I wanted to go out and meet these guys earlier but my parents wanted me to come to a family friend‚Äôs 21st birthday dinner. We‚Äôll call this friend J. For reference, I‚Äôm 19, and the only other people there closest to my age were 20/21.

Anyway, I ended up having a good talk with a couple girls, who were pretty attractive, sitting opposite me who had also been longtime friends of J‚Äôs, but this was my first time meeting them. They‚Äôre a year ahead of me studying the same course and from a city further south. I wasn‚Äôt interested in either of these girls, I was just making polite conversation, and seeing how different/similar their courses were compared to mine. They both seemed pretty friendly, and I was sitting right in between my parents so flirting with either of these chicks was the last thing on my mind. We talked for about half an hour and immediately after I got a call from a friend who‚Äôd gone too hard at a party too early. Had to leave the dinner before the dessert came out and went round saying goodbye to everyone so it didn‚Äôt look like I was just wanting to get out of there. Told J and his group that if I wasn‚Äôt back soon I‚Äôd likely see them that night in town if they were going, and that I was sober driving so they could just give me a call if they needed a lift at some point. J told me they‚Äôd already ordered a taxi van in advance since there were about 6 or 7 in this group all up, and there was another seat in case I wanted to drink and join them. I thanked him but was still pretty set on just sober driving and having a good time with my crew but appreciated the offer nonetheless.

Anyway, fast forward to a few hours later when I‚Äôd dropped off my messy friend and had met up with the rest of the boys. We finally went into the club around 12:30 after debating if we even wanted to go or just go back to one of their houses and smoke bud. We‚Äôd probably been in town about half an hour and had completely forgot about the people I was having dinner with earlier, until I saw one of the girls a few metres away as we were heading onto the floor. We made eye contact so I smiled and said hi, and offered again that I was sober driving so if she or her friends needed a ride just to let me know. She grabbed my hand and said something like, ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs all good we‚Äôve got a spare seat in our taxi, grab a drink and come home with us, and dragged me over to the other girl and a couple guys I was having dinner with before. In hindsight I think she might have been flirting then, but I was pretty oblivious so I said again, ‚ÄúNah legit I‚Äôve got my car outside I don‚Äôt need a taxi haha,‚Äù or something to that extent. She insisted again that I grab a drink and come home with them, and when we got closer to her friend, she turned around and seemed shocked for a moment and gave the girl holding my hand a thumbs up and I started to realise what was going on but still wasn‚Äôt really sure if I was jumping to conclusions. Her friend told me the same thing, to start drinking and join them and as I was internalising all this the girl who‚Äôd dragged me over kissed me on the cheek. I think I must‚Äôve looked shocked for a second, and I was, because this chick was way out of my league and all I could really think was ‚ÄúNo, trust me, you don‚Äôt want me.‚Äù Didn‚Äôt know what to say so I awkwardly shrugged with a sad smile as she smiled at me waiting for my reaction and turned around back to my group.

Ended up having a pretty good rest of the night after that, in all honesty, got shouted some coke and had a big sesh back at our mates place afterwards. All I could think of this morning though was what a dick I must‚Äôve looked like to her. Awkwardly shrugging and not really knowing what to do in a situation like that (I‚Äôm a virgin, never had a first kiss, never really been interested in pursuing anything remotely sexual) just made me look like terrible and I feel bad that I might‚Äôve hurt her feelings since I didn‚Äôt even have the good sense to come up with something like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I have a girlfriend‚Äù or any excuse to that effect. I‚Äôm not normally an awkward person, but the situation threw me off guard.

To girls on reddit, I ask, would I have looked like an asshole to you if it had been you? And to guys I ask what would you have done in this situation? Btw, not interested in getting back into contact with this girl, just wanted to understand her perspective a bit better.",06Oct2019,1
49,"Hi! So I did an internship last year for two months in the summer. While I was there, one of the employees became an unofficial mentor figure to me, and even though she wasn't my actual supervisor I worked with her a lot. When I left, I got the email addresses from a lot of the employees, including her, but I only ever contacted her (I just wasn't sure what to say to everybody else/didn't actually have anything to say). A couple months after I left the internship, I contacted my mentor asking for recommendations for graduate school, which she provided (she sent me the letter too--she said wonderful things and was super nice). We emailed back and forth for several months mostly about recommendations and me asking how things were going at work (they were going through a big transition while I was there).

In April, she sent me a link to an article related to the kind of work she does/the work I want to do, and I responded with something like thanks for the article and also told her that I had decided on my grad school and thanked her again for her support. She never responded, and now I don't know if I should email her again to keep contact or not. It's been so long now, and I have no idea what I would say if I did email her. But I don't want to lose her as a contact because she's an awesome person and has worked in the industry for decades and knows a lot. 

So should I email her again or just let it fall away naturally? If I do email her, what in the world do I say? In general, how often should you email professional contacts to keep the relationship going? 

Thanks!!",06Oct2019,1

51,"I couldn't post it on r/amitheasshole since it got flagged for suicide, so I'm posting it here.

I'm in uni and I met my friend Adam in first year, I thought he was really attractive and decided to talk to him. The friendship was a slow development as he was a very shy and awkward person who never initiated any form of social interaction, I was always the one to sit next to him in lectures, or start the conversations.

One day I was talking to him on FB and he mentioned something which was a bit alarming, I somehow managed to ask him if he was suicidal to which he said yes, at this point my crush for him disappeared but I was still his friend cuz I genuinely wanted to help him out. I tried to convince him to go to therapy, but every time I did, he would always say no and get mad at me, but then the next day he would send me a long text msg to say how he was sorry for getting mad and that he won't be 'bothering' me anymore, saying how I've been the greatest friend and that he was sorry for being around me &amp; dealing with his 'bs"". Talked shit about himself and would always end it with ""goodbye *my name"". As a friend, I wasn't going to let this goodbye msg slide and I would try to convince him I was fine with being friends with him and how he wasn't bothersome. This happened a lot during first and second year of uni, but it got more and more tiresome to convince him he wasn't bothering me.

In second year, my mental health was at it's lowest. I rarely turned up to lectures, but the times that I did go, I only sat next to Adam, but then one day he stopped showing up, I texted him to see if he was ok, the reply I got really shocked me, it went something along the lines of ""wow, I didn't know someone actually worried about me, this was a test to see who actually cared about me, thank you"". I kept telling him how I actually did care for him and I tried convicing him to come back to uni but he never did the rest of the year, so I just left it at that. The next time he came back to uni was for exams, I always asked how he did straight after the exams and he sounded like he wanted to fail, one time, in one of the exams, he said he only answered one question and left the rest and that he was ready to redo second year again. 

During the summer, I was going through my FB messages and saw that I received a long ass msg from Adam a few days ago (for some reason FB never notifies me of Adam's msgs). This was essentially a goodbye msg before he was going to commit suicide. I texted him back asking what he meant by ""goodbye"", if he was going to quit uni (I didn't fully want to accept he might commit). A few days later he sends me a msg to say it was a potential suicide letter, I replied back with how much he scared me and I asked where he was. A few more days later he replied back yet again with ""you actually care about me?"" and how he's going through a lot of bad things but is learning to supress it. I really didn't know what to say since he's so far into his depression, there was no way for me to help him, and convincing him to go through therapy wasn't going to work since he would get mad, so I just left it at that, and also I got really tired of this back and forth friendship, I didn't want to deal with it.

Now I'm in my final year, on the first day of class, I walk in and the first person I saw was Adam, I really didn't want to interact with him so I went over to my friend instead who was a few feet in front of him, I deliberately put my back towards him so I wouldn't accidentally make eye contact with him. It's been a few days of lectures and I've really been trying my hardest to not talk to him, but the other day, as class ended, I went up to him to say hi, I wanted to see how he was doing but my other friend called me over for a discussion on our group presentation, I turn around and poof, he was gone (he never stayed around when I was around my friends). Now here I am, wondering if I should still be his friend, or not, so am I the asshole?",06Oct2019,2

56," I've been wondering this question for quite some time. I've always done well at the goals I've set in life but as soon as I accomplish them I lose the sense of satisfaction/contentment quite quickly.

For a background, I'm 31 and pretty much at the top of my available career path for my job/age, I have a lot of room for growth in my current job structure, and I live comfortably with regards to money. I don't have a wife, kids, or a pet (although I would like a dog but I travel a decent amount which would make things more difficult).

Background: For the past couple years I haven't been very excited about life like I used to be. I have always had short, medium, and long term goals which kept my motivated in both personal and professional life. I achieved my most recent major goals in 2017. Now I still have short, medium, and long term goals but they seem quite easy to achieve. I no longer enjoy waking up and going to work, even though I currently have a highly desirable, non-boring job (by others' standards).

I am fit/eat healthy/and I have a disposable income - something that should make life such an easy thing to enjoy. But I am constantly dissatisfied with my life and want to graduate to the next level. For example, I no longer just want a Rolex watch, I want a Richard Mille. I don't want just a normal sports car, I want a Ferrari. I do understand that I'm among the top % of people in the USA in terms of lifestyle, but I feel no contentment with my current state in life. I anticipate this continuing no matter what my lifestyle, but what I'd really like is some contentment.

Some of the ideas I've had and am working on so far are: 1. Focusing on personal relationships rather than money 2. Traveling more to get away from the thought of competing with others with more money and continue to open my appreciation for life and the world 3. Forcing myself to realize that life is OK with what I have by not buying things I might want in the moment 4. Focusing on volunteering and getting a sense of accomplishment by helping less fortunate individuals.

Looking for feedback on what has worked for others in a similar situation. I'm not really looking for ""get over it, you've got it good compared to everyone else"" because I do already realize that point.",06Oct2019,3

74,"I‚Äôm 16 and I‚Äôve had a dream of being a punter for awhile. I worked for the idea after I left football sophomore year because I was sick of being a wide receiver when I wanted to be a punter. Once I quit I just went for it, I practiced and practiced, but as winter came I kinda just quit on my dream. And I‚Äôm stuck, currently I‚Äôm a junior, 5‚Äô9‚Äù 155 lbs. But I feel like I‚Äôm too late, like my opportunity is over. I feel like I could never be better than any punter already on the team, and that even if I worked my ass off until this next summer, that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to make the team. Because how would I just walk up and say I want to be a punter on the team and only a punter? Maybe I‚Äôd be down of course to practicing kicking and such as punters can kick field goals. But I feel like the coaches wouldn‚Äôt care, and why should they? A punter of all things, why would I even matter to them? To even have a shoot, I would need to work my ass off until June. Eating extremely healthy, lifting and running with all the energy I have, going full out for it. I really want to try and work for it, but I don‚Äôt want it to be all for nothing. I‚Äôm not looking for a make a wish where I magically become the punter because I want it, I know I need to be good enough to be considered. I just really need some honest as hell advice on what to do. Because someday I don‚Äôt want to look back and say I regret what I did, I don‚Äôt want to look back and see a quitter, but instead someone who went for it.",06Oct2019,1

78,"This is long, but I‚Äôm genuinely needing some advice here.

For some backstory, I am in 8th grade and going to this school. There is this girl, we‚Äôll call her c, (No, this isn‚Äôt something to do with love), that has no special needs at all. She is a grade below me. I‚Äôll put some reference names in here.

D = Friend

P = Friend (C has obsession with)

C = Fucking cunt girl.

Okay, now that we‚Äôve got that done, I‚Äôll continue with my post.

So this all started in 5th grade (for me). My friend, P, just came back to my school. So this girl in 4th grade, C, again, develops an obsession with P. Nothing real bad happens, she just kinda stalks around him.

At this point, P has repeatedly told C that he doesn‚Äôt like her. C does not give any of the two shits she has. She continues to call him and hang up, stalk around him, and glare at him every 5 seconds on the bus.

In 6th grade, one of the girls in my class gives C my number, and says that ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a hot boy in my grade.‚Äù She was lying, does not like me, and I too disagree that I am hot at all. She calls me and I answer, not knowing it was C. Since they keep calling me and hanging up without talking, I threaten to call the cops on them. Just to get them scared, no more. I know they can‚Äôt really do anything in that situation. The calls stop.

Towards the end of the year I find out that C was the one who called me. I didn‚Äôt care at that point. 

Queue summer school.

I went in every year because my parents wanted me to do something during the summer. I ride the bus home with D, P, and C, even though the person who organizes the people on the bus well know that P and C shouldn‚Äôt be together because of a lot of yelling and cursing before.

Me and D were messing around on the bus, he would take my backpack and hide it and would take my phone and hide it but would give it back to me if I were stumped or something of that sort. I fall down after grabbing my phone, and I fall down next to C‚Äôs seat. I put my phone on her seat for the time being so I could stand up.

She looks at it, grabs it before I get up, and chucks it at the window. This causes a crack in it. Now I‚Äôm pissed. I don‚Äôt do anything, but the next day I‚Äôm called to the office and I tell them the story. Nothing happens to her. No punishment.

The next year on my regular bus I have P and C on my bus again but not D. This year, she cusses out my bus driver (who was very friendly and I would consider one of my friends) 5 times in one week. Bus driver tells the principal and the bus company, but again, nothing happens. No punishment.

She ten, a week later, proceeds to try to start a fight with me. I was ready to make it hurt, but with the way things were going, I would‚Äôve been the one to get in trouble. So my bus driver, P, and another one of my friends tells the principal. Can you predict what happens? No punishment. 

Now we get to this year. Just a few days ago, she double flipped off her teacher and cursed her out to the point where everyone could hear her. Hasn‚Äôt even been called to the office.

I‚Äôm afraid she‚Äôs going to be getting a free pass with whatever she does. Is there something that I or anyone else can do to stop this?",06Oct2019,1
79,"Before I start this thread I wanna say that ""I'm sick of being lonely"" doesn't mean that I want a girlfriend or a boyfriend or anything like that. What I'm trying to say is that I'm an only child with very few friends that live far away (Which means I'm not able to be with them all the time). All my life I've wanted someone around my age (12-18) to be with,to share my creations with, to talk about our interests and all that stuff. To put it simply: I want to live with a kid I can relate to, a brother / sister basically. Now here's the thing, I'm pretty sure my parents would react negatively if I asked them about this. They already struggle taking care of me, taking care of another child would be a pain in the ass for them and I totally understand that. Not only that but my mom is in her late 40s and my dad's in his early 60s, It's kinda late to have another child so adoption would be the only way they can bring a new kid into the family but that costs a LOT from what I've heard. Finally, I want to say that I'm somewhat socially awkward so in the case they DID adopt a new child I don't know how I'd feel around them, I like my privacy and I'm afraid I'd regret it afterwards.

I got into another relationship briefly after me and her broke up and we were together for a while until i started gaining attraction to her again. It got to a complicated point were we were doing our final exams. I shot my shot but she didnt want a relationship as she would have prefered to be completely focused.

I wasn't angry angry, I found it amusing. I then fell back asleep. A few minutes later, I woke up to pigeon noises. He was making these sounds as a joke. I wasn't upset, I found it funny and adorable. That's when it all started. I was in 9th grade and he was in 10th. I was too shy to talk to him and I lacked confidence. Do what I did, I tried to walk pass him whenever I could. Later on, I figured out his schedule. I never really said hi, I'd just cross his path. But it made me so happy whenever I passed him by.

92,"So, a bit of background, my parents and I moved to America and eventually to Canada. In due time, we earned citizenship and out plans to stay became more permanent. My grandparents are still in India, with no children to care for them. My grandmother is adamant that she wants to stay there, despite all logic, given both of her children live in North America with high paying jobs and families of their own. They are both getting old, and its getting harder for them to continue their life there. We (my grandparent's daughter's family) have invited them to come here numerous times for many years but my grandmother is absolutely stuck in her ways that she will not move from her place. My grandfather is much more reasonable and willing to move, but nothing will happen unless we get my grandmother to agree as well.

She is so uncompromising that she won't even apply for a passport extension because it ""implies"" that she would eventually move. I won't go into the details, but she is approaching her mid-80s and life doesn't seem to be getting any better at all. My parents have tried every persuasive maneuver known to man, but whenever we even begin to talk about visas and passports, she hangs up the phone suddenly, as if she wants no part in a meaningless discussion. I don't know what to do. I am in college and I don't have time to put my career on hold just to convince her to come. Whenever we call, she always talks about us and tells us to come back and live there until she passes, since she thinks she only has a little time left (grim stuff, I know). In her mind, the ideal scenario would be that everyone moves back to India and settles there. My parents would get some bum ass job there. Me, dropping out of my prestigious university and going to one of the shit schools there, which she considers ""just as good"". 

I don't know if we're being unreasonable or if she is. I have always thought that its the parents responsibility to not limit their children's success for selfish reasons, but on the other hand, is it really selfish of her to want us to be by her side during her last days?

The situation gets even more complicated when you factor in that my uncle isn't too concerned about the entire situation because my grandmother has never asked him to come back to India. She knows that there's no way in hell she can budge my uncle into coming, but she knows that she can manipulate my mom. My uncle thinks that the entire situation has been blown way out of proportion and that no immediate action is really requires. This is very important because without my uncle's support, there's absolutely no way we can convince my grandmother to come organically. 

My parents aren't doing anything, since they think that there's nothing they can do. Whenever I think about my grandmother I can't help but cry because I understand how it must feel to approach your death and not have anyone beside you.

94,"Okay. Short version: I'd been taking Lovan for about a year and decided to stop (without anyone knowing) just recently. My depression is coming back super fast and it's affecting my relationship. Can't see my usual psychiatrist until January. What do I do?

Long version:

For almost a year, I had been taking Lovan (fluoxetine hydrochloride) to help deal with my depression, anxiety and anger. It worked pretty well and, especially in the last few months before my decision, my life had been awesome. I have a boyfriend who I plan on marrying one day and so on. But, about two weeks ago, I decided I was going to stop taking my Lovan. It constantly made me feel hazy and forget everything; it made life a sedative blur. I felt like I wasn't truly alive while taking it and my grades were suffering due to the 'IDGAF' attitude it gave me.

Fast forward to now, and I regret my decision so much. I'm crying nearly every day and experiencing anger so severe I can barely contain it from my friends and loved ones. I've had thoughts about ending it all and self-harm again, too. But worst of all? It's starting to put a little strain on my relationship. I made him (boyfriend) drink yesterday because he couldn't handle how sad I made him feel via being sad myself, and with this anger I've been feeling comes extreme envy that leads to toxic vibes etc. He is the strongest man I know... but he won't be able to take this strain and unintentional abuse for long. I'm ruining our relationship slowly. My life has gone back to meaning nothing. What should I do?

Should I start back up on Lovan despite the side effects it gave me?

Should I try and avoid venting or even being near my boyfriend when I'm sad to avoid hurting him?

Should I just end myself and let the discourse I started die with me in favour of grief?",06Oct2019,1

I realized a good tip was to ask other people questions about themselves. I've heard others suggest this and I agree, people seem to like to share things about themselves. And I'm not big on blabbing about myself to people I'm not already close to. And even when I do talk about myself, I get a serious feeling that nobody really cares anyhow, and I get paranoid that I'm making it too much about me. So, easy solution, right? Just talk about them.

But that's where the next problem lies. I just... tend to zone out. And that's awful! It sounds so selfish! It's a serious detriment to my social life.

109,"Was it really just the job that‚Äôs made me feel this way?

I'm a young female. I've started a new job recently and for the first time ever (or perhaps, the second time) I am in a very good-fit of a position. I can‚Äôt believe my luck. I didn‚Äôt have to try very hard to get it, only make myself visible on LinkedIn and go through multiple rounds of interviews. The job can have its stressful moments/days, and it doesn‚Äôt pay much, but overall, it is low pressure, flexible, and provides me with a degree or autonomy and leadership. It‚Äôs great and I‚Äôm grateful for it.

To backtrack a little on my life before this job...I was unsatisfied and always chasing after things outside of me (external satisfaction) to make me feel good internally. I used to have an intense need (not even want) for socialisation and relationships, pursuing people that didn‚Äôt have the time or desire to prioritise the same things as I did at the time. Previously, I always had this hole in my life that I felt the need to fill with partying, trying to establish friendships, dating and constantly being stressed/worried about finding a partner.

But now that I‚Äôve started this job...I feel so much more content about life, and everything. It‚Äôs kinda crazy. I don‚Äôt have as much anxiety as before. I am clearheaded and rarely in a bad mood (to be fair, I‚Äôve never been a sullen person, but I‚Äôm much happier and more content now).

So, what I mean to say by all this...was it really just this job that changed around so much for me? Now that I‚Äôm finally working somewhere that I‚Äôm not stressed at constantly? If so then I kind of feel guilty, because like I said the opportunity sort of fell in my lap.

Or is this just me maturing and getting wiser, and becoming stronger after lots of obstacles and difficulties/struggles in life. I don‚Äôt believe in god so I‚Äôm wondering how or why I feel so good. I don‚Äôt feel my ‚Äúdeserving‚Äù this also is a factor in my having gotten this job, since like I said I don‚Äôt believe in god, and I also don‚Äôt have that high of an opinion of myself. Just that it was happen-chance like so many other things in life.

I do have a good family, and friends back home, but those were always in my life. I mean, looking in from the outside you could even question why I am content, since I‚Äôve recently lost the only good friend I have in the area (she turned out to be mental and cut ties with me for an incredulous reason), so I don‚Äôt have a social life besides family and colleagues at work. I also have no love life, and don‚Äôt have enough money to really go out or travel. Besides other external reasons I could be very depressed and sad right now...

I think I‚Äôm addicted to carbs, so every time I try and limit food sources my mind immediately tells me ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôll never have pasta again‚Äù and I kind of just give in. I‚Äôve tried working out before but I‚Äôm too socially anxious to try much without crying, plus my ankle is really shitty and gives out after like five minutes of a brisk walk. 

I was thinking to try the thing where you eat like five small meals a day but I don‚Äôt know how long I‚Äôd last before giving in and getting lunch from school.

I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù and 225 lbs, in high school, and every time I see that stupid number go up it just digs a deeper hole for me. 

Does anyone have any advice for like what to eat or how to get myself into a routine without having to fight my brain every step of the way? Also, would swimming be a good exercise to lose weight?",06Oct2019,1
111,"So... I have some trust issues as it is due to some past things. But the scenario at hand doesn‚Äôt have much to do with that. My boyfriend was friends with this girl a while back, he openly admitted he used to have a crush on her but she didn‚Äôt reciprocate the feelings. She (20/f) has a one year old son ( this will become relevant) they used to talk a bit but never hung out much. I don‚Äôt know the extent of their friendship. But when we first started dating three years ago she would message me asking me to tell him to call her or asking me where he was and weird stuff like that. He said she would constantly text him asking him to come over or to hang out and when he wouldn‚Äôt answer her she would text me trying to get me to get him to talk to her. This came off as obsessive behavior to me. I never met her but we talked occasionally when she would message me. About a year ago he decided to just stop talking to her and i ignored her messages to me asking to talk to him too. I don‚Äôt live with him yet, but she and I live in the same town. Last night there was an event downtown and I had to work. She came in with her mom and son and I recognized her and formally introduced myself. Because even though they weren‚Äôt talking it seemed polite. I now think that was a mistake. I introduced myself as ‚Äúboyfriends‚Äù girlfriend lexie. And she was like ‚Äúoh well I‚Äôm not friends with him anymore.‚Äù I‚Äôm kind of a rude tone ? And then when I said ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs nice to finally meet you‚Äù she replied with a rather sulky ‚Äúwish it were under better circumstances. I told him about it and how she seemed kinda rude about the whole thing. I come to find out that she texted him this morning. She specifically said ‚Äúcan we meet and talk‚Äù and he explained that ‚Äúmy girlfriend felt you took an attitude with her last night‚Äù which he didn‚Äôt need to say... but she proceeded to explain ‚Äúshe was being rushed because her kid was losing his mind‚Äù this was not true. Her mom was holding him and he was perfectly pleased. She said she wanted to see him and just hangout. Seeing me reminded her she missed him, is what she told him. So they made a meeting to hang out next weekend, and she decided she wants to bring her son so he can meet him. They haven‚Äôt talked in almost a year... this is all super weird to me and I don‚Äôt trust her or her intentions. I don‚Äôt know what to do about it.

112,"My fianc√© and I got engaged about 2 weeks ago.

113,"This job is fairly new. I am a bartender and yesterday on my day off I got my hair styled into box braids. I don't want to post a picture of mine but if you google the style, you'll see what I mean. They are about boob-length (don't know how else to describe it lol), black, and with only a couple gold hair clips for decoration. Our employee handbook does not say what kind of hair is prohibited. I have a coworker with hair past her waist in a ponytail and another girl with platinum blonde, nearly white hair.

Today I came in and my manager came up to me. This is kind of how the conversation went down - he'll be B for boss:
B: ""You changed your hair.""
M: ""Yeah! I got it down yesterday!""
B: ""I don't like it.""
M: ""Oh... okay?""
B: ""It looks unprofessional and it's extremely long for a bartender. We'd have to run it by corporate first but I would suggest you take them down.""

It made me feel extremely uncomfortable. I don't want to pull out the race card but it is a very culturally black hairstyle and it is a style I think suits me the best. I can't tell if this is something worth fighting for or if his concerns are valid.. but in that case, wouldn't the hostess with hair past her waist also be asked to cut it? My hair cost $200 (she is a celebrity braider, so you can guarantee my braids don't look unkempt and in fact I got many compliments from customers that day) and it took five hours to style, so I don't want to spend two hours removing them the next day.",06Oct2019,0

120,"Last week I got to thinking after leaving my sisters house, and I realized that possibly the reason why I haven't really grown all that much is because of my family. I tend to lean on them a bit too much socially. Basically everyone I know is because of my sister and her husband, and if it wasn't for those two I wouldn't get out at all. I live in the middle of nowhere in southern Illinois, so there really isn't a nightlife or anything to do in general besides bars. I haven't really forced myself to go outside of my comfort zone since I always think ""Well I can always hang out with them"".

The other thing as well that I got to thinking about is how being around the family is keeping me from changing. I'm fairly quiet since I've always had my mom and older sisters to speak for me growing up, and being the baby of the family I sometimes still feel like I'm being treated like the baby of the family despite being almost 30. When I think of myself I still see myself as a kid, not as an adult and I'm starting to wonder if it's because I'm around people that still treat me as the youngest. If they get upset at me and I try to speak back, I immediately get shut down because, at least how I feel it is, I'm the youngest and I shouldn't speak back. This has been something with both parents and siblings, which now lead me to basically now not being able to defend myself or ask for anything without some sort of fear. 

So basically, what I need advice on is if it would be beneficial for me to move away. If anyone has had similar experiences, what helped you change, and would moving away really help me become more outgoing like I want to be? I do love my family, and of course what I mentioned here doesn't happen too often, but I just got to thinking maybe I'm using my family as a crutch to not advance in life.",06Oct2019,1

So, I'm pretty young. 16(F) living in Indonesia. I'm currently doing archery, skateboarding, singing, digital drawing, writing and trying to pursue acting.

 Now, I want to stop archery, as my parents both forced me to do every activity that had to do with it. It was stressful. I couldn't seem to have freedom with my own hobby, and as a result, I lost my interest in archery.

They're berating me, saying that I never follow through with things, and that I'm wasting their money. Which, to be fair, isn't wrong because I really get bored of archery nowadays.

My goals are to move to the Netherlands and not rely on my parents anymore, I don't really know how to do that, because I can't make money as no one wants to commission me ( I honestly believe I'm a good artist. ) So I'm just trapped in archery, and trapped in my parents insults.

132,"Tl;dr: My friend and unrequited love died last year, and his family doesn't know me but I know them and I shop at their store sometimes. I don't know how he died, only that it was sudden. I see his twin often, and now I know why he's been acting so different lately. I want to know what happened, I want to say something, but don't know what, or if I should. Any advice would be appreciated.


I just found out today. I went to his family's business where he used to help out on holidays and I saw his obituary in a frame with a little plant underneath it at the cash. I can't describe the sad shock of it. It was like in a movie- the walls and floor falling away and the noise of the shop fading away to silence. I was overcome by the sadness of it, but also shocked. Still it explained perfectly the mood in the store now. It used to be so joyful in there. That was what it was like everywhere he went.


His family doesn't know me, but I know who they are because of his stories and things. 


I should also add that he was an unrequited love. I wasn't the right one for him, but he was my first big, head over heels crush and the first time I saw the possibility of something that was better than my playboy bachelor lifestyle. If I hadn't felt what I felt for him, I don't know if I would have recognized how rare and important that feeling was when I felt it a second time, for my (now) wife.


I guess all of this is just to say, he was huge influence in my life, bigger than I was in his. We fell out of touch- I backed off a bit because he found his partner (who was perfect for him!) I fell into a bad (abusive) relationship, then I got out and got sober and couldn't socialize around alcohol for a while. Then I got married and started a family... Life just kept happening.


We used to see eachother on Christmas Eve at his family's shop every year, though, and he'd give me such a great hug. Last year he wasn't there. Now I know why. I really thought we'd reconnect soon enough. I've been intentionally dropping by the store hoping to run into him. Now.... 


So. Should I ever ask what happened? Is there a way to express my condolences? I feel like I don't have a right. I just feel so badly for everyone who loved him. I don't want to hurt anyone, and if the information isn't out there, it must be private. I understand why I want an explanation, a reason, but that's not their problem, right?

150,"Hello everyone, looking for legit advice here. Long text ahead.

I have a 12 year old brother and we both play video games. I mostly play competitive games (Dota 2, Street Fighter V, Smash Bros) and he plays Fortnite and stuff like Mobile Legends (ugh). I always hear him complaining about Fortnite lately and his tablet is broken, so I tried getting him into other competitive games (the ones I play) to also have someone to play with. However, it didn't go well at all.

At first, I tried to get him into Smash Bros and SFV. It was going well at first, I taught him the controls and the general game plan. I played characters I don't usually play and gave him chances to win sometimes. It all went down the drain when I thought he got good enough to move to the next level. I tried teaching him more about the game (not even hard stuff since I'm not even good at the games myself), and played my main character to show him how good he can potentially get. 

This had the reverse effect; he started thinking that he can't get better no matter what he does since he always loses. He also started to realize that I'm losing games on purpose when I'm using other characters. He got so demotivated that at one point when we were playing he just dropped the controller on me and left the room. I thought that maybe fighting games weren't for him

In my next attempt I tried getting him into Dota 2. I know this game in particular is a difficult game to get into, but since he plays ML I thought he would like to learn it despite the difficulty. Turns out I was wrong again. He got so frustrated while playing the game due to various things. I tried to calm him down and teach him as slow as I can to ease him into the basics, but it got to the point where I thought to myself ""fuck this"" and made him quit.

I have to be honest, I got pretty mad after that (internally of course). I don't know how to deal with people like this. It's as if he expects these games to hold his hand and make him win. He keeps on telling me ""I want to get better"" but every time we try to do that he just ends up complaining about every single thing. I'm starting to think that he's confusing ""getting better"" with ""winning"". I'm saying that because he can't handle seeing himself lose, even though losing is an important part of the process. I tried to motivate him by saying stuff like ""these things take time"", ""losing can make you better if you learn from it"", etc but I feel like none of those have an effect on him. I kind of get this feeling that if he doesn't feel like he's good after playing the game for a few minutes, he's never gonna get good at it. RN he's just playing Fortnite while complaining about every single thing; nothing different from usual.

I kind of realize by now that trying to get him into the games I play is impossible, but I want to at least get him out of this defeatist mentality. I don't want my brother to grow up into an adult that gives up on anything if it doesn't work out right in the first 5 mins. I want to at least make him realize how far effort can take you; doesn't matter if it's video games or whatever it is you put your time into. When I was a kid I had a similar experience, but the difference between me and him is that I HATED losing, and he's AFRAID of it. If you're afraid of something, it makes you unable to act and makes you want to run away, but if you hate something it makes you want to go against it.

So please, any advice would help. I know this post seems gaming related but I feel like he'd get equally frustrated and give up on anything I teach him (I tried teaching him guitar a few months ago and it also didn't go well). Thanks!",06Oct2019,1
151,"So my dad has never beenbin my life. But when I was younger I feel like my mom use to ask me if I wanted to talk to him and I feel like I did talk to him once or twice. But it stopped. I'm not sure if they're real memories and don't want to look like a fool about something so serious.

The one or two times my mom has talked about him in breif sentences they were in past tense like descriptions not stories. I know they were never married. I feel like she said I had bio half siblings. 

I'm scared to ask. All the evidence points to is that I'm a mistake. (Which I don't really care about) or he could be dead, in jail, or just a deadbeat, or he had an affair and left my mom only.",06Oct2019,1
152,"So, I‚Äôve known this girl (let‚Äôs call her Ally) since elementary school and we were friends but rarely talked. Going into middle school we became a little closer and finally it‚Äôs my senior year of high school and we‚Äôve gotten a few classes together. In the past couple of weeks we‚Äôve gotten a lot closer. Me and Ally have been texting constantly and just being nicer to each other in general. 
Yesterday Ally invited me to go to a school football game which I happily said yes to. We pretty much ignored the game and talked the entire time. Shortly after the game ended she invited me and a few of her friends back to her house where we all played some games on her wii pretty much the entire time.
One by one people start leaving and it‚Äôs finally me and Ally alone together. We continued playing games until midnight, chatting and in general having a great time. Finally I decide to man up a bit and I put my arm around her. She pauses for a second then leans into my chest with my arm still around her. Me and Ally continued to play games through the night staying in that position until I had to leave cause I was tired. She gave me a big hug, we said our good byes and.. yeah. I went home, texted with Ally a bit more about how much fun the night was then dozed off mid conversation.
Tomorrow I‚Äôm going with Ally to a midnight showing of a movie we both wanted to see. I‚Äôm not sure wether I should go ahead and ask her out or if I should mention anything about what happened the night before, if I should try to make a move or just do nothing.

To a lot of people it may seem super obvious that she may or may not be into me but in the end I‚Äôm afraid. I really like being with her and I want to be more than just friends but if she says no after putting everything out in the open, I don‚Äôt know if I would be able to go back to the relationship we had before I had these feelings for her.",06Oct2019,2
153,"My friend (coworker) found a puppy in their apartment complex. Apartment manager confirmed he was dumped when some tenants moved out.

They beg me to take him for a few nights while him and his roommate figure things out rehoming him. I agree but tell them my dog is super picky and bratty and he may need to make other arrangements for the pup. 

I take in the puppy. Now I'm falling in love. My dog loves him too. My friend is texting me saying things like ""We really want to keep him but I need a better job first where I can stay at home, we need to move into a bigger place first"" etc. Like...long term stuff. Essentially my friend wants me to take care of this wild ass puppy, potty train him, let him destroy my home, and then give him back when they feel they are ready for him. This puppy needs to get vetted, neutered etc  but my friend hasn't even mentioned this.

I want to keep the puppy and care for him like he needs to be cared for. My friend technically found him, and for that I feel like it's his puppy? But he is not in the place to take care of him, at least for now. How can I tell my friend that like...I'm keeping this puppy. Pls give advice.

155,"So last night my mom comes over for dinner with me and my gf. It‚Äôs wonderful until she starts talking about her ‚Äúspiritual consultant‚Äù and ‚Äúshaman‚Äù. 

To give a little backstory my mother is in her 50s, middle class white woman living in America. She recently paid (I don‚Äôt know how much) to go to a spiritual training school where she did god knows what. I didn‚Äôt ask. During her time at this school they introduced her to this shaman. This woman was apparently a high up in the fashion world before she went to Hawaii for a wedding and fell horribly ill. The story goes she was so sick with an unidentifiable illness she had to stay in Hawaii until she was well enough to leave. While she‚Äôs there her friend takes a shot in the dark and introduces her to a shaman who upon meeting her tells her that ‚Äúthey have been waiting for her‚Äù. A year later she comes back and is a full fledged shaman.

My mom tells me that she has been having sessions with her, and says that this ‚Äúshaman‚Äù claimed that our dead dog buddy‚Äôs soul was ‚Äúthere‚Äù and said that he loves my mom dearly. The ‚Äúshaman‚Äù also said that her dad (my grandfather who is known to have molested my mom and her sisters) was also there in the room and was sending his love to my mom. Then she tells me that this session occurred over video chat like Skype or a similar service.

I feel horrible telling my mom that the ‚Äúshaman‚Äù is scamming her and taking her money and that the spiritual school she went to which put her in contact with this person is also a scam. It seems like it genuinely makes her happy to do this kind of thing. It is not ok for her to be getting scammed and have her money taken by fake mediums over a video call. Would I be the asshole for telling her they probably found all of the info on Facebook or other places on the internet, or not? How should I break it to her to save her the money and pain of finding out later?",06Oct2019,2

158,"I'm a college student renting an apartment near my school (VA, USA). When I toured a sample unit in the complex, I looked in drawers and cabinets, turned on water faucets, and looked all over the floors for any signs of cockroaches or their turds. I saw nothing. 

I tried moving in, and saw quite a few. It was bad enough that I decided to hold off on unpacking and stay with my parents instead. In the meantime, I sprayed and hoped for the best.

They mostly went away, and I decided it was good to move in. I wasn't too off put by having to kill maybe two or three a month, I'm not expecting a perfect experience for as cheap as I'm paying. After a month, though, they came back with a vengeance. I usually kill 6 to 10 a night. Tonight I'm nearing a dozen. I'm a very clean person, to the point where the maintenance staff actually commented on it when they came by. But even I can't keep up with all the roach corpses and poop to clean up at this point.

To their credit, my landlord has been professional and reasonably cooperative. They sealed my sink cabinet with caulk and provide free spraying twice a month. I double down on this with various insecticides, bait traps, and peppermint oil. They have my entire building on the company shit-list and they're supposed to be spraying the whole building ""soon"".

But nothing is working, and I hate to think how awful the problem would be if I wasn't keeping on top of it. I spend way too much time and money throwing out paper towels, spraying, baiting, and worrying about it, so my parents and I agreed that it's time to give up and move out. I've listed the place for sublet, but I don't know if there's any easier ways to get out of my lease. Does it sound like a constructive eviction? Is there a chance my landlord has mercy on me and finds some other sucker to move in instead?",06Oct2019,1

Okay starting off. This girl and I have know eachother for basically all our lifes. But I havnt talked to her much. I always thought she wss pretty but never really tried anything. 

About a month or so it was her birthday coincidentally it beeing 1 day apart from mine so I sent her a happy birthday text and we had a little convo. 

I started to talk to her but she always seemed to answer rather than having a conversation. I've helped her with some homework and she is really nice.

I would like to know how can we improve our conversation. And what I can talk to her about or what I should do.

167," Apologies for any typos. Oh boy... Where do I even start. I won't tell you the whole story. I am exhausted and it's midnight. I am sick to my stomach and I just well. can't deal with this dude.... So I ""was"" friends with this guy. We are both gamers and we hang out at our local gaming store together at least once a week. He seemed like a pretty cool guy. A good friend and I today were in the car together and we were having a deep conversation for some reason about loyalty and trust. He brought up how he was arrested the second time we hung out because he didn't want me to find out from someone else or google. Well call him... Harold. Harold is a true honest person. I jokingly said yeah... not like our friend ... who we will call John. Harold showed me his arrest record. I in a joking manner again said What if we did google John? So I did just for s&amp;gs because he was driving and I was bored... because... why not? I expected to see something like his place of work and a FB page not a link to his SEX OFFENDER page! Woah! I did not see that coming. Not even a little. I of course was absolutely revolted. Every part of me skin crawled and I wanted to rip it off. So background on me for a quick sec. I was sexually assaulted as a child. Multiple times. No one in my family has any idea. I called my mom to talk to her about this and she told me I shit you not ""I feel so bad for those poor kids who have someone close like a family or a friend and the child is too terrified because they won't be believed"" Wow mom... did you just hit the nail on the head there. I honestly almost broke down on the spot and told her in hysterical sobs what happened but it would break her heart and give her pain and I can't do that to her. So she told me to just ignore him and let him go away. I asked a couple other people I completely trust what I should do and they said they didn't know. Here is why I can't let this go. Not even for me but the children at the gaming store I go to. There are so many kids, it is very family friendly. I called my father too, they both said the same thing. Don't say anything and let it go. I want to drop hints to the store owner and let them make a judgement call. They feel it isn't my business and I shouldn't tell the store owner but if I was a parent I would absolutely want to know if there was a convicted pedophile literally inches away. I don't know what to do. I'm stuck. Not to mention having to deal with my old trauma surfacing. I know that and my ang:(er are clouding my judgement. Please... does anyone have any advice?

168,"Just to make the backstory easier to explain, G will be for the good parent and B will be for bad parent. I am a student and I‚Äôm dependent on my parents at this current day in age. G has always been one of the best people in my life. G is kind, understanding and has a willingness to listen and help. In my early memory, B used to be like a discount G; not quite as understanding and a bit rough around the edges. In the more recent years, B‚Äôs behavior has increased from the occasional put down or insult to becoming an aggressive, selfish drunk. While B has not lashed out physically and hurt anyone, B has a tendency to destroy items in the surrounding environment in fits of rage (plates, computers, etc.) So while nobody living in the house has been harmed, there is the ever present threat of B snapping. B‚Äôs behavior has impacted my self worth/esteem and mental health drastically, so much so that I will hide in my room the majority of the day without eating just to avoid being a verbal punching bag. I have spoken to G about B many times over the year, and G has admitted that divorce has been a common thought as G has witnessed B‚Äôs treatment of my brother and I, as well as endured some of B‚Äôs verbal lashings as well. While all signs point toward divorce, the main thing that is holding G back is the warfare over assets. G is worried that many of the assets and finances would go to B if a divorce would take place. I have assured G that the chances of B driving G to bankruptcy would be &gt;5% or so (a rough guesstimate.) G is just worried about some of the assets.  It may sound peculiar that such amount of hesitation would be caused by a few assets, but G is not being selfish; G is looking out for my brother and I‚Äôs financial and economical future. G wants to ensure that my brother and I‚Äôs lives will be given the best head start when we go out independently. The point I am trying to ask is how does one deal with this scenario, how can one escape it and what would be the best course of action:Divorce or separation?

We‚Äôve/were best friends since sophomores in high school. She was the first person that I felt completely comfortable with so she meant a great deal to me and I loved/love her very much. For most of my life, I‚Äôm 22, it‚Äôs been chaotic. My parents were young when they had me, lots of instability in their relationship, my maternal grandparents were alcoholics (happily, they‚Äôve sobered up and are no longer), infidelity in their marriage, CPS was called once when I was 12, I thought it was discipline until an incident crossed the line. Recently, in my young adult life,  my great grandmother passed, my uncle tried to take his life, my mom was diagnosed with PTSD and DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder), my cousins were almost taken away from their parents. To sum it up, this is an inkling of what has happened thus far.

In high school, I opened up to her about EVERYTHING that affected me physically, emotionally and mentally. Not all at once, but slowly as I grew more comfortable. And she became my rock, someone I felt safe with.
It was like this until we were 19, I started to meet new people and I fell off the face of the map for her. It lasted close to two years? Then we reconnected last summer, June of 2018. 
Things weren‚Äôt totally different, just not the same. Which is expected with time, things change. We got on, we moved in together, moved out with my partner.

Now, prior to me moving out, things started to change or I noticed things have changed. She and her partner have been together for 4 years, she loves him very much and pretty much would do anything for him. When he moved across the state, (we were 19-20?) she moved into a city two hours away from where he lived. Eventually, they both moved back, got a place together, and so on. They would openly talk about marrying one other so then, it was just a fact that they would. But nothing really happened, it didn‚Äôt seem like he had the intention to propose until she decided to covert to being a Mormon; I should specify that her partner grew up/was raised Mormon, so naturally it had affect on their relationship. Anyways, I was surprised because years prior, she would‚Äôve never considered converting. Although I didn‚Äôt entirely agree, it‚Äôs not my life so I still supported her, I asked questions, inquired about her thoughts and feelings through it all. Things seemed fine and I moved out. Shortly after, I invited both of them to my new place for dinner so I could thank them for everything and apologize if I caused any inconvenience.. No reply. I figured, they‚Äôre busy, they‚Äôll get back, and still no reply. They got engaged in September, I congratulated her and she replied, ‚ÄúThank you!‚Äù I asked how he proposed and how she felt, etc. and left on read. She got married today. 

I was hurt, sad, angry, confused, etc. and reacted out of it. I unfollowed/unfriended/blocked her on all socials. I figured since I wasn‚Äôt important enough, she no longer deserved to see my life. What a millennial thing, ha. Now though, I‚Äôm reconsidering everything. I want to send her a text to tell her congrats and wish the best for her and her husband. Or should I wait and tell her that I‚Äôm happy for her and although I wasn‚Äôt present, I wish the best and understand that this may be the end of road? Or should I even send a text at all? Or unblock her? What can I do to move forward from this? 


TLDR; best friend of 5 years got married today and didn‚Äôt tell me or invite me. very hurt and sad, blocked her on socials. what should i do? unblock? send a text? wait to text? or should i do anything at all?",06Oct2019,1
186,"My parents decided it'd be good to do some contract work with their landlord. They'd look at his properties, inspect them, and repair them. All of this was done at a much cheaper price than getting more professional workers like a plumber or an electrician (which is what a lot of the properties required frankly). My parents are on SSI, and they often have less than enough money to survive (I live with them, and I can't get a job yet either due to some clerical errors on my birth certificate that I am in the middle of fixing). They also have experience in construction working. He seemed like a nice guy in all, but there was something off. For one, he'd always gravitate towards my parents and would say that he only gets rent from us. Second, he made suspicious deals with us (Ex: he'd offer to lower rent if we worked for him, he offered a lawnmower, and a car).  My parents accepted all of these things.  
Well, it turns out the car barely works, and the debt my parents are in is not changing whatsoever. You see, the debt from their work is being increased because we can't pay the electric bill. My landlord decided to let them use the money they pay for rent for the electric bill, putting them into more debt. Our electric bill is simply too high to pay (my parents only make $1100 a month, and it's in a $700 a month rental home, and the rest goes to other bills). Our landlord makes deals with cars on the regular (he sold a car for 400k recently). He knows his shit about cars, but not about ours. To top it all off, my parents spend way too much money on marijuana (they have bipolar disorder that needs antipsychotics and tranquilizers as medication, which we can't afford).  
I know I'm being a burden to my family. I'm planning all I can to move out and live on my own. I just need advice on what to do because we can't live like this anymore They can't live like this. I'm going to get $700 soon, and I need to know what to do here.",06Oct2019,1

188,"Im a longtime lurker, so I decided to make an account just to post this, any advice would be appreciated

I'll start with some context this is my first time finding my own place to live, its been a frustrating experience especially since I'm struggling against the absurd prices of the Seattle housing market. about a month ago I found an absurdly cheap offer for tenanting, large apartment, just one other guy, all for just 510$ a month with utilities covered. I was ecstatic at this offer and maybe a bit too naive, but that's where all the trouble began.

After calling this stranger up, we arrange a date on the weekend where I go to check the apartment out in person and see if I would be willing to move in, I throw out the line that ""I'll definitely check it out to see if it fits my needs"" pretending to be much less desperate then I really was, I couldn't possibly let such a stupidly  great offer vaporize right in front of me, I practically already made up my mind about moving in and only primarily attended the house to check it out out of courtesy. It had nice polished hardwood floors, everything was surprisingly clean, the couch was freshly vacuumed and the kitchens were still wet from being wiped down, nothing atypical or out of the ordinary besides the fact that it was such giant apartment for only 2 bedrooms, about 1400 square feet.

I moved in after the next day, I didn't really have much of my own, maybe a weeks or two's worth of cloth's my gaming PC that I built myself but never find enough time to actually use, and the essentials, everything else would have to be accumulated from now to the end of my days, I now realize that I failed to describe Ben (not his real name, even weirdos deserve privacy) who is the ""roommate"" that this post concerns, at first he seemed odd, and maybe a bit uptight, but for the most part seemed normal, he walked with a limp that he used his jet black cane to rectify, it made a loud thwacking sound against the hard wood which made it so you could always tell if he was walking around. He seemed like an average guy, a bit nerdy, he seemed to have a inkling shyness, but this facade didn't take long to fall apart.

This week I noticed something odd about him, that I've never actually seen him sleep, hes seemingly always awake, he stays up hours after I go to sleep, and even If I wake up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, he is standing in the kitchen with the lights turned juts standing there. When I wake up he is usually on the couch playing Tetris Effect on the ps4, this made me notice the second ""odd"" thing about Ben. While he is ungodly good at the game, moving at near the speed of light racking up points in ways I couldn't have even fathomed, it was his eyes that unnerved me, I noticed something with his eyes, they were focused, like he was an actual person, why did that unnerve me? why was it so out of the ordinary? for the majority of this week I've been observing him, and one of the most noticeable things about him are his hazy eyes, they are always brown unfocused and dull, even when he was staring directly at you he would appear no different then if he was staring at a object far in the distance, When he smiles or makes a silly face for a joke, they always remained unchanged, unmoving, even the wrinkles around his eyes rarely moved.

Things really started getting weird this Thursday, randomly he stopped using his cane, walking normally without his usually noticeable limp, I didn't mention anything to him and he pretended nothing was different at all. I nervously looked and explored around the apartment for his cane as this was really starting to get to me, I almost immediately found it in the trash can, It was one of those canes that pull apart into two pieces, but once I snatched it out of the trashcan I realized that it was absolutely littered with dents and bends, It was bent into practically a square with enough dents to rival the moon itself.

I didn't really know what to do with the cane once I got it so I just put it under my bed and then proceeded to take out the trash and pretend nothing happened. On Friday night I was fed up with ignoring the wacky behavior and decided to confront him on it, as I felt he want being honest with me. We were in the large kitchen when I asked him about the happenings, he was still playing dumb with me, maybe I've blown this out of proportion, maybe I was looking for something to be wrong him him, maybe he had a mental condition he wasn't ready to come forward with, after a bit of silence I decided to back down, a bit frustrated I went to bed in a hurry as to not embarrass myself further.

I tossed and turned in the night and got quite worked up, I couldn't fall asleep due to the stupid LED lamp that was on the bookshelf in the corner of my room, The room came furnished with fully stocked bookshelves, a bean bag, a mattress, and all the cool stuff, so I forgave some of the tacky decoration, This LED lamp was a giant glowing tower on a cylinder  stand, illuminating the room with random annoying glowing colors straight from the 80's, I fiddled with it, trying to find an off switch before I just unplugged it and thrashed myself into my bed and off to sleep, I was ready to accept that I was wrong about him, and life lesson learned to not assume things about people. Until I woke up in the morning to the bright shining light of the LED lamp, I certainly didn't plug it back in myself, all of my frustration from the previous night flooded back to me as I slithered myself over to the lamp, I tugged sharply and tightly on the power cord unplugging it from the wall, and I decided to take a look at the bottom of it to find out why it was so Important to Ben that he must sneak himself into my room to re plug it in, It was made by a strange Chinese company I have never heard of, which wasn't surprising for such a tacky and useless ornament, I had the nagging feeling that something was wrong, It was just a lamp, why was I so worked up about this?, so I laid it back down on the shelf and got myself prepared for work.

What really got my attention was when I returned, my mind was cleared from a nice day at work, and I was perfectly ready to get back into the rhythm of things and happily continue on, but when I opened my door to my room, I noticed the lamp was plugged in again, at this point I was pretty suspicious, so I googled the name of the lamp and came up with something that im still having trouble processing, apparently its some shady hidden nanny cam? I feel really violated for being spied on, so I flew into a rage at Ben, screaming at him with my shrill voice, he just sat there, staring at me until I worked myself hoarse. when I finally broke down and stopped, he told me he had no idea what I was talking about, but is very concerned about what I found, I was suspicious of him but a bit reassured that he appeared to be agreeing with me instead of pretending nothing was happening. I've been holed up for all of today, I've never met the landlord, but I do know he exists and that Ben doesn't own the place, could he be the one that was spying on me and I only blamed Ben due to his oddities? Am I being played like a fiddle by Ben and is he a axe murder ready to hide me in the freezer?, I have no clue, but I am shell shocked, I don't know what to do, I don't really have any friends or family members after a incident that happened last year, I feel like I should go to the police but I don't really want to waste their time with something I haven't even confirmed yet. 

What should I do? I really dont feel comfortable living in this apartment, apart from being kinda a weirdo Ben seems cool,  I feel really violated, I dont know if I was actually being spied on, but a hidden camera was present in the room that I was unaware of, and I dont really feel safe here, I currently cant afford to move out, as I just paid this months rent and wont be able to find a place for another whole month, any advice the kind people of reddit could give me would be greatly appreciated, thanks.

It was amazing reconnecting and rekindling our friendship but what came with it was something I would never have expected. My friend introduced me to her other friend and we hit it off. After talking for weeks I began to fall head over heels for this girl I had met. Things were great and the feeling was mutual, at least for a little bit. I expressed my feelings and interests after a while and made it clear that I wanted more than a friendship since we had so much in common and I hadn't felt the way she made me feel ever before in my life. To nobody's surprise, apparently she didn't feel the same but appreciated our friendship so much that she couldn't imagine me not in her life. I have tried for months to cope with this and have tried to make this weird friendship work even though I'll always hold on to the minute glimpse of hope that she changes her mind. I have so much love and appreciation for this person and it oftentimes is not reciprocated in person but often the next day through text. I'm at the point now where I do not want to hurt any feelings but I also do not want to be sad and upset about this every day.

Who would have thought that you‚Äôll love someone like me?

I‚Äôm this forgotten star, this abandoned building, the boy who has fire and storm in his heart. But, the moment you came, you kissed my bruised knees and I felt the gravity pulled me towards a feeling that never existed before.
Love. It is beautiful and reckless. However, we‚Äôre no excuse in this unruly world we live in. The circle of our forever didn‚Äôt last that long as we thought.

Let me be honest for the last time. There are still moments when everything I see reminds me of you. And I feel like the knot of air in my throat expands until it doesn‚Äôt feel like breathing.

Whenever our memories came rushing back at me, I let my mind run wild. Feeling every bit of love I thought was gone. I always wonder if you think about me. I wonder if you‚Äôre happy, happy without me.

I love you.

I have loved you without knowing how or why. I just do.
I remember the first time we talked. There‚Äôs this kind of connection ‚Äî like an old invisible string linked between you and me. Something strong and unbreakable. When I say unbreakable, it means that no matter how we tried to distance ourselves, unfeel each other, the invisible string kept pulling us back together.

However, this is it. I have to say my final goodbye. This is the time I have to confront the heartbreaking reality.

Thank you.

Thank you for loving me. Thank you for showing me a part of you that no else know. And most of all,
Thank you for letting me love you. For making me realize that I can love someone this much. No matter what happen, I will treasure all the memories I have with you. You will always, always be in my heart.

196,"Sorry as this is my first post on reddit. (28m) A few years back I made the decision to distance myself from my best friend group. I made this decision because I felt our lives were going on different directions. They seemed to care more about weed than anything else. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I could always go for some weed but they all were spending $100s if not 1000s a month on the stuff and I saw myself doing the same.

So, one day I told them that I thought we needed to slow down on all the weed and try doing some of the thing we used to when we were younger. They all (except one) seemed to be offended and called me a hypocrite because I smoked too (I never said I wanted to stop smoking, just that I thought I should chill out a little). Almost immediately after this I started to be excluded form the group. This event also coincided with myself finding out I live with anxiety and depression. When I tried telling them about this, they blew me off. I thought to myself maybe I should just distance myself from them. I had and still do have an amazing girlfriend who supports me at all times. So, I thought she could help me with whatever was going on. And I was right. She did exactly that.

This was maybe five years ago and haven‚Äôt heard from them on over four years. I‚Äôm living with my girlfriend and and extremely happy but lately I keep having this nagging feeling of missing this group. I struggle to make friends so I really only have my girlfriend as support but she doesn‚Äôt have all of the same interests I do (For example, she could care less about sports and video games). So, I have no one to talk to about these things and it makes me feel lonely even though I have such an amazing girlfriend who I love so much. Am I crazy for wanting to contact these former friends? Does anyone reading this think I was stupid for distancing myself from them in the first place?

Sorry for the longish post. I just feel so happy and settled in my life but I keep missing the little things I used to do with my friends like playing stupid video games while talking about the NBA (I know very childish) and it feels like I‚Äôll never be able to do this stuff again.

197,How do you deal with feeling like your being taken advantage by your family and being treated less? All my life Ive been the back bone of my family I always took care of my younger siblings was put in the middle of my parents arguments and the list goes on. As I got older anytime they needed something I always called upon if for any reason I wasn‚Äôt available to help I would get back lash and comments about how I‚Äôm so mean and fucked up for not wanting to help my family out. A few years later and it‚Äôs still pretty much the same however I‚Äôve been having a very hard time dealing with it lately due to the fact that my sister is pregnant. My sister is 2 years older has a history of being a compulsive liar and even faked an entire pregnancy 2 years ago my family went all out for baby shower and gifts and so on and we‚Äôre very devastated  when found out it was all a lie especially since my brother and his girlfriend had just had a baby girl the year before but my parents didn‚Äôt weren‚Äôt allowed to much involved and by brothers baby momma pretty much kept the baby away from my family. Fast forward I found out I was pregnant last year I was living in another city and decided to move back so my family could enjoy this pregnancy with me since they hadn‚Äôt had the chance with my niece and after the awful lie my sister created. I made sure everyone was included each step of the way my mom even spoke about how much she wanted to help and be my support system. Through my pregnancy I got a lot of rude comments from my family due to the fact that I would be having a biracial son. My sister even said my son would come out ugly and deformed. Fast forward again I had my son and a couple months later my sister announced she was pregnant. And they‚Äôve treated her like a princess although she kept it hidden from everyone for 6months. It‚Äôs been very hard on me seeing how they pamper her and treat her so much better than they treated me. I don‚Äôt know what to do at this point and how to deal with it. Part of me honestly wants to disconnect from my what I believe maybe a toxic family or maybe I should put my feelings aside?

His smell overtakes every air freshener I use, and I don't know what to do. I feel like if I tell him in any way he'll offended or angry because essentially telling someone they stink causes problems for most people. 

I don't know if it's a culture thing, a hair product, bad personal hygiene, whatever. It smells horrible and I'm losing my mind. My own dad says that I'll just have to suffer through it but my friends say that I should tell him or get an RA.

200,"My boyfriend and broke up 6 months ago. He is Indian, his parents are from India. We broke up because... you guessed it! His parents couldn‚Äôt get over the fact that I wasn‚Äôt Indian. It completely broke my heart. For a long time I had so much pain and anger in my heart, and I still do at times. But we wanted to stay in each other‚Äôs lives and we finally found some peace between us. Well, one night we were hanging out, having a great time like we used to and we had sex and now I‚Äôm pregnant.

Before anyone says anything outrageous, I am on birth control. Have been for 2 years, and I only really got on it for my period. And after we broke up, I stayed on it for that same reason. I‚Äôve since learned HOW this happened... I was taking something that made my birth control less affective and there was absolutely no way I would of ever known before hand that this particular thing affected birth control.. and now here I am. 

When I first saw the test, I cried all night. I kept saying I didn‚Äôt want it and I didn‚Äôt want to do this and I wasn‚Äôt ready. And I meant all those things. He told me I should get an abortion and I said that was against my personal beliefs, and I meant that also. I‚Äôve told him time and time again over the past 2 years that if I ever got pregnant, I wouldn‚Äôt have an abortion unless it posed a health threat. He‚Äôs always said he felt like abortion was murder. Yet, he wants me to have an abortion. 

At first I was actually thinking that‚Äôs what I should do. And he started to feel relieved. But over the past few days, my heart has changed. I feel like I said all those things out of fear, sadness and anger... I told him I was considering keeping it and he said that it would destroy his family and it would be an embarrassment. He told me that his mother has said in the past that if he ever got someone pregnant, she‚Äôd kill herself. He‚Äôs afraid that the shock alone would cause his mother to have another heart attack (she had one 3 years ago brought on by stress). He said he couldn‚Äôt be involved and that he would have to keep it secret and no one in his life could ever know he had a baby. This was soul crushing to hear and I lost all respect for him in that moment. 

So when I started leaning towards abortion again, he said he didn‚Äôt mean those things and he‚Äôd be there for me. When we were together, he always said he‚Äôd be there for me if it ever happened, but I‚Äôm honestly thinking that if I tell him I want to keep it, he‚Äôs going to go back to saying all those things and eventually hate me and abandon me. 

I do wish that I didn‚Äôt find myself in this predicament, but now that I‚Äôm in it, I feel like this is my new life and i need to cherish it. I don‚Äôt want to look at this as a horrible thing. I‚Äôm just scared. This wasn‚Äôt the plan, but I know in my heart I want to keep this baby. But the only reason why I‚Äôm even talking about an abortion is because that‚Äôs what he wants. If he was on board, I wouldn‚Äôt even consider it. As much as I love him and don‚Äôt want to cause issues in his life, it‚Äôs just not a good enough reason to abort my baby. And I know one of the reasons why it would ‚Äúdestroy‚Äù his family is because the baby would be bi-racial, which he doesn‚Äôt care about but his mother would be disgusted apparently.

I‚Äôm so lost, I‚Äôm so confused.. I know what I want in my heart, but I‚Äôm afraid of how this decision will play out. I know an abortion would destroy me and my family. And I couldn‚Äôt give my baby up for adoption.. I just don‚Äôt know what to do and need some advice..",06Oct2019,0

So if a guy like me sees so much in you I guarantee there's a high possibility you can attract someone like me.""

I really wasn't expecting that kind of a response, so I'm a little caught off guard and don't know what to think. I know I have feelings for him though, and that in itself has been very hard for me.

Is he just being nice to me or does he like me? I don't know if I'm reading into it too much.",06Oct2019,0

Also, I am extremely overweight in the mid 300's on top of bad ance as well.

&amp;#x200B;

And honestly, due to my appearance, I get very rude comments and second rate treatment while I am in public and this is the main reason I isolate myself in my mother's house and at this point, she is getting tired of me not taking charge losing weight getting educated further and becoming an independent  man and is heartbroken by my situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I have lost contact with all close friends and family because of my weird awkwardness the way I hide in public and not socialize we were alike in my early ages but I ran into my mental issues and I hid from them because they were rude sometimes and I did turn very awkward so I understand.

&amp;#x200B;

I have all the tools I need to lead myself in the right direction but somehow I just can't put everything together, I know I need to lose weight but when I try it seems that I am doing things the wrong way sometimes I use my elliptical and don't see weight loss at the end of the week and when I lift weights I don't feel like I pushed myself hard enough, and I cant seem to find the right diet even when I make healthy choices I find my self binge  eating at night because I really didn't eat that much during the day and when I eat normal dinner that my mother cooks I think I overindulged but I have lost 3 pounds at the end of the week.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know where to start to get my life going in the right direction my goals are to get down to 230 pounds with lots of strength, to meet new friends and associates that I can actually hang out with and to have a girlfriend wife kids and everything that a decent man should have.

&amp;#x200B;

211,"Anxiety has completely overtaken me, and I have several large assignments and tests to be preparing for and I just haven't been able to concentrate on anything because of this.


I'm a senior in college, I've worked hard to get to this point.  As far as I'm aware, I haven't broken any rules or cheated, but I have been behaving oddly or disrespectful towards my professors as of late.  On Wednesday I had a semi-argument with one of my professors.  On Friday, I went to go apologise, but he wasn't there, and I had prior obligations so I had to go, I emailed him later.  On Saturday he emails me back and says that's bullshit because he was in his office until 7pm... (I was there at noon and I don't knock on his door if it's closed because I feel like I bother him enough) And he said ""we will see you on Monday"" 


We.  So my department, or atleast the figureheads of my department, are going to be having a sit down chat with me.  My grades aren't terrible, but they're not great either.  I know what they're going to say...  But, in all honesty, I don't believe I've done anything wrong.  A student should be allowed to discuss things with their professors.  But they're not going to see it that way, because I know how this works, now, and that I was being too trusting with people I should've been able to trust. 


I'm not sure if I want this post to turn into... That... Kind of post, but... Honestly, I can't handle this.  I don't mean the work, I mean, this.  I can't handle this.  I know that's completely meaningless in text form.  If the worst happens on Monday, which, admittedly is a slim chance, honestly, my life will be over.  And at that point there's not much of a reason not to hang myself. Actually, even now there's not much of a reason.


The funny thing is that are still reasons, it's just that I've been depressed for so long, they no longer matter, and I don't believe myself capable of achieving any of them, anymore.  I've never been able to figure out my life, get my shit straight. I've never been lucky enough to have proper guidance or encouragement. People hate me for all sorts of reasons, and now I am absolutely certain that my professors hate me.  So what's the point.  Even if I'm not expelled, my reputation is will now openly be terrible.  And I wasn't trying to do that myself.  To have that glass shatter on you, to see that *you* might actually be that type of person, someone who people act nicely to your face but actually hate you...  But people don't intentionally do things wrong, for months, like they're trying to ruin things.  I wasn't. Up until this week I thought everything was going great.  That's why whenever people say ""it's all your fault!"" I'm like... Yeah... It is... But, I mean, I was *trying* to fuck up.

213,"I am currently 18 years old and living at home with 5 other family members. My house is not particularly big. 

When I was just starting high school, my teachers encouraged all of us to right a letter to ourselves 4 years into the future, detailing our current situations in life, so that we could see how much we grew since the first day of high school all the way to graduation. These letters were sealed and kept by the staff of our school, and returned to us, still sealed, on our graduation day. 

Now, as I am starting university, I would like to do the same thing once again. I have written and sealed a letter detailing my current situation, goals and aspirations, however, now I do not have staff members to keep it safe for me until I graduate.

Lets assume that he didnt kiss her in innapropiate places, the private areas. Lets assume he only did it in a semi innapropiate area-the stomach. Is that normal behavior? Im not stupid, so im not gonna ask if its okay for a parental figure to kiss your privates while you sleep. Not to be rude. If it is innapropiate, How should I help her?

He already had his liver removed. Someone donated half their liver to him. He was given basically a second chance at life. He stopped for a couple years then resumed drinking daily again.

229,"I am so heartbroken over this and I don't know what to do. This is going to be a long post, but I really can't leave out details. 

&amp;#x200B;

My daughter (4 - will be 5 in February) recently started pre-k. We live in a large city where the public school has 20-30+ kids a class, they don't take students serious enough, and they just don't have overall good results. Last year I took my daughter to an event at the fire station and she did a fingerprint kit, touched some of the tools and trucks, learned about fire safety and had some snacks and little things like that. While there the police and firemen were asking about school (because they have the DARE program) and so small talk lead into them asking if I decided about school since I was new to the area. They themselves explained the issues with the local public schools and said it's amazing how when they go to the other smaller private schools the kids act differently, are better behaved, and just a much better experience. After asking around neighbors, friends, online results, etc. everything they said was completely accurate.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to take this advice after asking others and enrolled her into a private school because even though it's just starting out education is extremely important to me, especially the beginning. The school she goes to she only has 7-10 kids in her class and each class has a teacher and teacher aid. 

&amp;#x200B;

She loves school, she loves to learn, she talks for hours when she comes home about everything she did and how much fun it was. Over the past week or two, I realized she wasn't as excited and happy, and I thought maybe it was just a slow week, maybe some less than interesting stuff compared to other weeks, whatever it may be. Well I picked her up at school, she got to the car and just started crying. (HUGE red flag) so I pull over in a parking lot, get in the back of the car and sit with her and ask her what is going on. Well, she tells me that a kid that sits behind her ""put a booger on her"" So I think for a moment and thought, maybe she means a kid picked his nose, had an accident, something like that... I ask her in more detail to tell me the situation and then she tells me he's blowing snot on his face, letting it run down his lip and wiping his face on her back and laughing about it. In my mind I'm starting to go insane but I keep calm so the conversation can continue. She starts crying more and told me she's upset because it was her favorite shirt. I explain to her that we can fix it and if anything else was happening. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, now she tells me that this boy kicked her in the back and does it when they are sitting on the learning rug (it's their area where they learn about a topic and have assigned seats). I ask her why she didn't tell the teacher and she says because the teacher told him ""you wouldn't act like that at home, why are you doing it here"" and multiple times yelled at this boy. I email the school immediately (the school is on lockdown at all times so you cannot just go into the school, otherwise I would of went back in a heartbeat) A few minutes later I get an email reply instantly explaining how she is so sorry and unaware of everything besides the kicking. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now fast forward a few more days. They moved this boy to a different seating arrangement and a few days go by, she's back to her normal self, laughing and talking all about school. Now fast-forward to tonight. I was working on a project for a Halloween event we are having at the school, and suddenly my daughter gets quiet and won't talk. I ask her what's wrong and she said she ""doesn't want to be laughed at again because it hurts her feelings."" This is very odd because we ALWAYS laugh together. I ask her what she means ""again"" and she said that now this other boy has a friend and they went around the classroom and made fun of my daughters' project on the wall, made fun of her bug building project and then laughed at the pictures she colored. Now she gets upset again (this is so rare that honestly, I don't even know how to react) I go for a little walk with her and tell her to tell me EVERYTHING they kids do and it's all ok and so she sits and tells me ""daddy, I'm just trying to listen and learn from the teacher and I can't get away from them"" My heart shatters into a million pieces. A few minutes go by and then she starts to tell me that not only do the kids do all the things she already told me but they also spit in their mouths and show her, they point and laugh at her and tell jokes to the other kids so they all laugh at her. 

I know I absolutely sound like I'm going too far and that ""kids will be kids"" especially at a time like Pre-k and when they are younger, but I made sure to put her into the private school where the focus can be on the students and they can learn. My wife and I always make sure she has great hygiene (nice hair, teeth brushed, nice clean clothes) healthy snacks, plenty of sleep, tons of physical and emotional support. I was very poor when I was in school, I had a rough time and could never have half the things she has (and I wouldn't change that for the world)  It sounds so odd that I have to say she's being bullied, but when multiple kids are involved, I don't even know what you would call it. We are now past the point of its just one kid being ""bad"".

&amp;#x200B;

My issue is that being a private top-rated school, talking to the teachers, having the meetings. What are my next steps. I know as kids get older they will get better, but how do I make sure that this stops. I don't want to take the approach of ""whatever they do to you, you do it right back"" but I think doing that takes us down a whole different path. If this was a one-off scenario where she did something silly or got embarrassed, I could MAYBE understand. The last thing I need is for her to be scared or nervous to not go to school especially AFTER I saw how her life has changed and she is so happy and positive, I refuse to let this change and I will go through whatever it takes to get this fixed, but I'm not sure what I even ask for at this point. If someone could just tell me if they ever had something like this or even just voice their opinion on the matter it would mean a lot to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I just want to say that outside of these incidents, the school is wonderful and I have zero complaints which makes this much more difficult as opposed to ""just change schools"" or ""move to a different classroom."" I do not think it's fair to impact her and what she knows and has learned because she honestly didn't do anything wrong. Why should she have to move or start over and learn everything again because someone is doing this to her? What kind of message or signal is that going to send? Maybe this is me venting frustration or I'm looking too far into it, but honestly, I don't know what else to say or think right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

231,"Hey all.  I'm on mobile so sorry about formatting. 
 
Im in my 4th year of university, with about another 2 years left. I had a really bad year (mentally) last year so I decided to take things slow for the duration of my studies. Problem is, I've been wanting to leave university to go to a trades college for the past 2 years, and the longer I wait to decide, the worse I feel about it. 
After being coaxed by family into going to university I went into Humanities because I didn't know what I wanted to do. Even though I've learned a lot, I know that I'm not leaving university with the skills necessary to go straight into a specialized field, and it's honestly crushing. If I dropped out right now and took up a 2 year training program for a specialized field, I would pay half of a single year of university tuition, and be ready for employment right out of the gate. 
 
When I first started wondering about why I'm in university and started looking for alternatives, my family was not happy. It didn't matter to them what I studied, as long as I studied at a university and not do trades. I'd understand if they were paying for it I guess, but I'm doing this all on my own and taking out huge loans for it. 
And that's another problem. I have 10's of thousands in loans for a program that I don't think I could get a job with. Hell, I don't even know where to begin looking for jobs with  humanities degree that doesn't require an additional 3 to 4 years of study (masters or specialized training).  
My GPA is also absolutely atrocious. It's gone way downhill since I started wanting to leave, and with my mental health issues that popped up last year it's been exacerbated tremendously (less than 2.0). Only reason I haven't been kicked out of the program is because I still ""pass"" half of my classes each semester. 
 
I guess I'd just like to hear some stranger's point of view on this, someone who can look in and give their opinion without any ties to the situation. I pretty much have 2 weeks to decide since the semester drop date is coming up soon.

After a few songs, we go and get water in the hallway and says,""So, do you wanna exchange contact info?"" Of course I said yes, gave her my number, and became hella happy.

A few more dances later and we're at the last song. I don't know the song and she had only heard it once before, so we both kinda just wave our arms willy nilly as you do. Out of nowhere, she wraps her arm around mine and I gay panic, causing her to pull back and say,""Sorry, I don't know why I did that."" We finish the song, get our stuff, and head out. Before I left, she gave me a hug and said,""Bye, I had fun!"" and her hand kinda lingered on my back for a second. 

Now, here's what I need to know: Is it possible that she might like me? I kinda like her, she's funny, really pretty, knows ASL, seems pretty levelheaded, and kinda awkward, but in an endearing way. Of course, I haven't known her long enough to have a flat out crush on her, but I think I might really like her and that she might like me too, but I'm afraid of misreading platonic liking for romantic.

235," I dont want anything to do with my dad. I appreciate everything he has done for me, but at the same time what he has done to me is completely messed up and I dont ever want to see him again. He is moving out, sometime idk when, and I'll be with my grandma. I blocked my dad on everything and even told him face to face I dont ever want to see talk or even be in the same house as him. But what does he do? Today he did all of my chores, cleaned my room did the dishes did the laundry etc, bought me pajamas and at least 30 bucks worth of snacks. Ok, whatever. He came home tonight and left a board game and my favorite sweets outside of my door. AND A FREAKING 100 DOLLAR NECKLACE. WTF. I dont want his gifts! I've told him that! Hes been buying me crap all month, but it's not going to change anything and he wont realize that! He's done bad things, stuff a father would never think of doing to his daughter,did I mention he never once acknowledged it or even said sorry, and yet he thinks buying me expensive sheet and doing things for me will win me back over!

I explained to her who i was and what the situation was. (Except of the fact i was pregnant) I told her i was worried if anything went beyond texts.

242,"I went through something really unfair this past year. I don‚Äôt want to go into the details but it basically felt to me like the equivalent of someone randomly shooting your dog and then suing you for the bullet. 

For awhile I was really sad, devastated, depressed. I moved back home with my parents and I‚Äôve been doing a lot better. I‚Äôm not depressed anymore, but when I think about it or am reminded of what happened I go into an emotional black hole. I just feel so angry, like fully enraged, and I think about all of these tiny details of it and all of the things I could‚Äôve said and I just dream of justice in a crazy way. 

But I know that the world is just in some ways unfair, and that things like this happen to a lot of people, all the time, and worse things happen, and justice doesn‚Äôt really come. I want to move back to the city where I was living when it happened because I have some career opportunities there but I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll get triggered into focusing on it again when it‚Äôs basically a ship that has sailed.

There is a bit of a silver lining, I learned things, I became stronger and less naive, and I realized how many things I have in my life to be thankful for. But still, when I think about it I crave justice and I know it probably won‚Äôt happen. How can I move on?

244,"my best friend and i have been friends for about 7 years now, we dated briefly for 2 years but that was during our teen years, we are now midway through our undergrad in university. it's safe to say i know pretty much everything about him, as he does with me. we clicked instantly when we first met and we have a strong connection that naturally balances out our differences as individuals.

Around this time last year i began noticing his overall mood and behavior was changing. i get going from high school to college can make you change entirely, but this was a different kind of change. it was a kind of change i became concerned with, specifically for his mental health.


bleh. that's how he describes everything. from his mood, how his day went, how work is, how his class is - everything is bleh.  before, he would say basic things like ""it was alright"" or ""nothing interesting"", but now ""bleh"" is his go to. for everything. even his favorite hobbies like fixing cars or video games. he went from being excited about upcoming game releases to ""I have no one to play with, what's the point in fixing my headset"". granted, this year his old friend group seemingly cut him off cold turkey, so I somewhat understand. 

im studying psychology and nutrition, so i use my knowledge to help him, whether it's with a quick pep talk to boost his overall mood or some tips for his gym regimen. but, as a woman with anxiety due to a disability, I cant say I can help a man with depression-like symptoms. 

I've had best friends with bipolar, schizophrenia, and narcissistic disorder, but those were all medically diagnosed. my best friend hasnt seen a doctor, nor probably can, so i cant say for sure he has depression. I do know he's changed in a negative way - whether it's from a change of environment or something happened - and i want to help as much as possible to avoid him going down a wrong road that can easily be helped. I've seen too many people go down the wrong path because they were neglected.

hes not a materialistic person; I bought him a small keychain for an early bday gift because I couldnt afford anything major atm, but he insisted for me to not buy anything else or at all. so, buying gifts for him ends up stressing him out with the cost (if he manages to find out) or feeling like he owes me something (which he never does, I love spoiling my loved ones regardless).

hes also generally very quiet unless spoken to and kept to himself unless hes with his close friends (me and about 4 other people he considers friends). for example, he'll hang out with guys during class no problem or his coworkers, but with me he'll confide his insecurities, be very talkative, share his interests without feeling judged, and be more open about his feelings at times, compared to his other friends. he's very particular in how he defines his friendships, so I'm curious if there's anything I can do to help in that department? like, what can I do specifically to make him feel more understood and cared for?

I've gone through some major life events (losing house to a fire to becoming disabled, all within the last 3 years) so I myself have been changing as well, but a good change. I know I was never the best person to him, but as i change i know I can be better and help him more than I used to - which wasnt very much. as we grow into adults I want to give more than I get and be more loving, because this world has too much hate already.

so, what is some advice in helping someone who's been slowly becoming less motivated and more depressed as time goes on? I really want to help, but im not that knowledgeable in this department, so i don't want to come off rude or insensitive. anything can help, I need an outside perspective on things so I can learn and improve too.",06Oct2019,1

248,"I have 2 sisters (both younger). I am 19 and my sisters are 18 and 17, they HATE each other, I used to be like them but I made peace with both of them when I was like 14 and they get along and are close with me but not with each other. Its not just arguing but they have full on fights. I usually just break it up and act like a 3rd parent cause my parents don't really know how to deal with them and they are super rebellious except with me, I have no idea why thats the case but they respect me I guess.

This whole situation started at like 10 or 11, I was with the older sister in the kitchen and when the other one woke up and got pissed that we ate the rest of the cereal. I rolled my eyes knowing there was gonna be another fight, I tried to stop it tho by saying that id go to the store and get more and I planned on doing that cause I really didn't want to hear screaming THIS early in the morning. I got ready and they had full on red faces from yelling, at this point my patience is VERY low. I tell them to shut the fuck up and I walked outside to get fast food for the younger sister as a sorry cause I was the one who took the last of cereal. I came home and the kitchen is DESTROYED. I see my older sister on the floor crying and I go to check up on her and wow it happened again she had a somewhat busted lip (it really wasn't that bad, was just a small cut that bled a lot). I went to my younger sister who locked herself in her room. She finally opened up and she had a bite mark on her hand. My patience is at a all time low and I kinda lost it on her I told her to grow up and she needs to stop fighting cause I'm done picking up the mess every time. She got kinda mad at that and told me that maybe I shouldn't have left and this wouldn't have happened. I didn't say anything and just left. I gave them cleaning supplies and made them clean up the kitchen TOGETHER. If they wanna fight and act like 3 year olds I'm gonna treat them like 3 year olds.

The problem came up when they protested working together and I got my phone out and gave them an ultimatum, they either clean the kitchen together or I get the cops involved since they could technically go to jail for assault. (I would never call the cops on them it was just an empty threat and it worked). Once it was over the older one said that wasn't fair for me to trick them like that, and I told her its not fair for me to deal with your guy's fights either.

When my parents got home I told them about their fight and my trick which made them work together. They laughed at it but then they told me I shouldn't use fear and manipulation to make them work together cause I'm not the parent and need to be their peer not their parental figure. I was shocked they said that and just stayed quiet not wanting to argue with them. I almost said ""well maybe if you guys actually parented them to not fight I wouldn't HAVE to trick them."" But I didn't.

I am tired of them sweeping it under the rug and chalking it up to sibling rivalry cause clearly its not. I know that my sisters don't listen to them that often but I think they should step up, how do I tell/show/convince them that their daughters fighting isn't healthy?",06Oct2019,1

253,"I just completed my diploma in computer engineering 4 months ago (diploma in computer engineering in India is a 3 year course which is taken directly after the 10th grade, so upon completion of this course, one is directly admitted into the 2nd year of college). So the aggregate of the last two semesters is considered when you're applying to get into a university. I actually scored pretty decent in the last two semesters (78). But because the AICTE reduced the quota for diploma holders to 10% from 20% and also because I fall into the general category, I knew I wouldn't be able to secure a seat in any good college which is affiliated to the government, I opted for a private university. A couple of my friends study in this university, so I asked them for a review and found it to be a positive one, so I got admitted into this private university. Now, 3 months down the line, I have found myself to be depressed and in a very gloomy situation. 
So basically my situation is that I'm surrounded by people who have scored way less in their entrances than I have in my diploma, these people are goalless, they have no aims whatsoever, they also have multiple backlogs. Being around such people makes me regret my decision of choosing this university. I feel depressed and low.
The professors here, set extremely difficult tests and the checking done is quite harsh too. So I am not able to score good and ace any test. I have managed to pass their tests. But because I'm unable to score, it will affect my CGPA.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I (24m) recently moved out of my parents house. When this happened, my parents used this opportunity to 'import' a high level soccer player (24f) from overseas, to live in my old room and play in my sisters soccer team. She stayed here for about 10 weeks.

Having just moved out, I still spent a lot of time at my parents, to help adjust to the lifestyle change and because it's a closer commute for me to work. During this time, me and the girl spent a lot of time together and really got to know each other. During this time I started to develop feelings, but decided to not express this, due to A) her living with my family and risking making it terribly awkward, and B) Knowing she would be going home in a few weeks.

I was fairly sure that she had some level of feelings for me too, but of course I could be wrong. She is quite shy and awkward just like myself so trying to read/reciprocate definite social ques was very tricky. In the last few weeks before she left, I distanced myself to ease saying goodbye. The day came, said goodbye and off she went.

We chatted a little here and there over text after she went home, but nothing serious. I accepted it was over. However about a week ago she told me she would be coming back next year, (in about 4 months) and would be staying again and playing an entire season. She was excited and I was ecstatic. She has been making plans with me, we have organized a road trip when she gets here, and have been talking non-stop since she told me the news. I'm totally infatuated again.

Now, I want to know if it seems a good idea to tell her how I feel now, because this is consuming me. Its still a long time before she gets here, summer too, the time where I would usually be out being social. However being this infatuated is consuming me, I don't really want to go anywhere or do anything other than talk to this girl, and I'm constantly fretting about whether she feels the same or not. Totally not healthy on my part.

So I figure, I tell her how I feel and it either goes well and I can stop stressing and over analyzing every detail of our conversations, or it goes badly, I feel shit for a bit. Get over it, and move on and enjoy my summer.

Would love any advice. My friends around me just continuously say ""just do it, just do it' etc, 'shes obviously into you' and its not helping at all in deciding whether this is a good decision or not.

Happy to give any other details.

The situation is that I received an early scholarship for the closest uni to me (it based on academic merit and being a rural student, I didn‚Äôt know anything about it until I received it). Until now my plan was to just attend this uni because it seemed easier. Applying for this uni is also free and I did so months ago.


I recently went on a trip where I spent time at another uni though and I feel like I would much rather go there. I also feel like this uni has so many better opportunities including better facilities, opportunities to earn some money on campus if I do well, availability of paid internships and a greater range of majors and minors to choose from in my area of interest (in the area of biology). The thing is I may not receive a scholarship at all for this university, it is a bit harder to get into and application fees are about $200. I should also note accommodation for this uni is guaranteed, for the other one it isn‚Äôt and I may not find out for a long time.

What should i do?

Hello reddit,
It's my first time posting anything and I hope the formatting isn't too weird, but I really need advice. Also, just a warning that this is very long and at times can be a bit confusing cause I'm writing this late at night. I need advice on what to do with my current situation in highschool and my emotional well being. Throughout elementary and middle school I had these two friends, who we'll call Sandra and kelly. The mutual friends in this story are Rachel and Jess.

So throughout elementary school me, Rachel, Sandra, and Kelly were in the same friend group and knew each other, we would all make eachother laugh and it was all around a great time. I got really close with Kelly and we were really similar in how we acted in our behavior and such. It's also important to mention that I did not hang out ¬†with them for the entirety of elementary school. On one occasion I felt that I was being left out of the conversations in the group so I decided to mingle in a different friend group and got a new best friend. In that group I decided that, once again, I was being left out and chose to join Kelly's group again. At first it was awkward but then everything went back to normal and we all had a terrific time. Sandra, Kelly, and Rachel all and me got really close. Elementary ended and everything went smoothly. The real problems arose during middle school. In the first semester of middle school we all had fun and Rachel ended up leaving our school. After Rachel left I grew increasingly closer to Sandra and everything was going fine, that's what I thought. I ¬†realized that both Sandra and Kelly were moving towards another group and I didn't know what to do because I was too socially inept to keep up. I worried too much about grades and would get upset at myself and at times visibly upset and down. No one seemed to care or notice and when Kelly would get down I would make sure she was okay. But things seemed to turn on me. Sometimes when I would try to get Sandra's attention by tapping on her shoulder she would flip out at me, she would give me a disgusted look and yell at me. This scared me and made me feel like I did something wrong. Things continued and i soon found myself kind of isolated and I got down on myself more and more. I would complain and Kelly would sometimes agree and complain with me. As she would tend to be visibly depressed too, we both had the tendency to get depressed about things like grades.The first summer of middle school rolls around and I try to meet up with all of them, both Sandra and Kelly woulf never make an effort to actually meet up with me, and during the whole school year they would never text me after school or invite me out to places. I soon found out, through instagram that they had gone to the zoo without me and I felt so betrayed after putting in all that effort to finally hang out with them. I talked to Sandra about it and she said that kelly told her that she hated me. My heart broke in two pieces, because for 5+ years I had known Kelly and we were so close. I asked Kelly if it was true and she said it wasn't, but I couldn't believe her. 8th grade starts and everything seems normal but I start noticing that they've become distant and no longer acknowledge me when I'm at the lunch tables. I ask Sandra why she's been ignoring me and she says that she'll try to not ignore me from that point forward. We end up going on a school trip and both Kelly and Sandra are ignoring me and are too busy with their other friends. I try my best to include myself but nothing I do works. At the end of the trip after having an emotional night of people from our grade sharing things they've learned to overcome I try to ask them what's up and if they still want to be friends. I told them both that I was hurt that they'd ignore me and I broke down crying. Kelly started crying too after I said I felt like something was wrong with me. Sandra lashed out and said ""I hurt you? I always end up hurting people"" and walked away. Me and Kelly cried together some more and then on our way back we sat next to each other and continued to talk like we used to. On the days back we didn't talk to Sandra, but one day when I was absent from school they made up. When I got back they were already integrated into a group with many people. I tried to fit in and I would do nice things for Kelly, like get her lunchbox that I saw in the lost and found and give it to her. When I gave Kelly her lunchbox back she sounded annoyed at me and said ""oh, I was going to get it during lunch"", not a single thank you. I was done with being treated poorly and met another girl who would be the main person I hung out with for the rest of eighth grade. I explained the whole situation to her and vented. I felt so frustrated and asked so many people about advice on how to handle the situation, but no one had an answer. I was on my own. I ended up talking to an authority figure about it and they brought in Sandra to talk about what happened she said that ""we grew apart"". I asked Kelly one last time at the end of the semester if she wanted to still be friends she didn't have an answer, all she said was that whenever we would talk all I could talk about how my grades were dropping and how upset I was. She was hesitant to be friends with me again. I cried a lot during this whole disaster. I talked to Rachel about the situation too, when she was in a different school, and I asked her if she was still friends with them. I was worried that if Rachel came back to our school that she would be best friends with Sandra and Kelly and forget about me/ignore me. I had Kelly and Sandra in several of my classes and it was painful to see them everyday talk to each other and pretend I don't exist. Rachel said she could be friends with whoever she wants and I understand but I can't help but feel betrayed because they hurt me so much. Highschool begins Rachel is back in our school. She starts asking me if she should go up to Sandra and Kelly and say hello, while I'm still not on good terms with them. I feel stuck in the middle and lost. I tried to work things out but I messed everything up with Sandra and Kelly. I have Sandra in one of my classes and we have a lot of mutual friends but I'm not allowed to make them choose sides, cause then they'd want nothing to do with me too. So for a long time I've been caught in this cycle. I've found new friends of course, but it's difficult because all of them are really good friends with my old ones and I feel stuck in a vicious cycle of trusting my new friends but feeling betrayed because they're friends with my old ones. 


Another thing I need advice on:

During the same school field trip I found out one of my classmates was my neighbor and I told my other neighbor who goes to my school and we all bonded and have become a tight knit little friend group of our own. Not really hanging out during school but more of hanging out on the weekends and whenever we have time. I told both of my neighbors about what happened and they were both very understanding. Abby took my side, but doesn't express it openly in front of others. Jess is close friends with my ex friends and says that she can be friends with whoever she wants, and does not want to choose sides, just like rachel. She also found out another reason why Sandra didn't want to be friends with me, apparently at one time or another she said I have her a nasty look for no reason and that I would complain about my grades goo much. I understand that Jess doesn't want to create bad blood between her and my ex friends because she wasn't wronged by them, but it still kinda stings. Me and Jess grew really close but it was kinda weird cause we would hang out and she would say negative things about Sandra but in class she would tall to her and act like she was the best person on earth. We had an argument about it because I thought she was being two -faced. We made up and we got closer and closer and she soon invited me on a trip with her family. I enjoyed the trip and we had the best time together, posting our adventure on social media. Sometimes I would mention how much I was hurt by my ex friends and she would try to comfort me. Everything was okay until recently when I got back into old habits and started to miss school again. Jess would text me and ask me where I was and I continued to miss school and pretty soon I could tell she was done with me. She said I could do whatever the hell I wanted with my life. I started to clean up my act and started going to school more, i hung out with her that weekend and everything was good. She invited me to one of her sports games today and I wasn't able to make it and when I checked her social media page I saw that she deleted the one picture of me and her off of her page. I asked her if she was mad and me and she said no and I asked her why she deleted the picture and she said that she thought it wasn't a big deal. She's obviously upset with me, I was planning to bring her candy and a card to make up for not being able to make it but it seems like she's done being friends with me, just like Sandra and Kelly. At this point I've been so hurt and damaged by everyone I just feel like i'm starting to go in a downward spiral. My grades have dropped, I look at myself in the mirror way too often, and I feel so down about myself. I have new friends but I don't feel genuinely happy and I don't know why. I try my best to move on but I'm reminded everyday of my situation when i see Sandra and Kelly. Dear reddit, what should I do?",06Oct2019,1

It started when I used an emoji on one of her pic she sent me and she asked who I think was the hottest then cont. asking specifics like why I think she look hot like face, hair, leg, etc. She follow by sending more pic and many times say she accidentally sent something which I saw before she removed was pic of her nudes. I was like wtf. She kept asking me why and then apoligize the next morning that she had drank too much wine. But still asked again. I got her to give me a number which I asked to text me after i called her(didnt pick up, says didn't want her husband to know). I called few times to see if its not a fake but she would not answer but only text. After telling her appropriate features that made her look hot and etc. she saids that she has cellulite hidden and she would show me a pic if I would like but to keep it on the dl. I just acted cool and gave her a thumbs up and she proceeds to send that then after a bit sent pic of her ass and if I like to eat them. I even asked her to hold a fork in her right hand and spoon in her left hand and she said ""r u serious"" so i asked her to show a peace sign. after about 15 min, she sent one.

274," My parents decided it'd be good to do some contract work with their landlord. They'd look at his properties, inspect them, and repair them. All of this was done at a much cheaper price than getting more professional workers like a plumber or an electrician (which is what a lot of the properties required frankly). My parents are on SSI, and they often have less than enough money to survive (I live with them, and I can't get a job yet either due to some clerical errors on my birth certificate that I am in the middle of fixing). They also have experience in construction working. He seemed like a nice guy in all, but there was something off. For one, he'd always gravitate towards my parents and would say that he only gets rent from us. Second, he made suspicious deals with us (Ex: he'd offer to lower rent if we worked for him, he offered a lawnmower, and a car). My parents accepted all of these things. The lawnmower is paid for, but the car is not.   
Well, it turns out the car barely works, and the debt my parents are in is not changing whatsoever. You see, the debt from their work is being increased because we can't pay the electric bill. My landlord decided to let them use the money they pay for rent for the electric bill, putting them into more debt. Our electric bill is simply too high to pay (my parents only make $1100 a month, and it's in a $700 a month rental home, and the rest goes to other bills). Our landlord makes deals with cars on the regular (he sold a car for 400k recently). He knows his shit about cars, but not about ours. To top it all off, my parents spend way too much money on marijuana (they have bipolar disorder that needs antipsychotics and tranquilizers as medication, which we can't afford).

279,"It started early in the year. I was unpopular as hell in middle school, always getting nitpicked for dumb trivial things I did. However, high school was a whole new ballpark. I'm in 9th grade now, so is everyone else involved. It started in Biology class. I felt for the first time, popular. Accepted. Celebrated with my presence in room 1244. They would say my name and give a cheer when I entered the biology classroom. I felt popular, polar opposite of middle school.

And then one day, after about a week of it happening, it all just sort of happened. I declared myself a god, and nobody objected. I limited myself to only the biology classroom though, not all of my classes, the entire grade, or the entire school of +1000 teens, just the one Biology classroom. And then shortly after I stopped being celebrated. It moved on to another boy named Caden. Caden had his own theme when he entered the room now, not me. They would say his name, not mine. I got jealous of him, and envious that I was no longer popular, and declared Caden the new god. And then for a week or two half the class called him ""God"" and not Caden. Well, then Andrew joined the cult because he was Caden's friend, I said that Caden was being a cruel and wrathful god, then Andrew became god,then Caden and Andrew recruited a girl named Macy. A few days go by and Macy is now god - this was beyond my control at this point (and it's been established that I am the true creator but god can change). Because she was the first female god, our small cult was debating on if she were to be called ""God"" or ""Goddess"" becaushe she was a girl. Macy declared she had a penis for some reason and demanded to be called ""Hot stuff"" so now people just call her that.

I'm wondering what the next step I should take is. We're now discussing who we should recruit into the religion cult thing next, and possibly expanding into other classrooms instead of just Biology. As the true creator, I can technically fire a god and reclaim power if they're being cruel, unjustifiably wrathful, or break their own rules since I started this whole thing by randomly declaring myself a god when well received back in September. What do I do next? Should we expand and recruit more people in our joke cult thing, creating a new god possibly, new demigods, angels, and possibly expanding into a hell kind of thing too? Or should I just use my power to abandon it, say it was a good joke that lasted about a month and call it quits.

I wont allow anything actually bad to happen, I think I just invented a new way for me to make friends through this cult thing, but should I actually expand it and carry the joke on or just disband the whole thing?",06Oct2019,0

I was adopted by all my friends in seventh grade and never really had to make any new ones since. There are these two girls who are both friends with each other.

293," 

Hey guys, this is going to be a long read but something that I desperately need advice on. To anyone that reads this and comments, thank you.

I have a close-knit inner circle of friends. These are my best friends and the only people in the world I truly count on. We're all 16/F, with the exception of 15/M. and there's 6 of us including myself. We've all been friends for various amounts of time, but solid for at least six years. Throughout these six years, there's been one common person we've wanted to cut off; we're going to call her AB. From EARLY elementary school AB has been a problem. She was always hyper-aggressive, falling into the bully role quite easily. As little kids we didn't want to be friends with her, but she'd resort to extreme ways of getting our attention, and if not ours... then a teachers attention and approval. AB never made friends outside of our inner circle as she was generally an unlikeable person to be around. This stigma clung onto us as we're deep into our teenage-hood now. AB is overall obnoxious and intimidating. She starts verbal arguments with people and is horribly rude to other students she doesn't know. She's very opinionated and starts fights with anyone who doesn't believe the same things she does. She's dramatic as all hell and it's caused more harm than good. Her general lack of respect for most people in life is nauseating and overall she's just irritating to be around. AB has clung herself onto me in a horribly toxic kind of way. She bounces between being infatuated with me- holding my hand, wanting to be around me, only posting pictures of her and I, becoming very possessive over me and absolutely hating my guts. AB has treated me horribly in the past, going to the extent of flirting with my boyfriend behind my back (and eventually dating him), criticizing me about my body, discluding me from parties she hosts, etc. She is generally insensitive to everyone's feelings- she makes CONSTANT jokes about how I don't have a dad, makes fun of one of my friends for coming from a low-income household, etc. AB lives a very privileged life (father makes 6 figure salary, fancy vacations, her parents are both still married and in love.) but it has NEVER been enough for her. She feels the need to excessively force her """"issues"""" that are UNDIAGNOSED down our throats, such as her ""depression, anxiety, and body dysmorphia."" Despite some of our friends having diagnosed issues that are generally chaotic and interfering with their lives, AB makes sure her problems shine in the spotlight, going to the extent to discuss ""plans"" of the sort with us. In conclusion, she's a horrible... horrible friend.

Eventually, as a group, we decided we had enough.

So we stopped inviting her places.

As a group, we hang out a lot, and that means almost every weekend. During the summer my close friends and I hung out 24/7. We posted pictures and we had fun, generally disregarding the weight of her wrath. We were all so fed up with a school year of criticism and restrictions from AB... we needed a break! AB started drama then, but nothing could've prepared us for the drama of the school year.

We've been hanging out 24/7 lately without AB, and she's causing HELLA melodrama. She complained to us how we didn't like her and didn't hang out with her, how she was so depressed this summer, how she gained 20 lbs, how everyone hates her, etc. This girl can't keep her business off social media, posting about how she needs friends who want to hang out with her and how she's contacting KHP. She constantly posts about how fed up she is and it's wild.

This can't carry on much longer- something has got to give. Cutting off AB directly is too hard because she has no friends outside of us. If we all cut her off, she'd have nowhere to sit at lunch, nobody to socialize with, and I do feel for her... but she hasn't tried. She hasn't been nice to people or even neutral. She hasn't made other friends in school outside of each other like we have. I'm worried for her, but I don't know how many other signs we can give her. Reddit, I need help and I need help fast. What the hell do we do with AB!?!?!?

TLDR; Toxic friend of 6 years won't take the hint that we want to stop being friends with her, even though we purposely exclude her and aren't overly friendly. Feeling trapped in this friendship because said friend, AB, doesn't have any other friends outside of us. Leaving her would mean she sits alone at school and does everything alone, etc. Every time we've tried to cut her off it's backfired. Her drama is hitting public social media now and it's stressing us out... REDDIT- WHAT DO I DOOOO!!??!?",06Oct2019,3

298,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm in a bit of a situation and I don‚Äôt see how I can get out of it.

I‚Äôm 35 and in 2017 after a long post-divorce depression I had a mental breakdown. During that period, I dropped my job and tried to do my own stuff but it failed and I ended up in a strong suicidal crisis.

Somehow, I managed to get up but this whole situation made me reassess my values. Throughout my recovery I found comfort in music which was my passion for almost 20 years but I never considered it more than a hobby. But at that time, I decided to give it a try. 

So, I spent all my money and sold everything to stay afloat to work on my project. Still, it wasn‚Äôt enough to finish it and I started a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter. But I can‚Äôt get any traction with it. I even prepared one of the songs to use it as a showcase of what to come.

I don‚Äôt have any fans or followers as I never thought of music as a career, so I never really shared my music. The campaign has 19 days to go and I don‚Äôt have any ideas how to make it successful.   

Advertising and commercial promotions didn‚Äôt work in my experience. Spamming links and inviting to support usually forbidden or not welcome. Music labels often asks for a fan base which I don‚Äôt have. And music is art and not a start-up, so it‚Äôs unlikely I can find an investor as it is too venture.

So, what can I do to solve my situation? What‚Äôs the best I can do in my position?

299,"I cram everything I do.

I can't do something seriously unless it's needed immediately. This results with me not doing the best in anything I do.

I am aware of my problem regarding this matter yet I can't seem to make myself do anything about it.

I'm currently in fourth year high school, and I still have papers to do and finals to study for in the next few days. I haven't started at all for any of these, and the paper I'm supposed to do is due in 6 hours and 30 minutes. Instead of doing the paper, here I am, procrastinating, on Reddit, asking for advice rather than trying to solve my problems.

I've browsed the internet for solutions, but these answers don't seem to offer any help to me in my current state.

If I try setting a schedule, I most likely won't follow it, making the whole schedule useless.

Starting with small things such as chores doesn't work for me. I find these different from studying and doing work.

Looking at the things I do each day doesn't affect me. I know the things I'm doing wrong, I just can't push myself to correct it.

Motivating myself is something I can't do, I don't have anything to motivate me with (or at least I think so).

Meditating won't work because I don't take it seriously, and I can't take it seriously.

Looking at these statements that I made, it seems that I am an extremely lazy and unmotivated person, and I don't know why I'm like that. I guess I prefer enjoying right away rather than working first and enjoying later.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm afraid this will be me for years to come, so here I am on Reddit, asking for any advice.

Is there anything I can do to help improve my study habits and mindset? 

If I can't do solve that problem right away, how can I cram studying and cram a paper efficiently?

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice will be appreciated. Thanks!",06Oct2019,2

This is my first year at college, I‚Äôm a freshmen at Temple and so far it‚Äôs been pretty rough. I‚Äôm having trouble finding new friends and I often don‚Äôt feel comfortable around strangers which is basically everyone here. 

I‚Äôm in a suite so I have 3 roommates and we‚Äôre split into 2 bedrooms. They are hardcore partiers and constantly have parties in our dorm. I‚Äôm a nerd but I don‚Äôt really care and I used to join in but recently I stopped drinking for reasons I‚Äôll explain later. I‚Äôll call the one in my bedroom Chad, and the other two Brad and Chet. I feel so distant from them and there‚Äôs two guys on our floor that they hang out with more than me. I try to get along with them but we just have nothing in common and it‚Äôs hard talking to them when all they talk about is sports and parties that I didn‚Äôt go to. I always ask them to take me out to the parties, but they keep making pretty bs excuses to go without me.

To top it all off, my parents separated a week after I moved out so home is kinda hell right now. My parents constantly fight for time with me and shower me with gifts in an attempt to get me to want to stay at their place when I come home. I thought alternating between where I stay but still seeing both of them when I come home was enough. But they make me feel guilty no matter who I choose and my poor little brother is stuck in the middle of it. 

On top of that, I‚Äôm struggling with a lot of mental health problems. The last few times I smoked weed, I‚Äôve tweaked incredibly badly and had these awful epiphanies about my life. This lead up to the the last time I smoked, Monday night, when for the first time ever, I wanted to end my life. That was incredibly scary for me so I stopped smoking but the effects of the things I thought of still linger. The last time I drank I become incredibly depressed but not as bad as when I smoked. I‚Äôve been in a depressive episode for about a week now. Basically, I‚Äôm pretty miserable and I have nowhere and no one to ‚Äúretreat‚Äù to so I‚Äôm in a constant state of feeling uncomfortable and disgusted with myself.

Now that you know my life situation, back to my roommates. I do my best to be a considerate roommate to Chad. I always keep clean, whenever he has a girl over, I get out and let them do their thing and I also let them use my speaker, my juul and my mini fridge. He doesn‚Äôt do the same for me, he‚Äôs always messy and the one time I brought a girl back, he didn‚Äôt get the message and the girl felt awkward and just went home and I never saw her again.

He‚Äôs done some really shitty things to me as well. He had girls sleep in his bed one night so he slept in mine so I had to sleep on the floor. He‚Äôs had sex while I was in the room and the next night he kicked me out at 2 AM to fuck the same girl again. He‚Äôs also said he has no respect for her which is pretty fucked IMO.

Whenever they have a party I come over and try to play but with most 4 player games like beer pong and corners, they exclude me. My roommates have been passing around a juul and I asked Brad for a hit, and he said that I needed Ben‚Äôs permission. Fair enough, but today I found out that IT‚ÄôS MY JUUL. 

A few weeks ago, we were having a party in our dorm playing a drinking game called Kings. Basically, you draw cards and each card does something different. My turn, I draw a 9 which is Rhyme. Basically, since I drew the card, I say a word and we go around in a circle saying something that rhymes with it and if you slip, you drink. Now what follows is probably my biggest regret at college so far and I don‚Äôt blame you if you judge me for it. It isn‚Äôt an excuse but I was drunk as well. We had our new friend over who was black so I said ‚Äúbigger‚Äù trying to see if someone would actually say it. Chad goes next and he immediately said it. Our friend called him out for it, the whole vibe of the party was killed and he was so uncomfortable he left. I immediately realized what I did and apologized to both of them and they all said it wasn‚Äôt my fault and that Chad chose to say it. But afterwards, they are talking about making a new rule about doing exactly what I did and if anybody does it, they‚Äôll beat the shit out of them.

Now we come to tonight which was my boiling point. It was 10 PM something and I was doing homework and I wanted to go to bed early. Of course they‚Äôre having a party in the other room but I don‚Äôt mind as long as they don‚Äôt come in my room. I decided to take a shower before I went to bed but when I opened the door to the common area, Chad and a guy I never saw before both had boxing gloves on and were ready to fight. Chad clocked him with one punch directly to the nose and the dude fell down. He got up and ran to bathroom leaving a trail of blood. Apparently it was a part of some drinking game but I‚Äôm not sure. Well, he‚Äôs bleeding in the bathroom that I need to get into so I‚Äôm pretty pissed, the Chad goes in to check on him. Brad got a Snapchat from Chad and the bathroom looked like a murder scene. The toilet was covered in blood. Since I was the only sober one there, of course I was the one who had to clean it up. So I put on gloves and got my cleaning stuff and cleaned up the blood trail quickly and waited for them to get out so I could clean the bathroom. They kept opening the door every few minutes and I assume Chad was cleaning the other dude up. 30 minutes pass, and finally Chad walks out. I go in but the other dude is still there. He starts talking about he‚Äôs fine if I pee in front of him then he grabs my head and kisses me. I‚Äôm uncomfortable so I step out and Chad goes back in and they lock the door. I didn‚Äôt know what he was doing but they were in there for 10 minutes so I had to wait even longer. Turns out they were TAKING SHOTS and the blood got a solid 40 minutes to start to dry. I spent the next 30-45 minutes cleaning all the blood up. It was everywhere including behind and under the toilet. While I was doing this, the only thing Chad said to me was ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have to do this‚Äù which was just wrong since I was the only one capable of doing it and I needed the bathroom. Then he left and took the other dude home. 

Anyways, after I‚Äôm finally done, I take a shower and lay in bed ranting to my high school friends that are hours away from me over text. Chad comes back and all he says is ‚Äúhey dude‚Äù, grabs his cologne then walks out. To be fair, Brad was pretty grateful and I think Chet was too but he didn‚Äôt express it. But I still felt so taken advantage of but it didn‚Äôt end there. 

Fast forward 30 minutes, all my roommates went out to parties which I asked to go to with them to earlier and they said no. A girl knocks on  the door in tears who‚Äôs ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with Chet and she‚Äôs bawling. I have no idea why they say they‚Äôre friends because all Chet does is complain about her. I let her in then she went into Chet‚Äôs room to find he was gone. She‚Äôs super drunk and sits on his bed and I just wanted to sleep at that point. But she‚Äôs a sweet girl so I decided to console her. She told me her story about her mental illness, how her boyfriend took his life and how she was recently raped. On top of that, her hand is fucked up because she punched a wall so I got her an ice pack. I heard her story trying to be as careful as possible for what I say. I think I said the right things because she calls me sweet and thanks me. She tells me that Chet doesn‚Äôt believe her rape story which, you can have your doubts about accusations and stuff, but that‚Äôs not something you say to them. Chet comes home and is livid. He‚Äôs pissed that this girl‚Äôs in his bed and that I let her in. He says that he just wants to go to sleep and doesn‚Äôt want to deal with this shit. Now if I wasn‚Äôt such a coward, I would‚Äôve clapped back harder than any man had ever clapped back before. But of course, I sit there, let him yell at me then she went home and I went back to my room.  

Now I‚Äôm sitting here totally alone on a Saturday night in college. I feel like screaming, crying and throwing up at the same time. I‚Äôm just so lonely and I feel so neglected here.

My high school friends recommend that I move out immediately. But the thing is, whenever I ask my roommates if they like me, they act like I‚Äôm crazy and ‚Äúof course they like me‚Äù. They even gave me a nickname. They seem so genuine about it  and I honestly believe that they do like me. I‚Äôd be willing to pick up the pieces and try to make this work. But all I know is that things can‚Äôt stay this way for my own sake.

Thank you for reading this giant story, it means a lot to me. I just wish I could actually tell this story instead of typing it.

TLDR; Party life and inconsiderate roommates has brought me to my limit and I‚Äôm miserable. But they seem like nice dudes if we can get past the things they‚Äôre doing.",06Oct2019,28

I fell out with this person a couple weeks ago to the point where they have blocked me from communicating with them on everything so I can't tell them to stop. I've blocked the account on here that they use but I know they have other accounts that I don't know the username. 

They don't ever comment on any of my posts but I know they are. I got banned from a subreddit (not going to say what one) because I posted something on there and they reported me. The next day I get a message from someone I know saying that they were the one who got me banned so that's proof that they are stalking me. 
Then a couple days ago I was talking with a friend and then out of the blue, they ask me if I had posted something similar that got me banned on a different subreddit. The thing is that I had. So I deleted the post because I knew the stalker had seen it. I was testing them to see if they were continuing to stalk me.

I know the easy solution is to create a new account they don't know the username of but that means losing my karma and certain subreddits require you to have a certain amount of karma. 
I have no way to talk to them as they've blocked me on everything. I've tried sending an email to them in the past but they probably didn't read it.

So I've been getting bullied for 6 or so months now and I've had enough of it. I'm the typical shy kid at school so I guess that's why I got targeted. I had just gotten out of a long-term relationship when I started to be bullied so I didn't really clock onto what it was for a couple of weeks because I had other things on my mind. Ever since then, I've really dreaded coming into school and even started skipping lessons. Because of these ass-holes, I've developed anxiety and am afraid to leave my house.

I don't want to tell any teachers or parents because I don't want to seem weak and the teacher I did tell didn't take it seriously.

327,"So let me start out with some base information to give some background. 

I currently work in japan and I enjoy it, but I‚Äôve come to realize that I just don‚Äôt want to live here. This isn‚Äôt a problem as I‚Äôm just on a work contract so I get to just enjoy my time here and then go home when it  is done.  

My biggest problem is that I enjoy learning languages and being able to learn Japanese has been the best and most rewarding experience I‚Äôve had. So I almost feel like I‚Äôm betraying my skill set to leave. I‚Äôve thought to myself that I‚Äôll just start learning another language when I go home, but honestly I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs a language besides Spanish that I‚Äôd ever get to use in real life. I‚Äôve already got some decent working knowledge of Spanish, but I just don‚Äôt feel the passion for it (the phonetics and speed are just very difficult for me as well as the myriad conjugations) I‚Äôve thought that maybe I just need to hop into another Romance language to find that ‚Äúspark‚Äù again, but then I feel like I‚Äôd never use it in the foreseeable future. (particularly, I was considering French or Italian due to the phonetics being a bit more approachable for me).

Part II of my problem is that I feel like my job prospects are limited (I know everyone probably thinks this) and I think I‚Äôm scared of the future. To top off the future worries, I feel like when I go back home I‚Äôll have to live in my college town again with my partner who I‚Äôm pretty sure never intends to leave. It‚Äôs not a bad place but I just don‚Äôt see a reason to stay if I‚Äôm not working a livable wage job at the university or something similar.
 
I‚Äôm thinking I may go back to school, but honestly my debt is already outrageous so I don‚Äôt see a viable way to go back. If anyone has any advise for people like me who want to travel and learn, that would be appreciated. I‚Äôve thought about maybe trying to find a job in the military of some sort or with a charity, but I really just don‚Äôt know where to start

TLDR: my passion for what I enjoy is dying and I feel like I‚Äôm headed for a rut. I‚Äôm just looking for tips from people that have maybe been in similar situations.

If you have any language suggestions I‚Äôd love to hear those too. Honestly I‚Äôd love to experience learning a language again, I just haven‚Äôt found the one yet. 

Also apologies if this seems a bit cluttered and hard to read. I‚Äôm just kind of spilling out my thoughts. Thanks in advance for any replies and advice!",06Oct2019,3

330,"I was boxed into a tight street parking space, going to back out and called to a women smoking close by if she could help us back out. She approached the car, and told me I had bumped the car behind me. I immediately put my car in park, and jumped out to see if it was true, since I hadn‚Äôt felt anything. I asked her to use a flashlight to check the license plate of the car, and she said the cover was dented, which we pointed out was flared because there were no screws in the bottom. We asked her to take a picture, and get her information so I could leave mine on the car (since she was supposedly a witness). She said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre fine, you‚Äôre fine‚Äù.

331,"Kinda looking at advice on my situations which in short i havent made a real friend in 10 years (i am 22) and at this point i am not sure how to. Most of my friends i had were friends of friends but over the years i split due to interest and of course the moving from secondary school to university played a big role.

I was alway told how good uni was and most people find some of their best friends there or at least find a good group of friends. Well i learnt through uni i can't seem to make friends alone. I ended up turning to online gaming as my safe space and i have met a ton of people some i would almost consider a friend.

Before i go on i am quite fine in a social enviroment and i am not that sterotype anti social gamer. I have become anti social in terms of getting bored going to events with people i knew way back when and hardly talk to them but i am able to go to a house party for example and have a good time and never have a negative effect.

But yeah as i was saying i dont count my online friends as real friends cause i am always jelious of their lives and their social groups. Along with that i seem to always be questioning if they are really a friend or just feel sorry for me.

I do have a loving family and its large but even since i went to uni i feel less connected and even now abroad on holiday with my family i feel lonely and in need of help.

How do i go meet new people? I am not a upfront able to talk to strangers person but if someone came to me i ll happily hold a convisation and have a good time. I honestly am just completly lost in finding friends and not sure what to do.

Any advice is welcome thanks in advance.

332,"I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for this, but I would like some advice on how to approach this.   


So I (22F) went home (to my parents' house) for a long weekend with a friend (22F). My parents were on holiday overseas, so we had the house to ourselves. My cousin (25M) is in the Navy and occasionally comes to stay at my parents' house to feed the dogs and water the plants. He was coming to stay they day after we were due to leave. 

The whole weekend my friend and I slept in my room in my bed. We didn't have anyone over because none of my usual friends had come ""home for the holidays"". On one of the days I let the dogs upstairs (which I'm not allowed to do) and I lost sight of one of them for a while, but eventually she came back. No big deal, but this will make sense later. 

My friend and I went out on our last night, and then I spent the whole of the next morning cleaning the house before we left, while my friend spent the morning bent over the toilet, hungover. I thought I did a pretty good job of cleaning, and was satisfied when we left. Apparently not, because the next day my cousin called me while at work, just to yell at me about what a state the house was in (I forgot to push in the kitchen chairs, and wipe one of the tables. Wow). So because of this ""state"" I had left the house in, he decided to go to every room in the house and check if everything was up to is Navy standards. He ended up finding a used condom, tied with a knot, in the middle of the study floor (upstairs). We didn't even go into the study. He sent me a photo obviously disgusted. I insisted it wasn't us, we didn't go into the study once, we had no one over, and we both have boyfriends who didn't even come with on this trip. He claimed to believe me. 

My parents usually have  lot of people staying in the house over Christmas so I am 99% sure I know what happened. A couple, staying on the sleeper couch in the study decided to hide their condom rather than throw it in the common dustibin for everyone to see, and they forgot about it. When I let the dogs upstairs, and when of them went misisng for a while, she must have smelt it and bought it out of it's hiding spot . 

Since then, my cousin has called my brother and told him about it, and he called my mom and was laughing and hinting about ""what I did"" at the house, so now she's obviously suspicious. What should I do about this? It literally wasn't us and now everyone thinks it was and no one is saying anything to my face about it.",06Oct2019,1

335,"So bit of background. This is a job that sounded like a good next step for me. However upon applying I had to do a timed test involving HTML/CSS/JS, which confused me as the job spec didn‚Äôt ask for this. I had some prior exp. in HTML and CSS in my previous job. I failed the JS test and most of the HTML test. I did fine on the CSS one. I got invited for an interview and subsequently got the job.

Before I accepted I asked my new employer how much coding was required, again because the job spec didn‚Äôt mention this at all. He said it‚Äôs mostly very basic and it can be 20%-50% of the time.

I have 2 managers. The guy who interviewed me, the chillest dude I‚Äôve ever met, who is my boss and helps a ton when stuck, and the team manager who is also really nice, but she does ask you to google most things when asking for help. 

I had 2 jobs to do. One of them was to create a page for a client site, but not using automation platforms like we usually do, but code from scratch. Alas I couldn‚Äôt do it. I managed the barebones structure. I spent so much time getting nowhere and the deadline was fast approaching. I then asked my boss, he came over and fixed it all in under an hour.

The second job was to replicate a form on a webpage from some random site which is purely using JS, has a ton of animation and smart stuff behind it. I‚Äôm just thinking to myself what the fuck, how the fuck am I supposed to do this? I have 0 JS experience which was clear in the test scores.

I ask my team manager for help (as my boss was ill) and she comes over, says try googling x and y. She sees a search result that barely resembles what I need and says try that. Again I try for hours and hours and get absolutely no where. 

That was Friday, it‚Äôs still not done. And I‚Äôm just kinda pissed off tbh. Is it unreasonable for them to expect this of me? I don‚Äôt mind getting experience in more coding, but throwing me into something like this feels horribly defeating. I already suffer with an inferiority complex that I‚Äôve been seeing a therapist for and this has not helped me at all. I‚Äôve enjoyed the other work I‚Äôve been doing, but on Friday our boss said he‚Äôs going to be working from home for the rest of this year and next because of circumstances and is going to be able to help out less.",06Oct2019,1

345,"Alright so BOOM 

A couple of months ago i got connected with a group of dancers and within this community of dancers, i met two dope girls and we became friends (we‚Äôll call them Coco and Nella). Nella is married to a guy (who is one of the dancers, we‚Äôll call him Jr.) and Coco is married to another dancer, let‚Äôs call him Maxwell). 

Overtime talking with Nella, she reveals to me that her husband has been cheating on her often, to the point where he caught an STD from it. Nella‚Äôs husband has no CLUE that his wife knows about any of the fuckery he‚Äôs been doing, nor does he know that he has an STD.

Alright so about 3 weeks ago, Nella and i are outside her place chillin and whatnot and she tells me that if she wasn‚Äôt married that she would try out some of the dancers. So me being me, i asked. She named Coco‚Äôs husband Maxwell . I asked why, she said it was because Coco always y‚Äôall about how good sex is with him and etc. I was shocked but not surprised if that makes sense. You see Nella and Maxwell are really good friends so i didn‚Äôt think anything of it at first...

BUT THEN...

Nella tells me that she wants to see if Maxwell is down  for a Soir√©e... if you know what I mean...

I told her simply that it wouldn‚Äôt be a good idea because Nella is friends with Coco- and that‚Äôs her husband. She starts texting him to feel him out then when she saw that he was ready for the madness, he agreed. All the while i know about the shenanigans but I‚Äôm not saying anything because i honestly felt like it wasn‚Äôt my place, but conviction was/has been fucking me up. 

Nella convinces Maxwell to sleeping with her. Now at first i thought it was going to be a one time thing. But recently they‚Äôve been more outlandish with their escapades. 

For instance, a couple of us were all hanging out at her house and Nella was going to get her husband from work. Maxwell decided to ride with her, and what would have been a 7 minute car ride there and back turned into a three hour car ride. But Coco was in the house ASLEEP didn‚Äôt know that he was going with her... i said nothing and i felt horrible.

While Maxwell is with Coco, Nella will text him thing like how she misses the D and etc. and he‚Äôs replying back with equally if not more x rated information. All the while sitting with his wife. So when Neither Jr. or Coco is looking or around, they‚Äôll kiss and/or fondle each other and then when the both of them come back in the room they‚Äôll go back to what they were doing as if nothing happened. But because i pay attention to small things, i see them smirk at each other through the phone.

Last night there was this HUGE dance event and a lot of people from out of town flew in/ drove in to watch and be a part of it. And Coco, Nella, and I were there hanging out. But i felt uncomfortable because I‚Äôm keeping the secret that Nella is sleeping with Her man. And i really like Coco as a friend, But i don‚Äôt want to be involved because of the hell fire behind this madness.

Kicker is, Nella was reinfected by her husband and have possibly spread it to Maxwell, who spread it to Coco. I fell horrible. I don‚Äôt want to get involved though. What do i do?",06Oct2019,1

My girlfriend of two years and I broke up a few weeks ago. It was mutual. Shortly after we broke up, I enrolled in my college's counseling program. I had done therapy during high school (I'm 20 now) and figured now of all times was the best to return. Almost immediately, the subject of our relationship was discussed, and how it affected me.

I started to talk about my girlfriend and her behavior as something that, I thought, was a normal thing that happened in relationships. The biggest red flag (to my therapist) was the guilt she always made me feel for doing things that she didn't like. If I wasn't really feeling like having sex or wasn't necessarily feeling like expressing physical affection, that meant that I was making her feel ""unwanted"". If I didn't want to go to a party (she was much more extroverted than I was) she would get on my case for a bit about it and how it wasn't respecting her. Whenever I thought I was standing up for myself, she would always say that I was ""disrespecting"" her.

Keep in mind, this was my first real relationship, I really had no background in how one is supposed to behave. My counselor asked me to dig deeper into her behavior and went as far as to say that the relationship itself was causing a good amount of the internal strife that I had been feeling for the past few months. This all just left me kind of at a loss because I never thought of her as ""abusive"" per se, but she did make me feel bad about myself sometimes, and eventually a lot of the time.

It's hard to think about, and I also don't know how to move forward here. Were part of the same friend group (that my brother is also in) so I can't cut her off or anything, but I kind of want to talk to her about this. The more I think about it, the more I realize that maybe I was emotionally abused and manipulated and the sicker I feel about having to be around her still.

I could really use some advice here. Should I cut her off and risk causing a mess within my social life? I already feel anxious and sick when I'm around her still, but I can't just abandon my friends.

I've been finding it really difficult to socialise with Amelia because she always smells very strongly and I've been finding myself avoiding her because of it. 

Every time she leaves her room I feel compelled to open all the windows in the hallway and communal areas to make the air a bit more breathable. 

I'm not sure how to approach the situation because it's such a personal subject and could seem very rude if I called her out on it. I'm not sure if it's a hygiene issue or a medical problem. I have strong suspicions that it might be hygiene related though because I have never known her to use the shower and she always wears the same items of clothing but she hasn't used the washing machine either. 

None of the other girls have mentioned it but I think that's out of politeness.

I don't know what to do and I could really use some advice; I'm only a few weeks in and finding it very difficult and have the rest of the academic year to go.",06Oct2019,1

About a month and a half ago an old employee started working here again, she‚Äôs 22. From day 1 of working with her I got a lot of ‚Äúweird‚Äù signals. It ranges from her randomly staring at me to full on physical contact.

Randomly during work she‚Äôll poke my side, hug me, hook her arm around me, lay her head on my shoulder, touching my arm and then laughingly looking away and random compliments out of the blue.

She always seems to find excuses to be around me during and afterwork. Now I‚Äôm not a complete idiot and I know damn well this is hardcore flirting. And I ofcourse responded untill I found out she has a boyfriend. The boyfriend has an extremely well paying job and they live together as well.

Thats the confusing part, I really cant find a good normal reason why she would flirt with me. And I cant seem to find out her intentions.

Regarding hygiene, she refuses to wash her face and brush her hair. This may not really sound all that bad, but her skin looks noticeably nasty. Anytime I touch her face, it feels like I am rubbing my finger on a freshly buttered pan. She refuses to brush her hair, and my mom just had to help her get this GIGANTIC frizzy knot out of the back of her hair, but even after that, she still doesn‚Äôt brush it. Anytime I ask, she tells me she does, but I will run my fingers through her hair and tell that she definitely didn‚Äôt. She goes to school with bed head almost every day and with her hair texture (frizzy, curly) it causes people to point and laugh.

With her studies, she waits until Sunday to do all of her homework. It isn‚Äôt that big of a deal when it is one paper, but today is Sunday and she hasn‚Äôt started her book project (activities like creating a game and writing a paper) personal scrapbook (5 pics printed and on poster-board with captions), and about 3 or 4 papers in language arts. Those things are due either Monday or Tuesday. When I did my book project, it took me the whole night to do it correctly. Same thing with my scrapbook.

384,"I have been offered a job opportunity.

I currently work part time, my commute is about an hour long each way (96 miles round-trip). I work 3-4 days a week at this current job. Sometimes the days/shifts vary. I work weekends, holidays and take call at times. The pay is great. The benefits are good. The people are great. My boss is wonderful. The workload is heavy, strenuous, and at times exhausting. Getting time off is no problem. Boss is very understanding/accommodating when last-minute time off is needed. I get recognized often for my hard work and dedication to the job. I‚Äôve worked here for a long time and am known well by many other departments which can make the job easier at times. 

New job opportunity ‚Äì Same amount of hours. Set days (day shift, no weekends, no holidays, no call). Lower pay (a decent pay cut). Benefits are not as good. Commute is only 15 minutes each way (18 miles round-trip). The staff is good. Getting time off is a bit more challenging. Last minute time off is pretty much nonexistent. The boss is OK. The workload is A LOT less strenuous ‚Äì a lot easier on the body, mind and less stressful. I do not leave this place feeling exhausted like I do at my current job.

386,"Note: I originally posted this to r/confession, but believe my post was removed. Please keep in mind that this post is of that nature (describes the horrible things I have done).

I am part of an research group at my university. I go to a university in Asia, so the system here is a little different to that of western universities. But basically, this research group is one where you work under one professor from sophomore year until graduation, and you do intensive work on your research topic (we meet up every day of the week). 

I have been a horrible person in this research group. Always late, and I‚Äôve even missed a lot of meetings due to oversleeping. Every time, I‚Äôve apologized. But once, I flaked on a meeting with a client. I wasn‚Äôt the only one so my peers were there to cover, but a no-show on such a meeting is obviously unacceptable. I spent days in denial, ignoring the missed calls, not so much as sending a message to apologize. I thought that was it. I couldn‚Äôt face the confrontation. But I finally came to my senses. And I spent a message of deep apology, asking them to please let me work with them again. I knew this was my last chance. I couldn‚Äôt screw up anymore.

But guess what? I did. I flaked on one meeting because I was unprepared, was too scared to face the consequences, and cut off contact again. This ended up piling on a lot of my work load to my peers. Up until the day of the event we were preparing for, I was out of contact and no-show. I just couldn‚Äôt face them anymore. I knew I had fucked up for good. Apologizing at this point seemed so useless, because I‚Äôve done the same stuff before, apologized, but here I was again. So I didn‚Äôt. Right after that event summer break rolled around, so there weren‚Äôt anymore meetings for 2 months. And when school resumed, I just went to the research group. Obviously I was super anxious. I was ready to face the worst. But everyone treated me normally, and acted like nothing had happened. Almost too nice, I couldn‚Äôt believe it. However, at certain points, I feel a certain air of coldness towards me. I know that underneath it all, things aren‚Äôt alright. I can‚Äôt just flake on something important like that and act like I never did.

If I want to alleviate my guilt, and not have to face the people I have wronged, I know that I can just quit. It will affect my future career path, but I deserve it. However, I don‚Äôt know if this is the best course of action for the research group itself. First, as horrible and unreliable of a person I am, I do make contributions when I work. If I leave, there will be more weight on my peers to work. We have projects in small groups as well, and even having one person gone increases the work load on the others a lot. Secondly, it will leave a bad aftertaste. I haven‚Äôt heard of anyone that‚Äôs left the research group abruptly, after over a year of being in it. It‚Äôs a super big deal, and one that wouldn‚Äôt be taken lightly. I would even have to personally ask the professor to remove me, something that might make him consider this to be a ‚Äòtroublesome‚Äô year. I don‚Äôt want my peers graduating from a research group that has a past, a lingering bad aftertaste that they can‚Äôt quite ignore.

Maybe these are just excuses I am giving myself because at the end of the day, I want to stay. Please do let me know if it is in the best interests of the research group that I leave. I have 3 options now: leave, apologize and stay, or don‚Äôt mention it and stay.

I should mention that over the summer break, I have seriously worked on self-improvement and have been able to tackle my lateness, oversleeping, and flaking habits. Maybe I will regress, I can‚Äôt make any promises, but for now, these will no longer be an issue going forward. (If I do regress, I seriously will quit at that point.) The issue is how horrible I have been and how I haven‚Äôt owned up to it in anyway, and how my peers‚Äô reliability and opinion on me are forever crushed no matter what I do at this point.",06Oct2019,1

392,"The girl is a famous pop singer named Miley Cyrus. Although i know her since years ago i fell in this mad love last year. It was exactly one night in December of 2018 that this revolution has happened in me and since then i think about her every single moment of every day. I've been trying to make contact with her and find out a way to meet her but still nothing. I really love her and i need her attention. I actually DESERVE it. I've been through a lot because of her. The fact that i love her this much and yet i can't have her is sad and depressing on its own but my jealousy makes it much worse and much more dangerous. Every time i see a picture or video of her talking, hugging, kissing, hanging out or doing whatever else with another guy i feel extremely jealous and hateful. I feel jealous of her boyfriends. I feel jealous of her producers and friends like that guy Mike Will who have spent a lot of time with her and talked to her and even touched and hugged and kissed her. I felt jealous when i saw her twerking for Robin Thicke. I am jealous of those reporters and interviewers who talked to her. I am jealous of those lucky bastard fans who could meet her in backstage and take pictures with her and hug and kiss her. The worst of them all was this lucky badtard called 'Matt Peterson'. Just go search 'Miley Cyrus Matt Peterson'and watch the clip in Youtube. That kid has asked Miley to be his prom datein 2014 and Miley has invited him to her concert and there she hugged, kissed, flirted and danced with him and she has singed her flirty song 'i adore you' to him while they were hugging and cuddling and all of those crap that a real prom couple do. She treated him so nicely and she changed his whole insignificent life. This video clip is so toxic and it fills me with hate and anger. If pisses me off more than seeing those guys touching Miley without her asking because in this case she is giving him the permission and she likes him back and she treats him so nicely. It pisses me off more than seeing her with her boyfriends because at least they personally knee her for some time and they used the opportunity but what about Matt Peterson? He is no one. He is just a random loser out of nowhere who had the chance to touch Miley. Lucky bastard. I am not less than some random loser so called fan boy or anyone else. Not only i am not less than them as a human but i deserve her attention more because i love her more and i care about her more than they do. Yet i can't have her. I can't even have a reply from her. Those guys are there touching her and i am here having nothing. It's not fair. It's pathetic. It's unacceptable. I don't deserve this shit.

‚Äã

So let's make it clear. Fuck all of those guys. Especially fuck Matt Peterson for causing me all of this pain. I couldn't eat and sleep properly since i've seen that shitty video. In that video i've seen everything that i hated to see. It was a catastrophe. It was terrifying. It gave me actual PTSD. So fuck him. Miley Cyrus still follows that fool and he still posts about that shit. He is there showing this video to hia family and friends and they congratulate him while i am sitting here and watching it and suffering. Fuck Matt. I am tired of hiding these all in myself and saying nothing. Fuck them all. I haven't sent him or anyobe any threats yet because i believe that words should be said after the action was done. I really have some crazy thoughts in my mind and in this situation i am crazy enough to do anything. All i see is death. All i hear is gunshots. I am done with all of these. I just want to pick a weapon and kill those who caused me this pain and thenmaybe kill myself as well. I think about going right to the place that he loves or works and shoot him right in the head without saying a hi and leave a note on his body saying 'Don't ever do this again Miley'

‚Äã

If i can't have her, i don't like seeing anyone else having her too. If she flirted me too then everything would be ok.

‚Äã

So i have one last thing to try. I should ask her out and if she says yes then great but if she rejects me then i'll go insane and i'll talk with my gun instead. Let the bullets decide who is right and who wrong. Believe me that i was a peacefilul person in my whole life. I've never killed anyone and i've rarely used weapons before but i can't tolerate this anymore. I feel so vengeful and i am totally losing my control...

395,"So every time I get a job, eventually the initial, novelty thrill wears off. Like clockwork, I eventually begin heavily dissociating everytime I'm at work. I'm unable to focus, I feel out-of-body and just generally disconnected and I eventually become misrable. The jobs aren't outside my grasp. I can do them, but I just feel so zombified and also feel a deep need to acknowledge that, which I know is part of the problem because the working-world almost requires you to just ""shut down"" and work. Anytime an employer sees that I have a conscience, it immediately plants seeds of mistrust in me as an employee.

I often look at other people doing their jobs and wonder how they *are* able to just ""shut down"" and work the way they do; even though I'm sure it's not all sunshine for them in their own minds/worlds. But some people really are able to just see it as a job, go in, work it, then leave. And for some reason I can't manage to do that; I can with *some* jobs, but not very many. And even if I have a job where I can manage to just focus &amp; work, if I'm there for over a year or so, I simply get tired of doing the same tasks every day and end up phasing out of the job due simply to boredom. It's not a matter of me sitting and saying to myself: ""I'm better than this"", etc. My ego is fairly well tamed in that regard. I just get burnt out on jobs really quickly; to the point where I actively avoid looking for full-time jobs because they all seem so monotonous, and instead I try to find a combination of multiple part-time jobs just to have a change of pace in my duties.

In a way, I'm glad that I'm not able to shut-down into a ""sheep mentality"", but this sword's double-edge affects my cashflow, bills, survival, etc. And since I've had various jobs, employers are hesitant to hire me for anything. And even I'm hesitant going in to any new job because its like ""okay, how long before this one goes tits-up?"" I understand that bringing a negative mentality like that to the table doesn't help, but even if I go into a new job with optimism and enthusiasm, eventually the dark cloud of dissociation comes in and rains on things in a deep, precognitive way that I **cannot** control; and I'm stuck just trying to tell myself ""that job just wasn't meant to be and doesn't suit my characteristics"", while trying to pick up the pieces again and again.

I've made peace with the fact that ""if you want to take from the well, you have to replenish the well"". I have to contribute to society if I want to also reap its benefits. And maybe it truly is a matter of trial/error until I find a job that suits me. But the growing list of short-term jobs on my resume is actually only making it *harder* to get jobs.

400,"Hello! I just turned 19 yesterday and I have no idea what to do with my life.

I finished high school last spring and currently I'm taking a gap year. I want to sort things out, save some money and stuff like that. I'm thinking about going to film school as my first choice, still thinking about second choice if things go wrong. Because this is who I want to be, a filmmaker. And also a musician. And maybe a writer. Shortly, I love creating things, and I think that cinema is most suitable for me. But this is where my obsessive thoughts come on.

 A lot of rather depressing scenarios start to form in my head. I'm mostly scared of scenario where I make a movie that is a total trash and people start to make fun of me. Like I go down the street and some people start shouting ""Hey, look, it's the guy who made that piece of shit of a movie"" and stuff like that. I think I could handle constructive criticism, but I'm not sure about being ridiculed and made fun of. I don't know, maybe I'm a little paranoic and I'm overreacting but I can't shake those thoughts. Filmmakers should have nerves of steel, so, basically something I don't have. But I love creating, and I can't imagine future where I would have to go to job i hate.

 It feels like I think that the worst will come. Everytime I have thoughts like that I get stressed out, they fill me with anxiety. And suddenly I lose all my courage, my motivation. I feel like staying in a comfort zone of not doing anything where no one can hurt me. Honestly, I don't know what to do. I spent so much time ruminating about these thoughts that in the end I didn't practice anything. And here I am, a 19yo with dreams and obsessive thoughts. I thought about starting a blog or something, showing my progress to people, following a path that I always wanted to. But I can't shake these thoughts. What should I do?",06Oct2019,1

I ended dropping out of school because of this.

412,"I'm a freshman in college. A week ago, we had an important long test. I was feeling confident because I studied the night before and wanted to ace this test so I could secure my grades for the semester. Fast forward to the test itself. Although I answered all of the questions, I wasn't sure if they were all correct. Lo and behold, they were not. I got a barely passing score, but I passed nonetheless. But what really made me sad and angry at myself were some of the identification questions I got wrong. They were totally easy questions, you could just try to memorize it in your head for 2 minutes. Problem was, I didn't. I just skimmed through the general gist of that topic because I thought it wouldn't appear in the test.

And now I hate myself, because I could've gotten a decent enough score if I just sacrificed 5 minutes of my time to study it, if I hadn't let sleep take over me. It's been a week already but I keep beating myself over it. I wanted to get an A in this subject but I'm worried that I'm not going to be able to catch up now because of my stupid decisions. I really want to be part of the Dean's List and make my parents proud (who sacrifice a shitton for me) and it pains me to think that this one important test would ruin it all.  

The thought gives me anxiety. I can't even focus on my studies now because I can't stop beating myself up. I shower for a long time and I keep replaying scenarios that I should have done. I can't even sleep well. I'm super anxious now that I won't do well in the other tests.

How can I not let this thought consume me? I don't want to feel this sense of regret and disappointment in myself for the rest of the semester. How can I stop myself from feeling this way?

I know it sounds stupid, and I probably sound like some kind of study nut or weird perfectionist rather than a self-loathing person...but I just wanna rant over here.",06Oct2019,1

I used to do dance, and want to do it again, but I don't know how to find a place to do so and my mom gets mad at me when I ask for help. I also want to participate in the school musical like I did last year, but my mom is hesitant for a few reasons. 

First, it requires a lot of driving. I can go back home without her for the first 2-3 months of the practices, but for the last month she would need to drive me home 2-3 times per week, and driving to the middle school takes 10-15 minutes. For the final week she would need to drive me back home in rush hour twice, and at a time that conflicts with when we have dinner. She would also need to drive me to the shows, which there are three of. I could carpool with one of my friends but it doesn't work out too well.

Second, the musical is not very organized. We would get conflicting information and often we wouldn't get all the necessary information. My mom is very organized and this bothers her a lot.

Am I in the right for wanting to do this or am I being entitled? How can I convince her to let me do it again? And if that's not possible, what should I do with all my time?",06Oct2019,1

422,"I was born and raised for 10 years in Sweden. I went to school there, and my grades were very good. Life in Sweden was fantastic. But in 2017, my family had to move across the Baltic, to Poland. Remember, I was 10, and this was a very dramatic change for me. My mom is Polish, but I never any Polish back in Sweden. I joined an international private school that costs a lot per year, but my parents' plan was to have me go there for 1 year so I could learn Polish, then join a public school. You need to know that everybody there speaks English, and some speak Polish, and that there are two versions of some lessons: English and Polish. Everybody has to go to the English and your parents sign you up for the Polish ones. 

However, this plan didn't work out. I had a terrible time in school my first year there, and most importantly, my Polish was at best tourist-level. My parents blamed me, and I got to go one more year there. Surprisingly, Class 7 (the class I went to bc I got moved up 2 classes before) was a really great class. Lots of new friends, and my grades were getting better. I only struggled with math and Polish, still not learning or remembering anything of value. After Class 7, I could barely have a normal conversation with anyone in Polish.

While my English was getting better and better at the International School, the other language was still going nowhere. Now, in Poland, at the very end of Class 8, you have to do a special test to measure your knowledge and to give high schools an idea of how good you are in 3 subjects: Math, Polish and English. You have to do a separate test for each, and the grade you get determines if you get a good high school or not. Obviously, I will pass my English test, but I suck extremely hard at both Polish AND Math. 

Knowing this, my parents moved me from the previous ""Beginner's Class of Polish"" to ""Normal Polish"", which is a class where normal Polish students have their lessons. I have gone from studying verbs to having to read books with hundreds of pages. My parents changed my History, Civics, Geography and MATH lessons in the school from English to Polish ones, where the teacher, the exercises, the homework, and the students are Polish. 

This is where I am now. I am struggling mentally with the most important subjects, my parents tell me that I should've worked more when I first came here, my future depends on the test that are coming up in April of 2020, and I don't know what to do. Help!",06Oct2019,1
423,"Hi all, I just started college as a 20 year old and I made a new friend who is 18. I enjoy her company but the way she acts like sometimes makes me wonder if she‚Äôs 14/15. She normally eats a banana at lunch and will shove the entire thing down her throat like it were a dick even when there are other people around. She almost makes a LOT of sex jokes which can get annoying at times because I feel like most other people stopped telling those types of jokes in like sophomore year of high school. She kinda has this celebrity fascination that she is always rambling about which I‚Äôm not really interested in hearing about but I don‚Äôt want to be rude and ask her to stop talking about it. 
She also seems to be a little self-serving. She asks me all the time how to do the math homework when she can easily google how to do it and I was ok with explaining it to her since my math skills are decent. Same thing with English, I love to write but she legit asks me what to write for her essay/ even how to reword her thesis statement and the subjects we are writing about aren‚Äôt really hard. The one time I got stuck on a math problem and I couldn‚Äôt find a solution, I went to her and asked her about it since I knew she had already done it and she said don‚Äôt ask me because I don‚Äôt remember how... and it‚Äôs like, really? I looked at the problem to show you how to do it when I had done the homework 3 days prior but you‚Äôve decided that‚Äôs too hard?

Another thing is I got upset yesterday about something that has been hurting me for a while and I just needed to rant to someone about it. I even told her to feel free not to say anything because I just need to get it out of my system. She then told me she didn‚Äôt know what to tell me and followed by saying she doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a big deal. Ok so apparently I can‚Äôt feel comfortable sharing my problems with you because you can‚Äôt even lend an ear without saying shit like that. No one wants to hear something like that when they‚Äôre upset and I‚Äôm sure she wouldn‚Äôt appreciate it if I did that to her.  

I‚Äôm getting kind of irritated by her actions to the point I feel as though seeing her alone gets on my nerves. She‚Äôs a sweet girl and an ok friend but I wish she would act more like her age. I guess I‚Äôm just ranting more than asking for advice but any would be appreciated.",06Oct2019,1

425,"TL;DR. Girl asked me out, I said no and is now manipulating my friends because of it.

&amp;#x200B;

There were 3 of us in a friendship group my 2 friends let's call them Tim and Josh. It all started when we were going on a night out and we were all going to meet up with 2 girls lets call them Lola and Caitlyn, we met up and had a good night. Over the next couple of weeks it became clear that Caitlyn had a crush on me but at that time Lola and I had already started speaking. Caitlyn then decided to get close with Josh, now something that you need to know about Josh is that he has some attachment issues and thinks that he's in love at the first sign of affection that a girl gives him, This is something Caitlyn was aware of as we had spoken about that kind of stuff previously. Now Josh and Tim are cousins and Tim is basically Josh's whipping boy. He always looks for approval off Josh, be it what clothes he buys, what games he plays etc. Now as I was saying Caitlyn told me how she felt and I had to let her down saying I wasn't interested, which she seemed to take well. She then found out that Lola and I had gotten into a semi serious relationship and I don't think that she liked this because when she found out about this she then got close to Josh, and she has basically took over by telling Josh what he can and can't do and calling it a relationship, then Josh is relaying this onto Tim so they're all following her. She has told them straight up lies about Lola and I, and they're mindlessly believing it without even asking us. I've tried to get back into contact with my friends, but all I either straight up ignored or a message off **HER** when I **messaged my friends** asking Why i'm trying to get back into **HER** friendship group.

A person I admire told me that ‚Äúan undergraduate‚Äôs degree is worthless without networking‚Äù. I know literally nothing about networking. I can probably count in a recommendation letter from a professor I did research for ‚Äì but that‚Äôs it.

I would definitely like to continue with my education, but I don‚Äôt know if I can afford to spend more money on education. To be honest, there were so many obstacles in the way of getting my undergraduate‚Äôs, I‚Äôm scared shitless of what happens next. In high school, people constantly told me that all I needed was a degree in order to make it ‚Äì also a lie. 

Another major obstacle is that I really, really want to stay in Michigan. I noticed for a lot of rich people I go to school with, all they want to do is leave Michigan. I can‚Äôt leave my family like that. My parents need me. Albeit I would like to live independently from them, but I could never leave their lives completely. After all they‚Äôve done for me, I find that immoral.

Whenever I‚Äôve needed a job or research experience, I‚Äôve always resorted to cold-calling. I have a lot of experience with cold-calling. The problem is, I don‚Äôt know where to start, and I don‚Äôt want to burn anymore bridges with my ignorance (I‚Äôve made some mistakes). Any advice is appreciated.",06Oct2019,5

We were in orchestra together for 4 years, but hung out outside of that too. Especially senior year, we hung out outside of school and we got along really well. The I moved about 3 hours away for college and we lost touch. So I haven't seen him for about 7 years. Apparently a year ago he also moved to my city, and just coincidence we ran into each other.

He saw me before I saw him, and called me over to say hi. The conversation wasn't awkward at all, I was genuinely excited to see him and he seemed the same! Turns out one of my co-workers is his good friend, and he lives not to far from where I work. We chatted and caught up for about 10 minutes as we were going the same direction and then went our separate ways.

The next day I messaged him and said we should get a coffee or a drink sometime and catch up. He replied pretty quickly and said he'd love to. I told him which days of the week would be best for me after work, and then he never responded.

I'd still really like to catch up, we used to get along really well and I think it's be great to get to know him again. Should I send another message asking when he's free? Or just take a hint that he ignored my last message because he has no interest in meeting?

449,"Look i dont know all the details but i will share everything i know about what is going on and how it has affected my mum. In the beginning after a break up between my parents my dad being the well of type decided to help my mum by letting her live in this house rent free and also he would give her money each month to spend on me as i was growing up this continued for at least 10 years as the agreement was she would move out when i turned 16. Everything was going fine until my dads company started loosing money to he had to retire and sold off his shares in the company. This is where he started asking for a little bit of rent each month bare in mind the house we live in is detached and is 3bedrooms 1 bathroom and is of a decent size so its obviously costing my dad quite a bit of money as he owns it. This is where the third person appears one of my mums friends started living with us and he would help around the house help my mum with her work and shit but he would steal money from my mum she would know this but all that would come of it was an argument. When my mum started paying rent she found a job and everything and everything was fine this was before i turned 16 
But i was only 15 so i understood all my dad had done for her. My mum had been saving to move out and when i was 15 she had enough to do so and move out with any issue but because that guy took it all she is now down 40k and doesn't have any money to move out i dont know how i can help her as there is no way im able to get even near to that amount of money but my dad has issued her with eviction notices and court dates basically trying to ruin her life now despite the fact he paid for the house all these years i dont know what to do as i am only 16 if you need anymore details leave a comment as im sure ive left parts out but my mum simply cant afford to pay the rent anymore and since she has no money she cant move out i dont know if i should start a go fund me or anything because my mum is really going thru a rough patch and she cant cope.",06Oct2019,4

453,"Early 20's male, in case that matters. For 4+ years, I have been having nightmares at least once-twice a week, and many times this involves waking up screaming. For as long as I can remember, I have been an avid dreamer - it's usually more weird for me to say I *haven't* had a dream than that I have had one, whether they're super detailed, or just some vague memory I have from last night's sleep.

Sometime in high-school (around junior year), I had a stint of a reoccurring nightmare that lasted almost an entire month, with the events/beings in that nightmare never occurring again after that month. (Demon-creature-thing would watch me from my door, and every night when I had the dream, it would be a step closer to me - the last dream involving it, it was right over my bed, staring at me). Ever since then, I've slowly begun to have more and more nightmares a month, and now it's to the current point where I'm having numerous nightmares a week, and often waking up screaming to them. Usually the nightmares involve typical things like not being able to talk/scream loud enough, not being fast/strong enough to escape something, something watching or stalking me, etc., but there are times where I've found myself waking up screaming to things that (once awake) I wouldn't even find remotely scary or unsettling.

Many times when I wake up screaming, I am conscious and can remember it the next morning, usually with the scream going from normal talking-voice loud to ""I'm dying somebody help me"" loud, but I have been told from family and my GF that I've also made low moaning/talking sounds. I've also been asked what my nightmares were about the night before and what I was screaming about, without having any recollection of even having a nightmare or screaming during the night. 

While this typically has only happened at my house, I has happened on a few rare occasions at others homes, including once at a date's house (which ruined the rest of the night and the following morning, oops).

I don't believe it really effects my quality of sleep, as I feel as well rested as I would had I not had a nightmare, but I know that it's not normal for someone to have nightmares/scream multiple times a week, and sometimes the uneasiness or dread I have after particularly bad nightmares starts to fuck with me. It's also annoying for my family and girlfriend as well, since usually my screaming wakes them up as much as it does me. 

Has anybody else dealt with something like this, or know somebody who has? If so, any success stories on making it stop, or any explanation as to why it's happening **so** frequently? I've mentioned to my doctor during visits for other things, but I haven't made an appointment to speak with them just for this, nor have I looked into any sleep studies or something similar.",06Oct2019,4

After my first rollercoaster relationship we decided to call it quits and I accepted it and got on with my life. I see him all around campus and sometimes he talks to me. Before talking to me he unfriended me on Facebook so I just got on with my life. However afterwards, a couple of days later, I accidentally like one of his tweets one evening, and he deactivated the account. And I only realised this after two or so months. Then on his birthday weekend I on two occasions get off the bus early from uni to my house and his area is along the way to my place. Then later on campus I'm getting a bus from the gym and realise that I MIGHT see him and understand what I'm doing is not okay so I move away. I've since avoided my impulses to see him.

I mean, it was intentional that I got off the bus earlier than usual and I knew that I have to walk past his area. I think I was hoping to see him on all of those occasions. I was going home but I also was at that bus stop hoping to see him. Another occasion went to the bar with my friend because he sometimes goes there with his friends. Not cool, I know.

The second time I got off the bus top early and when I waited it‚Äôs like I ENJOYED doing those things?? I hate myself for it who the fuck am I?

What if he saw me? What if I ruined his day?I feel SO GUILTY. I feel like dying. I know what I did isn‚Äôt okay, but I just need some help. I‚Äôm sick to my stomach.

463,"Hi, so I need some advice. I'm school age, so I have a councillor at my school, which will be important later. I have a best friend, who we'll just call brown. Now one day, about 4 days ago (It was on a tuesday) she came to school with a leg brace. I had only noticed at lunch period, since we have no classes together. I asked her :Why are you wearing that leg brace?"" And she replied with ""My mom did this to me."" That had surprised me, since I had known her parents since I was in fourth grade, they were nice people. She told me this whole story, about her getting her phone taken away just because her mom was in a bad mood, and when she didn't give her phone, she was sent to her room and her mom hit her, but not on the leg, somewhere else that I can't remember. Now, brown went to her room, and she sat there for awhile. Later on, her parents left to go to work, and she came out of her room, because y'know, you'll probably have a mental breakdown being forced to sit in a tiny silent room for 5 hours a day. It turns out her mom WAS home, and brown was just staring at the T.V. even though it was turned off. Brown's mom said ""You can't watch tv"" and brown replied with ""it's not on"", and this was I think when she was hit on the leg. She claims she ""deserves it"" but no kid should be beat to the point where they have to wear a leg brace. And if you think that she did deserve it for not obeying her parents, she's a teenager, so am I, you should expect teenagers to want to do their own thing, or at minimum be rebellious. I still have more to this story though. Every time we come to school, she tells me about things her parents have done or said to her. Brown has a phone, but her parents won't let her use it, they only let her bring it to school, she has life360 even though she's not supposed to go anywhere without her friends, and she can't even text certain friends. Brown also gets in trouble for nothing, and her mom takes out her anger on brown. Brown's dad only listens to the mom because he's scared of getting yelled at. That's a red flag, and this shows that the mom is toxic. I think a part her parents acting like this may be because she came out as bi, and they're intent on her ""walking down the aisle with the perfect guy"" in 10 or 20 years. But even if your kid is bi, you should accept them, and not emotionally abuse them. Now, here's where I need advice. My and my other friend, I'll call him yellow, are worried about her (yellow is also dating brown so he's even more worried than me) and me and yellow are considering talking to the councillor about her. Brown is telling us not to but this is serious, her mom hit her hard enough to put her in a leg brace. I want to talk to the councillor but im scared that she won't be my friend anymore, so should I talk to the councillor?

We got our place in late June and have been living together ever since and for the most part, we work well together. However, I'm finding money to be a huge issue for us. I recently stopped working my second job as I am 8 months pregnant and I was exhausted working 12 hours a day Monday-Thursday and a normal 8 hour work day on Fridays so I decided to go back to a normal 40 hour work week. For this reason, my finances have taken a little hit and I've had to be paycheck to paycheck the last month or so. I haven't been doing much for myself lately, I will mostly take the money I do have and put it towards rent, bills, or groceries for us. I've stopped getting my nails done, spray tans, gym, all the things I used to do because obviously I have a baby on the way. My boyfriend, however, has not given up much as he makes more money than me but rather than helping me out I'm finding money is a very tit for tat thing with him. If he does a big grocery shop on a week I get paid, he will automatically expect me to grocery shop the next week or else the house will stay empty. He keeps track of how much I ""owe"" him and recently, I got a refund check (roughly $5000) that I will put in savings for my maternity leave and also to fix my car that is currently in the shop. I regret telling him I even got that money because he's been pushing me to get it cashed although the check has to be verified before it can be cashed which can't happen until tomorrow morning. This morning he told me he needs cigarettes and wanted my debit card so he could go get some even though it will overdraft my account. It's all just getting to be too much for me...I don't talk to friends or family about this because I am trying to optimistic and I want the father of my child in his life. I don't want them to think I'm an idiot for being with this guy but I'm starting to think that maybe I am. I am thinking about starting to hide money from him in my savings so that he can't access.

She was on a camp over the weekend with my schools P.E. Club and there where other schools there too.

She met another boy there and she said that she have ‚Äúsoft feelings‚Äù about him. 

He did already have a gf but they broke up and Gaby and the boy have hung out a number of times and she described him as ‚Äúcozy to watch movies with‚Äù

This truly breaks my heart.

Also, a few days ago, one of her best friends just randomly came up to me and said: ‚ÄúYou must learn to get over things‚Äù just like that

I can‚Äôt stand this anymore. 
Should i tell her and if yes, how should i tell her that i love her?
I‚Äôm afraid that she doesn‚Äôt like me back and that i will lose her even as a friend.",06Oct2019,1
473,"I have a friend who has been going through a rough patch for a while. I want to show her that I care about her, so I told her I would spend one day every weekend with her, and I have been doing that as often as I can, except for when things come up that prevent me from doing so. In these cases, I always keep her in the loop, and she's fine with it. 

Recently, I have discovered that spending time with her every week is getting to be too much. I am married, have a full-time job, and I have things I need to do around the house that I can't do during the week, due to getting home from work in the evening. When the friend and I get together, we spend pretty much the whole day together, from 10 AM to 8 PM, or sometimes from 12PM to 6PM. I don't really get ""me"" days as a result, since I'm scrambling to try and get all my stuff done on Saturdays since my Sundays are dedicated to her. And then sometimes I don't even get my housework done because I've had other stuff taking up both weekend days, including hanging out with her. 

I'm thinking about asking her if she would be ok with us hanging out every OTHER week, instead of every week. But I don't think there's really an easy way to ask this without making her feel like an option or an inconvenience.

476,"Heres my background, was a decent student in high school with a 3.8 and very good SAT scores which got me into a top 25 undergrad university on a full scholarship. 

I‚Äôve dealt with intense anxiety and bouts of depression my whole life but it only got worse in college and took me a long time to seek help. Doing a bit better now but still really struggle leaving my room each day and going anywhere in public. 

I took 5 years to graduate undergrad with a 2.2 gpa in a social science. I rarely attended classes and most professors gave me a D out of pity. I do not really have any solid relationships with professors for recommendations and grad school seems to be off the table for me at the moment. However, I have always tested well and decided to take the GRE. My scores actually ended up very good with a 170 in verbal, 162 in quantitive and 5.5 analytical writing score. I figure I can include this as a resume booster.

In school I majored in International Relations and minored in History. This was my planned major going into school and stuck it out despite not thoroughly enjoying majority of my courses. I really love creating art and writing stories in my free time but right now do not see these as viable career option as I have no financial support, however, I would ideally like to find a creative field.

Does anyone have any suggestions for me? 

I have no real direction and have been working fast food since I graduated in the spring because I needed a break from life and it has allowed me to keep a roof over my head. I‚Äôm not necessarily looking for something that would keep me isolated everyday. My only prior working experience is on campus at the tech desk which I did sporadically over my 5 years at school. 

TLDR: 23 year old with 2.2 undergrad gpa in International Relations. I test well but have no work experience outside fast food. I‚Äôm looking for viable career options at this point but don‚Äôt know where to start. No internships on my resume and need to support myself financially.

480,"I'm 18. I've managed to have a successful LDR for the past 2¬Ω years now, and a few weeks ago I blew up on him over seemingly nothing. At the time, he was busy and couldn't respond to my text, and at the time I was feeling sad. But he didn't know this, and I kept trying to hint I was sad through text. Honestly at the time I didn't even realize I was trying to act sad, but looking back I definitely was. But all I wanted was some love from him. I wasn't trying to be controlling or anything like that 

But the more he didn't respond, the worse I got. For a second I started tol think that he might've been messing with me to try and make me upset, which is something I know he wouldn't do at all. And then I felt like maybe he was mad and that was why, which I assumed was because of me. 

It's unusual for me to blow up on someone though, and really I think I scared him when I started getting upset/blowing up his phone. I felt so bad after, and I kept apologizing for three days. Not constantly or anything. I told him I didn't know why I freaked out, and that it was unlike me, and he was really understanding. 

But idrk how to deal with this. I keep feeling like he's going to decide I'm not good enough over things like texting him a little too much, or sending one too many emojis, or because I said something he didn't like, and that he'll leave if I'm not perfect. Like up and disappear without a trace. Should I talk to him about it?

481,"I am in love or in other words i am madly obsessed with a girl. This girl is a famous pop singer named 'Miley Cyrus'. Although i know her since years ago i fell in this mad love last year. It was exactly one night in December of 2018 that this revolution has happened in me and since then i think about her every single moment of every day. I've been trying to make contact with her and find a way to meet her but still nothing. I really love her and i need her attention. I actually DESERVE it. I've been through a lot because of her. The fact that i love her this much and yet i can't have her is sad and depressing on its own but my jealousy makes it much worse and much more dangerous. Every time i see a picture or video of her talking, hugging, kissing, hanging out or doing whatever else with another guy i feel extremely jealous and hateful. I feel jealous of her boyfriends. I feel jealous of her producers and co workers like that guy 'Mike Will' who have spent a lot of time with her and talked to her and even touched and hugged and kissed her. I felt jealous when i saw her twerking for Robin Thicke. I am jealous of those reporters and interviewers who talked to her. I am jealous of those lucky bastard fans who could meet her in backstage and take pictures with her and hug and kiss her. The worst of them all was this lucky bastard called 'Matt Peterson'. Just go search 'Miley Cyrus Matt Peterson'and watch the clip in Youtube. That kid has asked Miley to be his prom datein 2014 and Miley has invited him to her concert and there she hugged, kissed, flirted and danced with him and she has singed her flirty song 'i adore you' to him while they were hugging and cuddling and all of those crap that a real prom couple do. She treated him so nicely and she changed his whole insignificent life. This video clip is so toxic and it fills me with hate and anger. If pisses me off more than seeing those guys grabbing her without her consent because in this case she is giving him the permission and she likes him back and she treats him so nicely. It pisses me off more than seeing her with her boyfriends because at least they personally knew her for some time and they used the opportunity but what about Matt Peterson? He is no one. He is just a random loser out of nowhere who had the chance to touch Miley. Lucky bastard. I am not less than some random loser so called fan boy or anyone else. Not only i am not less than them as a human but i deserve her attention more because i love her more and i care about her more than they do. Yet i can't have her. I can't even have a reply from her. Those guys are there touching her and i am here having nothing. It's not fair. It's pathetic. It's unacceptable. I don't deserve this shit.

&amp;#x200B;

‚Äã

&amp;#x200B;

So let's make it clear. Fuck all of those guys. Especially fuck Matt Peterson for causing me all of this pain. I couldn't eat and sleep properly since i've seen that shitty video. In that video i've seen everything that i hated to see. It was a catastrophe. It was terrifying. It gave me actual PTSD. So fuck him. Miley Cyrus still follows that fool and he still posts about that shit. He is there showing this video to hia family and friends and they congratulate him while i am sitting here and watching it and suffering. Fuck Matt. I am tired of hiding these all in myself and saying nothing. Fuck them all. I haven't sent him or anyobe any threats yet because i believe that words should be said after the action was done. I really have some crazy thoughts in my mind and in this situation i am crazy enough to do anything. All i see is death. All i hear is gunshots. I am done with all of these. I just want to pick a weapon and kill those who caused me this pain and thenmaybe kill myself as well. I think about going right to the place that he lives or works and shoot him right in the head without saying a hi and leave a note on his body saying 'Don't ever do this again Miley'

&amp;#x200B;

‚Äã

&amp;#x200B;

If i can't have her, i don't like seeing anyone else having her too. If she flirted me too then everything would be ok.

&amp;#x200B;

‚Äã

&amp;#x200B;

So i have one last thing to try. I should ask her out and if she says yes then great but if she rejects me then i'll go insane and i'll talk with my gun instead. Let the bullets decide who is right and who wrong. Believe me that i've been always a peaceful person in my whole life. I've never killed anyone and i've rarely used weapons before but i can't tolerate this anymore. I feel so vengeful and i am totally losing my control...

That a stupid assumption considering the time we had for that day to practice.

484,"Appreciate some advice here. 

I work for a local college as the Marketing guy (not great money, just shy of ¬£18,000 a year). 

Long story short:

I was pulled into a meeting last week and they are essentially launching an investigation into why I won't pass an exam prior to my contractual deadline of January 2020 (which is when my employment would've been made permanent). It's a high level project management exam, which I attempted 2 months ago (after being put on a weeks course). 

They told me it'll take 2 weeks from Monday, after which I may be dismissed (30 days notice from then). 

I've got to be honest, I wasn't particularly bothered as my head has been out of the place for months anyway. I've been working on launching my own Marketing agency and web business (I also offer AWS cloud consulting) and I've got a few local businesses on retainer at what's a good rate but slightly lower than competitors to prove my worth. I can certainly say it's had an impact on my job (all nighters before work etc). I've also developed a managed WordPress platform that's picking up as the product is finished. 

The plan however was to keep working while building up a client base and so I could cover any business expenses. Part of me says I'm screwed now, but the other part says hand my notice in asap and focus on bringing in clients asap as the income from my job isn't hard to match (and I've done no real marketing myself due to time). 

Any thoughts on this? I've got ideas to bring some in and referrals seem to be working so any thoughts on that too? 

Am I screwed or can I get out of this?

486,"Dear people of Reddit,

I started working at my new job about 4 months ago. The first month everything was going fine. But the work environment has become horrible now. My co workers monitor everything that I do.

The other team that I work with tell me a lot of the stuff that the other team is saying about me and they feel genuinely sorry for me. Their way of working is much more open and respectful.

504,"I am a very driven, set in my ways, determined person. I know who I am and I love myself and I know what I want. I am very proud of that as well. I am regaining my independence and self stability. I feel like every day I get more confident with who I am. 

Here is my predicament... I have these group of friends, and I love them. We have gotten to know each other so well, there's 7 of us and I feel so free when im with them. BUT they are kind of a bad influence on me. All we do is smoke weed. They encourage me not to be involved in the things I like. And I have a feeling they don't want me to be as ""driven"" because then I won't spend as much time with them. Example.. I am on the field hockey team at my university and I am super proud of that, it took a lot of balls for me to join and I did and its amazing. I have my first game today and I told them that and they said, ""dude that sport is taking up all your fucking time just quit."" and I was kind of taken a back by that but just brushed it off. But the more I think about it, the more I realize that this friendship may become toxic and im not too sure what to do. I have no friends at school and these are the only people I've hung out with so far and I do REALLY like them, its just the 2 girls in the group who peer pressure me into smoking all the time. 

Heres where I need advice. I feel like I have always been so set on perfecting myself and understanding myself and wanting to be successful. But I feel like NOBODY in my life, other than my dad and sister are like this. Especially in college, everyone just lets loose and does whatever without thinking about the consequences. And since ive met these people, I occasionally do that too now, and I like it. But im torn between being driven, and just BEING. I feel like I just am not capable of not caring about myself. Half of me wants to just not care and get high and just free my mind. But the other half says, ""take advantage of every opportunity, stay true to who you are, never forget your core values, and always stay driven."" 

I am so split between the root I wanna take. Not to say its one or the other. But I am interested in your opinion/advice. 

(also I know its better to be driven than It is to not give a shit about life, but you know what I mean)",06Oct2019,1
505,"I'm(M) a seventeen year old high school student, I want to know if becoming a plumber, my math skills are weak, I'm guessing that my math skills are equivalent to an average 8th grader or 9th grader, I barely know the basics of Algebra or Geometry. The majority of the math teachers in my school are not so great at their subject in what I see and hear, one of my teachers did not know how to do long division(I can't either), but it's not their fault, I could have studied. So I'm undecided in what to do after high school, but I must decide soon since time is running out, but one idea is a plumber, but should I go for it since it involves math, how quick should I have to learn the skills. How expensive is it to take the courses, I rather it be easy and lengthy, than it being difficult. Another idea is that I could be a nurse, how difficult is becoming a nurse? I honestly want to make and write music but my parents(mid 50s, Hispanic immigrants, lived in the US for 35 years) would be SERIOUSLY disapointed, I have two neighbors that are plumbers, and I think I should also talk to them about the experinces.

So I live with my boyfriend, in his parents house with them. We offer to pay them rent literally all the time, but they keep refusing saying ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want your money, don‚Äôt worry about it.‚Äù But then, they expect us to do EVERYTHING. They want us to do the Dishes EVERY TIME, (which I obviously don‚Äôt mind doing, just maybe not being the only one to do them.) they want us to do all of their laundry, they want us to take out their garbage all the time, and a bunch of other stuff. 

And when I mean ‚Äúall the time‚Äù, I‚Äôm talking, we are the ONLY ones who even lift a finger, and when we try to bring it up, their response is ‚ÄúWell we pay all the bills. It‚Äôs the least you guys can do.‚Äù Except we offer every day to pay rent, and they keep refusing??? 

When we don‚Äôt do the dishes for a couple days, and they kind of pile up, (because they use literally 5 plates a day to themselves) we get screamed at about how we need to do them because we don‚Äôt do anything else. 

I seriously don‚Äôt think this is fair. I understand, we live with them, so obviously we have to do our share. But we shouldn‚Äôt be the only ones to do EVERYTHING. 

I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm just being a brat, or if this seriously is unfair. I don‚Äôt know what I should do, or what to feel.

512,"He lied his kids away, when she found out he lied about his name she ended the relationship. Then he set up tinder profiles with just photographs of his front door on in the hope of getting her attention. He then said he has split up with his wife, showing her text messages on his phone, these turned out to be from another phone he bought. He lied about his kids finding out when she tried to get in touch with his wife to tell her about him, he tried to guilt trip her saying she's traumatised his kids. Now he's been spotted a few times by her neighbors sitting on her doorstep when she's at work or in the night. Also he found out who I was, told her he's looked through my online pictures and profiles on social media sites, told her it will just be pedestrian sex with me?! She assures me he's not dangerous at all, but to me he sounds very unhinged so being dangerous is not out of the question in my mind. I've told my girlfriend that if he's spotted in her village again then she needs to call the police, and she agreed. He live in London and we both live in the north of England, so he drives up just to sit outside her house?! She said there's no way he will want to be spotted by her because she will tell his wife and then he could lose his kids. She thought she'd got rid of him when she managed to speak to his wife on the phone, told her everything, then he disapeared for a while. He turned back up just as I started seeing her.

Police should be the first step hey, I did find out his email address and I sent a message telling him to move on, look after his kids, told him I'm finding it intimidating and very weird what he's doing. If this doesn't scare him away and he turns up, the it's the police. What can they do since he's not done anything illegal so far.

He did tell her that he knows where I live and where I work. This freaks me out. I've never met the guy but for sure yesterday he was on her street whilst I was in her house, since she saw him speed past her in his car when she went out in her car, said he was driving fast. She has dogs and sometimes they start freaking out in the house, probably it's just people walking past the house, since they do that, but it's pretty unsettling knowing all the oddball stuff he's done up to now.",06Oct2019,43

515,"As a kid, my parents would only encourage me in my academics and nothing else was important to them. My mom is also mentally unstable and unable to recognize that or admit it, so my parents would frequently fight. Starting at 10, I would play peacemaker. I would try to calm my mom down while my dad collected his thoughts and eventually apologized (even though it was almost never his fault). So there wasn‚Äôt enough stability to have my own emotions at home and I moved schools often and changed churches even more so there wasn‚Äôt anybody I was friends with for more than 2 years. I didn‚Äôt think anybody had the time for me because everybody has their own problems. 

So I just turned 19 2 days ago and I‚Äôm at a very academically intense university. I‚Äôd taken CCP classes for years and thought that I was prepared, but I‚Äôm not doing well in my classes. I feel like I‚Äôm not worth anything if I can‚Äôt even do school. I want to get up to my Ph.D and my dream job is to be on the edge of research for AI. 

My parents are very manipulative and every time I come home my mental state degrades. I‚Äôve been with this really amazing guy for 10 months now that my parents don‚Äôt like and we‚Äôve had some issues recently. We both struggle with depression and for a long time I‚Äôve been trying to help him with his depression and dissatisfactory state of life, but in the process i disregarded my own mental health and that‚Äôs my own damn fault. 

Last night I went over to his place to break up with him, but I got there and started talking and my anxiety spiked so high that I couldn‚Äôt get any words out. I was trying to explain why I didn‚Äôt think I was good for him. That I just cause him pain. That I can‚Äôt give him what he needs and that it‚Äôs all my fault.  He was mad at first, but then noticed how much I was blaming myself. He wanted to know if there was something he‚Äôd done or something about him that was wrong. My only excuses were that he might not go to college and academics are super important to me, but even without college he‚Äôs very intelligent. He has motivation issues that I try so hard to help with that I often feel like I need the motivation for two people. But he‚Äôs been so good recently. I haven‚Äôt had to do much. 

I had talked with my parents about it earlier that day and they kept saying things like I could do better and that I didn‚Äôt need to settle. I thought maybe they were right, but after the conversation I had with my boyfriend, I feel like I was just being blinded by my parents constant stream of negativity. The only thing that‚Äôs a legitimate reason is that I become depressed when he is depressed and even though he‚Äôs the person I trust and care for the most, I can‚Äôt even bring myself to be honest with my emotions to him. 

Instead of breaking up he asked if we could go on a break and grow as our own people because he doesn‚Äôt want to lose me. I don‚Äôt want to lose him either. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing or what I need and I feel like I‚Äôm just a burden to everyone and that I can‚Äôt even be successful by the one thing that I‚Äôve valued myself in for so long which is my academics. 

I don‚Äôt know how to move forward. I want to heal my mind and love myself as much as I love my boyfriend. I‚Äôm also a Christian and so a goal that I also want to achieve is to strengthen my relationship with Christ and truly make Him the center of my life, because I‚Äôm realizing that I can‚Äôt do this on my own. Even with counseling I feel like there‚Äôs no improvement and I just hate myself and I want to die. If I can‚Äôt even be smart enough to do something good for the world, why should I even live. I just want to be good for people. But I suck at that. Look at this pity party.  I want to care for others but this looks like I‚Äôm just caring for myself. I feel so selfish and stupid. I don‚Äôt want to keep doing this. 

I‚Äôve been going to counseling. I‚Äôve been trying to eat healthy. I‚Äôve been trying to make sure I‚Äôm social and with people. I‚Äôm trying to manage my responsibilities and scale down where I know I can‚Äôt handle any more. I‚Äôve spoken to professors (the university I go to is very good and student teacher interaction. 4th in the nation) about the fact that I want to cut myself and kill myself. I haven‚Äôt let myself be alone when I‚Äôm sad. I‚Äôve made sure that I don‚Äôt hurt myself. I take a lot of supplements to balance my female hormones (PCOS is an issue) and prescribed natural muscle relaxants to help my chronic back pain, neck pain, and migraines. I have so many cognitive and biological issues and I don‚Äôt know how to fix them.

522,"I'm a 23M who just graduated college a few months ago and landed a full time job in Boston. Me and my ex were on a very on-again off-again relationship and looking back now, our relationship was very toxic. However, we ended the relationship on mutually good terms about a year ago and we're friends now. It helps to be each other's friend, because we came together to this country for our studies 4 years ago and at the end of it, she is the only person I really really connect with and vice versa. 

I know this relationship is completely over, and I do not at all intend to go back to dating her ever. Neither does she.

Now 6 months ago (April), I started talking to a different girl who seemed cool and we would occasionally exchange snaps and dms here and there. My ex got flared up when she found out about this when she saw a message from the new girl pop up (around mid June). She was upset I did not tell her since we were very close friends and we pretty much shared everything still. I didn't feel like bringing it up until I atleast met the other girl or we got to anything real instead of just random one, two line flirting that would be the only conversation we had every couple of days. I was planning on telling her though if the new girl's status in my life amounted to anything more than random flirting.

Now where this gets complicated is when my ex told me she started dating someone about 5 months ago (early May). She kept me posted with details even before they started dating, such as when the guy made moves at her and she wasnt sure, and I advised her when she needed it. It seemed pretty normal. This was why she was very pissed when I didn't tell her that I started meaninglessly flirting with someone. She said that she told me everything and that it was a violation of our trust for me to not tell her the same. I got a lot of shit for it, and she took it to heart. I agreed that I was in the wrong, and I apologized, and i even stopped talking to the new girl, coz it didnt seem like it was going anywhere anyways. This friendship meant too much for me to say anything else. 

But reel in to August of this year, I find out from a mutual friend between me and my ex that she started dating this other guy in February. And plus my ex told me that they hadn't done anything but held hands, and kissed like ONCE since she still wasnt sure if she was really into the other guy. Turns out, they'd been fucking all the time between February and August (when they broke up). Now I don't need to know all the details and I'd completely understand if she wasnt comfortable sharing this with me. But she lied to me, and then gave me so much shit for doing the same at a much much smaller scale. 

Unfortunately for my ex, her relationship ended, and she graduated from college and is struggling looking for a job. Despite of what I know, I feel a sense of responsibility and concern for her, and I offered her a place to stay with me till she lands a job (we don't have anyone else to rely on/live with here). So, she now lives with me and I have still kept what I know a secret. This wasn't that difficult to do until recently when she keeps bringing up the new girl stuff I did without telling her as a justifier for not having trust in occasion. She will sometimes do it jokingly, and sometimes itll be serious. 

My question to you all is, What do I do now? I cannot tell her what I know and that her expectations mean shit if she lied to me for so long because then, she wouldn't be okay living here. I don't want her to go back to our home country because I genuinely care for her and she put in a lot of money and hard work into college for 4 years. I want her to get a job and then I can tell her about everything so we are clear. Or I might never bother mentioning this given we are not going back to dating ever. What would you do?

TLDR: dated girl for about 4 years, we mutually broke up, still very close friends. Trust issues because I didnt share the fact that I was online flirting. Turns out she was dating someone else for months already and didnt tell me. Do I confront her or let it be since our friendship is important to me?",06Oct2019,1

Some background information: I'm a female in my twenties and I live in a European city. Last year, I fled to a women shelter do to domestic violence by my family. The police told them not contact me in any way.  A little while ago I moved out of the shelter to my own appartment.

Apparently, my family is still searching for me. I just found out that my family found out in which city I am living. They also found out at which university I study and some of my new contact information.

Right now I am beyond terrified and I don't feel safe anymore. I live alone and don't have friends that can help me. I had already an appointment with my therapist schedulded for tomorrow.

531,"I've been talking to this guy that I met on tinder and things had been going really well. We went on a date and both had a really good time, and later confessed that we were falling for each other.

The other day I made an assumption about him that really hurt his feelings, and I said that I thought things wouldn't work out between us because of what I assumed about him. He cleared up the misconception, but said that he  couldn't be with someone who was debating whether they wanted to be with him or not. I told him that I thought that the assumption I made about him was true and that I would like to be with him now, but he said that it was goodbye for now.

I really liked this guy and didn't want to lose him, so I sent him a bunch of texts begging him to reconsider. I know it was a very desperate move and I'm not proud of it or justifying it. He responded a few hours later saying that he could be friends with me for a bit and he would maybe take me back. I told him that I was ok with that and he said he would take me back at some point, just not now. Later that day, he was acting like we used to before the incident. We were talking sexually and sending nudes and he said he wanted to do out on a date with me and that if it goes well, he'll ask me to be his boyfriend.

The next day, I apologized to him over text. I told him that my behavior was very inappropriate and that this was a learning experience and I wouldn't do it again. He told me not to send him a bunch of messages if things didn't work out between us and I promised him that I wouldn't and that I was out of line when I did that. He said that he was glad to hear it and that someone who can admit their mistakes and learn from them is a good guy.

533,"Throwaway account.

This is starting to freak me out. Basically there is this girl I have been friends with for a long time (maybe 2 years), and I have had a big crush on her for about that long as well. When I asked her out (technically twice), she said she would if things weren't going well with her current boyfriend who lives very far away. I've waited for her for so long without her making a move and I thought that maybe just getting over it was the best thing for me and her, so I started. Ever since I started I have been having dreams of us talking about explicit things that I would never talk about if you get what I mean. I have had a dream every day in a row for 3 days now and I really don't know what to think of this. I can't stop thinking about it and it's driving me insane. Of course she's attractive but this is really extreme. What do you guys think? Am I a creepy weirdo?",06Oct2019,1
534,"TLDR; Been friends for a couple of years, hooked up, and now a while later, have feelings.

Throwaway for reasons, but title says all. I (M 23) met my best friend (F 21) a couple years ago at work. We would have the same shifts and are currently in the same friend circle. We‚Äôve always been touchy with each other, but it wasn‚Äôt until us hooking up that I realized that I may have feelings for her. The night we hooked up, we had gotten super drunk at the bar, and had ended up coming back to my place. Long story short, one thing lead to another, and we hooked up. I have always had some sort of attraction/connection to her, but that night answered it all. I recently went on a trip to Europe over the summer so for those 4 months, I didn‚Äôt see her. I just recently came back to work, and seeing her again has made me so happy yet so depressed at the same time. We had never gotten around to talking about that night, and it kills me inside to think that maybe she doesn‚Äôt feel the same way I do or thinks nothing of that night. The whole time I was in Europe all that I thought about was her and that night. Any advice on what I should do?",06Oct2019,1

537,"So I've joined uni this year in India (IDK if the country makes a difference also I'm Indian if it matters) and I came in through a special quota which allows all Non-Residents of India and citizens of other countries to join the institute. The institute I'm studying in is famed for [ragging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragging) (in the city ever since it's inception 50 years ago) and is on the Union/Central Government's watchlist.

This institute follows a GPA system that goes from 0 to 10. To get a job in a good company, one of the criteria is to have your GPA above 8.5. Only a few of the seniors have their GPA above 8 (Around 5ish) and the rest of them are dangling around with a GPA of 5-7 and a handful of them have failed in most of the subjects in their respective semesters.

In the first year of uni, everyone from this quota will live in a hostel with students who came through the normal admission process. From the second year on to the fourth year, we'll have to live in a different hostel with ""upgraded facilities "" (Since we're paying more than what the other students are paying.). To be frank, the hostel is crap. The place is very dirty with trash lying everywhere in the corridor, the occupants get drunk and pee on the water cooler ( The tap water isn't all that clean so common water coolers are installed at different parts of the hostel) and all sorts of drugs are available.

Going through all the stories and data available to me, there's one thing I've realized- no matter how smart or disciplined you are, your life is ruined after you go to that hostel. Eventually, your grades will fall and you'll become like them and there's no coming back.

My seniors want my batchmates and me to learn all of their names, the stream of engineering they're pursuing and the place they've come from. They're gonna call us (to their hostel-the upgraded one) day after tomorrow and ask everyone to say it one by one and identify the seniors without looking up (Freshers aren't allowed to look at seniors' faces, they always have to look down). There are about 100-150 names that have to be learned. I don't mind learning it but we're having our end semester exams next month (Less than that actually) I really can't afford to waste time on anything else. Since a festival is being celebrated the day they're calling us, they'll give us food and stuff (everything I've mentioned before) and we'll have to stay there for a few days (Even though we have classes the next day). They've started giving us cigarettes to smoke but would take it back if we decline. However, they'll ask you until you give in and since you've already started smoking, why not get addicted to alcohol and go for substance abuse too. Knowingly or unknowingly, they'll make us like them.

If I stop associating myself with the seniors in this quota, they'll make sure that I get isolated by everyone. The seniors who came through the normal admission process aren't great either but a few of them are toppers and don't really care what the freshers do (which means I can't talk to them unless I'm in a club or a sports team).

If I work hard this year and come in the top 100 (out of 1100) students, I might get one of the best hostels in the campus (Year-2 onwards) but again, if I don't go to the special hostel, they'll think I don't want to be with them and above process will start.

My question is:

1) How do I deal with the day after tomorrow's situation? I don't have time to learn all their names moreover, I have a lot of assignments to do. Also, I can't afford to live there. The day after I've to submit an important assignment (why would a group of failures even care about my assignments :(( ).

2) How do I get out of this crap next year without being detected by the seniors? 

&amp;#x200B;

Note:

1) I've already messed up with my relations with the seniors (a small oopsie) and they're saying they'll ""deal"" with me later (Probably when they call us for the names thing).

2) I can't go to the anti-ragging comittee because the seniors will figure out who filed a complaint.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; I have seniors who want me to be like them when trying hard not to. I'm screwed on the day after tomorrow.",06Oct2019,0
538,"So I have a goldfish(I think 5 now so not too old) who is usually frantically swimming around his tank Whenever someone enters the room, he has recently though started going to the same back corner of his fish tank and seemingly staring off into space for long periods of time, occasionally I‚Äôve witnessed up to 90 minutes, he barely moves when in this kinda trance-like state.

539,"It‚Äôs always the same cycle. I feel like utter shit, I see it from a different perspective and move on, then I remember all the bad shit at once and it restarts.

This year i‚Äôve felt the most content with myself yet so distant from myself. Recently, i‚Äôve felt like nothing could touch me and motivated. But tonight, all the negativity striked at once.

How does one cope with being ugly? Seriously.  I looked up the question and a statement I found was something similar to ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre attractive and you say it people roll their eyes. If you‚Äôre ugly and you say it, people will make you think that they don‚Äôt think that of you‚Äù and honestly, I relate highly to the latter.

High school is the worst, especially being some large dude who looks too old to be there. I‚Äôm always called/made to feel like a pedophile or pervert, which I‚Äôm assuming is because of my looks. Most of the time, they‚Äôre ‚Äújoking‚Äù and I just end up laughing or smiling it off, but it cuts the deepest. And I just want it to fucking stop.

I know this is a lot of self-pity but right now I don‚Äôt know what to feel other than that. I‚Äôve been going on NoFap streaks in the past few months trying to better myself, but this ultimately seems like what‚Äôs demotivating me.",06Oct2019,1
540,"I'm a temp in an office working in a phone bank.  I've worked there for 6 months and have gotten praise for my work and understanding the industry quickly.  Last week, when my contract was up, I was offered a permanent position but declined. I let them know I was grateful for my time there but as my contract was over I'd be leaving.  I've made friends, socialize with co workers outside of work and generally like the job; but I'm leaving for better opportunities. 

There is a woman I work with, we'll call her Patricia.  She worked with me when I first got there then quit after 2 months total.  She's short with people, unapproachable, generally negative, has a huge ego and (relative info) drunk all the time.  She admitted once to me that she has shown up still drunk from the night before to work.  While I don't care for her,  I just try to keep her at a distance and to my thing.  I'm friendly but don't spend time socializing with her.  

She came back about a month ago after 4 months away to help out during a high volume time.  She straight away pointed out  I didn't update a phone number on an account; ok,  I'll make sure I don't miss another one.  And that I neglected to put a zip code in another time; sorry,  my bad.  But for the 4 months she was gone, I've never had a complaint.  That's fine... I know I'm good.  

Friday she pulls me over to her desk to talk with me.  She says she's looking out for me and wanted to tell me that I'm messing up all over the place and she's hiding it from the supervisors so I don't get fired. I'm stumped.  I ask her what she's referring to and she just says I'm sloppy and fucking up everything.  I ask for any kind of example and she has none.  Then she says people are calling in specifically complaining about me.  I know this isn't true... I again ask for some kind of example and she makes something up that's quite impossible for me to even do.  (Walking a client through a procedure we don't offer) I said no, this didn't happen.  

Later I find out she's talked with at least 2 people I work with telling them that I'm drunk at work all the time.  (She deduced after another co worker told her I had a flask in my purse when we were going out after work)  I know she's drinking at work which is so ironic and makes it kinda Twilight Zone-y. 

I don't drink at work.  I'm naturally chatty and bubbly and when I drink I'm more so.  I'd be a drunk flirty inappropriate rep if I was!  

I've got 2 weeks left, but I don't want Patricia's accusations tripping me up on the way out.  I take pride in my work and feel like she's trying to hurt me professionally.  It seems so petty but I'm so frustrated and it's making me uncomfortable. It's all false and it is mildly infuriating. 

I plan on calling a meeting with my immediate supervisor Monday morning to share my frustrations but am wondering if this is the right move.  Clearly I'm doing a good job if they offered me a permanent position and I've not once been reprimanded.  I've recieved positive feedback from everyone I've worked with including the VP of operations.  I *know* I'm doing a great job.  Should I just ride this out and be thankful I'm leaving? But then, should management be aware of what's going on with her and the fact that she has slandered me to at least two of my coworkers?

My parents want me to donate my entire first paycheck to the church and then 10% of each paycheck after that. I'm not even making that much and I'm also not allowed to work that long so I'm not really making a lot of money.

They tell me that they'll pay for my college tuition but they don't even have a savings account or anything set up (I'm the eldest and neither of my parents have been to college in America so we're just figuring things out as I grow up). And before anyone comments about financial aid, my parents make enough to be considered middle class so we wouldn't get much anyway. And a lot of their paycheck goes to hospital bills.

So I don't really see how they can pay for all of this, and I don't really want to give all the money I'm earning to our church because there are more important things in my life. Should I just go along with it? I mean it's only 10%, but also every bit counts. Advice?",06Oct2019,1

He broke things off with her when we started talking and has been honest about that from the start. 

Anyways, she‚Äôs freaking crazy. I‚Äôm not perfect but this girl is off the charts. She will not stop posting break up quotes on Facebook, makes weird statuses about how he broke her heart, and texts him long messages constantly. There‚Äôs a lot more but I don‚Äôt feel like going into too much detail. He told me he would block her and I told him he didn‚Äôt have to.

I‚Äôm afraid that if he blocks her the threats will turn real and that‚Äôs the last thing I want to happen. I know he feels the same way and it makes me so sad that he is in this position.

553,"Hello all,

I'm a male, 24 year old who has had anxiety for many years now. I believe that my anxiety started to get worse when I left for university at 18, and I have had problems ever since. I went to university about 5 hours away from home; a home I was particularly fond of and a place where I felt very comfortable. I'm now a Ph.D. student, living about an hour and a half away from home.

Since I left for university, I have had many issues crop up. The city where I studied wasn't conducive to feeling safe and secure, with lots of unsavoury characters, attempted break-ins etc. It was quite a depressing place. My parents broke up when I was 17, after me, my brother and my mother came back from living in France. My Dad stayed there, but then moved back to the UK in 2014. I do see him, but I couldn't call the relationship 'deep'. My mother started caring for her parents in 2011, and quickly became depressed and spent most of her time away from the family home. My brother started growing up quickly and struggled without a present Dad and a distant mother. I had a very close family: my aunties and uncles, cousins etc. Now we all barely speak and I've lost touch with most of them... lots of family issues that stem from the death of my grandmother, sibling rivalry between my mother and her siblings etc. Lots of tension between us cousins now. It has felt like a lot.

I'm giving you this background information to see if you fellow sufferers of anxiety feel in any way similar to me. I often find myself LONGING for comfort. It feels like a distant memory of where I felt safe, warm, cosy and comfortable in a family house. I often spend my time thinking about events like Bonfire Evenings, Halloweens, Christmases... times where I felt happy, safe, secure, and loved. The idea of 'cuddling up on the sofa' and watching a film no longer feels 'cosy', and I try my very best to re-create these feelings. Yet I never seem to be able to.

Is this just the result of many problems occurring in life? Is it the result of moving from childhood to adulthood? Is it the result of family breakdown? I have no idea, but I'm fed up of feeling this way. Do you have any experience with this sort of thing?",06Oct2019,1

557,"I really have no one to talk to without causing drama, my friend group last night is in a massive divide our groupchat has been deleted and both sides have made a groupchat. I know it may not seem like a big deal but it is these friends have been there with me for all 4 years of my highschool along with that groupchat. So basically what caused this divide was this kid who will call Bob use to go to our school but left freshman year do to him failing classes and being all in all a shitty human being and his dad caught wind of that. All my experiences with Bob always contain some sort of drama he uses people to his advantage to climb up the social ladder. His mom wants him to be popular so buy him anything spoils him rotten he has two bedrooms, a macbook pro, iphone 11 and 50k Jeep Wrangler thats modded and what not. Well anyway he left so sophomore and junior year where super fun! All my friends had a good time no drama. So then we catch wind Bob is coming back senior year, and I flip out, half of our group flips out including my super sensitive emotional friend who will call Will. Will is super funny, kind but cannot take a joke or anything negative hes super self conscious I guess. He has no sense of hygiene he doesnt keep up with his car, cloths or supplies he just is kind of a mess and I guess isnt aware of it. Bob really hurt Will freshman year so Will freaks the fuck out. Eventually senior year comes and Bob invites one of the people from our group will call Henry. Now Henry I never really was found of he is similar to Bob he uses people and main goal is to be ""popular"" and get laid. He does whatever he thinks is cool and is trying to get with a girl. So he gets invited to one of Bobs partys with girls, and two of Bobs friends. Henry goes then tells Will to calm down. Anyway time moves on we dont got any beef we just avoid Bob. But bob is hanging out with Henry more and more. Then long story short we play minecraft on my friends world and we are dicking around and destroy Henry and Bobs house due to the fact they built it right on top of ours. They FLIP out say we have some hate for them and take it outside the game of minecraft. Me and my friends are in aw and Henry stops hanging with us and Bob ignores me and blows me off. Eventually homecoming comes around I make up with Bob and Henry at hoco due to us being in the same groups have a great night. Then this week Bob and Henry continue ignoring me and telling some of my friends that I ""HAte them"" which I dont at all they just ignore me. So then last night, Will my sensitive friend goes and hangs out with Bob and Henry and he who disliked them the most is just converted. Will then tries to glue our group with them by adding them to the gc. My friend Paul did not have it and instantly removed him it happened 3 times. Bob, Henry and Will then make gc spamming asking why we ""Hate them"" why we are ""salty"" we ignore it do to the fact they are trying to get a reaction or create some drama stirring the pot. Because all our epxeriences with Bob have been heavily under Drama and we are just trying to be pals have fun and not be involved in a bunch of drama so we dont want to hang with Bob. But I guess Bob cant stand being not liked or not being accepted or is trying to stir up something so he is persistent. and Will my friend is acting like some mediator between us. Its just annoying I dont know what to do, do I ignore them, tolerate them befriend Bob again who has hurt me and my friends and been involved and caused drama. I wanted my senior year to be fun but now that Will and Henry wont due anything without Bob someone we dislike it sucks. I just want things to be like senior and junior year I miss those times. I talked to Bobs friend and he told me that Henry and Bob think we are immature with our humor and that we ""hate them"" why would we cause we dont want to hang with fake wannabes who create problems. We just want a fun year I dont know how to handle the situation I am at a standstill any moves I make I feel could alter our friend groups friendship the groupchat is in ruins we already feel divided I am yet to see tmrw how everyone acts.

560,"Hello guys,  


I have recently turned 20 and I work as a software developer for a legacy company. I hate the field where I'm working on because it's not rewarding and it's not fun as it used to be. I found myself get into anxiety and the thought of getting stuck in this job forever got me scared me so much that I started to learn programming in a new field, I have been working every day, I 7 months, I only got 2 weeks of rest.  
I have been working on a project with a guy I met online and reached a Minimum Viable Product, we decided to apply for a startup accelerator and they scheduled their time to talk about our proposal.

Now if it was successful, we would be able to receive funding from the accelerator and launch our product to the market, we will be matched with advisors in their network and get to see for the first time in NYC till now everything is awesome but there's the problem: I will need to leave my job, my family and stay in NYC( I currently live in Italy ) and stay there for 4 months.

This is something completely new, and I fear acting on it and ever take the call given. I have one part of my brain saying that I should do it no matter what and the other one that says to play safe, but I really think that I'm missing a big opportunity. When will it ever happen that a jr. developer gets chosen for starting a startup and everything is paid for?

And not to say that the accelerator program starts in November, so everything is getting faster, I really don't know what to do now.",06Oct2019,1

None of this was paid. I did it to be nice.

But now she won‚Äôt leave me alone. Asks me to look over her resume again and again and make recommendations. Sorry, but no. I helped before and honestly I don‚Äôt want to help anymore and I think that‚Äôs a reasonable ask.

Hi, this is my first post so bear with me.

So my mom has been seeing this guy for about 2 and a half years. They broke up a couple times and they‚Äôre currently separated but trying to get back together. 

The guys daughter doesn‚Äôt want us in her dads life. She sent 2 nasty messages to my mom stating that she has no respect for us and shit.

His daughter is 30 with a husband.

(For clarification I‚Äôm 16F and my dad passed away a few years ago. Moms boyfriend lived with us for about 8 months as well)

Well, the guy my mom is seeing recently moved into a new place and hasn‚Äôt even been there 2 months.

His daughter inserted herself into his life with her husband. At first it was understandable because they have a mould issue. About 2 weeks to fix totally. Now they are finding a new place and won‚Äôt be out until spring. On top of that, his daughter knows all his passwords and keeps stealing money from him and blocking us on his phone.

And to make matters worse is my mom is having a major surgery in a few months, (about December presumably) and will be out of work and will have no one to care for her. 

We talked to her boyfriend and asked him to help us. He was and still is happy to oblige, but now everything is ruined and mom has no one to care for her. No family or anything.

I wanna tell his daughter to fuck off and to let him live his life.

Let your parents live their lives. You have your own.


TLDR: crazy bitch won‚Äôt leave her dad alone and is trying to insert herself in his life while erasing my mom and I.",06Oct2019,5

573,"This situation is a bit complicated. I'm currently jobless and need to find a way to get away from my family, it's pretty bad. Any ideas?

Here's the backstory. I grew up in a family that was on the poverty side, I didn't get the chance to get much knowledge on anything because we just couldn't afford it. Movies, games, cloth brands, ECT and I was basically a care giver for my father. I was 23 when he passed on. Ironically the day after my birthday. My mom panicked and started dating someone almost immediately, and then moved us half way across the country to live with the boyfriend. I finally had a chance to get a job and life but it was taken away before I had much of a chance. After 6 months I landed a job at Walmart, but it didn't work out, I left after 3 months because of family issues, I didn't have a driver's license, I was being dropped off 1-4+ early and sometimes waiting 1-4+ after work for a pick up. I needed unlimited data on my phone to research customers questions because, I was to poor to have the personal knowledge needed, if I upgraded my phone plan, I'd be kicked out. Yes, you read that correctly.

I landed a job at a warehouse. My mother then finds out 8 months later, that the rent I'd been giving from both jobs hadn't been saved up for a car, the boyfriend spent alot of it. She dumped him and took me with her. A few days later, they made up and she moved back in. The problem was, I lost the job because of that and received a one year ban from working there again. My brother lost his job about a month before hand and my mom took him to the DMV to get a license a few days after wards for him to drive himself to job interviews, when I lost my job, neither one wanted to help me with my job search. My mom finally took me to the DMV 4 months later on October 30. Shortly after almost every company had there national hiring days, I missed at least a dozen of them. The car then kept breaking for the next 2-3 months. I had about 2-3 weeks of actual job searching time but, nobody was hiring anymore. I was coming back from the grocery store and was in a car accident in February. The car was totaled. I took 2 months to personally recover and an additional month to figure out the car issue. The boyfriend even had the guts to say those 2 months can't be used as an excuse for not having a job, I should of had a job during that. üòí I also ironically received 8 calls for interviews the week after the accident.

To help save on time, from this point up until now, any interview I somehow got, they asked, why were you unemployed for so long? Because the people I live with are jerks üò≠. There's a crap ton of other personal things they did, like my brother kidnapping me once. BTW, I also have 17k of medical debt from February that my mom and the 
Boyfriend refuse to give me the paperwork for.
Any ideas of what I could do here would be greatly appreciated.",06Oct2019,1

575,"I've noticed that I often get unreasonably angry whenever someone does something I perceive to cross a line in these respects, even something minor like saying ""watch where you are going.""  I become almost delirious with rage, and feel that I simply cannot continue until I've told the person off or humiliated them worse in return.  

Even this is not always satisfactory, however.  I often obsess about not having been ""assertive enough"" and find myself having irate, often violent, fantasies of humiliating or taking revenge against the other person.  (Very importantly, however, I know the difference between fantasy and reality, ultimately understand that these thoughts are disproportionate, and feel in no danger of ever acting on them.)

I am currently a freshman at Colgate University where I am receiving quite a bit of financial aid. I did have to pay a bit out of pocket, but that was covered by my 529 account.

If I say something to her while she rambles for hours about this, she starts to scream. I don't even reply and she keeps going.

In her opinion I am leaving for money and that I am ashamed of her, my family and my country. This is not true. I want to leave because I am not happy here. I do not share a lot with the people I go to school to, my friends or my family and I don't see me happy staying here. It's just not worth it living like this just to please them.

Now, since the breakup I've started smoking like crazy, im cobstantly wasting myself etc, to put it short im kinda fucked up.

Problem is, were friends and shes the girlfriend of another good friend of mine. I picked up the hints that she might liked me a little more (basically, when we were out she would spent all the time with me and not her bf, aleays asks me if i would come, too and all that stuff), but i shrugged it off as 'good friends'. Well, a few days ago on a party we got into a real deep talk and i really picked her apart, and well don't want to write down all the shit she told me but it boils down to she wants to break up. Why? Well, her bf treats her well, has money, is studying, good looking...well just everything. Except one thing. Hes a little boring. Now, there's more to it than just that but i think thats really the main issue. I think she likes me more than is good for both of us.

594,"To be perfectly honest, I've never really had friends before apart from a brief period as a high school freshman when I somehow accumulated quite a few people I hung out with on a daily basis. I ended up having to switch schools mid-year and, as per usual, at the new school I knew no one and continued my streak as a recluse. Over time, my old friends stopped contacting me due to not seeing me nearly as much. That was the first, and last, time I ever had friends. 

Anyway, I googled for advice and got solutions such as joining clubs. I joined a psychology organization, since it was the only one I was interested in (I'm a psychology major). Well, the org only meets once a month, so that wasn't the best option. 

I try to smile at people when we make eye contact and do nice things like hold doors open for them or whatever, because I know I have strong resting bitch face syndrome and I look intimidating overall because of my grunge/gothish choice of wardrobe. I know that can be offputting for some people. 

I'm just completely lost, and I always have been. It's been so long since I've had a conversation with someone my age that wasn't school-related. I've never gone out to have fun with anyone my age apart from my brief fling in high school. I spend most of my time with my pet cat or my family. I go to school or work, then I come home. 

I'm starting to feel completely hopeless. The fact that nobody seems interested in being my friend makes me feel like there's something wrong with me that isn't obvious enough for me to notice. I do have chronic mental illness (depression and DPDR) that gets in the way of things, but I would totally do my best to deal with it if I had legitimate friends. I just want a few deep connections with people, that's all. Hell, just 1 would be fantastic. 

I guess I should also mention some things about me. I already said I dress grunge/goth. I'm also into gaming, art, anime, and science of all kinds. I am part of LGBTQ+. I live alone in an apartment with my cat. I go to school full-time and work part-time at a grocery store that I loathe lol. I plan on moving as far away from my hometown as possible when I graduate, but still able to visit my family whom I love dearly. I've always felt like a complete oddball here, very out of place. But I figured by now I'd have found some other weirdos to befriend. Back in high school, I used to hope I'd find friends in college. Now in college, I'm hoping once I graduate and move away, I'll find a more diverse setting and branch out more. 

I'm probably rambling too much. I'm interested in reading what others have to say about this. Thanks to those who reply, if any.",06Oct2019,2

I got dressed up and everything and was excited for a good night. My boyfriend was looking for his wallet in the house. When I tried to offer help, I asked him if he was sure it was in my apartment, then as soon as I asked where the last time he saw it was he snapped at me, and called me repetitive and annoying.

I would get over it, but the way it was spoken was so vile it caught me off guard. He gave no reason for me not to believe he meant it. We have been dating for 10 months and this is the first time he's been nasty towards me. We haven't had a single altercation. I treat the boy like he's an angel, I did not deserve this at all.

He cried and got so upset at himself. I told him I was not mad and dropped him and his friend off at the show. I went home because all I wanted to do was cry.

I do not want to talk to people because I am hyperconscious of things I say more than ever. I do not want to see him and feel very resentful for making me feel this way. He knows how much I dislike the way I interact with people and he knows I think I annoy everyone.

How can I get over this? Am I overreacting?",06Oct2019,1

Anyways anytime i try to talk to him about my concerns and fears he just says ‚Äúyour being crazy‚Äù.

The kicker is he has no real expectations on my part to do anything and is even willing to throw in some presents. Like im so fucking confused as to whats going on...Im assuming he‚Äôs just letting me stay here cause im in a tough spot and it costs money to move out but he says that doesn‚Äôt even matter.

I was at a party and I ask everyone who was there should I go get stitches or will it be okay ( they were sober) they all said no.

Hello, I'm living in Hong Kong since I was born. As you know, there are protests happening in Hong Kong. Some still believe in China's communism and my father is one of them. Months ago me and my family agree that none of us can talk about politics so not arguement will happen at home.

However one day my father just talk about it, my sister and I feel offended so we go to our friend's home to live about a month. We hoped that our father will stop it because of this. However after we came back he just keep on doing it for almost everyday. Few hours ago, he did it again. I just can't hold anymore and punch him in the face. I even said ""I don't have a such father like you.""

Now he went out and going to live in a relative's home. I know the thing I did and word I said is horrible, but I have to do it or I'm now dead by jump out of window. I know he love us but I can't hold myself after being disrespected by him. I fear that I will lose my father forever but I just can't accept a father like this. I just want to him to notice what he did wrong but he just didn't.

I know it is quite ridiculous but how should I let him know about the truth about China and Hong Kong and change his mind. I have tried to tell him what China did and he's just like fuck that I'm correct and you're wrong.",06Oct2019,2

602,"22f a few years ago I met a guy on tinder. We talked and FaceTimed (dirty)before we met and then he came over a few days later. We were messing around and I wanted to have sex. He said his penis hurt from masturbating the day before and that he felt weird that I admitted to having (protected) sex with a different guy few days before. He also said he didn‚Äôt want this to just be a one time hookup so he wanted to wait until the second time we hung out. I thought it was fine that I was repeatedly asking and trying to act ‚Äúcute‚Äù and seductive.  He agreed eventually, saying we probably wouldn‚Äôt get the chance again for a while and that he had never seen a girl want sex that bad. We had sex and I think he stopped after I came because he wasn‚Äôt liking it or it hurt, I don‚Äôt remember if he came or how it ended exactly.  I don‚Äôt think he really held any bad feelings against me for it or saw it in a bad way because we hung out for a while afterwards before he left my house that day, and he asked me to hang out again a couple weeks later and we had sex again. We still talked fairly regularly until I stopped contact because I started dating my current bf.

I feel horrible about all of this. I didn‚Äôt realize until I learned more about the true meaning of consent in college that acting that way is not okay, and it dawned on me recently when looking back that I had basically pressured him. I know I didn‚Äôt physically force him to have sex with me, I just feel terrible that I thought it was okay to pester him about it until he gave in. I talked to my bf and my friend about it and they think I‚Äôm overreacting (I have anxiety and tend to worry a lot). I just can‚Äôt stop feeling guilty for the way that I acted as I‚Äôd never do something like that now. I feel like I deserve to be punished or something. Part of me wishes I could ask him how he felt about the situation and apologize but I‚Äôm not sure if that would be appropriate over 3 years later, and I don‚Äôt know how my current bf would feel about that.

607,"I'm a 20 years old male with no job, plays games and does art all day and is on reddit a lot. Lately, I've been feeling like giving up because of people, not being able to get a job, feeling significant and not feeling special. 

Let's start at the beginning. It all started back in 2015 when I was dating a girl (let's call her L). L and I dated for awhile around a year or so and I was happy, ofc we had our on and offs and it mainly happened due to our personality clashing which was fine, so I broke up with her eventually. I broke up with her whilst she was at some concert or something and I was considered a dickhead because I expressed my true feelings to her. After so, around a few months after that we became friends and it was okay till my best friend decided he was hungry for her. He and she pushed me away (take in I found I had anxiety at this point and still effects me to this day) and decided to blame me because of certain actions I'm not proud of happened. I'll admit the arguments happened sometimes because I was a bit jealous.. But for a good reason.

Move onto now and I feel like either I've given up making friends or I seem to have the effect that no one likes me with people. My family itself has been torn apart. My mother only cares for her boyfriend and his kids, my brother is off in his own life, my sister is a spoilt brat who doesn't listen and my dad keeps losing his job due to anger.

614,"So this guy (m26) and I (f27) have been constantly talking for 1.5 years. We live in different cities, around 8h distance, so our relationship remained online. However, we became very close, talked to each other for hours almost every evening and in weekends. During this time, none of us made an attempt to move the relationship further than a friendship, but eventually I ended up catching feelings for him. 

Being a shy person, it took me a lot of time (and courage) to finally confess to him  - I told him that in the long time we've been talking, I developed feelings and I also reassured him that, even if he doesn't feel the same, we can still remain friends. 
He is also a very shy person, so based on our interaction so far, I was hoping that maybe he likes me too, but he doesn't know how to tell me, so I was a bit taken aback when he friendzoned me. His only answer to my confession was along the lines of ""Don't worry, our friendship is too strong, so nothing can break it, and you are an amazing person, otherwise we wouldn't have remained friends for such a long time.""

I told him I understand, I apologised for the uncomfortable situation I put him in and I promised him I won't mention this episode ever again. He didn't say anything else besides"" I kinda know for a while you have feelings for me."" and, after that, our relationship resumed to the same as before and he continues texting me, like nothing happened.
The only difference is that I can't text him anymore the same way I usually did... Ever since I confessed, he was mostly the one starting the conversation and, although I told him I want to keep our friendship intact, I can't help but feel like I want to get away from him for good. The rejection hurts too much for now and every time he talks to me, that hurt comes back even stronger and I don't know if I can do this... 
I am planning to tell him I want to cut ties with him permanently,  but before that, I wanted to get some objective insight. 


TL;DR
I confessed to my close male friend and got rejected. Should I leave him behind for good, even if our friendship is great, or should I swallow my feelings and try to move on while keeping our friendship intact?",06Oct2019,1
615,"I own a house and was living alone, and about a year ago offered a very good friend of mine an inexpensive place to live, as she was unable to find something that fit her needs and budget, distance from work, etc.  It's nice having a modest income from rent, and it's nice having help take care of my pets, but I have been starting to miss having my own space -

This year has been very rough for her. She's had to deal with major dental/reconstructive surgery (a 6hr procedure) which, because of the long-term restrictive diet, has added to depression and diet issues.

She has been far too involved in one of her friends' struggles with alcohol addiction and rehab treatments, and basically has been caring for (and falling in love with) his dog for the last month while he's been in inpatient care.  Well, he got out of treatment and went back to drinking, so she wisely ended her relationship with him - and so she's dealing with a messy break up and never getting to see the dog she loves, adding to her depression.

I do love and care for her, and seeing her struggle has made me want to help - and so I try to encourage her to meal plan, to take care of herself, to see a therapist - but this is always met with resistance, which she resents in herself, which makes her feel worse.

As a roommate, she's been drinking more and cleaning less.  She's not a slob, and she does help out around the house, but I'm not sure she realizes how much goes into the house upkeep.  We tried printing out a chore chart, making a dry-erase chart, all sorts of stuff.  She is working on drinking less, and making some progress.

It's become frustrating to have a roommate that is sad and mopey all the time.  Because of the depression and anxiety, I feel like I have to be very very careful what I say, as it will almost always be heard as some kind of negative criticism. My house usually feels filled with negative energy.

She's noticed that I've been more distant, she worries that I'm mad at her...and while I'm not mad at her, I'm afraid that to be honest and tell her that I'm frustrated by her depression and anxiety, that I miss having my own space, that she's bringing me down emotionally, and that I'd like her to move out...well, I worry that to hear that would make it even harder for her to get healthy.

There's no lease agreement or anything like that, and part of the understanding when she moved in was that at any point either of us could decide she would move out, no questions asked...but there'd be questions asked if I asked her to move out, and assumptions made.

Also, by asking her to move out, I am forcing her into a lower quality of life, and that makes me feel very guilty.  If she can't live with me, she can live with her parents for cheap and commute \~2hrs a day, or she can pay the obscene premium to rent her own apartment, or find a house full of roommates to share space with...

Not to mention how much work and time and personality she's put into my home - she helped me pick out tile during a re-model, she's guided the direction of the gardens, we keep bees...

She's talked about moving out some-day, eventually. She has a vision of moving out to some property that is owned by an old friend, living for free, and building some sort of container house or tiny-home.  I don't like the idea that I'm stuck with her as a roommate until she can realize this goal, I don't think it's at all realistic.

My life feels stagnant, and dependent on her in many ways...what do I do?",06Oct2019,1
616,"One of my roommates (let's call her D for the sake of simplicity) bought all our roommates matching vibrators a while back. Last night, I had two friends over and we were drinking and watching a movie where this girl mentions getting a UTI through masturbating with an electric toothbrush (Booksmart - fantastic movie btw). On that topic I offhandedly mentioned I had one and when asked how I said D bought all of us matching vibrators. The topic never went back to D so her name wasn't brought up again but the guy (let's call him T) just asked me random questions about my use of the vibrator or whatever lol. T is also a friend of D's. Today D and I were catching up on our weekend and I mentioned that T now knows that we all have matching vibrators and she got upset because she doesn't want people knowing things that are personal to her. My other roomies aren't aware that T or my other friend that was also there (who wasn't really paying attention to the convo) knows about any of this. It just got really silent and she just told me to continue the story but wasn't really responsive when I tried to continue. After finishing her meal she just went back to her room.

I know I fucked up and I don't know what to do.  I apologized to her then and just said that I don't have an explanation, it just came out and I wasn't thinking. I also just thought in that moment that it wasn't super private and I wasn't distinctly talking about D, she was just mentioned offhandedly. I was also pretty drunk which doesn't excuse it and my mind was clearly not thinking. I don't know what to do or how to fix or approach it. I want to apologize to her again but I don't even know what to say. Do I tell my other roomies that T knows? Does it really matter that they know he knows? He doesn't talk to the other two and one of them is studying abroad for a few years so she's not even hear. I just feel so horrible and chances are she might have told them that he knows. She's clearly pissed and she has every right to be but now I feel like she just won't really speak to me about anything personal. Please help.",06Oct2019,1

620,"To receive more accurate advice/answers, I'll start off with giving some background information.

I am a middle schooler who is currently achieving decent grades, with my worst one at the moment being an A- (which I still can't stand to look at today.) I have achieved grades of  similar evaluations in the past, so my grades are pretty stable, to say the least. I, am spoiled. Spoiled to the extent where I get materialistic gifts here and there and I get small necessities when I need them most of the time. I am NOT spoiled to the extent where I can not handle denial and I am not that much of a brat. I still keep my manners in public, and I might as well say I keep more manners than my dad when going out.

I have deep interest in clothing, technology, and photography, and as long as I obtain good grades, I get a moderate amount of money to spend on all of these. Yes, what matters is the grades, which I guess is pretty standard being asian. My clothes are more higher-end brands rather than H&amp;M and Zara, and the money I invest into technology and photography is no joke (aspect of my life where i'm very spoiled). When the semester ends, and I make it onto the honor roll list, I receive $300 as a gift from my parents. I get $600 when I make it onto the high honors list, which as of this moment, I haven't exactly done, but I predict for this year to be a good one. I love community service, and when I get into high school I plan to do some overseas, which is expensive, and I feel like I'm spoiled for wanting to spend that much money on community service.

I am in one of those situations where I think I'm super spoiled at times, and then think I'm just slightly spoiled. I eat mostly decent priced food when I go out, and very occasionally I will have a steak at Ruth Chris when I feel like it. My classmates for which I am not close to perceive me as a spoiled international student (I am Asian-American, but I keep up with a lot of Chinese and Korean culture, which is why they think I'm an international.) I personally believe that they think of me this way because many classmates in my school live in projects and 60% of the students in my school live off free/reduced lunches. My close friends don't see me this way (for the most part) because they are of equal wealth/social status.

To get to the point, I am wondering if my future will be ruined by my lifestyle. I have heard that spoiled kids will never make it anywhere in society and I am gradually starting to believe this. My parents have high expectations for my future, and they are taking small steps like sending me to a private and having a tutor over at my house to help increase my academic standing. By no means am I the best student in my school, so I personally don't think that I will be successful, especially with the way I am living right now.

623,"I know everyone says forgive but don‚Äôt forget. I know everyone tells me if I don‚Äôt forgive, I‚Äôll go to hell. Well, I believe in second chances but not thirds, and I don‚Äôt believe in heaven or hell. 

What I‚Äôm saying is, I have a medium / small sized family, and everyone has their bad blood and exclusive cliques in it. The only thing is, I‚Äôm the only one who doesn‚Äôt have a clique. im alone in my family and I have been since I was a very small child. I‚Äôm going to try to make this as simple as possible without telling my whole life story (although I think I‚Äôm about to so sit down and buckle up for this long ass article). I just need to know if I‚Äôm a bad person here and if I‚Äôm supposedly doing the wrong thing. 

In my family, to put it simply, every person is a piece of shit in their own ways. It started with my mom who is an alcoholic and chose her new husband over me, her daughter, long ago and every single day over and over again today, she didn‚Äôt feed me or take care of me, I raised myself when I needed to be at her house. So I moved out of her house and into my dads, except he‚Äôs very abusive. so to start things off, I have a list of people in my life, and my mom and dad are crossed off. I don‚Äôt care to keep them in my life anymore, I just keep them out of it. I‚Äôve seen who they are, I‚Äôve seen that they‚Äôre not worthy of being in my life, so I choose to keep them out of it. 

Then, my grandma and aunt. My grandma was always good to me, my aunt has always been a cold hearted gossip girl who throws anyone and everyone under the bus if it means she can have some gossip material and always be in the spotlight. She‚Äôs also a cheater and a whore. So she‚Äôs off my list as well. But my grandma, she has changed. Since she started exclusively hanging out with my aunt. My grandma is now abusive to me, talks shit about me for years now right in front of me to my other family members, when I used to feel like she was the only person in the world I have left. She is also no longer in my life and I chose for it to be that way. Off the list. 

Well, I still had my grandpa and my one cousin who I‚Äôm on good terms with (my two other cousins are also pieces of shit who I chose not to have in my life by default). Although N, the last cousin I have left, has been on thin ice with me. He always makes fun of my height, my acne, the fact that I‚Äôm not a total hillbilly like he is, etc. he always does it in front of an audience and I fucking hate it. Also, side note, he‚Äôs an asshole in general. But one day a couple weeks ago he was putting on a huge show of making fun of my height in front of all of my family, so I annoyedly but playfully gave him a tap on the head but noticed I did it a little harder than I meant so I turned around to tell him I‚Äôm sorry. But he punched my full force in my eye, I got knocked back, and yelled ‚Äúfor fucks sake, N‚Äù and beat him up in a rampage for about 4 seconds. I‚Äôm sure that sounds extreme but my life is disgustingly difficult and I‚Äôm constantly on the verge of suicide and I have no outlet, him doing that to me then punching me in the eye just sent me off the brink. 

So needless to say N is off my list. He was already a piece of shit and I was trying to cope with it, but I will no longer. 

A week later I learned that my grandpa is telling everyone in the family that I ‚Äúbeat the shit out of my little cousin for nothing and screamed the f-word so many times he couldn‚Äôt count‚Äù (he‚Äôs hardly younger, he‚Äôs fucking 2 years younger than me and I‚Äôm 17. Also, I said the f word once so that‚Äôs kind of bullshit). And everyone in the family just stares and whispers to each other when they see me now. So, grandpa had never caused me problems before, but I know he has molested and violently abused his children throughout their lives, as well as constantly cheats on his girlfriends and gives them all STDs between each other, so I figured he‚Äôs right off the list as well. 

Now, the most recent one was yesterday, where I don‚Äôt want to go into it but my step dad. Who had went out of the way to cancel the girls night out Friday night I had planned with my mom so we could try to have time together and I could be social for once and bond with her. He cancelled them so he could take her drinking like they do every single night of their fucking lives. And then proceeded to make last minute plans to make her go gambling for a whole day from 8AM to 10PM. So I spent 2 days at my moms house, alone, in this quiet dark house, thinking. Crying. Feeling so alone. Wishing I was dead. I had never liked him, he treats my mom like shit, and drives a wedge between us when I actually do try to build a relationship back with my mom. So he‚Äôs done. 

I feel like I have no one in the world. I have music, I have my studies, and my animals. These things keep my going, nothing else. I cry every single day. I wish I was dead. I‚Äôm sure you could say it‚Äôs my fault that I feel so alone, because I‚Äôve chose to kick everyone out of my life. But there comes a point where I have analyzed who a person is and decided that they are not worth my time. My effort. My life. Not worth the risk of what they could do to my life, how they could hurt me, more than they have already, how I know they‚Äôll do all over again when I give them the chance. 

Because I know who I am. I am like a stupid puppy, who loves and loves, and when I get kicked by the one I love, I cry, but I keep coming back, so they can keep doing it to me again and again forever. But I feel like I‚Äôve grown up. I can‚Äôt do it anymore. 

I‚Äôm sorry this has been so long. I just need to know. If I‚Äôm just as shitty as them. Because every time I confess to a family member in my life that I no longer want them in my life, no longer want to attend the family functions, no longer want them in my life, they tell me I‚Äôm selfish, I just have teen angst, and that I‚Äôll burn in hell if I don‚Äôt forgive them so I have to. 

I just need reassurance. Or help. 

TLDR; I‚Äôve kicked almost all of my family members out of my life one by one for hurting me over and over again and I‚Äôm left feeling ashamed for it by them. Am I wrong?",06Oct2019,5

626,"Hi. I am 15, female and a junior in High school. I have had depression and anxiety since I was 11, and for personal reasons, I can't tell my parents. 

Yesterday I had an anxiety attack, for me this means struggling to breath, heart racing, light nausea, thoughts spinning out of control and crying. I was about 15 minutes in and slowly starting to calm down, when I decided to write a letter to myself. It's about three pages long, and I honestly don't remember anything I wrote, but I know it was pretty bad. 

I know I can't open it alone, it would probably trigger another attack or make me feel really, really bad about myself. I just can't do it. I can't open it with my parents for outstanding reasons. That only leaves my friends at school. Only one of them knows about my depression and anxiety, so I thought maybe I could ask her to open it with me. But, I don't know what it says. I don't know if it says something that could make her really worried about me. I don't know if it says that I want to die (I don't). I don't want to worry her too much. 

I could just leave the letter alone, but I think it would be good if I opened it, so that I know how bad things really are (I tend to block those moments out completely). I know I can't open it alone, so should I ask my friend to open it with me or just leave it alone? Please give me your honest opinion, I don't know what to do. Thanks!",06Oct2019,2

* told three+ people about the former crush on said internet friend
* spent six weeks not talking to me apart from four calls in which she talked about various guys she had to friend-zone
* spoke about me negatively to the two former closest people in my life, specifically going to my ex-boyfriend and one of my closest friends since play-school whom i've grown apart from to talk about me
* told people jokes and ideas i'd told her like she'd invented them (not even good ones, just random stuff - even one to do with minecraft of all things?)

I have a friend who lives a few cities away from me, and we're sure she has an eating disorder. She confessed it to me about half a year ago? She hasn't been diagnosed, but at the time she told me that she is obsessing over calories, and that she can't stop losing weight. She told me she didn't want to tell her psychologist, so i supported her and gave her a lot of advice. Lately it has gotten way worse. She told me she weighed about 54 kg (119lbs) (she's 5""6 / 1.72m), and that she knows that she has an eating disorder, and that she is trying to stop, she just wanted to get to 52 kg (114lbs) and she'd stop losing weight. She told me that she doesn't consume over 1000 calories a day, and a few weeks after that she told me she has trouble consuming more than 800 calories.  I have talked with her for over 3 hours every time we have this conversation, and every time i explain to her that her BMI is way too low, that a person with her exercise, age and height should be around 1500 - 2000 and she kept telling me she'd try, and i agreed to help her with a kind of diet plan to get her to start eating carbs.   
A friend of her found her secret twitter account, where she rants about this. She lied to me and currently weighs 46,6 kg (102lbs) and her goal weight is 45 kg. 99 lbs. her BMI is 15.9. 

The thing is, I have tried to help her so much, she doesn't live with family because she has had a lot of family issues (they won't help her anyway), she isn't talking about it to her psychologist which means she's not going to get help, and she does not want to change. I have tried everything honestly, every kind of advice, every kind of approach and nothing is working. I know it's supposed to be her choice and she's supposed to want to change, but I can't just let her die? she is continuously fainting, extremely tired, bruises easily etc.   
I've read a lot of statistics and articles and people who get admitted with a BMI of 11 never make it out of the hospital alive. I'm incredibly terrified and considering telling her current guardian to do something. But I don't know if she would do that.

Basically, I've got a very objectively sex appealing body. (I'm not being narcissistic) just the truth. I started working on my fitness (was overweight nearing obese) lost 50 pounds. started weight lifting... I'm back to my prebabies weight but with huge boobs. 

Today I, for the first time in 5 years, wore a form fitting long sleeve shirt that I got for Christmas from my mother-in-law 6 years ago. It's not a revealing shirt (it's kinda thick wool thread) and very commonly worn here in Norway. 
I wore it over to my in-laws house, my sister-in-law and her husband were visiting. (we see each other often and all of us are actually friends) 

Anyway... First off, my father-in-law (who's never been creepy) brushed my boob with his hand (possibly on accident but I doubt it because of the way he did it) what ever, I could move past that but he did it RIGHT in front of my MIL. She saw it, and a flicker of mixed negative emotions passed in her eyes. Fuck. I didn't want that.

I saw wondering eyes throughout the day on my figure but tried to not think anything of it. Then at the table, I stood up during dessert to get milk for my coffee and my SIL's husband obviously looked at my boobs and she saw that and I saw that she saw and my husband saw all of.

I feel like an attention whore now even though I really REALLY didn't want to be seen in a sexual light by family members.


So, I'm asking. Am I an attention whore if I wear clothes that fit my body in the company of family members? 

I know it was wrong of my FIL to ""accidentally"" touch my boob. (he was wayy more touchy in general today and my MIL definitely noticed btw) 

But I'm also just not sure if I, physically, am too inappropriate for normal properly fitted clothing. 

I fucking sound like I want a circle jerk here to tell me to ""own it girllll!"" but I don't. 

Nothing is black and white, shits gray. 

So? Should I of and should I always dress in loose clothing from now on when around my in-laws? 
(loose clothing is normal for me so it's not a big deal... But I, I'd like to have the choice to go with something that doesn't make me feel like a bubble)

I (24) am fond of teens and children, and I've taught just about every age group at some point. However, while I enjoy a classroom setting, I'm more partial to a one-on-one or small group mentorship style. I don't want any children of my own and had myself fixed a year ago, but that doesn't mean I don't want to ""parent"" children, I guess? I don't know how to describe that, but basically I'd like to mentor teens as a parental figure. I had similar adults in my life when I was a pre-teen and teen, and they were absolutely integral to me being the functional human being I am today. I don't think I would have accomplished all that I have without the teachers and internet adults I met as a teen when my family was absent and shitty. And I want to be that for teenagers, too. I've been thinking of starting a non-profit for a creative after-school program or a safe house of some sort, but financially I don't think I'm there yet. Plus, there's a lot of stigma around non-parental, not-formally-applied-teacher adults hanging out with kids that aren't there's. 

So I guess I'm just asking if that kind of desire is ok or not. Like, wanting to be a teacher is fine but I don't want to work at a school? That's the best I can describe it I think. Informal teachers were so important to me and I want to provide that for others who might be struggling or distant from their families. How would I go about doing this in a professional, acceptable way without people freaking out that I must be some sort of creep? Or is this just completely unacceptable?

My dad is young at heart. He‚Äôs had many, many girlfriends throughout my life. He is a successful, hard working, and good looking man, however for some reason, he has always been attracted to skanky women. I‚Äôm talking women who are on drugs or have been on drugs, don‚Äôt have custody of their children, look kind of filthy, etc. My dad doesn‚Äôt do drugs. He smokes weed, but that is all, and I know that to be true. 

Now, I was an addict for a few years of my late teens/early 20s. I have since recovered. 
A lot of these women my dad hangs around, dates, whatever, are women that are friends with people I used to get high with. A few of them, I *did* get high with or bought drugs from. These women are all my age or younger. I‚Äôm in my mid twenties. My dad just stopped talking to one woman he was interested in after I told him she used to sell me drugs, and also stole from me. But there are probably several more he talks to that I don‚Äôt know about. It honestly just makes me uncomfortable. Not only are the women he sees *my* age, but they‚Äôre people who I know personally and don‚Äôt like, or have mutual friends with.

My mom has reconnected with a woman, we‚Äôll call her Ruth, who she used to be friends with in high school. This happened over facebook, since Ruth lives in another state. My mom is a very kind, generous person, but she‚Äôs very easily taken advantage of because of this. Over the past couple of years that my mom has been talking to Ruth, it‚Äôs become clearer and clearer that Ruth has serious mental issues. When she is upset, she takes it out on my mom and says horrible things to her. For example, Ruth has called my mother a pervert for cuddling my little brother while he was sick, and she even said ‚Äúi should kill you‚Äù after my mom said something to upset her. Then hours later, Ruth will cry and apologize and swear she loves my mom. I can see right through the manipulation, but my mom can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where Ruth will cry to my mom about not having a job, and not being able to feed her children, so that my mom will send her money. And she has, over $150 dollars in the past three weeks. 
I know that my mom is a big part of the problem here, but i love her and care about her, and i hate to see her being manipulated so much. I and many others have tried to tell her that Ruth is crazy and a bad person, but she keeps going back to being friends with her.

668,"My biggest wall of text to date. Also, mobile.

A little backstory: met a friend a couple years ago and through hard work on behalf of myself and my wife managed to become quite good friends with him and his significant other. Hung out regularly, did dinner weekly the four of us, and helped him through some personal stuff.
Now his life has taken a downturn. Just had his first kid in a small apartment (which is great; I have never met anyone more ready to be a father)  and his mother in law had a sudden unexpected diagnosis that is untreatable and terminal. He's strong out trying to work 50 hours a week, visiting MIL in hospital, and taking care of a newborn so his spouse can go see MIL  etc. 
I tried to be supportive as best I can. I'm not overly good with my words oh, so how did send him text every couple of days letting him know that I was thinking about him, hoping things would get better soon, and if there's anything I could do I would. I also suggested different activities such as coming over for a beer, going to a local show, or just going for a walk to give him a way to vent or try to ease his stress.
A week and a half ago while I was out working late, he came over to talk to my wife (who is by far the more emotionally supportive of the two of us). He talked to her how he was extremely offended buy me suggesting activities that took him away from his family. He also said that he had been avoiding me for the last couple of months because he had been insulted by something I had said at a previous outing. I had no idea I had offended him in any way.
I don't want to say or do the wrong thing and push this friendship further away than it already is. It has been two weeks, and I have not sent him any messages whatsoever except to apologize for offending him and being unaware of it. I understand that he is in a really difficult place, with a lot of things on his mind and taking up his time. How do I support him in his time of need while not offending him further? Do I just leave him alone for a couple of months when his MIL passes, and then try to reach out then?
I am painfully aware that i ATA, for thinking of myself first in my relationship with him even though that may not be what he needs at the moment.",06Oct2019,2

Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don‚Äôt say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

So the other night I come home and she‚Äôs SCREAMING at him to get out. Like desperate, scary ass screaming. I think he heard me come in and so he left immediately, really nonchalant on the phone with somebody saying he was coming over. She proceeded to bawl for half an hour, upstairs, perfectly audible even with my door closed downstairs. Like, someone just killed her child-level crying. And I texted her (since we‚Äôre not close) and asked what was up. She basically said she‚Äôd kicked him to the curb because he was (I quote) ‚Äúabusive and manipulative‚Äù and she can‚Äôt do it to herself anymore. This was a few days ago. Last night I come home and he‚Äôs here. Today I asked what the deal was, and she said it‚Äôs complicated, it‚Äôs hard to leave someone after two years and sometimes they just scream at each other.

I dated a girl earlier this year for about 4 months, it was my first relationship. She broke it off in April but it was for understandable reasons and we still stay friends (though awkwardly). Anyway, one day during the relationship after about 2 months or so, I was at her house downstairs watching a movie one night with her and her parents. Then her younger sister calls her mom from upstairs. She tried to commit suicide by overdosing on her depression medication. Her mom was freaking out while her dad went up to get her, my gf at the time called 911. I didnt k ow what to do so I asked the mom if there was anything I could do, but she was in a panic. My gf then grabbed me while running past me still on the phone, and told me she would walk me out. I told her to call me when she could. I then drove off, and made it about halfway home before I stopped and waited at a gas station. I then got a call saying everything was going to be ok with her sister, and i asked if i should come back to the hospital and she said no and i could go home. I told her tell me if she needed anything and that i would stay up late when i got home for updates on what was happening. I guess i figured i should give her some space, so we didn't hang out in person for about a week, but i texted her often that week. 
I look back on that whole scenario and wonder if I should done something differently to help, like go  to the hospital anyway, give her something to make things better, do something the biggt it happened....but what? What do you guys think I should have done if you were in my boots?",06Oct2019,1

But it‚Äôs just so ignorant. Calling me stupid and judging like she‚Äôs god for me using psychedelics to learn what i need. It was positive, and my life will be better because of it. Now is the time to act and better myself.

I know psyches aren‚Äôt the answers to everything, but god dammit, when you‚Äôre ready, and you learn from it, it‚Äôs worth it god dammit.
I learned that i don‚Äôt need drugs to grow in every aspect of myself. But if she would listen and drop her judgements she‚Äôd know that. But she thinks I‚Äôm doing this for fucking fun because it‚Äôs labeled as a ‚Äúdrug‚Äù while she downs a bottle of wine to cope with ‚Äúbeing sad.‚Äù

How can i respond to her? I care about her deeply. She‚Äôs my best friend here. But i wish she wouldn‚Äôt judge me so much.

676,"Hi reddit, long time no see

I‚Äôm here looking for advice with one of my housemates, but before I complain about her, a little about me. I‚Äôm a student at university, studying biology at Queen‚Äôs in Canada. I bartend on Thursdays and weekends, and with my parents paying for 2/3rds of my tuition ditto my room and board, I‚Äôm not too bad off at all. I walk home with my pants so full of loonies that if it weren‚Äôt for my belt I‚Äôd look like Winnie the Pooh. My housemate, on the other hand, works at an on-campus coffee shop- she gets better hours, but much worse tipout. As I understand it from her dad being a lawyer in Ottawa, she has a similar arrangement with her parents. In terms of spending money, I am far ahead of her. Perhaps that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt mind what happened this summer.

This summer it was just me and her. While she was hoping to get all five housemates to split on utilities such that we would pay a quarter each and the rest would get 1/6th to cover fridges / hot water heater rental. I disagreed, saying it wouldn‚Äôt make sense for people who aren‚Äôt living here to pay for *our* utilities bill. Cue the rest of the house nodding thankfully with their unemployed / summer in Cuba / camp counsellor paychecks. Then the first utilities bill hit.

It was some 330 dollars- Canadian, of course, but still ridiculous. I was willing to admit fault for the bulk of the utilities- I had a mini fridge in my room, did my weekly laundry during the day, and would use chrome cast to play ‚Äú24/7 lo fi hip hop study beats‚Äù from the TV instead of my laptop, so upon request I chipped in an extra 75$- just under half of her bill. It helped her case that she spent her weekends visiting her mom in Ottawa, so in a sense 2/7ths of the week should be entirely on my dime. In lieu of the devastating bill to me, I unplugged my mini fridge, started using my ugly ass led study light, and put the tv on an accessible power bar so that when not in use it could be turned off, reducing ambient electricity. I hadn‚Äôt thought I had been using that much electricity, but whatever.

Next bill comes- 310. That‚Äôs odd, considering I stubbed my dick on the stair bannister while stumbling upstairs in the dark after my shifts so much I thought I had an std. I pay a skeptical extra 50$, understanding she has a right to be upset when cross referencing last years utilities when someone was living solo- around 130$. When this happened again next month and my housemate accused me of having no respect for the environment, I ranted to some friends, and they said they had similar problems- one friend lives with her landlord in a shared unit, and he was threatening to evict if she didn‚Äôt drop her electricity. This being all too fishy, I called Kingston utilities and found out that while the RATES haven‚Äôt changed, a base 100$ ‚Äúservice fee‚Äù was applied to all accounts, distributed across hydro water and sewage to look like the bills were high. This was especially frustrating to me to learn, because while I had been going out of my way to turn off every light, I would wake up in the morning to run my dog after a 3-am closing shift and find my housemate left the hall light on because it‚Äôs how she does her makeup. I also learned that she uses a tower fan- not pointed at her, just keeping the ambient breeze alive- every night when she sleeps, which, of course, uses frustratingly large amounts of electricity compared to the honeywell I used twice weekly. Anyway, I thought this matter had been put to rest, but now, early October, I‚Äôve received a message from her asking for me to pay an extra amount again. 

This bothers me for many reasons.

Bothers:

1. Despite taking up a holier-than-thou attitude, she continues to use space heaters, fans, 80-watt Edison bulbs that may as well be heat lamps, take 30 minute hot showers and generally show no indication of deviation from her original utilities usage, she wants me to pay an uneven amount even after we‚Äôve discovered the root of our bill was not each other so much as the Kingston utilities companies gouging us with silent jumps in price (/r/aboringdystopia). I think this is a disrespectful abuse of my roll-over-and-let-them-have-their-way outlook on 80% of problems in life, and hate to think that it likely comes from a place of disrespect. Continuing to play along with her ego can‚Äôt be good, right?

2. She asked in October. If she had had real monetary issues with the August utilities bill, she would have asked me sometime within the last five weeks. This seems to me to be less utilities related so much as a fast cash grab from the guy she knows she‚Äôs duped in the past.

3. She‚Äôs a politics student, and if I know one thing about politics students, it‚Äôs that they think they are all some kind of puppet master. They‚Äôve read ‚Äúhow to make friends and influence people‚Äù eight times and think that if they memorize someone‚Äôs name birthday and favourite colour that they will be entitled to abuse their newfound ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù. I can see it in the way she talks to me- always smiling the same rehearsed smile, eyebrows so high that it has to be forced- I don‚Äôt want to be accessory to that.

But. As with everything, there are sides to both thought processes. 

1. I make more than she does. I‚Äôm a believer in Bernie and economic equality, and in this scenario, I‚Äôm the metaphorical billionaire of the two of us. If she really is coming to me in need of money under the guise of utilities, I would probably give it to her. I‚Äôve spotted friends in the past, they just had to be honest about what they needed the cash for.

2. Saying no to her now, after having gone with it so far, could be burning the bridge right before I finish crossing the river. Now that the rest of the housemates are back, the utilities are fully split once again and balance will be restored. Is it really worth the trouble?

3. I‚Äôve gotten increasingly snakey vibes from her since I moved in in May, and I‚Äôm okay with not being her friend. But as I‚Äôm the new guy, rejecting her could quickly turn to being enemies with everyone in my house, which I would hate because most of them are really sweet people that I love hanging out with.

So what do I do? Do I tell her to go fuck herself, do I pay her and then cut the cord of her massive uranium powered fan/space heater (had a dream like that once and it felt good), do I pay but tell her that this is not coming from a place of utilities so much as a spot of pity for her minimum wage no tips job? Call a house town hall?? Fuck if I know. Help a guy out

Tl;dr, my housemate wants me to pay more than my fair share of utilities but doesn‚Äôt seem to be taking any steps to change her own utilities consumption, do I pay it anyway because I‚Äôve made it this far covering more than my part or do I take a stand?",06Oct2019,3

It was exactly one night in December of 2018 that this revolution has happened in me and since then i think about her every single moment of every day. I've been trying to make contact with her and find a way to meet her but still nothing. I really love her and i need her attention. I actually DESERVE it. I've been through a lot because of her. The fact that i love her this much and yet i can't have her is sad and depressing on its own but my jealousy makes it much worse and much more dangerous. Every time i see a picture or video of her talking, hugging, kissing, hanging out or doing whatever else with another guy i feel extremely jealous and hateful. I feel jealous of her boyfriends. I feel jealous of her producers and co workers like that guy 'Mike Will' who have spent a lot of time with her and talked to her and even touched and hugged and kissed her. I felt jealous when i saw her twerking for Robin Thicke. I am jealous of those reporters and interviewers who talked to her. I am jealous of those lucky bastard fans who could meet her in backstage and take pictures with her and hug and kiss her. The worst of them all was this lucky bastard called 'Matt Peterson'. Just go search 'Miley Cyrus Matt Peterson'and watch the clip in Youtube. That kid has asked Miley to be his prom datein 2014 and Miley has invited him to her concert and there she hugged, kissed, flirted and danced with him and she has singed her flirty song 'i adore you' to him while they were hugging and cuddling and all of those crap that a real prom couple do. She treated him so nicely and she changed his whole insignificent life. This video clip is so toxic and it fills me with hate and anger. It pisses me off more than seeing those guys grabbing her without her consent because in this case she is giving him the permission and she likes him back and she treats him so nicely. It pisses me off more than seeing her with her boyfriends because at least they personally knew her for some time and they used the opportunity but what about Matt Peterson? He is no one. He is just a random loser out of nowhere who had the chance to touch Miley. Lucky bastard. I am not less than some random loser so called fan boy or anyone else. Not only i am not less than them as a human but i deserve her attention more because i love her more and i care about her more than they do. Yet i can't have her. I can't even have a reply from her. Those guys are there touching her and i am here having nothing. It's not fair. It's pathetic. It's unacceptable. I don't deserve this shit.

So let's make it clear. Fuck all of those guys. Especially fuck Matt Peterson for causing me all of this pain. I couldn't eat and sleep properly since i've seen that shitty video. In that video i've seen everything that i hated to see. It was a catastrophe. It was terrifying. It gave me actual PTSD. So fuck him. Miley Cyrus still follows that fool and he still posts about that shit. He is there showing this video to his family and friends and they congratulate him while i am sitting here and watching it and suffering. Fuck Matt. I am tired of hiding these all in myself and saying nothing. Fuck them all. I haven't sent him or anyobe any threats yet because i believe that words should be said after the action was done. I really have some crazy thoughts in my mind and in this situation i am crazy enough to do anything. All i see is death. All i hear is gunshots. I am done with all of these. I just want to pick a weapon and kill those who caused me this pain and then maybe kill myself as well. I think about going right to the place that he lives or works and shoot him right in the head without saying a hi and leave a note on his body saying 'Don't ever do this again Miley'

If i can't have her, i don't like seeing anyone else having her too. If she flirted me too then everything would be ok.

‚Äã So i have one last thing to try. I should ask her out and if she says yes then great but if she rejects me then i'll go insane and i'll talk with my gun instead. Let the bullets decide who is right and who wrong. Believe me that i've been always a peaceful person in my whole life. I've never killed anyone and i've rarely used weapons before but i can't tolerate this anymore. I feel so vengeful and i am totally losing my control...

I may get up and do something suddenly that no ones ever does expect so advice me anything that might be helpful before i do something.",06Oct2019,0

682,"I (21f) have always been self conscious. When I was a child and also some of my teenage years I used to think I'm flat out ugly. I've grown out of that and I think I'm actually pretty now. I'm more or less comfortable in my body too and I'm happy. I do still have anxiety. 
However, it is hard for me to feel sexy. If I try and move my body in a sexy way to tease my boyfriend or just look or act sexy when we go out or in any situation really, I feel ridiculous. I feel like I'm putting on an act and it's not me. And I keep thinking that I must look dumb.
I feel that way especially with my boyfriend. I know he does actually find me very sexy and he thinks I'm beautiful cause he tells me every day and he shows me with the way he acts. I love him so much and we trust each other completely. But because of that I think he knows that I feel a bit uncomfortable when I try to be sexy and he knows I'm more of an introvert so I feel even weirder try to act sexy. 
I would love to be confident enough to just feel and act sexy. I would love to be able to buy some lingerie and then put it on and wait in the bedroom door when he gets home. But when i think of it my brain says stuff like: he'll think it's ridiculous. He'll appreciate the effort but won't actually find it sexy or that I won't know how to move in sexy lingerie or what to do afterwards. 

I hope this text isn't just a mess. How can I improve my confidence and feel sexy?

683,"        I had a job, house, car, truck, and savings up until about one and a half years ago. I was/am struggling emotionally/mentally and a couple I had met online and talked with about everything going on offered for me to move 2000 miles to their home. They had a guest bedroom, I could get a job there etc. They started asking me for money to help them with their debts and I was ok with that. They were about to lose their home and car, and she had just had her second child. In my head, they deserved it and needed it worse than me. Long story short, I gave them all of my savings and every check until I moved. I gave the house I was buying from mom (which has since then flooded 3 times) back to her and told her to do with it what she wanted. I gave away my car to a friends mom, and I gave my truck to a semi retired truck driver that worked at the same company as me.

I moved to these friends halfway across the country and immediately regretted it. I lived in a run down RV that they used as their dog kennel as well. I got sick and they just told me I was being a lazy pos, even though I went back to work. I needed to pay for the gas in the RV but I needed to help them pay their house payment, car, insurance, and for gas. It was the worst time i've had in my life. There was alot more that happened. Anyway, sister reached out to me and asked me to move to her house, so i've been living with her and her family. I've been doing handyman work and waiting for mom to send my birth certificate, so I can get a license here, and an actual job. I have nothing, anywhere, except some clothes and personal items now. 

My brother-in-law just got notice that he won't have a job by the end of November, so they're going to move and they'll be at his parents until they get into a place of their own. I can't go. I broke down shortly after getting here and deactivated my Facebook and any other way I had to contact my old friends. I alienated everyone and i've had no contact with anyone but my sister and her family for a few months. I had a friend asking if I would move there but I don't want to reach out now. It feels like I would be using them. I told my sister I would figure It out and she doesn't know i've done this. I fully expect to leave her house one night and find someplace to just lay down and die. I know she doesn't want that and probably not my old friends either, but I don't know what to do.",06Oct2019,1
684,"I was assigned therapy at age 17 and have been forced by my dad (mom isn‚Äôt in the picture she died when I was young)  to attend a therapist for reasons I do not want to disclose. But it has to do with football is all I will say. Anyways not the point.

She is a pretty women, ten years older then me and hot. Since the beginning I didn‚Äôt take it seriously but she didn‚Äôt care that I would just joke around and be obnoxious (which I did on purpose because I did not want to attend therapy) at one point she began talking about dreams because I called her a native ‚Äúdream catcher witch‚Äù. She asked me ‚Äúhave you had any dreams you want to speak about?‚Äù. This was about four months into therapy and she hadn‚Äôt kicked me even with the douchy things that I regret saying to get kicked on purpose. So I said ‚Äú Yes I dreamed I fucked you on that chair.‚Äù trying to be funny and finally get kicked from this stupid therapy. She laughed and said that‚Äôs okay and I shouldn‚Äôt worry about having feeling like that and should be open about things with her, then we had an awkward silence for like five minutes because I was shocked she didn‚Äôt kick me out finally.

Then I actually began having recurring dreams about sleeping with my therapist. We took a month long break from therapy when we went on vacation and I actually began wanting to sleep with her with this recurring dream. Now I actually take therapy seriously. But I don‚Äôt know if I should tell her that I lied that one time but now I actually want to sleep with her.

686,"I (28F) met someone (29M) in 2011 who I fell head over heels for, but he wasn't single then. It was a summer research program in college, and we spent a lot of time together almost every day that summer.  I never told him how I felt, and when the program ended, we never talked much again (we lived in different states, very far away, and we were both in really time consuming programs). 

Sometimes he would invite me and one other mutual guy friend from that summer up to go hiking. The last time this happened was about three years ago. The timing never worked out, and I haven't seen him in over eight years. He started seeing someone more seriously, and he got married last year. 

I still get texts from him during the holidays. These are usually texts to both me and our mutual friend.

Here's where it gets a little messier... I am still pretty good friends with this mutual friend (completely platonic), and I want to stay friends with him. I've never talked with him about my interest in our married friend... I want to unfriend the married friend on FB, but I know that (1) married friend would notice and feel really surprised / hurt about it and (2)  mutual friend would find out eventually, and I feel like this would come across as so petty that I might lose him as a friend.

I also have really bad feelings about just deleting married friend without explaining why, but I also really don't want to explain it to him, because he is married and I think of that as an off-limits / boundary breaking conversation. 

What should I do? I've tried to deal with this for years, but it just isn't getting any better. 

I am tired of feeling so pathetic and hopeless. Part of the problem is that I'm in a very isolating situation in graduate school now, and I have been too busy with work to make a lot of friends, so it's been really easy for me to feel nostalgic about the past (especially that summer when I made so many friends and had some really wonderful connections and times). 

Please advise. I know this problem seems petty to the extreme, but it's been making me think a lot about life and death and time and all the decisions I regret, all the actions I regret not taking. All of my friends are getting married, and I feel like I'll never meet someone that I can both be great friends with and be super attracted to (I've only had one or the other in all my past relationships). I've become so depressed from all this. 

I feel like the only thing I can do to break the loop is to confront him with goodbye, but I fear the social repercussions.",06Oct2019,1

691,"TL;DR: My boyfriend isn‚Äôt as fun as I thought he was and he cries a lot over issues that I don‚Äôt agree with. We just don‚Äôt really get along anymore. He isn‚Äôt supporting me as I apply for law school. I don‚Äôt feel like I can be myself around him anymore. I don‚Äôt think either of us can afford to move out and break our lease, which is still good for another 8 months. What should I do? 

I really want to break up with my boyfriend. I‚Äôve been thinking this since about a month before we moved in together, but we already signed the lease and I was hoping that it was just a mood I was in and I‚Äôd change my mind later. I have not, and now I‚Äôm starting to feel like I resent him. 

He‚Äôs holding me back. He cries when I try to do something for myself, like go over a friends house on a Friday night. He cries, saying that he and I never do anything together, but wants to sit home and watch tv when it‚Äôs a beautiful Saturday and I ask if we can go do something. He cries when he sees me goofing around with my friends, saying that I‚Äôm acting up and I need to calm down. He cries when I get mad at him about these things. 

When we first started dating about a year ago I told him I like to party and he told me all these stories about crazy nights he‚Äôs had. Well, since then i have never had one of those nights with him. He‚Äôs usually sober and drinking water when I bring him with me to drink at a bar with friends, I even had to BEG him to let me stay out until 3 am on my birthday (which was on a Friday night, so I had all weekend off). I don‚Äôt party more than like once or twice a month and it‚Äôs always on the weekends so I‚Äôm not hungover for work on Monday. I see no harm in that. He just doesn‚Äôt approve. 

I‚Äôve learned the hard way to give him a 12 hour notice if I ever intend to hang out with friends that night. Which is fine, I always give him notice since then, but now he‚Äôs crying as I try to leave the house that night, saying he wish I wouldn‚Äôt leave. I wish he wouldn‚Äôt cry. I wish he would be fun, and want to go with me. He is no fun. He does not offer alternatives, like going to the movies or something else that we can do together. I‚Äôve tried offering alternatives but he never likes my offers, he doesn‚Äôt like the movies, doesn‚Äôt feel like driving an hour to the beach, doesn‚Äôt want to walk the dog in the heat. 

Another thing that bothers me is when I told him I was thinking of going to law school. His response was ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been thinking about going to school too, in a different state.  Can you just move there with me and...not go to law school? It seems hard anyways, are you sure you can do it?‚Äù. Okay so even if the rest of my complaints seem crazy, this one really isn‚Äôt okay. I want to date someone who‚Äôs supportive of me. He clearly is not okay with me going to law school. 

But we are only 4 months into a 12 month lease!!! I‚Äôve never lived with a boyfriend before and I truly did not realize how restricting it is to be comfortable and be myself. 

Neither one of us can afford moving out. It‚Äôs a lot of work and I actually really love the house we‚Äôre renting, it took me months of searching to find it. Honestly I wouldn‚Äôt mind continuing to live with him if we broke up, but I doubt he would want that. Living together just makes breaking up harder for me, and I almost don‚Äôt want to break up just to keep the peace.

692,"I grew up in a kinda strict household with my mom who was kinda weird on who I was friends with. I mean she was right for doing it, I relate more to the I guess 'weird kids' at my school than the preps in my AP classes so I'm not a very social person irl. I don't go and do like everyone does at my age (16) hell I don't even want to get my license.  I don't keep friends that long either because I stop talking to them after a week unless they try to talk to me constantly. Or something else happens and we stop talking, which has happened twice with people that I were close to. I do have internet friends that I'm definitely closer to, but I'm not allowed to have them (I still talk to them anyways) and I just check up on them time to time. 

So I end up talking to myself.. alot. Like, I pretend that I have a huge friend group and make up senarios, not all of them are happy either. It can get pretty dark. But it's helped me through a few things to pretend someone was there and it helps me fall asleep. This didn't bother me until recently because I've been doing it for so long and last night was kinda weird. I was laying in bed working on a drawing as if I was making it for someone. I was describing and commenting on what I was doing like I usually do but when I finished, I quickly save it to my phone and close out of my art app as if I was gonna send it to somebody then I realized 'oh, I was talking to myself.'

It results in me thinking they don't like me, which makes me feel powerless, so I usually compensate with isolating myself from people I like a lot and testing them with my passiveness to see if they're worthy of my attention. It's just hella energy consuming, and I  still have at least 4 months of waiting until my therapy begins, so I thought I would ask you for some advice. Like, how do I start loving myself more? I don't have a healthy system of regulating emotions, either I'm too proud of who I am, or I just feel like I'm a shitty nothing.

714,"I know I want to have a community-oriented career that involves working with children. I‚Äôm excelling in my human development classes, but I‚Äôm also taking an education class and I really enjoy it. With a degree in human development, I could do a lot of interesting things: I could go pre-law, move on to law school, and become a child welfare attorney. I could go to PT school and become a physical therapist. I could get an advanced degree in psychology and become a school psychologist, counselor, or therapist. I could pursue an MSW and become a social worker. These are all things that have been done by recent grads of the program I‚Äôm in. The problem is that these jobs all require a graduate degree. I think I want to eventually go to grad school, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea financially to take on that much student debt straight out of college, and I want to be able to start my career soon. 

Education only requires a bachelor‚Äôs degree. All of the recent education graduates I know got decent jobs straight out of college. The downsides are the pay and the politics. I‚Äôm not super worried about the pay. Teachers obviously aren‚Äôt paid super well, but I have a pretty simple, low-maintenance lifestyle, so I think I‚Äôll be fine. All of the adults in my life, especially teachers, say not to become a teacher because of the corruption and political stuff going on in many of the local school districts.

Today, she asked me if I was going to homecoming. She said she didn‚Äôt want anyone asking her because she was already very stressed and didn‚Äôt need any additional decisions or strain. I told her that I was going to ask her if she was going, not that I wanted to ask her to, then I told her I probably wouldn‚Äôt. Our conversation ended there. I‚Äôm super conflicted because I do not want to pressure her by asking when she doesn‚Äôt want to be. On the other hand, I want to ask her to go and this is a really good opportunity because the date and time is already set.

It just seems weird because we talk at work a lot and I thought at the very least he enjoyed talking to me.

 I haven't seen him since he told me he was moving which was 2 weeks ago.  And I don't know when he's going so maybe he already left.

Also apart from the nervousness of never really doing anything about my love life I also am not sure if I should pursue this guy.  I like him a lot but I don't know if I know him well enough.  He can also be rude to people sometimes but I think it's just his autism.  And he often talks over me or doesn't listen and that's very likely because of his autism.  And he often seems annoyed at people if they ask him to do things at his job beyond the basic stuff.  

Am I seeing red flags or am I just nervous and trying to get out of doing something socially scary?  I mean it really shouldn't matter this much because he's leaving soon but I'm finding this situation stressful.",06Oct2019,1
723,"So I've been going to this bar weekly with my friends since my best friend passed in a car accident earlier this year.
The very first time I came to this bar, I arrived before all my friends so o went in and got a table.
My waitress came up and I instantly thought she was gorgeous, great smile that just lit up my eyes.
We would lightly talk in between her waiting g on us and what not.
That went on for a month or so.
Fast forward to this weekend, and I had it in my head that I'm going to buy her a couple drinks and try to talk to her more and make something out of this.
So I did! Bought her a couple shots and it seems like she's into me so we start talking more and more that night, revealing a little more about ourselves.
I then find out about her ex that had died in a car accident earlier this year, I said how sorry I was and tried to relate to her with my buddies passing. Car accident earlier this last April.
She stopped and asked what day. I said the 26th
She's like no fucking way, what was his name?!
So I tell her and she just stopped and then asked me his last name.
We both then realized that it was the same guy we were talking about about and we both shared some emotions and she hugged me.
We went on to get more drinks and hung out at the bar.
I eventually said my goodbye for the night, I asked for her number and she seemed to pull back a little so before she could say anything I just said well you know it's no big deal, if snapchat would work better we can do that, and she went for it.
We messaged a few times last night and this morning and everything was cool.

Now at this point I'm not sure what to do. I feel like my buddy brought us together somehow.
I have some definite feelings for this woman and I would love to date her but I'm not sure what to do about her dating my dead best friend. I dont want to disrespect him or her and I'm just confused as to what I should do.

726,"I [F 27] grew up with this girl [F 28] let‚Äôs call her Blue. I  met her when I was in the third grade. I wouldn‚Äôt say we were best friends when we were younger but we did share a lot of laughs and we hung out a lot. We started getting pretty close in high school. We shared a lot of funny moments together and we never really had any fights. There were definitely things that annoyed me about her like her inability to communicate what she was actually feeling and her constant need for me to pay for things. However, I try to hold on to the good memories like how she helped me get through a really difficult breakup and I was her friend during a few relationship changes as well. I was there when she just started dating her now husband and that was about 7 years ago. 

About 4 years ago, something really bizarre happened. Blue was out with her family and I saw her before she saw me. When she saw me, I don‚Äôt think she knew that I already saw her, but she started hiding from me. It was so weird. She literally started ducking and weaving through people. When I called her name out, her entire family + her boyfriend just looked at me and didn‚Äôt say anything. I had no idea why she even did that. She eventually came out of hiding to pretend that she didn‚Äôt see me/everything was normal. I kinda just stopped communicating with her and our friendship faded away a little. 

Fast forward like 2 years later, she reached out to my boyfriend saying that she ‚Äúmissed me‚Äù. I thought it was weird but also figured maybe I misunderstood our last interaction. We caught up and I asked her about the situation where she hid from me and she completely denied the whole thing and it made me feel crazy. So I figured I‚Äôd just drop the whole thing and try to maintain a normal friendship. I wasn‚Äôt anticipating to be close, I just wanted to be normal. A few weeks after meeting, she invites me to her wedding. I was completely shocked. I knew she was getting married but I didn‚Äôt expect to be invited to her wedding, it had been so long since we were actually friends. I said I‚Äôd be able to make it to the wedding but I didn‚Äôt want to go to the reception. I didn‚Äôt think it would be appropriate for me to be there dancing with her family, all of whom basically ignored me that last time. So bizarre. 

My boyfriend and I head over to the wedding which was 2.5 hours from my house and get caught in major traffic. We ended up missing the wedding completely and I saw her in the back taking pictures. I got major anxiety being there so I made my boyfriend drive me back home. I sent her a gift and we lost touch again. That was about 2 years ago. 

Fast forward to now. We got in touch again and she invited me to her babyshower. I just think it‚Äôs SO bizarre that she would keep inviting me to these big deal events and we don‚Äôt even talk. I mean, I‚Äôm flattered that she would want me there and I do try to remember where our friendship was many years ago... but so much has changed and I really don‚Äôt know how to feel about all of this.

my sister has been calling me every single day for 3 years but i dont think i can handle that anymore. i am known as my family's neruotypical and she always makes me act like her therapist. i am the only one she trusts enough to tell her suicidal thoughts to and lately its been getting scary because shes been telling me all this stuff about how she wants to seriously hurt her mom for making her upset and hurt customers at her job just because they annoy her. i dont know what to do i dont think i can handle this anymore, especially because my mental health is declining - i have bulimia and depression and i need to isolate myself sometimes and its soo hard to pick up the phone. i need to focus on school too and its so hard to do with all of this. sophomore year of high school my sister was the same and left me goodbye voicemails and suicide notes every other day,,, that year my only friend also killed herself so i almost failed all my classes because i couldnt deal with it. i really dont want that to happen again hut idk what to say to her without hurting her.

737,"It all started when I made two friends in the skate park one day. I'll call them Duncan and Matt. We bonded really quickly, started hanging out and became inseparable. Being as sheltered as I was, they were into a lot of stuff I was always sheltered from like drugs, drinking and rebelling against authority. It was freeing getting to hang out with them, I enjoyed it.

Although, things started to sour after a while. Duncan kept wanting to push things further and further, he even once suggested that we rob someone who he said had money on them, a suggestion I quickly shot down. I started hearing stories from people that Duncan would pickpocket and purse snatch from the elderly, women with children and anyone he saw as an easy target outside of town. I personally witnessed Duncan steal from corner stores, try to sell people fake weed, run out of barber shops and restaurants without paying etc. He did it with no remorse, the whole thing made me uncomfortable, but I never showed it. Matt, who was a few years younger then us found Duncan's exploits hilarious.

One day Duncan stayed over at my house for the Weekend. He was great, fun to be around and couldn't have been kinder to my family. Unfortunately, soon after he left in morning, I noticed that my money, some of my ps4 games and an Ipad had gone missing. I never thought he'd do this to me! I confronted Duncan about it the next day and we had a verbal altercation. He denied stealing anything, but my gut feeling was proven true when a week later some friends sent me screenshots of DM's where Duncan was clearly trying to sell the games he stole from me. This fractured our group.

I no longer talk to Duncan, but I'm still friends with Matt. While I warned Matt not to trust Duncan, he still choose to hang out with him anyway making our relationship tense. Unsurprisingly, Duncan would recently steal money from Matt too. Eventually, they made up, but Duncan admitted he stole Matt's money to buy drugs.

I hate Duncan, I hate that he broke up our group, I hate that he and Matt are still friends because I know that he'll only continue to rob vulnerable people on the streets and exploit those willing to trust him like Matt. Is there anything I can do to stop him, and is there any way to quench this anger that I feel towards him?

742,"hey r/advice. this is my first long-winded post about my life but i need advice on my situation. 

**english is not my first language, i've known it most of my life, but there will be errors**

i currently reside in Florida, US and am in a very emotionally abusive household. I have a 47 year old mom and a 77 year old dad, my dad is an awful person. He has 12 kids including myself, he abandoned 9 of them and the 3 left including myself hate him. There's my 32 year old half brother, he's lived in Florida his entire life with my dad because he suffers crippling depression due to the way my dad treated him his entire life, constantly calling him a failure and only giving my brother a place to say so he has something ""good"" to say about himself. My brother left Florida a few months ago to live with my other half brother (my dad abandoned this one) in Arizona. My brother and I are somewhat close, since we bond over having depression and the mutual hatred of my dad. 

I now live with my sister, mom, and dad. My sister is 20 years old, and my dad has called her stupid her entire life and that she will get nowhere; but my sister's dynamic is different and she tolerates him and still says she doesn't want to leave him and she loves him. My sister never stands up for herself and is a very submissive person, her and I do not have a good relationship; its just how we've always been. She is attending college and working or with her friends, so she's never really home. 

My mom is from Honduras, and left Honduras to be with my dad, they've known each other for 21 years, my mom is now a U.S citizen. My mom is like my sister, very compassionate and feels a lot of pity for my dad. They both know he is toxic, but they have like Stockholm syndrome or something. 

My dad loves to be in control, I see all of his ulterior motives. He moved the family to a bumfuck country side town so that we can be secluded from the outside world, he takes all of my mom's hard earned money and uses it as his own for stupid things, like revamping old cars he never finishes fixing, etc. He calls me a bitch and cunt and everything in between when he's angry at me, he's usually angry at me for not talking to him or being out of the house for too long. I suffer from anorexia, i'm trying to recover from but its hard when he denies me food constantly by yelling at me every time I'm in the kitchen.

 He's an awful person in every way, he doesn't do anything for this family but my mom and sister let him be in control. He makes no money and just watches TV all day, I understand he's 77 but he does nothing all day but say awful things to everyone. He isn't as abusive towards my sister and my mom verbally and emotionally as he is to me because I fight back. A couple of nights ago, he really set me off by trying to stop me from cooking by staring at me and saying nasty things, and I just began yelling at him and telling him all the things that are wrong with him and I want him to die. He had no valid points or anything to say, he just laughed at me and calling me crazy and saying I have no respect for him and how I'm a mistake and should have never been born. I kept yelling at him until my mom and sister stopped me, they understand my feelings but don't take any action. 

After dumping my feelings onto him for my family to hear his solution was to buy a mobile home for me to live in in front of our house (we have 3 acre property). But he'll still try to control me like he did with my brother, cutting off electricity or water when he's angry or something stupid. No one stops him, my family lets this happen and just complains but never does anything. 

My mother's family lives in Chicago, Illinois and I do really like them, they know my dad is abusive but my mom denies any help they try to give her because she wants to stay with him. I want to move to Chicago with them. I turn 16 in two months (december 26) which is legal in Florida to leave your home. I have a boyfriend who lives in Toronto and is willing to help me live in Chicago and drive there for me, and my mom's family is accepting to me, so my living situation won't be an issue. 

My mom is open to the idea, but she doesn't want me to leave her, and I don't want to leave her either because I made her sound like a bad person with my choice of words, but I love her so much. I just want other people's opinion on this situation. It's extremely hard to live here and live the life I want to lead.

746,"My (34m) wife (39f) is a recovering alcoholic now, going on three months sober very soon. I am extremely proud of her for this, and other accomplishments that she has made, such as getting a job and generally working to improve her/our situation.

Unfortunately, this all comes on the heels of what I feel is the most vile treatment I‚Äôve ever experienced in my life ‚Äî which is obviously exacerbated by the fact that it was from her.

Police responded to one of her tirades in mid-March, as she had drunkenly attempted to jump off of our balcony. I stopped her, but someone noticed the commotion and called the police. Trying to avoid a cell or rubber room, she went on to have me put in jail, and subsequent to that I was forbidden from contacting her until the court case was resolved. I was forced to move in with my parents, about an hour away.

During the three months where we weren‚Äôt able to communicate, she proceeded to drink every dollar she had away, and while under the influence she did some pretty horrific shit.

When she finally did pull her head out of the toilet, I proceeded to get her attending AA, and generally encouraged her to make the right decisions; as mentioned, she got a job, and so forth. She is immensely regretful of her decisions, and I know this to be true. I had been willing to forgive her for all of the shit up until this most recent debacle ‚Äî near the end of those three months was the most reprehensible ‚Äî but her actions in that last month (June into July)  cut me completely to the core.

I can write off all of her behavior and destructive habits until that point as a product of her being sick and drunk. However, I cannot forgive her for what she did in the end; I don‚Äôt think I ever will.

Back to the title ‚Äî I‚Äôm trying really hard to treat that last episode in the same fashion that I did everything preceding; I‚Äôm trying to disassociate the behavior from her identity, but I don‚Äôt know how. Moreover, I don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs possible. I am considering that my marriage may be fucked.

747,"(All names changed for privacy.)

I don‚Äôt know how I should feel about this. I love my FIL, but I can‚Äôt help resenting him for this. I wonder whether it makes me a terrible person. 

**For TLDR, read the bold bits.**

**My father-in-law (FIL) is in his late 50s.** My husband (who‚Äôs in his mid 20s) was his only child. 

But **in 2013, FIL got into a relationship with a younger woman (who we‚Äôll call Karen).**

**Karen had a child, Chloe, born in 2010.** Chloe‚Äôs father died soon after she was born. FIL took on the role as her dad, and grew to love her as his own.

About a year into the relationship, Karen became pregnant (it was planned). **My sister in law, Isla, was born in late 2014**.

Unfortunately, after Isla was born, Karen changed. **It seemed that once FIL was ‚Äúlocked in‚Äù to the relationship, she revealed her true self. She began to abuse him (emotionally, mentally and sometimes physically).**

If he ever tried to leave, she would threaten him that he‚Äôd *never* see Isla or Chloe again if he did. 

**Karen also started to neglect her children**, in several really horrible ways.  She just wasn‚Äôt interested in being a mother to them. When FIL dared confront her about it, she‚Äôd physically kick him out the house and block his number, and tell him he was never going to see Isla again. 

She‚Äôd then contact him a few weeks later and guilt trip him, saying Chloe and Isla missed him, and he could only see them again if he would take her back. (During those few weeks she would neglect the kids really badly.) 

Here‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt understand at all. **Instead of reporting her for neglect, and taking her to court for custody of the kids, he opted to re-enter the relationship with her. Again and again and again.**

 Despite how she abused him, and despite what a horrible mother she was to Chloe and Isla. Because he ‚Äúloved‚Äù her. He was convinced he would teach her how to be a good mum. 

But it kept happening over and over. 

This is the worst part. At one point in early 2015, my husband had to move in with them, as he was going through his own troubles (he didn‚Äôt get together with me until 2015). 

Soon after he moved in, **Karen got angry with FIL, and kicked *both* him and my husband out onto the street.** They had to live in a homeless shelter. 

**EVEN AFTER he watched her treat HIS OWN SON that way, he STILL got back together with her again.** 

And of course, in 2016, she got pregnant again. This one wasn‚Äôt planned. Apparently, she ‚Äúforgot‚Äù to take her contraceptive pill.

**They had another girl, Olivia, in Dec 2016**. Karen got worse if anything, totally neglecting Chloe and Isla in favour of the new baby. 

Around this time, **social services got involved**. Chloe‚Äôs teacher reported that her attendance record was so poor. (She would only go to school when my FIL was around, as Karen could never be bothered to take her.) 

Social services then discovered how badly Karen neglected the kids. They began the long, arduous process of trying to teach Karen how to be a good mother, to no avail. 

Of course, **soon after Olivia was born, Karen got pregnant again**. Apparently, ‚Äúfool me once...‚Äù didn‚Äôt occur to my FIL. She ‚Äúforgot‚Äù her pill again.

Just before the new baby was born, my **FIL finally got the courage to leave Karen**, because social services told him that it wasn‚Äôt in the kids‚Äô best interests for them to stay together.  

They implied that the courts were soon going to take the kids away from Karen, and that if FIL was still with Karen when that happened, he wouldn‚Äôt get custody. They‚Äôd go into care as foster kids. 

So, FIL and Karen broke up. **A month later, July 2017, baby Mia was born.** 

In August 2017, the case went to court. **FIL was awarded full custody of Chloe, Isla and Olivia.** He was awarded parental rights of Chloe despite not being her bio dad. 

Baby Mia was allowed to stay with Karen, with the condition that at the first signs of neglect she‚Äôll be removed.

So jump forward to today. **FIL is in his late 50s, struggling to be a single parent to 3 kids aged 9, 5 and almost-3.** 

It is absolute hell for him. My husband and I take the girls at least once per week, to give him a break, and we help support him as much as we can (financially, emotionally and babysitting around our full time jobs). 

But he struggles so much. He‚Äôs not a natural parent anyway - though he does an amazing job given the circumstances - but **his own health is rapidly deteriorating**. 

He barely takes care of himself as he doesn‚Äôt have time to visit the doctor or dentist. He smokes due to stress. The girls are bad sleepers, due to all the past trauma, so he hardly gets any sleep. He spends any spare time during the day sleeping, or trying to keep up with housework. 

Like I‚Äôve said, **my husband and I do as much as we can to help**. We work full time and our weekends are dedicated to helping him. **FIL has no other family or friends that can help.**

And it‚Äôs likely that Mia, who‚Äôs now 1, will soon be taken away from Karen, as she has started to neglect her. I truly don‚Äôt know if FIL can cope with another kid. 

I just feel so angry. I don‚Äôt blame the kids at all - I love those girls so much it hurts. But **I can‚Äôt help but feel resentful towards FIL. I know it‚Äôs hard for people in abusive relationships to leave, but he willingly impregnated Karen time and time again even though he knew she was an abusive/neglectful mother**. He‚Äôs now ended up with all these young kids that he‚Äôs struggling hard to look after, in his late 50s.

And I know exactly what‚Äôll happen. I love him so much and it sickens me to imagine this, but because of his poor health and family history of health problems, he‚Äôs likely to either become too ill to take care of the kids, or die, long before they‚Äôve reached adulthood. 

And it‚Äôll fall on me and my husband to take in those 4 kids. Like I said, no other family. 

**I feel like my husband and I cannot dare to have kids of our own now, which was always our dream. Because it‚Äôs likely that soon, we‚Äôll be responsible for 4 of them.** And I can‚Äôt imagine how we‚Äôll take care of 4 kids- let alone if we have any of our own as well. So it seems like we can‚Äôt have our own.

Either that or we have to say, no, we can‚Äôt provide a home for these girls. But we can‚Äôt do that. They‚Äôre our family and we love them. We cant possibly throw them into the system.

It feels like our future dreams and all our  free time have been taken away from us through no fault of our own. All we do when we‚Äôre not at work is help with the girls. We have no social life and few friends, and we can‚Äôt in good conscience start a family.

**Am I selfish? Am I wrong to feel so resentful?** Just try to imagine you were me/my husband and how you‚Äôd feel. I just don‚Äôt know. **We would never, ever abandon those kids or my FIL** but it feels like because of them, our life has been decided for us.

Please help, I‚Äôve got nobody else to talk to. **My husband feels the same way about all of this as me. Should we buck up our ideas and stop feeling resentful and just deal with the cards we‚Äôve been dealt? Or do we have a right to feel resentful? How do we stop feeling this way? **",06Oct2019,2

My best friend lives in Florida and keeps telling me I should move down there to live with him and find work. There's definitely much more work there. My small town only has a couple thousand people and very few options. 

The main problem is that I'd have to leave my girlfriend and her daughter, both of whom I love.

753,"Never imagined this would be my first Reddit post but I‚Äôm looking for some advice because quite frankly I‚Äôm a little shocked. 

Every weekend, my boyfriends who I‚Äôve been dating for 7 years and his family meet for lunch. We usually go when we‚Äôre free and the same goes for his brother and his girlfriend. 

Yesterday my boyfriend and I met with his parents and the conversation turned to my boyfriends brother  who suffers from depression and likes to be in control of everything, hating when he doesn‚Äôt get his own way. 

His brother didn‚Äôt turn up for lunch and instead was texting abuse at his dad blaming him and everyone else for his mental health issues. That‚Äôs another story. 

Long story short, my boyfriend looked over his dad‚Äôs shoulder at one point and spotted a text message from his brother saying that he doesn‚Äôt want to come to lunch because I‚Äôm there and that I‚Äôm fat and doesn‚Äôt want to be seen with me. Again, let me reiterate, I‚Äôve been dating his brother for 7 years!

His dad replied ‚Äúso you want me to tell your brother you‚Äôre not coming because his girlfriend is fat?‚Äù. My boyfriend didn‚Äôt see anything else in his reply as he walked away. 

My boyfriend wasn‚Äôt going to tell me what happened because he knew I‚Äôd be angry and naturally I am, well more pissed off and hurt. His dad also isn‚Äôt aware my boyfriend read the text messages so I can‚Äôt bring it up with him. 

So I‚Äôm now confused and have no idea what to do. Do I act like I don‚Äôt know? Or do I say something?",06Oct2019,2

When he was 17 he dated a girl for 2 weeks then she left for an ex. 

He said he never had intercourse with them. 

I felt like if he can lie like this now there will be more down the line so I broke up with him. 

Now everything came together. He didn‚Äôt like me talking to my exes. He took calls away from me. He was kinda secretive with the people he talked to. 

I believe he was talking to exes behind my back and maybe sleeping with them.",06Oct2019,1

763,"Hi, I am part of a fairly large online group, and partially responsible for moderation. There is a person in the group who has been around for a year or so, and we are fairly sure he is depressed. He has expressed some suicidal tendencies. We have frequently reassured him and advised him to seek therapy, but all he says in response is 'k' and refuses to engage. We have no ability to get him real life help.

This person constantly self-sabotages - for example, we held a competition that required some effort. He talked for a while about how bad he was at the skill the competition required. People reassured him, so he decided to enter the competition. He then talked about how bad his entry was. It wasn't very good, and he didn't win. For the next weeks, all he would talk about is how bad he is at everything.

Whenever criticized or given advice, he calls himself trash and stupid, and stops talking except to say meek and self-deprecating things, and so whoever talks to him feels compelled to reassure him again.

He has recently started calling our shared activity boring, insulting others for enjoying it, and when called out on this, dramatically saying he's leaving. Now we just say ""bye!"" instead of trying to reassure him, but he keeps going.

It's distressing and frustrating constantly dealing with this person's self-pity. We are beginning to feel burnt out about this but at the same time, this is a vulnerable and depressed person, we don't want to cause anything worse to happen, and he does still have friends in the community, just not as many.

768,"I've been working as a receptionist for about as long as I've been in college (4 years). I used to only work one day. at one point I was working 30+ hours a week and going to school. I'd do homework when I was at work when it was slow. It was usually slow I only work 20 hrs at the moment, no school

I'm going to community college and I have a 3.2 GPA. The only reason I have a 3.2 GPA is because I drop classes. I repeated one class five times before I passed with a B.

My home life is kinda precarious right now. I live at home with my parents and they want me out. I've turned into this lazy stagnant blob without realizing it. I'm starting to think that I need to move out in order to start growing as a person again honestly. I was taking prerequisites for a BSN nursing program (CC then transfer to a four-year) because that's what they wanted me to do. It's not a horrible one and I didn't have a better one. a couple of months ago when the fall semester started, they decided the best thing for me to do would be to complete the associates in nursing program and just have the RN. That way I could have a degree/license and a reliable way to get some money and get out. I agree with that. I hate that it only takes one positive drug test for your livelihood to be taken away. I like weed. is a dumb reason to not pursue a career. I used to smoke every day but now I only indulge occasionally because I know I'll have to stop altogether at some point. I'm pretty sure I'm a budding alcoholic.  I drank myself to sleep last night. I digress. I applied to the associate's nursing program at my community college

This semester, I didn't have any money saved for school so I ended up taking the semester off.

I want to know what it's like to be a nurse. Maybe I'd actually be interested. I applied to volunteer at \~5 hospitals and one made contact. I'm gonna be participating in their orientation in a couple of weeks.

I also just signed up to visit a state school in a few days. I think I'm gonna apply there, not to the nursing program just as an undecided. I don't even know why. I can't afford it.

I don't know why I'm doing anything that I'm doing professionally speaking. I've never wanted to be a nurse. I want to be financially secure and not be the loser still living with their parents or dependent on anyone. I just wanna make something of myself.

I've been doing the same thing for over 4 years and I have no skills, other than being a pushover. I used to be able to draw kinda well but I haven't done it regularly in a long time. I enjoy math. Loved every math class I was ever in except for statistics. I've got some credits under my belt. I suck at saving. I work 20 hours a week at less than $15/hour.

I guess the best thing to do right now is find a second job. What else am i doing, right? Maybe I'm just a burnout. Maybe I just need to cut my losses, stop going to school altogether and save up to move out.

770,"Hi everyone, sorry for this post being so long, I‚Äôm just here because I‚Äôm having a bit of an identity crisis regarding my religion.

I was raised in a Muslim household. My mother was also raised Muslim and my father converted from Christianity. 

Now, I love Islam, as a whole, I really do. It‚Äôs a peaceful, beautiful religion and I‚Äôm happy to have been raised as part of hat community.

But in the past year, I‚Äôve realised that my own values differ from those of Islam. I‚Äôm part of the LGBTQ+ community (trans gay man) and because of a number of disabilities I have, I‚Äôve been unable to physically perform some Islamic duties without becoming seriously ill, and the few Islamic schools I‚Äôve been to were incredibly ableist and bigoted regarding my autism. 

Also, pretty much my whole life, I‚Äôve had a strong spiritual connection to dragons, gryphons and otherworldly creatures. It‚Äôs difficult to describe but whenever I see an image of a dragon, I just feel something inside my soul pulling me towards it.

Well, back in June of 2019, I was watching a YouTube video of someone reading the Junji Ito manga Uzumaki, and the start of the video had this beautifully haunting choir music. I heard that music and just felt such a beautiful sense of calm and inner peace and I decided to look it up.

It turns out that choir was a prayer; more specifically, a demonolatry meditation chant. I was quite alarmed, to say the least. But I decided to look up what demonolatry actually is and I‚Äôve discovered that it‚Äôs not the blood sacrifice Satan loving cult that I had previously believed it to be. It‚Äôs a peaceful religion similar to Shintoism in some ways. I actually found that a lot of its values match my own and I agree with its teachings

Before I knew it I was finding out as much as I could about it. When I found out that one of the Demons of demonolatry is Leviathan, commonly represented as a blue sea dragon who provides healing from traumatic events (I have ptsd, depression and anxiety) my connection to the image of the dragon suddenly made sense; it seems like I have a connection to Leviathan. 

Now, I don‚Äôt have the best relationship with my mother for a variety of reasons, but it boils down to me feeling utterly disturbed and terrified of the concept of motherhood. That is, until I discovered there was another Demon I seem to be drawn to; Lilith. She seems like the symbolic mother I feel like I never had, the one that I feel like I was missing.

There‚Äôs so much freedom within Demonolatry as well, it feels like such a comfortable and welcoming thing to be a part of, but I still stand by my Islamic beliefs and I don‚Äôt want to be punished for taking a different path. 

I‚Äôm stuck in between these two faiths and i know I can‚Äôt belong to both of them. I feel like I‚Äôm divided in a yin and yang way.

If I remain a Muslim I won‚Äôt be paranoid of taking a wrong step, but if I convert to Demonolatry then the two biggest aches in my heart will be cured. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do but if anyone has some advice, please let me know. Thank you for taking the time to read this.",06Oct2019,1

775,"I am a 22 year old male. I've started going to therapy to treat my Social Anxiety problem that I have dealt with all of my life. I just left the third session with the therapist I am currently seeing.

She asked me if I was dating and what not. I told her that I am single. During our last session she sort of discussed with me about women and romance. Then she said, ""Now DCT, I am assuming that you are heterosexual, are you?"" I got a bit nervous when she asked me. I am gay, but I am still in the closet. I thought about just saying yes, but I would be lying.

Before I answered the question I asked her, ""Everything that we discuss is confidential correct?"" She said, ""I cannot disclose what we talk about without your permission unless you are suicidal or trying to kill someone else."" Then I told her, ""No I am not heterosexual.""

I felt so weird after I said it because I have NEVER openly discussed my sexuality with anyone. I told her, ""I am sorry, but it felt weird for me to say that because no one knows.""

So, since two or three years, every month, I'm saying to myself that this is a new starting point. I'll kill my old habits and I'll be a better version of me. But everytime, I give up after 10min, or less.

Recently, my girlfriend told me that I was addicted to her. It's kind of true. If she doesn't show me love, I can switch into a bad mood in seconds. I know this, but I can't change, I don't know how
I'm not in a very good physical shape. I'm doing basketball 8h per week, but my coach and doctor said that it wasn't enough to lose weight, I need to work on my nutrition. But I can't change my habits. I love my junk food two or three times in the month. I'm used to eat between meals pretty often, I feel really hungry, and sad if I don't
I'm in my last year in high school, I can't focus in class, can't do my homework, can't study. It bothers me, and if something bothers me, I don't do it. But I should, I must. But I can't

I don't like the way I act, or behave, and I want this to change. But I don't have enough determination to do it, I just get angry or sad if someone tells me to change something in my life.
I would love to change, but I'm just used to my bad habits and bad behaviours

I'll probably just read your advices, and never apply them, like I do for 2-3 years

I have come to seek guidance - I struggle with the most basic endeavours, and it‚Äôs affecting my life so very much. This ranges from many things such as taking care of myself to learning a new skill. 
I am very slow and probably do have something wrong with me, although I‚Äôd rather not find out as I have always wanted to just be normal and capable but I find it extremely difficult. 

I have no real talents or strengths at all and spend most of my days like a sack of potatoes. My people skills are very minimal and I don‚Äôt exactly socialise a lot n‚Äôor am I very good at it. I do not even know the basics when it comes to taking care of myself but I do my best. It seems when I do try to make a difference in my life it just gets too hard and I give up.

All is not lost at least, I have secured a great job (mostly through luck) which did help push me in the right direction however with less free time it‚Äôs quite challenging to keep track of everything. My diet is very poor and I just tend to eat whatever when I‚Äôm hungry, mostly it‚Äôs unhealthy as I just buy something cheap and fast but I have gained a tremendous amount of weight ever since. Seeing everyone at work have actual lives gets me down too, they always have so many plans and just know exactly what they‚Äôre doing with themselves meanwhile I have no clue.

I had sudden motivation to learn to drive, I‚Äôm 24 and just want to amount to something at least. I‚Äôm on my 2nd lesson however feel like I‚Äôm getting nowhere and I‚Äôm just terrified. I fucked up so many things and I just felt so down afterwards that I want to give up on it.

About 5 years back, my group of friends (4 others) and mother group of friends (~8 others) became one big group of friends and everyone kinda intermingled and became friends with everyone except me and 2 others- my bff and another(well call them person A) because we didn‚Äôt feel the need to and liked the friends we had. we were always nice to the others just not quite friends. in the other group, person B was a bit bossy and for some reason didn‚Äôt like me my bff or person A. that‚Äôs fine. whatever, but it started becoming a problem when B started excluding us. 

cut forward a year, things have gotten significantly worse.  me and A are becoming good friends with the others,and bff is dating one of B‚Äôs closest friends so B tolerates bff, except the exclusion had gotten much worse and much more obvious and is only directed towards me and A

after another A and i now have some really good and close friends, but then B starts fighting with me. only me. and i have no idea as to why. whenever i made jokes like calling bff  dumb (clearly friendly and joking way) B calls me dumb in an aggressive way. B calls me annoying (or something else) and is then like. raise ur hand if u agree and everyone else does and numerous other things like that. I have actively been trying to befriend B and i‚Äôm always kind and try to be as polite as possible all the time to B

what i don‚Äôt understand is why the people i considered close friends never say anything and just let it slide. it‚Äôs blatantly obvious, so it‚Äôs not like they don‚Äôt notice and it really hurts because i‚Äôve stuck up for them, so why can‚Äôt they stick up for me?

If someone has lost weight don't comment about it, because you don't know if they've had a bad time so that's why they lost weight. They might link having bad health with losing weight , and that can spiral to eating disorders. 
Same don't comment if someone is very skinny naturally because they might not like it. And you might trigger some self confidence issues.

For everyone in this post to remain anonymous, I will not use their real names. Ill tell you what happened. 

So, I have these friends. A is dating J. And A is absolutely head over heels for J. For the most part, they seem like a pretty nice couple.

I have another friend, her name is B. B is best friends with J. 

But recently, J told B that he was only using A to get over a past girlfriend of his. J says that he plans on dumping A very soon, and he's just using her for affection and stuff. He doesnt truly love her.

Like I said, A is head over heels for J, and if she gets dumped, itll hurt her VERY BADLY. Itll mess her up, man. 

Now, B doesn't wanna tell A that J is about to dump her, and that hes using her because B is J's best friend,  and she doesn't want to lose his trust forever. B and J are incredibly close friends. 

I really want to tell A that J is using her, but if i do, J will stop being friends with B, and that will also mess B up really bad. Considering B and J are such close friends. 

But if I just let it all happen, A is gonna get hurt by J bad. 

I feel like it's not my place to tell A, ""hey, your boyfriend is just using you and is gonna dump you"" you know? but i just want to prevent all that pain for A. But if I do, B will lose a close friend.

Also, may i add, J is manipulative, and hes not really  a good person. J has hurt B a lot, but theyre still good friends.

Some days I feel like I am in a simulation.... Some things they say/do don‚Äôt make ANY type of sense. Like they aren‚Äôt *with* it &amp; it is terrifying... We tend to disagree much more than ever; maybe because I‚Äôm becoming a young woman &amp; I have a voice now? ((couldn‚Äôt do that back in our day!)) lol. And my poppy is becoming angrier &amp; more combative every day. Something here is fishy, or am I overreacting to the generational/age difference? Is it normal behavior as humans get older they become more argumentative/aggressive/etc?? 

I mention alzheimer‚Äôs or dementia because I am worried for my poppy, there is family history. I tell my grammy but she just shrugs &amp; thinks it‚Äôs normal for men to become ornery as they get older... but it is MUCH more than ‚Äúornery.‚Äù It is many many many behavioral changes &amp; such, even with the both of them but mostly poppy..... but I am not a doctor.

834,"Each year it has gotten worse. Usually I'll plan something, like an outing for me and him and my family, but any time it's just the two of us, it sucks. It's  gotten to the point where I almost dread my birthday because I know it'll be nothing special, just like any other day. Same old chores, same old doing our own thing, same old boring routine. Maybe with an outing thrown in there.

I feel like I always go above and beyond (I mean nothing crazy, we're both low key, introverted individuals) for his birthday, either with a thoughtful gift or making his favorite meal or taking him to his favorite restaurant, usually at least a couple of those things.

And that's another thing. And I feel selfish even saying this. Year after year for birthdays or for Christmas the past few years, he has gotten me the same thing: a gift card for the same place, for the same amount. I pretty much expect it now. I don't hope for a diamond or a designer handbag or some shit, but jeez, he just puts no thought into it anymore. It's like he doesn't care. Idk why he even bothers asking me what I want anymore. I know what he'll get me.

I'm fully expecting to come home from work, change, make us both dinner, and then go to bed like it's any other day this year on my birthday. And I'll maybe get a ""happy birthday"" and the traditional gift card and I won't even be able to pretend to be excited.

After the break up they still text each other. Then suddently she cuts all the contact (I guess she knows about us) - it drives him crazy. He started saying that he loves her so much more than before, the reason they break up is nothing at all, and he cannot love her wholeheartedly because I keep being friend showing him how desparate I was...

I'm 5 weeks pregnant now, our families talked and we decide to get married next month. He said he love me but he loves her more. Sometimes he thinks of her and cries in his sleep. But he said as long as I love him and I'm the mother of his child - he will try love me more.

843,"I‚Äôll try not to make this too long and apologies in advance for the shitty grammar

Okay so, I grew up in a low income household. My mom and dad were separated for a long time due to immigration issues, so I grew up with a single mother who worked hella hard to put a roof over our head and food on our plate. Needless to say, she dealt with a lot of stress to keep it all together and to this day I am still amazed by her resiliency. Years later, my dad was finally able to join us (timeline: dad and I have been separated from when I was 6-18 years old). When he came, he worked 2 jobs, working 7 days a week (often overtime everyday). With their combined incomes we were able to live a bit more comfortably ‚Ä¶ but still struggling. My mom works in a factory and dad works as a janitor. My dad‚Äôs been working hard to save money to buy a house, but the house prices are insanely high. My mother also wants to buy a house but is not good at keeping her finances in check. She is in massive massive massive debt. I won‚Äôt get into too much detail about my parents finances but let‚Äôs just say they both hold resentment towards each other for not saving enough money. I‚Äôm currently in my mid twenties now, just finished nursing school and studying for the NCLEX exam which I will be writing soon. Right now, I feel shitty staying at home studying while my parents continue to work hard but not making any progress. For example, we still live in the same crappy apartment, while all our relatives, especially the ones who recently moved here from out of country have already bought a house and are living comfortably. I know eventually I‚Äôll be earning a decent income while working as an RN but I feel like I should be doing more. I feel guilty for not working harder, for not being more successful, for not being more goal-oriented in terms of money/career. Having grown up with a mother who always stressed the importance of doing homework and not letting me have a social life (always telling me to study 24/7 and not letting me hang out with my friends) it got to the point where I told myself that when I grow up, I would prioritize enjoying life more than working hard. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I still want to make a decent income, but I want to enjoy life more. I don‚Äôt want to work overtime or keep striving forward in my career, I just want to be content but I feel guilty for wanting that. I feel that I should work just as hard as my parents have (to sort of repay them back) but I just don‚Äôt have the desire/motivation to do so. I just want to get a stable job that pays well and live comfortably, but I can‚Äôt do that without feeling guilty. Often times, when I do go have fun I feel guilty, guilty for spending as little as 8hrs in a week hanging out with friends/engaging in hobbies while my parents are constantly working. The guilt ruins those fun times and often makes me feel overworked because I am constantly working hard or worrying about having fun behind my parents back. So my questions are:

1. How do I stop feeling guilty while having fun? (How can I work hard AND play hard)
2. I don‚Äôt see myself as the goal-oriented type (money/career-wise) but should I change that? If so how do I become more goal-oriented?

TLDR: Grew up kinda poor. Parents separated due to immigration issues (but remained married). Grew up with very hard-working mother. Dad came to join us much later and like mom, worked very hard. Having witnessed both of them work very hard, I feel like I ‚Äúshould‚Äù be working even harder (working every second of my life) but I don‚Äôt ‚Äúfeel‚Äù like it. I want to enjoy life and work hard at the same time. But every time I have fun, I feel guilty for not working. How do I work hard and play hard without feeling guilty?",06Oct2019,1
844,"I need people to understand that this is **NOT** a kink I should or want to explore with my boyfriend. This is an obsession born out of severe anxiety and OCD.

My boyfriend and I have been together for over a year. I knew he was interested in penises from the beginning, and that didn't bother me. This isn't my first romantic encounter with someone who at first glance would otherwise be considered bisexual.

However, unlike the previous guy my boyfriend seemingly is only sexually attracted to penises. He needs to look at penises whenever we have any sort of sexual interaction. He loses his erection when it's just me and this happens with penetration and sometimes blow jobs and hand jobs. I never thought I'd be someone who'd have an issue with my partner watching porn but given the rest of our interactions and his monolithic preferences I can't help but feel anxious and insecure and not enough and disgusting and unattractive because he's also told me he's ""lowkey not into vaginas"", and he's seemingly very disinterested in me sexually.

I have had OCD since childhood and it latches onto things that give me extreme anxiety.

While I feel like there are a lot of issues here that go beyond OCD but with regards to my obsessive thoughts about my boyfriend's sexual preferences which give me ANXIETY I nonetheless masturbate to them compulsively every single day, sometimes multiple times a day, and feel HORRIBLE after. 

I have started therapy for anxiety and was given an SSRI, that has seemingly helped, and up till about 2 days ago I had not given into any compulsions and felt better and proud, but I nonetheless did eventually and I feel terrible today, and I felt terrible yesterday too.

847,"I am in love or in other words i am madly obsessed with a girl. This girl is a famous pop singer named 'Miley Cyrus'. Although i know her since years ago i fell in this mad love last year. It was exactly one night in December of 2018 that this revolution has happened in me and since then i think about her every single moment of every day. I've been trying to make contact with her and find a way to meet her but still nothing. I really love her and i need her attention. I actually DESERVE it. I've been through a lot because of her. The fact that i love her this much and yet i can't have her is sad and depressing on its own but my jealousy makes it much worse and much more dangerous. Every time i see a picture or video of her talking, hugging, kissing, hanging out or doing whatever else with another guy i feel extremely jealous and hateful. I feel jealous of her boyfriends. I feel jealous of her producers and co workers like that guy 'Mike Will' who have spent a lot of time with her and talked to her and even touched and hugged and kissed her. I felt jealous when i saw her twerking for Robin Thicke. I am jealous of those reporters and interviewers who talked to her. I am jealous of those lucky bastard fans who could meet her in backstage and take pictures with her and hug and kiss her. The worst of them all was this lucky bastard called 'Matt Peterson'. Just go search 'Miley Cyrus Matt Peterson'and watch the clip in Youtube. That kid has asked Miley to be his prom datein 2014 and Miley has invited him to her concert and there she hugged, kissed, flirted and danced with him and she has singed her flirty song 'i adore you' to him while they were hugging and cuddling and all of those crap that a real prom couple do. She treated him so nicely and she changed his whole insignificent life. This video clip is so toxic and it fills me with hate and anger. It pisses me off more than seeing those guys grabbing her without her consent because in this case she is giving him the permission and she likes him back and she treats him so nicely. It pisses me off more than seeing her with her boyfriends because at least they personally knew her for some time and they used the opportunity but what about Matt Peterson? He is no one. He is just a random loser out of nowhere who had the chance to touch Miley. Lucky bastard. I am not less than some random loser so called fan boy or anyone else. Not only i am not less than them as a human but i deserve her attention more because i love her more and i care about her more than they do. Yet i can't have her. I can't even have a reply from her. Those guys are there touching her and i am here having nothing. It's not fair. It's pathetic. It's unacceptable. I don't deserve this shit.

So let's make it clear. Fuck all of those guys. Especially fuck Matt Peterson for causing me all of this pain. I couldn't eat and sleep properly since i've seen that shitty video. In that video i've seen everything that i hated to see. It was a catastrophe. It was terrifying. It gave me actual PTSD. So fuck him. Miley Cyrus still follows that fool and he still posts about that shit. He is there showing this video to his family and friends and they congratulate him while i am sitting here and watching it and suffering. Fuck Matt. I am tired of hiding these all in myself and saying nothing. Fuck them all. I haven't sent him or anyobe any threats yet because i believe that words should be said after the action was done. I really have some crazy thoughts in my mind and in this situation i am crazy enough to do anything. All i see is death. All i hear is gunshots. I am done with all of these. I just want to pick a weapon and kill those who caused me this pain and then maybe kill myself as well. I think about going right to the place that he lives or works and shoot him right in the head without saying a hi and leave a note on his body saying 'Don't ever do this again Miley'

If i can't have her, i don't like seeing anyone else having her too. If she flirted me too then everything would be ok.

‚Äã So i have one last thing to try. I should ask her out and if she says yes then great but if she rejects me then i'll go insane and i'll talk with my gun instead. Let the bullets decide who is right and who wrong. Believe me that i've been always a peaceful person in my whole life. I've never killed anyone and i've rarely used weapons before but i can't tolerate this anymore. I feel so vengeful and i am totally losing my control...

Also, would anybody want to connect to me considering that I still haven't been to university and therefore someone in a professional job such as an engineer wouldn't bother connecting with me? 

The reason why I'm asking is that I was advised to make one now, but I haven't even started university yet so it feels like it's a bit too early. 

I also don't want to annoy anybody by sending them connection requests because once they see my profile they may think it's a joke considering there would be nothing worthwhile on it.

849,"My ex and I have been broken up for 5 years. We have a 7 year old son together. I have full custody and my ex has just recently started taking our son every weekend. He is otherwise very hands off. 

My ex has lived with his girlfriend for the past 4 and a half years. She seems decent and has always treated my son well. Ive only met her casually a few times. 

All of a sudden though it feels like she is taking over. She had a seperate bday party for my son. Full of her family. (My son said he knew 2 kids.) Shes been taking him to family functions without my ex. Etc. Now she wants school photos. Although they don't even know what school he goes to. 

But what caused me to post is what happened today. 

She took my son to the pumpkin patch with her daughter. Nice right? But there was also her exhusband, his girlfriend and their child. While my ex stayed home and watched tv and slept. 

And apparently they were all at his bday party too. They even come over for dinners. 

Am I being a bitch in thinking this is weird? 

When my son was dropped off tonight my exs girlfriends kid gave me attitude about how they do so much more with my son. 

I don't even know these people. Have no idea who he is with or where. If i ask I get screamed at and told I'm being a controlling bitch. 

I do all the school stuff and everyday things. They always get the fun weekends. I really don't know what to do. 

We are all in our late 30s early 40s. We aren't kids. 

Any advice or perspectives?",06Oct2019,2
850,"I really fucked up this time and I feel like a horrible person but I needed somewhere safe to say this. 


I'm gonna keep this short because my sentence structure is absolute shit.

A few weeks ago I asked this guy I liked if he could help me lose my virginity. He said yeah so the following day we went to his house and tried but I couldn't relax and couldn't get horny! To top it all off his thing was HUGE!! Couldn't handle the pain so I told him to stop and if we can try again some other time. he said yes but I could tell he was frustrated lol anyway, The next day he told me ""I don't wanna take your virginity anymore"" I guess he thought i would get attached. ( I genuinely did not have feelings for this dude) 

So yesterday I told him I lost my virginity and he insisted on sleeping with me so dumbass me said ""ok:)""
He came to my house and we tried but I couldn't shake off the feeling that something wasn't right. 

Turns out the condom tore while we were doing it üò≥

I don't know how to tell him that i might be pregnant AND that i lied to him....

The guilt is literally killing me inside and I'm still freaking out!

Am i a bad person for lying to him about that?



p.s. we both don't have feelings and he's already seeing someone else


p.s.s.I'm so sorry this is a whole ass mess lmao I'm not good at expressing myself with words

if you guys could give me advice i would appreciatie it so much :(",06Oct2019,0
852,"So about a month ago my brother got into a physical altercation with my boyfriend (the father of my children) fracturing his face. Stating he was sticking up for me because my boyfriend supposedly pushed me. I repeatedly told him he didn‚Äôt I lost my balance and almost fell in the fire so I launched myself on the ground so I didn‚Äôt get burnedüôÑ completely ridiculous! Now my dad is ignoring me and won‚Äôt talk to me at all, I guess it‚Äôs not uncommon for him to do this. I‚Äôm just sick of trying so hard and getting just pushed to the side all the time. Only talked to when it‚Äôs convenient for them. They have this idea of who they think I am in they‚Äôre heads, which  is nothing of who I am. I feel like I just need to cut ties, stop putting myself through the heartache constantly. I feel guilty all the time and they make me so depressed. I just feel like it‚Äôs so negative having them in my life, blood or notüòû",06Oct2019,1

854,"My gf and I moved across the country and recently moved into a 1BR apartment. We moved in 3 weeks ago and our still settling in. One of my gf‚Äôs friends just asked to come next week to visit the city, and wants to crash at our place for 5 days. It‚Äôs a small place and I really feel like another person living here for almost a week would really cramp my style tbh. I know she misses her friends a lot from back home, so I told my gf that she could stay for at most 2 nights, but her friend would have to find a hotel or airbnb for the remainder of her stay. AITA and being lame? 

I forgot to mention that my gf is currently mad at me and thinks I‚Äôm being inconsiderate. So who‚Äôs right?",06Oct2019,1
855,"Unfortunate events have happened in my life recently and I might be forced to move out of my parents house because of them. I'm 20 years old but I have no never lived on my own. I usually relied on other people to buy groceries, clean the house, cook, do laundry, basically everything. All I really do is bring home money from work to help with bills. So far I plan on moving into a cheap apartment and that's all I've come up with so far. How do I prepare for the big move?",06Oct2019,1
