0,"Hi everyone! I’m not well versed in living on my own. I’ve lived with my parents since basically forever aside from a year in a college dorm and about 6 months living at my ex’s. Basically I’ve never been responsible for being the main coordinator of my own living situation.

I found a good deal online for a bedroom for rent on a separate floor of a house owned by a 40-year-old single woman (I’m also female). It’s $600/month, which is well within my price range and on the average-low end of bedrooms for rent with shared common areas in my area. 

The only picture of the apartment is the street view, however. I texted her and she said we can do a showing on Sunday in the morning. My stepdad might be able to come with me so I don’t put myself in danger, but he’s not officially sure yet. 

Would it be a very bad idea to go alone if I have to? If my stepdad can come, should I let the renter know that I’m bringing him along?",02Oct2019,1

2,"tldr: fucking up recently at work, feel like I’m gonna get fired. Want to turn it around and do what I can to save my job.

I’ve been dealing with a lot of mental health issues lately. I was on disability leave for 4 months and returned to work about a month ago. I try not to bring my mental health problems into the workplace, but recently I feel like I’ve been screwing up with that among other things.

Last week, I made an informal complaint to my manager. Suddenly the leadership at my company want to hear my opinions on how the team can be improved. I’m not used to having the attention of management so it’s freaking me out.

Today, I totally bombed a presentation/demo to my colleagues and the leadership (about 25-30 people in total). It was my worst presentation ever- even worse than in college public speaking. I had forgotten about it until 12 minutes before the presentation and only had those few minutes to prepare. I made myself look like a fool.

I feel like if I continue at this trajectory, I’ll lose my job. This is my fourth job since I started my career 2.5 years ago so I can’t afford to lose it because it’ll certainly be difficult to find another gig because of my employment history (laid off twice, wrongfully terminated once).

I feel like I’m a burden not only to my team but to the company. I feel like I’m an outsider on my team.

How can I turn this around? What should I say to my manager tomorrow during our bi-weekly 1-1 meeting? Should I tell him what’s going on? How would I even phrase that?",02Oct2019,1

On a day to day, how many times do we think about what girls can do and guys cannot or vice versa. If a man allows his women to walk on the outside towards the street, does that mean he cares any less? If a woman pays the rent while the man pays a utility bill, would that make him any less of a man? Question of the day: In todays society are men and women of equal sex?  If a man stays home and takes care of the kids while the woman goes out and works, does that make the man weak? Is the woman the head of the household?

4,"A bit of context, we've known each other for about 3 years now. At first, we were very close, just talking every day now she's just getting mad at me for the littlest things. 

The most recent thing was her getting mad at me for my screen name. My screen name is Athena, and she says I should change it because it's a Greek God and ""I just want to be treated like a god."" It's just a name I like and would like to be called, nothing more than that. 

A bit earlier she gets mad at me because I chose Turkish over French. Yes, I'm being serious. A summary is that I chose Turkish even though other people told me I should learn French. But she DMs me saying that I have to learn French because other people said so. Around the same time, she gets mad at me because I ""stole"" her account and made her beg for a Discord server. I registered both so I owned them. I will admit I should've asked first.

Once again, earlier I told her my feelings about how she was treating me. My friend gets so mad at me, for expressing my feelings towards her. She said that she was ""joking."" No, she wasn't. That isn't joking around. 

I really don't know what to do. When she isn't like this she's so fun to be around, and she has told me that something is going on at home and maybe that's the cause of her behaviour? I don't know. 

I don't know if I should still be friends with her, I've asked other people and they said I shouldn't be friends with her anymore, but at the same time, I want to be there for her at her darkest times. 

Thanks, Athena.",02Oct2019,1
5,"       I (17M) am finally realizing that there might be something very mentally wrong with my mom. Since I was young, she's always had two sides. She's been loving and caring, an amazing person to be around, and on the flip side, angry, spiteful, and hateful of my dad. She used to tell us stories, even sharing how he was apparently sexually abused once (which she had no right to share) and how messed up his family is. They had horrible screaming matches and things were thrown.                           No one ever got hurt, but it was terrifying to young me. I always assumed she was right, because I was young and impressionable and spent way more time around her. However, over the past few years, I've come to realize how bad of a state she's in mentally. She has to win every argument (I mean HAS to) and she'll resort to personal attacks and try to discount our arguments, especially by saying that my sister and I are siding with my dad, and saying that my dad is changing his story. She has some kind of beef with him, but I don't know whether it's a past experience or she just really hates anyone who gets in her way. For years, I placated her, blaming the anger on my dad or her poor life choices (which she blames on the world and circumstances) but I refuse to do it anymore. I'm just not sure if that's a good choice. Should I just go along with her and choose the path of least resistance, or should I continue to stand up for myself? So far, the latter has caused her to say some pretty hurtful things like how she's totally failed as a parent, and how we don't understand her struggle. I don't know what it was that bent her life out of shape, but I can't keep letting it ruin mine. Please, Reddit, what do I do?",02Oct2019,1

7,"I'm having a really hard time deciding what to do. And I'm sorry if this is long. It's a complicated situation and I would really appreciate some advice. 

Ok so I was adopted as a baby. My birth mother refused to name a father, so I was put into foster care. My adoptive parents got me at 4 months old, and were divorced by the time I was 2. My adoptive mother raised me by herself, and was abusive. My adoptive dad moved out of state, and I saw him 2-4 times a year. At age 16 (I'm 28 now), I started trying to find my birth family with very limited information. At age 25, my home state unsealed adoptees birth records, so I wrote to the state requesting mine. I let my adoptive mother know, and at that point she decided I could finally have my birth file. My adoptive mother has always been really shady about my birth file and adoption records, and always told me that she had no photos or names or information on relatives, including medical information. When she gave me the file, it had photos of my biological mother, siblings, grandparents, and uncles. It also had medical information, listed my birth mother's full name and address, etc. I was really surprised that my birth mother had withheld that information from me, and I know periodically she went through the file because schools and doctors asked for pertinent information and she would lock herself in a room to look at it. I never questioned her about why she lied, and got really caught up in finding my birth mother and maternal half siblings. I found them in a matter of days (after 9 years of searching thinking that the files had redacted information). My birth mother wanted nothing to do with me, but my half siblings were able to give me medical information, like the fact that everyone in the family had diabetes, etc. But nobody could tell me who my birth father was. Last year I was able to connect with a close cousin on 23andme, and this week I was able to track down my birth father. I have spoken with several of the cousins from his side, and have been able to piece together a story about how he had some sort of hush hush illegitimate child, and how the family isn't allowed to talk about it. He has told his entire family not to post photos of him online, and has done a very good job of keeping his personal contact information off the internet. He is very successful, Christian, and he has 2 kids that are younger than me. My cousins expressed that his wife could divorce him if she finds out about me, and if that happens she would take half of everything including his business. His daughter is still in high school. 
So here are my dilemmas. 
1. I have siblings. If I were them, I would want to know. I would also probably be really mad at my dad for hiding it from my mom, and for not giving that child the quality of life that he was absolutely able to provide. I also don't want to damage the relationship they have with their dad. I hear they're very close. 
2. After all this time searching, I'm not sure that knowing him/meeting him/talking to him would change much. I don't expect a miraculous father daughter bond. I really just wanted to know his name and medical history. Now I know. So I'm not sure much good would come from making contact. Plus, he might not welcome me, or might ask me to stay hidden from his wife. I can only go off what his family has told me. 
3. The cousins I've spoken to have alluded to the fact that my adoptive parents met with my birth father when I was about 12 years old. The level of shadiness from my adoptive family makes my gut tell me there is far more to the story than I already know. Part of me really wants to know if they lied to me, because I have asked point blank if they met or knew my birth family, and they said no. But I'm also not close to my adoptive family, so this knowledge wouldn't really change much in our dynamic, because I live 20 hours from them and don't involve myself with them unless I have to for holidays. 
4. I can't figure out if I'm scared of being rejected or really just feel like contact and knowing more will really change anything. After so many years of looking, I just feel ready to be done. 

What would you do if you were me?

8,"My parents already clearly know i do not want to be circumcised but they are still very persistent. I was originally going to get circumcised when i was 12 (in philippine culture, you usually do it around your teens) but they kept delaying it until i was 14. but then i started questioning it and started doing my own research. In my opinion, i found it unnecessary. They were VERY upset with my decision. my father accused me of being gay, they told me all women would be disgusted by it, that i will never fully mature if I dont go through it and that I'm in high risk of catching HIV. Things were really heated but i was firm on my answer and told them i didnt want to go through it.

Thankfully after a week, they stopped and cancelled the appointment. I thought it was over and done but in the past 4 years, it kept randomly being brought up. It's not often but I would just prefer if they stopped trying to convince me completely and understand im not changing my mind.

10,"I’m (26F) feeling pretty nervous right now. My boyfriend (23M) got hurt on the job about a week ago. He got a deep gash on his knee that required 5 stitches. He was supposed to call a doctor to set up an appt to get the stitches taken out but his anxiety was too bad to push him to do it. I should’ve been on him more about it. Today, after I got home from work, I asked him if he found a doctor and he said “no, my moms going to do it. She’s taken plenty of stitches out before, she has a lot of experience.” I questioned him, asked if he thought it was a good idea, and he assured me it’s what he wanted to do. But when the time came, it turns out that the wound hadn’t completely healed because he’s been working normally on it for the past couple of days. He had the plan to go to work tonight and ask for light duty, but they denied his request and put him on his usual work. I’m agonizing over this, I can’t stop worrying. I can’t stop blaming myself because I should’ve been firmer with saying he shouldn’t go through with it. I feel like a terrible girlfriend. I know he’s stubborn and wouldn’t have listened probably, but I can’t stop beating myself up because he might have really screwed himself over in more ways than one with this.

15,"Hey everyone, I guess I'll start by giving backstory. I joined the navy right out of high school and so didnt learn a lot of things about correct choices and financial planning. However, everything had been going good for a while. I made some pretty bad choices with money and credit cards. But I was recovering and learning how to better spend and save. The problems started last year around April, when I stopped by subway on my way he from work and found out my debit and credit cards were both declined. So I opened my navy federal app to check and found out that my account had been hacked. They took everything. Everything in my savings and checking. They maxed my credit card with cash advances. And even took out personal loans in my name. The cash advances and loan they didnt withdraw though, so I paid that back immediately. But they still stole about $8000 from me. What was worse was that my bank denied my claim, they said it was my fault. I know I didnt get scammed, I'm not that stupid to give out my info. I also know this because I didnt even know my own account info. I always did the thumbprint scan on my phone. They had to reset my info for me to file a claim. But they still think I did it. But anyway, so I was $8000 in debt but it's the navy, they feed you and the pay is alright, so it wasn't unbearable. Then in September of that year the navy messed up some paperwork and gave me a $22000 bonus for no reason at all. Simple fix I thought, I just have to talk to personnel and give it back. Then they told me that they cant, because it's not getting posted as debt, they told me that it should be fine but theres nothing they can do. I'm still skeptical so I wait a month and keep checking in with them, but nothing's happening. So i do the worse thing i could've done. I started with using that money to pay off my identity theft debt. In my mind it made sense, debt to the navy is interest free, while since I basically placed my other debt on my credit card, it had interest. That opened the floodgates I guess though because then I started using more and more of it. I just, wasnt able to let it sit there I guess. Then December rolls around and my paycheck is half of what it should be. Turns out they decided to collect the debt after all. I dont have the money anymore and so they're just gonna take it from my pay. It would be been fine and good but just yesterday I separated from the navy. It was for mental health reasons resulting from this financial issue and a few other issues, but I dont really want to talk about that. So now the problem is I still have 17000 debt to the navy, and all I have is 3000 in my checking. I'm going home to georgia to stay with my dad until I start college next year, and I have a job lined up too, but it's just. I cant stop worrying about this. I can change the payments per month to line up with my income, but still. I dont even know if this is an average or a lot of amount of debt. I just dont know what to do. I know it's my fault for this, but any advice would be very welcome.",02Oct2019,3

Hi, I'm new to Reddit and I don't really know where to post it and I wanted to get advice from people. I can't really tell my family as most of them I am on bad terms with and the rest probably won't understand. I'm 18 years old male and right now going to college to become a preschool teacher, but I'm having doubts if I should still pursue this path.

I always felt that something in my mind was wrong. Emotions were one thing I didn't really understand. Why are people always enthusiastic? Why can't I describe how I feel to friends and families? Why do people call me cold and heartless? These questions plagued my mind through life and decided to see what was wrong with me, mostly for curiosity.

I was diagnosed with high alexithymic traits, mostly on Difficulty Describing Feelings, Problematic Interpersonal Relationships, Difficulty Identifying Feelings, though all categories I showed very high alexithymic traits.

I also had a lot of suicidal thoughts for no reason. The last time I thought of suicide was around 1 week ago, but I don't know why, I wasn't feeling any particular emotion when thinking if I should kill myself. I haven't told my family and friends any of this because I want to keep it to myself.

The doctors are sure that the reason I have alexithymic traits is because of the abuse and neglect in my childhood. When I was five to eight years old I was physically and emotionally abused by my mother's boyfriend at the time and somewhat neglected by my mother.

My earliest childhood memory was my biological father telling that I was a mistake, he wanted nothing to do with me.

I didn't have a lot of memories of my mother at the time because she was mostly working and when she wasn't she was sleeping. That gave me ample time to bond with my mother's boyfriend.

One instance of abuse was when he gathered up all my stuffed animals, toys, blankets, and pillows, piled them up, and surrounded them with cement blocks. He grabbed two of my toys and said, ""This toy represents your mother and this one represents your sister, if the house was on fire and you can only save one, which one would you choose?"" I was six at the time and like any six year old, I wanted to be a hero, so I said, ""I want to save them both."" To which he replied, ""You can only save one, not both, that decision costed you your mother's and sister's lives."" He through the two toys in the pile, doused it with lighter fluid and proceeded to light my stuff on fire.

Another was on the day after my seventh birthday. He wasn't there for my birthday so the day after he came into my room in the morning and told be that he had a present for me. He opened his hand and had seven thumb tacks. He said he had one for each year and proceeded to stab them between my fingernail and skin in seven of my fingers.

I was put through daily with beatings with studded belts until my butt was black and blue to different emotional scenarios. I was also bullied a lot in school for the way I dressed, which usually consisted of baggy long sleeves and pants. The teachers saw this and did nothing. I even showed one of the teachers I trusted my bruises and she said she would help me, but after six months of waiting, nothing changed.

This went on until I was eight. My mother decided to break up with the boyfriend because she saw the abuse and we moved to a different state. My mother never really showed a lot of regret, except for talking bad about the guy behind his back.

I'm 18 years old now and believe I want to be a preschool teacher, mostly to help children going through what I did. I think I really want to help, but I'm not sure if I should continue on this path. Teaching, especially with young preschool children, requires a lot of emotional feelings, something I can't really provide.

So I need advice, can a person with has thoughts of suicide and alexithymia become a preschool teacher? Or should I pursue something else?",02Oct2019,1

At first it was sporadic, but then we noticed he was doing quite often. We talked to him about stopping so he doesn’t lose his job, and he was open to getting help. 

Anyways I befriended a wife to someone in this group, and hang out with her regularly. She’s upset that the friend in the group is still doing drugs (not as often as before). She’s telling me that others in the group are also experimenting with these drugs now. What bothers her is her spouse being around it, and she thinks this happens all the time. I however see this group of friends very often, and don’t see drugs at all. If it is being done, it’s very discreetly.

My son was welcome to go away for college too but wanted to go to a local one. Although he only had to travel a half hour to class if living with me, he still lived in dorms and apartments. I wanted him having the full college time. He got tired of it and eventually moved home but continued going to classes up until he graduated. I was happy with this and love having him home. Now he still lives with me and he said he graduated in May and didn’t walk at graduation because he didn’t have friends there, I didn’t care to question, it was his preference. I asked him about his diploma and he said it was coming in the mail. I forgot to bring it up again. 

Ever since he “graduated” he has been working for me. He’s a great employee and I’m always impressed with his natural skill and ethic. 

Yesterday he came into the kitchen crying. I hadn’t seen my son cry since his mother and I told him we were getting divorced over 8 years ago. He broke down and said he “couldn’t breathe living with his lies anymore.” 
He told me that he failed out of college 2 semesters short and that he had been taking solely “non-degree courses” as that was all the university would allow him to take. So he had me pay for 2 semesters of courses that didn’t even go towards a degree then he lied about receiving a bachelors degree. He flunked out and maintained his lie perfectly. That is, until his guilt ate him alive. 

I’m wondering what I should do. He doesn’t have enough money saved up to get his own place and I don’t plan on firing him either, though it might be the right thing to do. I don’t want to hurt my relationship with him or his livelihood. I think he has a place working for me for as long as he wants to and I feel a responsibility to take care of him but I also feel responsible to provide consequences.

29,"Hey Reddit!

I work at a local pool as a lifeguard. I’m a Junior in high school. There’s this sophomore girl who goes to my school and she’s a swim teacher at the pool. I often have shifts with her.

The first time I saw her, I was blown away. There was something different about her; something you can’t really pin down. She’s pretty, sure, but there’s some indescribable quality that just makes her glow. And don’t even get me started on her smile. It lights up the room, hell, the world. It stirs my soul in a way few things do these days. I can tell that she’s very emotionally intelligent and kind by the way she works with the kids. 

We make eye contact very often. More often than anyone on the pool deck. Whenever she’s laughing at something crazy a kid is doing, she looks at me to see if I’m smiling. I am, but it’s not because of what the kid is doing; it’s simply from watching her work, smile, teach these kids a basic life skill.

Okay, I’m trying not to get too sappy.

Now, the downside: We’ve only actually talked a few times. And it’s always me initiating the conversation. And it’s always very short, like under 10 seconds. Whenever we do talk, though, she smiles her genuine smile and it gives me hope. But when she walks by my guard chair or just by me if I’m standing, she usually doesn’t smile or even look at me, and believe me I know because I’m checking to see if she is. So that’s a bit confusing.

During today’s shift, I initiated a longer-than-usual conversation (meaning like 15 seconds) in which I asked her about a family member who goes to the high school. She again gave me that smile, and although her responses weren’t really full sentences, there was actual emotion in them. It didn’t feel like she was just trying to get it over with.

If you’re still reading this, god bless you.

So here’s the problem: after this Sunday, I’m not going to have a shift for awhile because of a school thing. I don’t want to wait too long and dissipate an already thin relationship. I know for a fact there’s some chemistry going on. Should I take a chance and ask her out this Sunday? Would it make me seem desperate? Ahhh!!

TL;DR: I’m a lifeguard, she’s a swim teacher, we give each other interesting looks, talk sometimes but very briefly. I won’t have a shift for awhile after this Sunday. Should I take a chance and ask her out next shift??",02Oct2019,1
30,"I have my good friends, but, I’m sick of talking to the middle-aged teachers and other students.

I understand and concede that they are young and unhappy. But, they beat themselves up, are conceited, and cannot hold a meaningful convo.

I’m a nice person, I give them compliments, then they become attracted to these sweet words, but, **I can’t take the fact they don’t want to hear a solution or the truth sometimes.** they can also never give a compliment or empathize.

I point out a mistake, and the teachers believe I am challenging his authority. I offer up a solution to an assignment or offer a better way to approach a problem; they lose their temper. They’ll find ways to make rumors or point out mine or someone’s mistakes even if it wasn’t my or their fault or it was the next person’s fault.

It makes me even more furious that I have to follow through with this treatment while encouraging others and staying positive because throughout my life, the adults in my life have always been truthful and critical to my faults; they wanted to challenge me and help me grow, and, I choose to see from other’s paradigms and empathize.

But, I can not take such arrogance and unawareness.

I sympathize with flaws in an individual but this is too much for me.

Do I just grit my teeth and take this as a learning experience? How do I do this?",02Oct2019,1

33,"Hello friends

I live with two roommates (3 people in the apartment including myself). We live in an area where parking is an absolute premium, and people will pay up to $150 a month for a tandem parking spot. We have 3 tandem parking spots that come with our apartment (you can fit 3 cars in a straight line, where 2 people have to back out to let the last car out). We just signed a lease on this place, and I met the other two roommates online so I wouldn't say we're really friends. My other  roommates both have cars and use them regularly. I do not have a car. Subletting parking spots is a common practice in my area; I sublet my parking spot last year at my previous apartment for a whole year, but that spot was not a tandem spot.

My question is this: would I be an asshole if I asked my roommates if I could sublet my parking spot as it would lower my rent quite a bit. The obvious problem is having a 3-car tandem spot (where one of the car-owners does not live in the same apartment) would be a huge pain to my other roommates. So would it then be okay for me to suggest that they pay me an amount to agree that I wouldn't sublet my spot?

Here are some scenarios based on a figure of $150 per parking spot.

1) I sublet my parking spot to someone else who lives close by (if things were to go this route, I would make sure that the new person's schedule fits well with my roommates and that they live nearby). I save $150 a month. I give a little bit of that, say $25 each to each of my roommates as compensation for the inconvenience of the 3rd car-owner not living in the same apartment. So I'd save $100 net.

2) I suggest that my roommates pay me directly so that I do not lose out on renting out my spot, and they thereby pay a little extra to have the convenience of a 2-car tandem spot rather than a 3-car tandem spot. I'd say $50 from each roommate, so I'd save the same $100 as option 1.

3) Nothing happens, my roommates don't pay/save anything and I don't save anything.

I'm basing all this on the idea that if none of us had cars, we would sublet our spots for $150 each and each save that amount on rent. Instead I'd only be saving $100 because of the inconvenience factor. 

Obviously, another way of looking at it is that I'm looking to get a refund on a portion of a commodity because I'm not planning to use it. And why should my roommates have to pay extra for their own parking spots that were supposed to be included in the rent if we go with option 2? I'm a little confused because in my current situation, I'd like to save some extra money, but if I was in their situation, I have a feeling I would think I was a bit of a prick.

Please give me some advice!",02Oct2019,1
34,"Hi!

I’m a 21 (F), I just bought a 2004 Volkswagen Beetle convertible for $1,700 on offer up.

The girl told me the title is clean and all I have to pay is the registration fee with is 50 + late fee.

I check the dmv for the status and it’s $375 for the registration fee. Also, there’s an undisclosed $180 ticket on the car as well. 

Furthermore, I get the car checked at my mechanic. The engine &amp; transmission is good. But, there’s no air bags and they have been tampered with. He concluded the car had to be in an accident. Also, the back window is busted. 

I tried reaching the girl, but she changed her name &amp; isn’t answering her phone number. 

What can I do now?

Can I resell the car on offer up along the bill pay &amp; pink slip? 

Can I report this to the police?

35,"I was dating a girl for a long time and we ended up getting to the point where we were ready for sex. Her period came late the first time and consistently was late afterwards while we were doing it. I always pulled out AND wore condoms, however one time I MAY have had cum on my hand afterwards and fingered her, although I am pretty sure it wasn’t (between my middle and ring finger it was a little bit dry and sticky, that’s the only evidence I have) later on, I broke up with her. However I waited until she got her period which she says was entirely normal (color, length, flow, everything) besides being a little lighter and ~6 days late. I had no contact with her after this. I didn’t think anything of it, and I was ready to break up with her, so knowing she got her period and feeling safe in the fact I wouldn’t have an awkward trip to planned parenthood, I did. Now, it is a month after this and she is ~10 days late and I am terrified. I read about implantation bleeding and now I’m concerned that maybe it wasn’t actually her period. I am terrified, can anyone offer help or advice or anything.

37,"A little background: I have been working for 12 years now proctoring tests. I am an independent contractor on a test-to-test basis, but even when I don’t actually run the tests, I line up qualified people and train them, as well as ensuring that they do all that needs to be done. The company is not local, and I am the only person locally who runs the show. 

In the past year, the company has gone downhill. I’m frequently missing materials that they should have sent me, they have been paying later each time, and communication is extremely lacking. It’s more trouble for me than it’s worth, at this point.  

So the question is, should I explain why I won’t be taking tests for them anymore? Or just a standard “thanks so much for the opportunity” kind of letter? Is it petty to tell them why I’m over it?",02Oct2019,1
38,"I used to drive a 1999 Toyota Land Cruiser, and since I live in the city, I hated everything about it. It averaged 8 miles to the gallon and is impossible to parallel park on most streets. This summer, I finally got rid of the Toyota and my father helped me shop for a new car. We visited dealers like Mazda and Volkswagen, and all the 2019 models were costing a lot more than we expected, for example a mid trim Mazda 3 with some important features are setting us back around 33000 CAD after tax. Therefore, when we finally visited Audi, (which was never a serious contender due to price) we saw the 2019 Audi Q3, and it was love at first sight.  My father vastly preferred the Audi over the other ones, and since our family is always careful with our money and savings, he was able to buy it with cash right away and still have more than enough for our family.

He paid 47000 for the car and around 52500 CAD after tax, and coming from the Toyota, I was ecstatic and felt like I was flying a spaceship. However, about a month later, the impulse of buying the stunning German hatchback faded quickly, I now realized how big of a mistake it was. I’m a 19 year old university student and make minimum wage in B.C. So I make around 6-7k per year. Living in BC, my entire income for the year is just enough to cover for insurance, as a relatively new driver my rates are sky high, and factoring in depreciation and maintenance, gas and parking at both school and my apartment, I’m on track to lose 20,000 dollars just in my first year of owning this car, not factoring the possible recession in 2020 and the EV revolution that is supposedly coming. I know I wouldn’t be able to keep this car for over 5 years since I don’t own a permanent home in BC and the car doesn’t have any safety or self driving tech that’s rather crucial in modern cars. My dream come true has become a financial nightmare, and I hate myself for spoiling my family’s money every time I sit in the car, since it’s almost two months old at this point, should I sell it if I can reclaim the 7% pst? My calculations determine that id lose about 7000 dollars and just be done with the car, I feel like that’s okay, but I hope you can give me your two cents of whether to sell or keep the car, thank you!

39,"I'm gonna be brutally honest here I definitely am not the best person. This story begins with my ex and me when I was in high school. I was 18 and a Senior and so was he. I wanted to go to prom and didn't know anyone until one day I walked to my car after school and there was this guy holding a sign that said ""I know this is totally gay but will you go to prom with me anyway?"" I obviously said yes because it made my heart melt. He immediately took me out to ci i house, surprise dinner dates, if i needed food he got it for me, anything i wanted he got me. (He bought me my first Louis Vuitton backpack that he saved up from his two jobs which i felt awful about but me being me i accepted...) After we made it official (It wasn't really official in my eyes since everytime he would say i love you i would just smile and change the subject) it's like i couldn't fight with him. Whatever i said went..He was basically everything i wanted in a guy he was 6'4 and tall and latin and masculine as i was only 5'7 and tiny and twinkish (which in the gay community means hairless small and slightly feminine) He was driving me insane! But i didn't want to cut it off because i loved the attention he gave me and i loved being lusted over. For my birthday after graduating high school he rented me and all my friends a lake house. I made my friends distract him so i could have another guy over. I know I know it's awful but it's true. He still refused to believe I would ever cheat on him even after he saw numerous times I had grindr and tinder right on my phone in front of him. I would push the limits with fights as far as they'd go just to see what'd he would do. I refused to sleep with him i think the entire time we were together we had sex MAYBE 3 TIMES and that was because i was basically blackout drunk. Now let's fastforward 1 year later and I ghosted him. I didn't even send him a text, I just blocked him straight up. He would show up to my house and I wouldn't answer and eventually he gave up. Now it's been a year of us not being together and he has a new boyfriend. (I hadn't seen or heard from him all year I just saw him in target with his boyfriend, and when i saw him his eyes instantly lit up even in front of his new ""boy-toy"" so of course me being me and not caring about his boyfriend apparently i unblocked him. I know what i'm doing is wrong but i'm going down the path of starting this up again. It's gonna end up ruining his new relationship, and i'm not even gonna care. I'm basically heartbreaking this amazing guy i wish i could love but for some reason just can't. Am I wrong if i continue to text him after the other day of seeing him?",02Oct2019,1

i’ve already looked around on google for some insight but it all seemed pretty obvious, while i’m looking for more specific ways to help him out.

he said that he wasn’t particularly close to her because she had dementia and has been sick on and off for his whole life. he also mentioned feeling bad because he really hated her for being the reason why his parents fight all the time (it impacts him a lot). 

i think he’s blaming himself a lot and while i tell him to try not to blame himself (though i know it’s hard), i feel like i’m being super unhelpful during such a hard time of his life.

Basically it’s your fun, beer drinking group just there to have fun and not take it too seriously. (As I think it should be, we’re adults playing softball it’s all in good fun not a serious competitive sport)
Our team is definitely not good. We usually lose very badly. But everyone kinda laughs it off and congratulated each other if we do something good. When we make a mistake we joke about it because naturally that’s what you do when you’re embarrassed. 
Basically every game we play we get in a huuuge fight after. He takes it extremely seriously and gets mad that we are not good. He says that everyone is trying to suck and that it’s not funnys it’s just super immature. I said I think they are in it for a different reason than you may be. He says it’s “mind boggling” that I would defend these people who are TRYING to be bad. I defend them and say they aren’t trying they just ARE bad and some people would rather laugh about it than just suck and be sad.

You can’t just tell someone to fix something and they fix it like that, especially in sports.

45,"Context: Okay so there’s this girl that I met through Apex Legends (around late January, when the game was popular) that I’ve only recently got in touch with again in late July. How I got in touch with her was by inviting her to my 19th Birthday house party. I saw her in my Facebook friends list when picking the invites and thought “fuck it, let’s invite her for the meme, there is no way she’s gonna come to my party since she’s from Brisbane, Queensland, and I’m from Melbourne, Victoria”. So I invited her and told my mates who also knew her since we were in the same gaming group, it also gave me a reason to reconnect and see how she was going since we hadn’t talked in 5 months. I messaged her after I made the event on Facebook asking if she’s gonna come, she then replies, “yeah sure why not?” I was actually so shocked. A girl is making the effort to come all the way down to Melbourne from Brisbane to my party. During the time that I had made the event and the night of the party itself, we had been FaceTiming every night for hours. Every time I finished work she’d message me straight away and called me. I loved it. Fast forward to a couple nights before the party, she actually came down and booked an airbnb near my house for the weekend. We connected so well and being the awkward person I am I thought the convo wouldn’t flow but it did! Anyways she came to my party, we had fun, she met my mates (who also knew her since we all played games together) it was overall a good night, anyways she invites me back to her airbnb, we didn’t have sex, but the next night she invited me back again, and we did. I forgot to mention that her mum lives in Shepparton, Victoria (only about a 2 hour drive from me) which she was then gonna live with instead of living with her “shitty brother” up in Brisbane. So after the weekend she’s moved back home, where she’s happy. To this day we still catch up, bit of sexual interaction here and there. I then explain after a month and a half of meeting her for the first time, my feelings for her, she unfortunately doesn’t feel the same, and wants to stay friends. I don’t like to toot my own horn here but she has told me that I’m attractive, she thinks I’m funny and that I’m “one of the few people that can make her laugh”, she loves my company, she feels comfortable to come to me for help, I’m her shoulder to cry on, I spoil her, I get along well with her friends and family, she’s always super excited to talk to and see me, I just make her overall genuinely happy. She’s told me about her past boyfriends and I’ve seen what they look like too. They’re not the most good looking of guys and they’ve been very controlling and a couple of them have been very mentally and physically abusive. What am I doing wrong? Am I too nice? Does she just have a thing for assholes? 

Redditors I need your wisdom

I’ve talked over about it with only two people, my best mate and my dad. My best mate is not really sure, he thinks I should just hang in there and eventually she’ll realise that I’m the one. My dad is a little more harsh, giving me 2 options. Option 1: saying that I should confront her about that I’m not looking for a friendship and that if there’s not going to be anything between us, it’s not worth my time and effort. Which puts her in a situation where she has to make a hard decision to either move this friendship into a relationship or just abandon the entire thing all together. Option 2: move on to other girls, pay less attention to her and more attention to others, she’ll eventually realise that she’s losing a valuable person in her life, and she’ll come running back, if she doesn’t, tough luck.

I’m a nice guy, as you guys can probably tell, and I’m sticking with my mate’s advice right now since I hate the thought of losing her or putting her in such an uncomfortable position. Also I’m just not into other girls like I’m into her, she’s not like others I’ve seen in the past. I feel so fucking good around her and I’m always so happy with her. But my dad’s advice is probably right, I don’t want to waste my time trying to get someone I can’t get. It’s a depressing move but it’s probably for the best.",02Oct2019,1

So I don’t actually have much of a background when it comes to relationships. I identify as Pansexual to everyone. But everyday I’m coming realize how much I’m not attracted to men. I mean, don’t get me wrong they are attractive and some guys make me want to seriously go off the deep end. But I’m never sexually attracted to them. I want so desperately to be attracted to guys but I never feel anything. For women I kind of do but I’ve never been with a woman, or kissed one or anything of that sort.

No rules, Nothing holding anyone back. As Arthur trudges angrily through the forest he is facinated by all the new properties of the world since the fall of humanity. New plants, Seemingly new animals never seen before.

It was like some weird fever dream every adventurer would kill for. But it was real and as real life does it hurts you and scares you over and over. At first, the adventerous spirit that the new lands give off overpower

that initial fear. As time grows the fear grows, as you get new experiences the land starts to scare once again. However, Arthur seemed immune to this fear. His drive and spirit to always be learning and discovering really

gave the others hope in the grim world they were all unwillingly spiraled into. In the massive plains, the misty mountains, the deep oceans, and the dense forests there was always something waiting. Waiting for that human 

spirit to come and discover the creatures and ruins lost to time. As the boys finally have a small ""home"" set up they sit around the campfire and eat as they prepare themselves for a rough day ahead of survival.",02Oct2019,1
54,"Hi! my name is Megan and i’ve decided my high school needs what i needed most in freshman year, a psychology club! my club idea is to be a support group for people with not only mental illnesses but with people struggling day to day. it wouldn’t be group therapy more teaching people coping mechanism and about certain resources as well as providing a comforting and safe environment incase they fear going home. i want to get lots of people to join and obviously it can’t be “mental health club” because it’s teenagers. i want to come up with a punny and fun name so people don’t feel like they have ‘problems’ if they go to my club! sorry not the most creative!!",02Oct2019,1
55,"I'm not really sure where to begin. I've had many issues throughout my life that has lead up to this point and I have no one to talk to about it. Before I begin, I'll give a little bit of background info. I'm a male, I'm currently 19 years old, freshman attending a community college a couple hours from home playing soccer, and I've been home schooled my whole life up until this point. I'm practically entirely new to reddit, so I apologize if I'm not formatting right or not giving enough detail or just sporadic overall. I'll provide different paragraphs/reasons that have lead up to my current mindset today.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I turned 14/15 years old I've been lacking feelings. For the most part, I either feel sad or indifferent, I rarely feel any other kind of emotion. Very recently, I decided to talk to some of my family about this (I have both parents who care very much about me and 3 brothers and 2 sisters), I talked to my younger brother who's 17 years old and the only sibling I have a strong relationship with, I talked to my mom about how I've been feeling, and I talked to one of my older brothers too. They both told me they basically feel the same way, which makes me assume the way I've been feeling is genetic and there's no way around it. I've tried therapy and that lead nowhere.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to get extreme anxiety all of the time, just having to speak to someone about anything would make me very nervous. Lately though, I get anxious depending on the day. Some days I'm very confident in myself and I don't care what anyone thinks, and other days this terrible anxiety returns. I have no idea what this is dependent on, but I can't seem to control it whatsoever.

&amp;#x200B;

In class, around friends, I'm a very quiet person, and people point this out all of the time. I wish I wasn't, but I am and it's hard not to be. I'm extremely introverted and melancholic. After being around people for 1-3 hours, it feels like all of my energy has been completely drained and I don't feel like talking to anyone and I want to just lie in bed. I hate this about myself, I'd like to be more social and energized and live life more, but at the same time, when the depression is really bad, I don't care to do anything. My emotions, when present, are very bipolar.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 14, I started getting into soccer. From the age of 14-16, I played soccer an excessive amount. I'd force myself to play everyday, even when I wasn't feeling like it, for a minimum of 1-2 hours, I was determined to be great at it. I eventually got really good, not good enough to play D1 college or anything, but I improved quickly over a short span of time. That drive I felt during that time is completely gone, I haven't felt any need or desire to work towards something for a while. I haven't felt any sort of passion for anything recently either. I just don't care about anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Since high school sophomore year I've had 3 serious romantic relationships. The first girl I dated we knew each other since elementary school. We went out for 6 months and she ended up breaking up with me for some other guy, which they're still going out 'till this day. I was slightly upset about this for a while, but I eventually got over it. The relationship was very toxic, she was manipulative and controlling and I wasn't very understanding.

&amp;#x200B;

Almost exactly a year after we broke up, I started dating this other girl, we connected very well. After 5 months or so I started to lose feelings for her, I honestly have no idea why, we kind of just drifted apart. I'm not proud of this one bit, but I ended up dragging the relationship on for another 4 months for the sexual benefits. I eventually broke up with her and she started dating this other guy about a year later and has been in a relationship with him for about a year. Occasionally I think back, and I find myself regretting this very much. I miss her, but I'm confused about how I truly feel towards her.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, 6 months after the breakup, I started dated another girl our senior year of high school. This girl has had this 'best guy friend who she thinks of as a brother' her whole life. I wasn't worried about that at all at first. We dated for 7 months, to make it long story short, she cheated on me with him. Compared to the other girls I dated, I was absolutely in love with this girl. We just broke up 4 months ago from today and a day hasn't gone by that I haven't thought about her, not necessarily positive things. I'm not proud of this either, but when me and this girl were talking she had a boyfriend of 3 years, and she cheated on him with me. So I blame myself sometimes for not seeing this coming. Anyways, her and the guy have been dating since.

&amp;#x200B;

Back to the way I feel on an everyday basis. It's been a lot worse the past few months, I've been feeling sadness or nothing whatsoever almost all of the time. I downloaded tinder a few months ago. I've gone on a couple of dates. I've desperately been trying to force and/or find a connection with someone, anyone. I've lost all self-respect for myself. I feel lonely even when I'm around friends or family. I get a decent amount of compliments on my looks, but I just feel like I'm not good looking at all. Everyday lately has been filled with pessimistic thoughts and I really have no motivation to go through with school, to maintain any relationships, or to continue in life in general.

&amp;#x200B;

All of my ""relationships"" whether they be with family, a friend, a girl, has felt empty and dry. I don't text many people, but the ones I do text mainly consists of small talk and feel forced. When I drive 2 hours to go back home, usually on weekends, where all of my friends live, I sometimes hangout with them. Even then, I don't feel like they truly care about me and I end up not talking much and being excluded from conversations. On weekdays, besides attending class and doing homework, I either sit in my room and just lie in bed or watch youtube or netflix, or on some days I have soccer practice for the school. Occasionally I want to hangout with someone, but I have no one. I feel lonely, pathetic, depressed or emotionless, unmotivated, and done with life. I apologize if I gave more information than necessary, but I'm glad I got it all out.

&amp;#x200B;

66,"Hello, 
 
So my mom has been going to  Goldsgym for about 5 months, she has been constantly bullied by people who are around her age. My mom attends every  zumba class  given in that gym. 
 
Shes 51. looks younger than her age and shes in good shape. Unlike some people her age. My mom is not fluent in English but she understands it. Some of the type of harrassment included 

1. Forcing her to move from her spot in the dance floor.. yelling at her and snapping their fingers for her to move 
2. Giving her dirty looks/ pointing at her. 
3. Making comments about her appearance 

""Look at her with nails and eyelashes, she probably doesn't do anything at home"" ""she probably has never work in her life"" -- ""look at how she moves, she thinks shes all that"" --- both in English and Spanish. 

Just for the fact that she looks presentable at the gym and does the dance routines. Sounds like most comments come from jealousy. 🤔

4. Trying to push her away-- telling her shes in the way.
  
***Mind you all of them are older women, at times I think shes dealing with teenagers **** 

At the beginning my mom brushed them off. My mom tends to  ignored them , but at times when they annoyed her, she will tell something or flipped them off. 
I have wrote an email to the general manager of the gym and my mom has spoken to the dance teacher about the behavior of the women,but  it's not like they will get in trouble. It's not school. They are paying customers,  so at I dont think much will be done. 

If the harrassment is not resolved,  should she just go somewhere else?",02Oct2019,1

Her name is Kiki, she’s been with me for 8-10 years, and I love her to pieces, this stuff is just so devastating to me.

73,"I’ll try to keep this as short and relevant to our current situation as possible. My grandmother is 83 years old and she has always been pretty neurotic, and makes herself the victim in every situation. She also holds on to everything. She is still mad at me about things I did when I was 13 (I’m almost 27) and in her old age she just seems to choose to be angry and bitter about everything that has gone wrong in her life instead of looking back on the good things.
My mom is living with her due to her current financial situation. My mom broke her arm falling off her horse almost a year ago. My grandma has made her injury about her this whole time, saying things like “this has been so hard on me” etc etc. My poor mom has been relying on my grandma more than she’s wanted to, my poor mom couldn’t drive for a while (my grandma is honestly a terrible driver...I’m talking stopping and reversing in the middle of intersections) and she can’t hardly even do her own hair. But if you ever bring up how hard of a time my mom is having, she will say “I’M SUFFERING TOO!!” She gets mad at my mom for ridiculous things like my toddler son preferring my mom over my grandma, as if that’s her fault.
Today she sent me an aggressive text telling me I need to reach out my mom after her surgery on her arm, followed with “don’t tell your mom I told you to text her because I’m trying not to be so controlling.” I decided to push a little and tell her if she doesn’t want to be controlling then don’t. Of course that ended with me being “nasty” and she brought up a few years ago when we weren’t getting along and she had kicked me out of her house (we’ve all lived with her and she is impossible to live with)
My question is, how can we stage an intervention for her? How can we tell her that the way she is to everyone in her family is unacceptable if she wants to spend her final years with us in her life? If we bring anything up, it’s an attack and she becomes the victim. She locks herself up for days and talks about how stressed and hurt she is and her diarrhea...god. I really hope my mom can leave her house soon. She is even considering living in a camper just to be free from her. We do need to somehow get through to her that she should not treat the people who are going to be taking care of her this way. She attacks us but then becomes the victim if we stick up for ourselves or each other.
How do we get through to her?",02Oct2019,1
74,"I'm honestly really, really confused.

One of the guys I liked (15M) found out about my feelings last year and asked me a question about that in a game of truth or dare. I (15F) ended up confirming it, but told him it was because of a nice gesture he did during last year's prom, which was being my last dance and being really comforting considering I was pretty bothered over something else, in hopes of glossing over that issue smoothly.

Not long after, he talks to me in person and in private about how he actually liked me too, and that if he didn't have a girlfriend, I would probably take her place.

I honestly didn't think much of it, and thought that was pretty obvious anyways. Though, I simply didn't think of the possibility of us after that.

But apparently, he just couldn't seem to do the same.

Weeks later, he always asks me the question of if we were a thing and that's mostly all he could talk about lately. He now boops my nose, puts his head on my shoulder, pats my head and ruins my hair more often than he did before.

Out of nowhere though, he wraps his arms around me on a day where everyone was exhausted and he just nuzzles his head on my shoulder area to tell me he really likes me. But I immediately point out how he has a gf and he regrets it.

He apologizes to me but his apology leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I was okay when he said he does stupid things when he's tired, but it got really iffy when he said I remind him of his gf too much.

Oh, and even after the apology, before playing a game with his friends, he leans his head on mine to tell me I'm his lucky charm?

I live in a house with my wife in a suburban neighborhood. Our room is in a corner of the house and the houses are pretty close to one another. It’s generally a quiet neighborhood and rarely do we have noise problems. 

Except for now. 

Around 9:30pm-10:30pm our neighbors daughter comes to let her dogs out in the yard. Good so far right? 

Here’s the thing, whether we’re trying to sleep, study, or watching TV, the neighbors daughter SINGS AT THE TOP OF HER LUNGS.

A couple of times I’ve been woken up and thought someone was being attacked or needed help. She’s been doing it for about 2 years now and she hasn’t gotten any better. No matter where you are in the house you can hear here and it’s not pleasant whatsoever. 

What are my options? I was thinking of writing a note and slipping it in their mailbox but it feels mean.

88,"Alt account and vague details cause I’m paranoid. 



To summarize the situation: a few months ago, I was browsing job listings for the 1000th time and saw a post from the local college. Essentially, anybody over the age of 18 with a skill they could share with people could pitch their idea and instruct an ungraded class for the college/ local community. I decided “why the hell not” and threw out my idea.


Forgot about it because it took so long to hear back. Then they call me in for an interview last week. Pitched it to them and they loved it. They want to take this class very far. I was ecstatic because it’s a niche interest of mine that I actually went to school for. I’m going to instruct kids 12-18 on this topic.


The problem is: I actually want to do good . I want to be a good teacher despite the fact this won’t be graded . I didn’t  graduate college. It was too expensive for me to pursue this degree without a clear idea of what I wanted to do, which I didn’t have. 


This class is pretty academic. Think debate rather than yoga or cooking (nothing against those arts). I believe I possess the knowledge to do this, but I’m not sure I know how to be a good teacher. I don’t want to flip and ruin this subject I see as very important and helpful and overlooked by middle and high school curriculum. I want them to be engaged.",02Oct2019,2

I will do my best to keep this as general as I can so as to not disclose personal information, but I work in a sales-driven workplace and have been at this job at a variety of levels over the last few years. I have been sure to negotiate for better pay/accommodation with each change as I saw fair and fit, and now I'm planning on asking for the largest increase with my most recent adjustment to my duties. My position has become an amalgam of sorts due to my capabilities and because of a management change that dramatically changed the workplace (for the better). Recently a co-worker of mine was going to quit but was coerced into staying with a Significant pay raise which I inadvertantly came across while working with some paperwork, and I now more than ever see the necessity in asking for this raise (less drastic increase in pay that my co-worker's, might I add).  

My question is:  What is my best approach in pursuing this raise, as I've never before asked for a raise without the timing directly coinciding with a job title change?",02Oct2019,1

My bloodline family is not the nicest to say the least and I never quite had a family of my own. My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and 4 months and I know by now I shouldn't be jelly but I seriously am.

She is 16 and German and my bf has a small thing for German girls.. I have little confident in myself and I love his family to death and I'm terrified because I don't want to be left out and I don't want to be forgotten about.

94,"Let me just put events that still bother me between her and I in order, sorry for the lack of coherency in this summary. On my eighth birthday, my mom divorced my dad and took me out of the house, where I couldn’t see my dad for three weeks. When she took me out of the house and to her mothers house, her soon to be husband was there that night; I suspect she cheated. Tensions built over the next ten years, where I felt angry for what she put my father through with the divorce and the aftermath of it, she took half his money and tarnished his reputation. My mom and dad butted heads on everything, usually because my mom was always late with payments or didn’t want to help with half of my expenses as a child. I found out rather close to college that she wasn’t going to split the cost of college with my dad, leaving my dad with all the payments. For some reason, this was the tipping point for me and I decided to go no contact with her. Later when I found out I needed surgery, she called me and made it all about her when I told her I needed surgery. Additionally, her side of the family either guilt trips me or gives me the silent treatment. I didn’t get a single card wishing me well after my surgery or for birthdays, etc. My need for advice is as follows. How do I deal with the thought that my mom just may not be a good parent?

*Somehow find a higher paying job, use that to continue to live on my own and take a few classes 

*Leave my apartment, live with a few roommates (which I really don't want to do), and take a few classes

*Continue what I'm doing, and try to do some design stuff on the side, hoping I can make a living off it soon.

99,"Hi guys,

I'm looking for some guidance on how to stop my black-and-white thinking. I want to stop overlooking important things. I can't really explain without exemplifying - so I hope that's okay.

Last night my boyfriend made a promise that he wouldn't sleep on the couch that night, and stay in bed with me throughout the night. We were play arguing earlier about going to bed, and I was pointing out that he's an insomniac and would be there in the couch later while I'd be sleeping, so I'm not going to bed so early - hence he made the promise to not do that.

Anyway, so I wake up and he's on the couch reading on his phone, but he did it because he couldn't sleep, and also to not bother/wake my sleep.

I got really hung up over the fact that he broke his promise and ignored everything else - that he couldn't sleep, and that he was looking out for me.

I want to learn how to not feel so indignant and wronged about the promise being broken, and look at the larger picture, and one that doesn't cause strife over something that didn't require it. I was reflecting and I think there's a pattern of me thinking super black and white and missing important aspects of things that should allow for a more colorful thought palette, that cause the same sort of strife in other personal relationships. Reflecting on it, I feel silly and petty and just want to be better than that.

101,"I'm (18M) a freshman in college; I graduated high school in May. I'm majoring in music education, and have been playing warmups/conducting for the various choirs at my old high school for some teaching experience. Everything was going great until about 2 weeks ago. 6 freshman/sophomore (14-15 years old) girls in just *one* of the choirs gave me their Snapchats on little notes in the span of a week. When I got them, I threw them away as soon as the girls left the room. Problem solved, right? Nope.

When I conduct, I like to make eye contact with the students (it helps). However, if I make eye contact with any of these girls, they do a little flirty wave or wink. It's really unsettling, as I obviously feel no attraction to any of them and I *really* don't feel like going to prison. When the class is over, they like to crowd around me, fighting to get my attention. I have to pretend to go to the bathroom just to get away from them until they go to their next class.

102,"So this is gonna be a semi long backstory/ rant. I don’t even know if this is the right community to post this to but whatever. So a couple of months ago (feels like forever ago) I got a second job at this place just for the summer. I needed extra money and this job is super close to my house (like 2 minutes). My cousin also works there and she recommended that I worked there since they hire pretty much anybody and the past is fairly good for a college student. So I applied, got the job, went through the training and started working there. Turns out there is a reason why this job has a high turnover. It’s absolutely TERRIBLE working there. Not only does the management suck, the training there is inconsistent so I had to wait a while to be trained for doing the job that I was already learning how to do by working even though I wasn’t ‘supposed to. Anyway, I was absolutely miserable and stressed there and was constantly getting yelled at customers which gave me terrible anxiety. The only ‘good’ part of the job was that i actually began talking to a guy , who worked in a different department, who I had a HUGE crush on. I was waiting for him to ask for my number or ask me out but he never did before I decided to quit and I never told him I was going to quit. I haven’t worked there in a month but I literally cannot stop thinking about him and kind of wish I didn’t quit even though I HATED working there. I’m debating on whether I should reapply for the job next summer but I feel it’s pathetic for me to go back to a job I hated just for a guy. On the other hand, I’m kind of mad at myself for quitting that job so impulsively  and not thinking it through before I quit. It was terrible but I feel like the constant stress and dealing with rude customers will help me with the career I want to pursue/ good life skills to know. I’m introverted and while I was working there I could feel myself getting more comfortable with confrontation and just dealing with angry people in generel. I was also starting to get used to it and I miss the paychecks and all the tips I got from that job lol What’s should I do? Am I pathetic?",02Oct2019,2

113,"Using a throwaway (because I don't want to be identified)

So I (20m) am living away from home in a sharehouse while I attend uni, and a couple months back a new housemate moved in. He seemed alright at first and I didn't really notice him because I don't really socialise much with the people I live with. 

However, recently I discovered that prior to moving in, he was convicted and jailed. I am unsure of how long he was in prison for or for what, but I do know that he had a conviction for drink driving so I assume its related to that.

Obviously, as someone who can afford to go to university, and whose family has never had any brushes with the law, I know I am coming from a position of somewhat privilege, but I can't help but feel uneasy around him after I discovered his conviction. As someone who's basically an adult, and as someone who tries to judge people on who they are currently, I feel frustrated that my discovery of this has significantly changed some of my behaviours. 

I now feel really uneasy if I am away from home and leave my room door unlocked, in the past it never registered whether i left my door unlocked or not. I have also felt paranoid that someone may have taken my car keys and used my car without my permission. Recently, he's been asking more and more to borrow food items from me, and while these were inconsequential items (an egg, some milk, etc.) I feel like I'm pressured into something because I feel mildly intimidated by him. 

Part of why I'm so uneasy is that while he does appear to be making an effort to be better (going to church, talking to counselors) I have also heard of things that have somewhat broken the implicit trust I have in people. For example, when I was away on vacation, my flatmate had warned me that she had caught him stealing another person's alcohol from the common fridge.

I feel like the troubles I am having living with this person is indicative of a larger problem, when I moved in, the landlord assured me that she only allowed students from the local university (my uni) to live, but lately it seems like she's letting just anyone in. Is this something I should bring up with her, or is this just something that I have to deal with as an adult. I also suffer with anxiety and depressive symtpoms, so I'm not sure if my own mental health issues are coloring my perceptions of this person and if I do end up complaining to my landlord about it, I would be unduly hurting someone who is trying to put his past behind him.",02Oct2019,1

As part of exercising what I’ve learned, I’ve been letting many unhealthy people in my life go. My actions have removed a lot of unnecessary drama from my life, but have also left me with some residual guilt.

One friend in particular I’ve let go this summer was very socially needy, verbally aggressive when angry, and tended to be “brutally honest” (AKA flat out rude to people close to her) to a fault. I often felt like she was using me and others to meet her social needs (and based on her social media posts, still is) and tends to pick fights with people who bring up their concerns rather than hearing them out.

However...she is still an immensely kind person at her best, and fiercely loyal. She was there for me in high school when I was in the closet and insecure about my faith. She has a lot of amazing qualities, and because of this I feel a lot of guilt for distancing myself from her. However, I don’t want to feel obliged to be her friend just because she’s an extreme extrovert who constantly needs to be around people to avoid being depressed.

Nobody focuses or has any respect for people that actually know what they’re doing and are everybody is just okay with sounding mediocre and unprofessional and it bothers me. Every week since our season has started I’ve considered quitting and it ruins my whole day thinking about the fact that I have to go to rehearsal. 

I haven’t quit because:
1) the director is my stepmother 
2) I plan on going to college as a music major, so it’ll look good on my college applications to have another music extracurricular
3) I’m afraid that if I quit a Capella, repercussions will also fall on me as a class officer in the choral program 

Recently it came up that there was a middle school concert on the same day as one of the a capella rehearsals (I student teach at the middle school in the morning), but my director isn’t letting me go because we’re a few weeks out from the high school choir concert despite me knowing all of my music very well and being strong on my part alone. These middle schoolers are so important to me and I don’t want to miss their first concert because I’m being forced to do something I hate doing, but I know that if I quit there’s no going back, so I’m kinda at a loss as to what to do.

I know somebody is gonna tell me to try to talk to my director/stepmom and tell her it’s important to me that I’m there for the concert, and I’ll tell you right now that won’t work. 

My intuition says that continuing to be in the group has more of a negative impact on me than it offers in potential positive gain, and so I should quit and use that time to do something that will make me happy. 

I know it’s a stupid thing to be asking about on the internet but this is the easiest way for me to get an unbiased opinion as soon as possible.",02Oct2019,1
131,"Okay, so back story... my partner is non-binary trans male. This has a lot of the mental play with his “ness”(if you will). Body image is a struggle and he is currently away getting top surgery to help make him feel more at home in his skin. We have only been together for a year and a half and have been cohabitating for  about 6 months.  We recently moved to NM to start fresh and I have my 3 kiddos from a previous marriage. 
Life has been a struggle since we’ve moved. Finances have been especially tight lately and now his top surgery will be putting us behind a little further. He feels like a burden. I’ve reassured him that he is far from a burden. He hates his new job as a security officer for a casino. He feels like he never does anything right. 
I am unsure how to help him processes and work through emotions or express them in anyway without causing an even larger fuss. It’s getting so bad that we are now fighting and arguing more and more. He’s super sensitive to everything. I feel like I can’t talk to him without hurting him more or upsetting him. 
The last two tiffs we got into resulted in punching a car door which bloodied his hands pretty badly. 
Last night was our last night together for a little while, and it ended with a panic attack, sketchy comments leaning towards suicide, and me yelling saying I’m calling your mother if you don’t quit. Which clearly didn’t go over well but the crying and pacing eventually stopped. I literally feel like I’m at my wits end. 
Therapy or the mention of it is a huge no no. I’m at a loss completely. Any advice on how to handle this is much appreciated. When the relationship is good it’s so good and when it’s bad it’s really bad. I’m tired of all of the ups and downs. I love him dearly and I’m trying to be patient but I don’t know how much more I can take. 

Please be kind this is my first post. And I’m open to any suggestions. I don’t know if this is just from everyday stresses that’s bringing this behavior or his “ness”. Let me know what you think.",02Oct2019,1

[tl;dr at the end.]

For context: on july 30th 2018 our second dog in ten years, Niki, died because of vet negligence. She was 4yo and was the love of our lives. My dad didn’t want a puppy (he had many dogs throughout his life) in the first place but he fell in love hard. When she passed, it was the first time i saw my dad cry. We are still,to this day, devastated. He said he didn’t want anymore dogs and we agreed.

A couple of months later, out of the blue he said he missed having a pupp to come home to (to this point we were very depressed and we hated coming to an empty apartment) he was very specific: same breed and the happiest “y vivo”*from the litter (*it would translate to the most alive). So my mom found him and we were happy again. The thing is my dad couldn’t move forward (still grieving) and from the first day he started comparing both niki and marty. They never bonded I believe. He isn’t the best trained pupper but he is ours and i love him to pieces. He is a freaking hurricane but he loves us and make our days better.

Today though, i came back from the movies all happy and dandy, marty was in the kitchen...I opened the door and he run towards my parents room. He jumped on the bed and my mother told me to get him out that my dad didn’t want to see him. I asked what happened and my dad said “I don’t want him here”. Mother was “your father is fed up take him away” i asked again what happened! Dad said “i don’t even wanna talk about it i don’t want him anymore” I asked if he was thinking of getting rid of him and he said yes with the most serious face. It fucking scared me and im 32.

Right then i turned around and took marty for a walk while i cried my eyes out on the verge of an anxiety attack. I don’t know what to do. I want to leave with him but I’m still living here because it is super expensive to move; i work with my family too...not great pay. I’m really lost. Like Niki, he is my buddy, my confidant my everything. I don’t even know what happened!!! 

Marty sleeps in their room...now he is crying because they wont let him in...what do i do?? it’s breaking my heart just the thought of giving him up.

Fyi my mother is a useless narcissistic who loves marty but apparently not enough to put her foot down. 

TL;DR: dad wants to kick out our puppy because of “something” he’s done and wont tell me what.",02Oct2019,7
134,"This is my first post so I'm sorry if this isn't what's expected, but  I'm desperate for some outside advice.  I watch a lot of R/Slash videos on YouTube which is how I learned about reddit hopefully I'll find some good advice.
ANYWAYS. To the story.
 I am an 18 year old female. I am in my second year of college. I have had a lot of troubles throughout the years was relationships. I have had a lot of abuse in my past. The abuse mainly  Pertains to my senior week.  I graduated high school your early so I was younger than the everyone that I was hanging out with . Of course I wanting to fit in and I wanted to you know look cool in not be left out so I drink excessively the 1st night and a guy that I kind in new took me into a bathroom and he took my virginity from me. This cause a string of anxiety and depression and I'm currently still struggling. This year I told my mother about it and it was very hard but I am gladly working through it with her support. This anxiety has traveled over to what I love most which is animals and the severity of it Kim be explained with one little story. I was at the doctors office looking at my MRI of me knee. (I completely tore my ACL and the meniscus on both sides of my knee so 3 tears total) So I was already kind of bummed out but we were working through it. I was in  My mom's big suburban and I saw a little Orange kitten running in the road and I yo trying to get my mom not to hit a and she tried but we did and I hyperventilate 8 I was screaming crying and when I talk about it I still tear up being cry and start getting this panicking feeling and ished something that is really hard for me to deal with.  This leads to my 1st question of advice on Maybe easing anxiety I haven't really gone in got it medically Diagnosed that I do have anxiety but I feel that it's pretty obvious that I do have some form of it.  My 2nd question pertained to a new relationship I'm in.  The guy I'm seeing is 23 but he does more for me then a lot of men in my life have he doesn't know about senior week completely but he does know about my love for animals which is something we share and he knows about some of the male figures in my life. He has been good to me and every way imaginable but hes also changed my views on everything. I was raised  Mainly by my mother who for a long time was a single mother and she always taught me that I needed to go to college because it was something she didn't have the chance to do and it would pay off and that it's something that I need to do to be successful sooner. But my boyfriend his kind of made it where this isn't the life I want that this is something my mom seems to want more than me I was gonna be  A veterinarian but I recently decided to change to zoology and animal behavior. I don't know if it's because how well he treat me in the fact that I know that he wants a family that I have baby fever so band but my 2nd question is would it be a mistake to go ahead and try for a baby. We both one is so badd and we both hate waiting for it and I'm honestly scared of what my family will think if I do try in succeed and I just don't want to be that disappointment 1st child that my mom tells my younger siblings not to be like.

135,"14 m.   I am good about not giving a shit for many things, but my weaknesses are my parents. I have trauma of me being asleep and my my bipolar dad being a complete asshole about me to my mom (saying I’m weak, a girl[which theirs nothing wrong with], and shit like that). In order to leave this stupid place with my mom I gotta do 2 semesters in one. Recently, my mom has been getting super pissed and that along with self-diagnosed anxiety disorder has been making me a lot darker than I used to be. 

Basically, when something that makes me sad happened I feel the call of the void and just start feeling depressed and lose all will to live. This has escalated to the point where I tried self harm. Scratching myself as hard as I could and sometimes bleeding. My humor has also become really dark the past few years. Imagine raccoon eggs but more suicidal. 

Idk who normal what I’m feeling is and how to help if it’s bad. My mom didn’t believe me when i told her about my anxiety (i occasionally start sweating and feel white hot) and my dad didn’t seem to care. Plz help ty",02Oct2019,2
136,"So I (M17) am about to turn 18 in a couple of days. Very excited but concerned somewhat about my relationship with my girlfriend (F16). She is turning 17 in December so by the end of the year I'll be 18 and she'll be 17. We have been dating for about a year now and do have sex ever here and there. But now that I'm pretty much 18 I'm concerned on if i will have to worry about legal troubles since I'm technically dating a minor even though there is little over bit over a year age gap.

138,"Okay so basically this happened about a week ago, but I’m still pretty hurt about it. So basically my best friend, wasn’t hanging out with me, wasn’t really talking to me, stuff like that. So I basically wrote him a letter (which was probably a bad idea but I didn’t think of it at the time) and I wasn’t aggressive at all, and I had said I missed him and take into account he’s been my best friend for a good 3 years, we told each other everything etc. but anyways, I wasn’t aggressive in the letter and he’s been pretty busy so I mentioned in the letter that I was totally okay with him being busy and I understood. So he took it with him to class, and I’m not sure exactly what happened, but somehow one of his other friends got ahold of the letter whether that be he gave it to her or she took it (I’m pretty sure he gave it to her because he could have easily gotten it back) but she read it out loud to a couple of their friends and he had said that it was my fault and he just wanted to hang out with his girlfriend (he didn’t even say a word to me about dating her) and I had felt like he wasn’t making time for me or anything. I had been trying to talk to him anyways like friends do, but I never really talked to him for more than a couple minutes at a time. So after he got the letter, he texted me with a gamepigeon message (funny right lol). So I blocked him and he hasn’t reached out to me once. Before any of this happened, I had kinda felt like whenever I was feeling that something wasn’t right and I talked to him about it, he always dismissed it or low key said it was my fault, but I guess at the time I didn’t notice.

141,"this is probably going to be a long one. sorry reddit lol. but let’s call my ex J.

J and i were together off and on for a year. but i had feelings for him since i was barely 15 (i met him at my job, he trained me and we had a connection and we started talking more, etc). for a little bit he kinda strung me along. we’d start talking, flirting, hanging out and all that, but then he’d ghost.

that went on for about 5 months.

then not long after that, we started hooking up. i’d always tell J that i wanted to be more than just his toy, he’d get mad at me. he said things like “you think i’m that type of person huh?” “you think i’m just a fuckboy who uses girls for sex?” and i’d apologize. after a bit of hooking up, i ended things. then i went right back and said i wanted things to be different. well we kept hooking up. nothing changed. i asked if he even liked me, he said he “wasn’t sure how he felt”. so i ended things again. of course i obviously went back. he never told anyone about me. not a single person. i ended up telling J’s best friend (C) because he was one of my best friends too and he was completely shocked because J told C while back that he thought of me like a sister. 

one of the times when things ended, it was because he lied about his sexual past and tried hooking up with his ex behind my back. i wish i would have fucking left then.

the on and off again hooking up went on for about 6 months.

but the last time i went back, things started to get a lot better. he told people about me. he said he loved me. he said he was sorry for everything he put me through. introduced me to his family. took me to prom. everything he did just felt like it had more meaning to it yaknow? he just felt like a completely different person who wouldn’t hurt a damn fly. so we started officially dating.

a bit goes by, we’re really happy. falling asleep on the phone every night. never going to bed mad at each other. sneaking to his house when his parents aren’t home. he was moving 2 hours away but J was so confident we could get through it, i mean he’d only wanted to be there for a year. so when he moved there i went to visit often. spend a few days here and there. 

one of the nights i went over there, we were having sex. we were in a position neither of us really liked and tbh i kinda wanted to just stop and go to bed because by this time it was late. probably 2 or 3 AM. so J kept trying to change positions so i suggested that we should just stop for the night, and he literally just says “no” and INSISTS we keep going. i had to say no definitely over 5 times and he kept trying to pull me back to him when i was trying to pull away. finally he stopped, but i had to say “no” and flinch away way more than i should have had to. sometimes when we fought he’d really scare me. he’s never hit me, but he’d hit things. it only happened a few times but i got so scared when he did that. 

another thing that really upset me was that he’d kind of just leave me on his bed while he played games. i’m not gonna get mad at him for just playing games. but like when i went over for about 2 days we had a few plans. go to the park, the museum, shopping etc. none of it happened, but i feel like it would’ve if he wasn’t on his playstation almost the entire time. i just wanted to spend time with him while i was there. he told me “we’re still spending time together because we’re in the same room.” and then said “maybe i’m hinting that i want you to play too.” which really pissed me off because if he wanted to play a game or two with me, why hint at it? why not just ask me to play a game or two with you??

after i confronted J with this, for some reason, he got so so mad. (we were texting, i confronted him after i had left.) we didn’t text for about a day after he got really mad over it. he then texted me the day after that and said he wasn’t sure if he loved me or wanted to be with me anymore.

i don’t know why, but i begged. i begged someone who wasn’t sure if they loved me, to love me. i feel pathetic for doing that. after a bit of distance we got back together but that was literally for a week.

and at the end of that week, before things officially ended, J’s ex gf contacts me. she says that he forced her to do things when they were together. she sent me a really long message about how she doesn’t want to talk about it anymore, but she knows that one day i’ll wake up and realize how bad he really is. after processing all this, i ask J about it, wondering what he’d say. obviously he wouldn’t admit to it, i knew that. he says she’s lying. but she told me before about how he lied about his past and she was right. she told me before he was trying to get with her behind my back and she was right. why would she lie about this?

not long after figuring this out, J says once again, he’s not sure what he wants. i knew this would just be a cycle again. so i said ok, it’s done this time. i couldn’t do it anymore, i couldn’t move on in the future after all he’s put me through even if he did change.

it’s been a week since we broke up and i just feel nothing but disgusted with myself. like it’s my fault for the pain i’m feeling. he was so manipulative, i cant put it into words. he really made me feel like he was all i had. we were going to move in together next year. i realize that it’s a good thing that it’s over, mostly because i would have done anything for him. i was going to move 2 hours away with only him and nobody else that i knew other than him. i realized once we broke up that i really would have been stuck.

i feel so goddamn lost. i know i’m only 17 and that i have so much ahead of me but i just invested a lot of time into someone who wasted so much. someone who could do such horrible things and feel no remorse. i feel angry at myself just for typing this out. i’m embarrassed. i hate myself so damn much for what i put myself through. i don’t know what the first step is in trying to move on.",02Oct2019,1

144,"My friends and I are worried about our friend, who we think is addicted to a video game.
He plays pretty much nonstop, and has gotten ridiculously good at it, which pushes him to play more.

This is causing real issues in his life though. His sleep schedule has become horrendous. He comes home from school, takes a nap until around 8, and then plays well into the early morning, before sleeping for a few more minutes and then waking up for school. 

His grades are not as good as they once were. In the past, we remember him being very dedicated to school work, but he now finds himself failing classes.

Most importantly of all, his mental health is truly poor. He gets furious at the game, and gets sent into fits of rage where he destroys controllers, objects around him, and hurts himself in the process. He recently punched straight through his wall, leaving him with a fractured hand. He gets annoyed at people in school, and isn’t a stranger to saying things that he later regrets. 

I don’t want to see him continue down this path. He’s a very talented musician, and he wants to go to college for it. I’m worried that he will lose sight of his passion and his life will change drastically for the worse. As high school juniors, this is a critical time for our lives. Decisions he makes now will impact his entire existence.

My friends and I want to help him, but we don’t know how. We first have to get him to understand that he has a problem. We don’t know how to do that, but it’s just the first step. I’d love for him to see a therapist, as I think it would greatly benefit him. He has other emotional hardships in his life, and it would help him a lot. However, therapy is expensive, and he wouldn’t be able to afford it. I doubt it would be covered by insurance, but I don’t know that for sure. 

What can we do to help him?",02Oct2019,1
145,"
I have an incredible amount of guilt about how expensive my school is. My parents have already put $125,000 towards my degree, and I have about $15,000 in student loans.Now, as a junior, im considering dropping out, and that just increases my guilt tenfold. 

To be perfectly honest, I have thought about dropping out or taking a leave since freshman year. My mother at least, was supportive of the leave (but she’s not the one that pays.) 

I was immensely pressured to go into a stem field and even leaving that was incredibly difficult for me to do. Dropping out - going against everything anyone has ever told me my future would be - seems damn near impossible.
I go to a very good school. And I don’t take that for granted - I know I am being presented with incredible opportunities that I would feel like an idiot for missing out on. But im just not sure what to do anymore. I’ve always been a good student. Enrichment classes in elementary school, advanced placements in middle school, AP classes in high school. But now I am just so burnt out I don’t even know what to do with myself. I think that most of what got me to go to school and stay in school and learn is not actually because I am interested or want to - its because it is what everyone expects me to do. I’m so afraid I settled for a major because I knew I was running out of time, and that I have simply set myself up to do something that I hate for the rest of my life. 

I have no motivation left. I have been sending in incomplete, half-assed homework (if I do it), and I have not been going to class. I can only focus long enough or get myself motivated enough to study for exams for an hour. Even my social life has been suffering - I find my friends incredibly annoying.

 I’ve always preached do what makes you happy - but how can I do what makes me happy if I have no idea what it is? 
I dont even know what I would do if I were not in school. Theres always been such a clear picture: you graduate high school, go to college, get a job. I drop out, then what? 

I’m supposed to study abroad this spring. I’ve already paid my deposit and sent in my visa application. To be honest, that’s the only thing i’m looking forward to in my life. But it feels stupid, to stay in school just to spend tons of money to study abroad. I could travel on my own for significantly less. 

I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’m so lost and so unhappy. Even my friends are tired of hearing me constantly question my future and won’t listen to me talk about it anymore.

TL:DR - im already $125,000 + in the hole and am considering dropping out",02Oct2019,2
146,"So let me start by saying , I moved here in July to my brothers house with my GF of 4 1/2 years . Now we’ve been living together since our 1 1/2 anniversary. We moved because our living situation at point A was unhealthy , so we moved to point B because it was more stable , and controlled environment. Now me &amp; my gf are 20. Since we moved here we both got our drivers license, both got jobs and working responsibly , and got ourselves our own car. Now my brother &amp; his wife (who were living with ) told us 2 weeks ago that they wanted us to look at our own places to live . So they wanted us to save $1500 by Nov 1st. When they know I have a car payment due on Oct 13th of $350, then 3 days after that on Oct 18th, I have my car insurance of $115. I work a job (as a server) making maybe $200-$250 a week. Now my gf (who works an hourly job) doesn’t get paid until after that. Anyways , there have been some issues around the house between my gf and my brothers wife. My brothers wife doesn’t know how to control her temper , and she doesn’t have the best way of putting words together to get her point across. Instead she comes across rude most of the times , and it drives me and my gf nuts. So today my gf wanted to do laundry but they had towels and a bed sheet. So my brothers wife told her “it can wait till we get off work” which is about 6-8 hours later . Anyways my gf responds with “I can fold the towels up for you and fold the bed sheet and leave it all on the dryer. But she insists on it waiting till she gets home (she doesn’t like anybody touching her stuff , but she doesn’t have a problem with moving our stuff out of the washer or dryer (if she asks of course). So my gf responded with “K” because she thought it was unnecessary how she responded to something so nice. Anyways my brothers wife sends her a whole text saying how I’ve been doing amazing , but all my gf does is slack off &amp; and do nothing . Which she cleans the house, cleans the poop, pee, washes dishes , vacuums , dusts, I mean the whole 9 yards. So when my brother &amp; his wife got home they wanted to talk, but my gf who doesn’t handle conflict that well says (she doesn’t feel good). So I get on to her because I think it’s ridiculous she can’t just talk to them like adults , but instead hiding away in the bathroom. So they leave to go to the grocery store &amp; and I leave to go get cigarettes. I ask her if she wants to come with &amp; says no. Then when I get back , she’s nowhere to be found , my brother calls me up saying the neighbor called him and said she left the house and went walking . (I asked her when I left the gas station if she was walking , cause it sounded like she was, and she told me no) . So i get back in my car and drive around looking for her. Finally I found her , she was getting inside an Uber that her mom had called her. She wouldn’t tell me where she was going , blocked me, my brother &amp; his wife . Won’t speak to me &amp; the mom won’t tell me anything besides she’s safe . If you’ve read this then thank you , but I’m just so hurt , and confused , and I’ve been crying trying to figure out what to do. She’s at her uncles , but I’m not totally sure because all the mom said when I asked her if she was staying somewhere where she could sleep , and if she didn’t I’d help her get a hotel if she absolutely didn’t want to come home, is (I have a brother nearby) so I assume she’s with family , but reddit please I’m asking ....What do I do in this situation? I’m losing my mind, and I feel so hopeless , because we’ve been perfectly fine in our relationship but for some reason she won’t speak to me. I’m concerned about her but idk to do to make this feeling go away........


TL/DR:
My gf and I moved in with my brother , she had conflict with his wife , but she didn’t want to talk about when they got home, I argued with my gf and she left in an Uber to her uncles &amp; blocked all of us and didn’t tell us .",02Oct2019,1
147," 

So I have been very go with the flow for my whole life. I just sort of let things happen to me because I used to figure what is going to happen will happen whether I want them to or not. That way of thinking has a very religious backing. And because this way of thinking kinda sucks, I really need to get out of it.

I graduate from college in about 3 semesters, so December of 2020 or Spring of 2021. Yes I did go to college. I am getting a degree in Psychology because the classes are cool and a minor in professional writing because writing is the only thing I actually like lmao

The issue comes in when I think about how in like a year and a half I’m going to have to be doing something with my life. As of yet I can barely even get a proper job by myself. (See I’ve mostly worked under the table and through the school throughout college, so that’s the entirety of my work experience. No retail or fast food to speak of. 

As for internships I have been trying to get internships over the past couple of summers and they have yet to work out. I imagine I only have to try harder. But I also imagine without that internship experience no one will want to hire me straight out of college. 

I have to think of my options now. What can I realistically do with a bachelors in psychology with the experience I have? I’ve thought of a few things, but I can’t be sure they are realistic, or if I might have more options.

* I could join the Peace Corp for a while. It is something I never really considered but for a large part of college I was really into helping people. That is why I got into the psychology field in the first place. I just enjoy being able to contribute something meaningful to the world. I gotta be honest though this didn’t even cross my mind until today when my professor told us about her experiences there. It reminded me of the softer part of myself that I had pretty much buried since I fell into a state of depression.
* I could pursue writing full time. But what good is that? I definitely want to be able to achieve that in the long run but as of now I don’t really have anything to write about. The best I could do right away is a blog and I’m too nervous to even set one up now. It would without a doubt get abandoned soon after since I don;t really have any content to publish.
* I could look for an internship around where I live but I really don’t want to stay here. I think I would be miserable in my home town long term. I knew that when I graduated high school actually so I moved out of state. I had a breakdown and had to come home. I have been here since and I’ve been quite not the same since. I’m afraid to move out again but also I feel that I have to.
* I could look for a place to intern elsewhere. Somewhere far away. That would include finding a place to live. And the internship may not even give me enough living expenses to keep myself afloat. I’ve never dealt with that before. The only places I have ever lived was in a college dorm and at home. 
* I could go to grad school. That would also require arranging living conditions which I probably wouldn’t have the means for. Furthering my degree would be a good idea, but I almost feel like I should wait a little bit before taking this route. A year or more.
* I could get a job at a college.Ideally this would pay for grad school.I know I can get into the admissions office with a bachelors, and that would be a stable job for a while. And if they let me take classes to get a masters degree that is even better.

I think that is about all of the options I have. I’m not the kind of person that can charm my way into any position, but that’s probably obvious. In fact the breakdown I mentioned earlier pretty much broke my personality and desire for human contact so I haven’t exactly had friends in over a year. That doesn’t help in the bleak outlook of my future. Thanks in advance for any advice you may offer. It was nice to write this out at least and realize I probably need therapy.",02Oct2019,1

152,"At the beginning of the semester (late August) there was a party in which I saw a guy I know kissing a girl I know. We'll call him M. Both of these people are in my same major and our major is very collaboration oriented, so I have worked with both of them before on several occasions. 

Normally, I wouldn't think anything of this kissing situation, but this time around I suddenly got that hot, fluttery, all-too-familiar jealousy. I hadn't ever felt feelings, really, for M before, but I guess seeing him kiss someone else made them bubble up. A few weeks later, with the consent and advice of my friends, I stepped WAY out of my comfort zone (I am VERY shy and insecure) and basically asked M on a date over text. After a few days, he finally responded, saying yes, he would go on a date with me, but he is absolutely booked until, well, basically this week. 

Yesterday I texted him again asking about his availability, and he said he was busy with midterms this week, but is available next week. Then he informed me that he is ""kind of talking to someone right now"" and that he just wanted to be straightforward with me. 

Of course, this was appreciated, but when I asked my friends what to do, they were just like ""yikes....."" and didn't elaborate? 

Today I saw him at school and one of his friends (of course) called me over and talked to me for a bit and he basically just turned his back on me and played on his phone while I talked to his friends. I think he's just very awkward and didn't know what to do, particularly since I haven't responded yet...

anyway, what do I do? I don't even know what like ""level"" of ""talking to"" he and this girl are at.... He is also a very kind and considerate person, so I am wondering if he is just saying that even if he's had two conversations with her.... and I am not sure if this is a rejection....

157,"So, she is about a year from 30 years old. She has been working on her GED (passed 2 so far, 3 left to go. The 2 took her nearly a year). No job. Her goal is to become a nurse. So after GED, she will go to community college then transfer to a university. For nursing school, it's either during 2 year college or the school she transfers to. She currently lives under a friend's roof for free and uses food stamps. And she says she is a slow learned, and I think that might be the case. I am the only one working.

Here is where the problem lies...she wants to start modeling, drawing (on one of those electronic pads) and DJing because they all seem very fun to her. However, I know that to be a nurse...it is hard and time-consuming enough...is it a good idea for her to take on those hobbies above? I heard DJing is not the easiest hobby too. And she does plan to eventually make money from modeling/DJing, etc. I am just worried that she isn't thinking about being practical enough. Nothing to build on her resume yet, still in high school education given her age, etc. She also wants an expensive cosmetic surgery (around 8 to 9k). She has about 20k saved up from working under the table when she was young.

159,"Before I say anything, I think it's important to note that I haven't been diagnosed with depression or any mental illness, but I know something is wrong. 

For the past few months I've been getting stretches of really good days, confidence and happiness, and then a week after I feel like death itself. I usually come home from school after pretending to not be miserable and sit silently in the living room (being around people is better than isolating myself) and I usually end up crying a huge amount. When anyone asks me what's wrong, all I can say is ""I don't know, I'm sad."" I have thoughts about how no one will miss me if I disappeared, how I'm worthless, etc etc etc (after this I always come to my senses and feel horrible about worrying people) It's come to the point where whenever I have a good day, I know that in a few weeks, I'll be punished for it. 

Here's where my mom comes in. I know I have an issue, but at the moment we can't afford therapy. So today, my mom is taking me home, she's in a bad mood and starts lecturing me on how I don't appreciate her and all she does. She always seems to bring up that she's a single mother and says things like ""your dad would never take you places like me."" 

I usually just ignore her when this happens, but I tell her I'm having a ""depressed day"" (which usually means she will lay off) but she keeps going, telling me ""we all get sad."" I just start to cry right there and when we get home, I lock myself in my room. 

It's important to note that I love my mom. She is one of my idols and I think she's really cool, but when she gets in these moods I can't stand it. 

Practically two seconds later she asks what's wrong, suddenly concerned (even after I told her I was sad) and I tell her that she really hurt my feelings when she didn't listen to me in the car. She says sorry. 

I come out about twenty minutes later and the first thing she says to me is ""are you suicidal?"" I say no. She then suggests exercise, which I can't explain to her how wrong that is, then she tells me that ""other people have it worse."" I came out to be around people because it helps, but I couldn't deal with her. I just go back in my room. I feel belittled and pathetic. It breaks my heart that she's trying to help, knowing these things won't fix me. I just can't get her to understand and I don't know what to do. 

TL;DR I have stretches of time where I'm depressed. After school, my mom is lecturing me and I tell her I'm sad and having a depressed day. She keeps going. After she apologizes when we're home, she suggests that exercise will fix me and tells me other people have it worse. She has the best intentions and I don't know what to tell her or do.",02Oct2019,2
160,"I texted the national human trafficking hotline last week and they were slightly responsive at first, but I after sent a long message, I didn’t get an answer. For context, this is the text I sent them:

“I'm not sure if I'm overreacting. The house next door to me looks abandoned at first. The paint is peeling and the yard is completely overgrown. It looks like no one could possibly live inside there. I moved in last year and shortly learned that an man lives there who appears to be in his 60's. He is always alone and doesn't seem to have a family. He has a large 15 foot truck, which does not have a city parking permit to park on the street here (but he does anyways). He also has a white van in his driveway.

I can see through their upstairs window from my porch. The light has never been turned on. I can only see silhouettes of furniture piled up in a room. Looks abandoned. One day last fall, I was sitting on my porch outside and saw a girl (who appeared to be 14-17 years old) walked by the window. I had never seen a person inside that house, so I was extremely startled.

Since then, I have been suspicious and always kept an eye on him, silently. He seems dangerous so I don’t want him to know I’m suspicious, so I just keep an eye out for things, every time I'm outside the house. 

I have seen random things on different occasions. Once I noticed him walking a young girl and a man in a brown uniform to his truck. Another time I was standing on the sidewalk and watched a woman, who appeared to be on drugs or insane, climb over his fence into the house. I’ve seen him leading ONLY FEMALES to and from his large truck. I saw him walk a girl into his truck just a few days ago. Today, I saw a random man enter his house. Every single person I have ever seen walk into/out of his house or communicating with him is different! All of these weird incidences have been people i’ve never seen before. 

I really feel like something is not right here. I live in a city that has the highest rates of human trafficking in my state. There’s also a large port in this city. There have been stories on my college campus of people luring girls into human trafficking as a bible study group called “God the Mother.” I’ve seen this man with ONLY: older men, women who appear to be on drugs, and younger females) ages 15-30). 

I would contact law enforcement but I don't know if they will take me seriously.”

I sent that text to the hotline last week and didn’t receive an answer. This morning, I passed him as I was heading to class. He was walking a girl who appeared to be in her 20’s from his abandoned-like house into his truck, carrying a large box. They never spoke and I watched her get into his truck as I walked away. 

Reddit, what would you do? Am I overreacting? Do I go to the police immediately? My landlord? I’ve never been in a situation like this before to know what to do, and I need to be cautious given that he lives next door to me.",02Oct2019,6
161,"I can't stop worrying about everything. Right now, I am getting jittery. My pulse rate is up and feel my heart would sprung out my chest.

The reason was I closed the lid of the air-conditioning unit facing me and a guy from the building maintanance saw me and told me to stop. He turned the temperature up and begged me to not do that again. Well he's right. I am killing the machine. 

I can't stop thinking what will happen now. Last time I tried to turn the temperature 1 degree higher because it was freezing on my workstation, the whole office made a fuzz about it. I had to take a leave just to get myself out of the situation where everyone is complaining and cursing whoever turned up the temperature. 

Our office have central air, but its distributed unevenly. One side is directed towards me. No one else is in my side of the unit so I can just close the lid to prevent the freezing air from directly hitting my head. But even when its closed, it was insufficient so I had to wear layers. While the other side of the room are fanning them selves because it was too hot on their side. Well anyway, I won't give much more details.

If you notice my predicament, I'm actually getting worried about small things I'm not even supposed to pay attention too right? Who cares if the rest of those guys feel hot. I did not turn the heat up this time. But I still feel so guilty. If I try to turn down the temperature and close the lid of the aircon again I would be basically killing the machine. Also I could get reported in the building admin for destruction of office property. 

The current temperature, although still cold, I can tolerate. But the other guys will be getting hot soon. I can't stop worrying about the consequences and how will they react. This time around I came clean and told them everything. Now their curses will be directed on me instead. 

Ahhhhhhh.......................

What's more troubling is that I can't stop hating myself for worrying. I hate myself. Why can't I stop worrying about trivial things, to the extent that I spend the last hour typing this post instead of doing something more productive. I'm so stupid, it hurts.

I haven't felt safe at my house since the age of 19. I am now 22 and the feeling has gotten worse. Their toxicity has gotten to my brother, and now he's starting to bully and verbally abuse me too just because my parents do it. He's turned into a selfish spoiled jackass who does nothing but says negative things about people. Especially me. It's gotten to the point where I truly hate him and the person he's become: our mother. She has the exact same personality and sadly transferred it to him. 

My mom verbally abuses and yells at me everyday. I feel like more of a slave than her daughter. As a kid I was jealous because we never had a mother daughter relationship. It was more like I was her prisoner and she was the warden. Sometimes I wonder if she even truly wanted me. 

My father is also verbally abusive and manipulative with a temper. He is also mostly absent from our lives even though we all live together. He's obsessed with money and harasses me about it at least twice a week; Even going so far as stealing all the money from my savings account way back when I first started college(worst of all I just failed out if college and my parents will freak out when I tell them, I'm afraid because the abuse will get worse.)

I'm in school to learn Japanese. There's this guy in my class who is built, has a nicer looking face, has tattoos and every single one of the girls in my class look at him flirtatiously all the time. Even the teacher. I thought I could keep it to myself that I play guitar really well, but after a few months I found out that he also plays guitar and probably better.

I feel genetically inferior and basically useless as a person. Everything I care about is being done better by someone else who I just plain don't like.

Now I think she’s very attractive and a very nice person. We’re both super awkward, and some of our hookups have also been awkward (as one may expect). But this past weekend, I was with her every night. Not hooking up, but just hanging out together with the exception of one night. This night we hooked up for a decent amount of time. Now, I’m a generally nice person with no people I hate/dislike and, I guess, I’m what one could call a “beta male.” I’m not very dominant in this setting, and especially in today’s social climate, I’m afraid of doing something wrong and being held responsible for that action. But the next night, when I was with her and her friends, everyone was making jokes about her wanting me to choke her while hooking up. And this morning, I found out that after we hooked up this weekend, she said she was turned off because I wasn’t “rough enough.” Consequently, I got kind of upset, and things were awkward the next night. I mean, she didn’t say anything before or during the actual hook up then complained about it after it happened. If she said something, I would have done what she asked. And today, we mutually decided that whatever we had was finished. Now here’s where my dilemma comes in. In today’s “hook up culture,” people my age simply hook up with one another then completely forget about it. But it’s different for me.

I actually thought about leaving my bf to be with this other person, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it because the other guy wasn’t “ideal”. The other guy had just gotten back into college after flunking out, struggled maintaining a part time job, and relied on his mom to continue to support him. My bf was the exact opposite of this, which is what made me stay with my bf because I realized that I only had passion/lust with the other guy.

So,  I actually took a week break from my bf to try to think things through. But in retrospect, I was just drawn to the stability and security that he represented. Anyway, I stopped the cheating but my bf found out. I was devastated because it hurt me so much to know that I hurt him. I begged my bf to take me back. 

We’ve been working on our relationship since, and I do love my bf and enjoy being with them. But I find myself thinking about what if I ended things between us and I went with guy I was sleeping with and just think about all of these “what if’s”. 

I’ve grown attached to the security I feel with my bf (financial, emotional, etc) but I just don’t think I feel as connected as before? I just don’t feel the passion i did. I feel like I’m so attached because of what he represents (stability, security). 

Now before you say, “just end it” - we live together. And I’ve talked about us having a future together, but just I don’t know. And I miss him when he’s not around, but I don’t know. 

I just woke up and realized that I think that I’m in love with the idea of my bf and what he represents rather than him. 

So I’m tempted to end things but also terrified because I don’t know how sure I am about ending things since I’m scared to be single and the fact that we live together makes things messy.",02Oct2019,1
182,My boss pressured me (and by pressuring I mean he sent me a bunch of messages and would tell me everyday at work that I needed to quit my other job if I wanted the amount he was offering for a promotion). Even though I really liked my other job I needed the extra cash and finally put in my 2 weeks. 3 days after my last day at the job my boss texted me and said he can’t afford to pay me anymore. He offered to pay me until I found another job but him and his assistant have been trying to bully me out so he doesn’t have to. I need the money so I’ve kept my head down and continued working. He usually pays me at the end of the month but he still hasn’t paid me. I’m late on rent and I’m too scared to confront him because I’m afraid he’ll say something mean again.

187,"So in my algebra class this dude sits next to me pretty much every day, he seems a bit off (he'll mumble to himself a lot and answer rhetorical questions the professor asks the class and has hentai drawings in his binder that he'll just randomly look at) and I made small talk a little bit not thinking much about it.

 We had an exam last Thursday and today we got them back graded. After class our professor asked us both to stay after class and told us to take our tests out. Our scores were the same and most things were exactly alike, including the placement of where we wrote our work but the thing that stood out most was that for the last question we both answered it exactly the same in a way that it wasn't possible to be a coincidence. I pointed out that he was on the right side of me while we took the test so he wouldn't be able to see the left side of my paper and it would be less of an exact copy on the left side (and vice versa for the right side of his paper) which ended up being true.

So basically we're not allowed to sit next to each other and can't sit next to anyone during exams, I don't want to have to find a new spot and potentially take other people's regular seats but at the same time if I sit in my regular seat and he tries to sit next to me I don't want to be the bitch that tells a kid who obviously has a disability ""you can't sit with me go away"" in front of the entire class, how do I tell this kid to fuck off without coming off as a complete piece of shit?",02Oct2019,1
188,"Hello, I was born in Germany and I lived a while in Brazil, I grew up speaking German and Portuguese, I had no problem talking to people in any of those languages. I have relatives from South America and Europe, so I grew up with a huge ""cultural mix"". When I moved to the U.S. I knew only a couple of phrases in English, it was very limited. I went to 8th grade after a month I had arrived, I couldn't talk to anyone, I couldn't understand anything my teachers were saying, and I couldn't make friends. The first month was the worst thing, I was always alone during lunch, I missed the feeling of having someone to talk. In Brazil, I was that guy who used to sit on the front of the class, answer the teacher's questions, and ""improve"" the class in some way, like bringing new topics or making analogies with a topic that we were studying.

 When someone tried to talk to me, they would give up quickly, I couldn't maintain a conversation for more than 10 seconds. Then I went to High School, I was pretty much ""fluent"" at that point, but I was still afraid of talking to people, I thought that I had a terrible accent and people wouldn't understand me. I had some friends in my Freshman year, most of them were foreigners as well, they were from Japan, China, France, Colombia, and Brazil. I had an easier time talking to them, because they had passed through the same thing, but I knew that I was creating a ""bubble"". I refuted to talk to Americans/people that had English as first language. Even though I was the guy who answered the teacher's questions, I was a shy kid throughout my entire life, I was afraid of failing in anything. When I was 7 years old my father passed away and it messed me a lot. Also, I had suffered bully in Brazil, because of the fact that I was born in Germany, people called me ""Nazi"" every single day through 2nd grade until 6th grade. 

 So, to wrap it up, I want to be able to communicate, I want to get to know people, I want to know what do they like to do, what are their favourite books, what are their favourites D A N K M E M E S, and who they are in general. I'm currently a Sophomore in High school, so I think that I have time to change.

191,"I go to school in Ontario, Canada and in my program during our third year we have a class that is based on experiential learning in the form of an advertising agency. We are given a client and we then have to work with the client to solve whatever issue they have related to their business. The class is split into two ""agencies"" and from there several smaller teams are made within that agency and everyone on the teams are given a role such as, project manager, account manager, copy written and art director. Before groups were made I informed my professors of a few people I could not work with as I have had bad experiences with them in the past, for privacy their names will be Heather and Sally. To my surprise Heather and Sally were both in my group. Sally I don’t have a huge issue with I just didn't enjoy working with them last year, Heather on the other hand is a nightmare. I have never met anyone more incompetent than this person. Lucky for me Heather was my project manager which meant she was in-charge  of making sure everything was to go smoothly, that meant scheduling meetings with faculty (my profs) and the client, and creating deadlines for us to follow. Heather was horrible at all of this. Not only did she miss our first meeting with faculty but she also showed up incredibly late to our first meeting with the client. Along with that she scheduled a meeting with the client to present work that hasn't yet been approved by faculty (presenting unapproved work is grounds for ""dismissal"" or an automatic failure of the class) and was forced to cancel it because of this oversight costing us 20%. it got to a point where it was so bad that my entire group was fed up with her behaviour that a heated conversation with her broke out in the group chat. Prior to this we had 2 others with her and informed faculty who basically said it's not their problem. Now during this time I too wasn't a star student I along with another group member both showed the client rough work before it was approved and I was 15 minutes late to a meeting but, I was the only one in my group who consistently did work each week to present to the professors for approval. One of my members, the one who showed rough work with me, flat out told my professors that they didn't do any work for two weeks! Now Heather is incredibly mad at me for reprimanding her, so mad that she decided to tell faculty that I showed unapproved work and was 15 minutes late to a client meeting, omitting the fact that she basically missed a whole client meeting and my other group member also showed rough work and didn't do any work for 2 weeks. As a result, I was ejected from the team and my fate in this class is currently on the rocks. All of my group member have agreed that my ejection was unnecessary and that Heather should have been the one ejected. From my point of view I feel extremely targeted by Heather and faculty. They said that I wasn't pulling my weight when in reality I was pulling the weight of two other people. I wanted to know my rights as a student who's paying for an education. I did do something that was against the rules but is it enough to justify failing me 4 weeks into the class? Especially when someone else did the same thing, faculty is also aware of them having done the same thing, yet I was the only one thrown under the bus. I have compiled a  list of things Heather has done that violates agency rules and I must say her whoas greatly outweigh my own. To reiterate my questions, can I be failed for the reason of showing unapproved work to a client? When I'm paying for this education can I be failed for any reason? Is there a set of rules and standards that protect student rights?  In addition, after my meeting with faculty they basically tried to censor me by saying I can go home because they don’t want me speaking to other members negatively about the agency. I fell like that and this who situation is unethical and in a way a form of targeting. Especially when I'm the only one getting punished for things that other people have also done.",02Oct2019,1
192,"I guess I can just jump straight into it. I was born in a different country where my imidiate familly still lives. Over the past year there has been much unrest and many protests because of the corruption in the haitian government. I, living in the US did not realize the gravity of the situation.
 I facetimed my familly today and they had to stop speaking and turn off the lights because violent mobs are running around the city beating on people's gates with machetes and guns. They also revealed to me that there is no food or water available due to gasoline shortages. They also cannot travel safely during the day ( we have atypical features and skin color where we are from) because other people rough them up for money. They dont sleep for days at a time because of the mobs.  I am afraid for their lives literally every day, and there is nothing I can do about it. 
Last and least, is that I am facing having to return there due to American imigration policy. I have been afraid of making commitments, even short term because of this abstract looming "" end date""  to my life. 

I feel so afraid and at the same time so ashamed of the things I take for granted here( water, food, electeicity, being able to walk across the street safely, or sleep). I can't feel happy without remembering that my familly is so far away and in constant danger - it just feels wrong.  I feel helpless to help my familly and my country. In the short run, I have no franchise in the US because I am an imigrant, nor in my country because the government is a front. I can't send my familly sustenance, nor can they buy anything with any money I send them because tbere isn't anything anywhere. 
Anyway,

I know it's pointless to worry about something out of my hands, but I really cant help it. I'm frustrated, I feel helpless, and it is eating at me.
 Should I email or call a US lawmaker ? Can I even do that since Im not a citizen. I dont even know what to do for my familly.

194,"So in high school, I never viewed chemistry, or anything STEM related for that matter, as something that I was capable of doing. To me, subjects like calculus and chemistry and physics and biology- those were all subject mean for the people that were in the STEM program- people like my friends that were valedictorian and salutatorian of our class, that could never be me.
However, I was really involved with the forensics event with my high school science olympiad team, and I absolutely feel in love with the “work” that I was doing in that event. That lead to me taking the forensics class that my high school offered, and I can remember sitting in that class, nodding, going “ok...I think I can do this.” 
So my senior year of high school I decided that I wanted to go into forensic chemistry, and that meant majoring in chemistry. Even though I knew that this was going to be hard, I was ok with the thought and was determined to give it everything I had.

Coming into college, I was terrified for my first set of chemistry classes, so when I had professors that were super friendly and open to questions, I can’t tell you how relieved/grateful I was. That being said, I really look up to all of my professors, and I greatly value their opinions and any chance I get to work with them. So I guess in a sense, I desperately hope that they believe in me as much as I hope to believe in myself.
On top of this, I hear professors and especially other students talk about research and the projects they want to work on and how they want to go to graduate school, and to be honest, that all kind of scares me. Graduate school sounds more cut throat (and I could be wrong), and that concerns me. 
As far as research is concerned:
I’m in the honors program at my college and they really push research and graduate school and such, which is amazing, but whenever I think about research I just end up shutting down. The idea of not knowing what I’m doing at the start (even though I know I’ll be trained) and thinking about needing to be able to solve problems from scratch and just the knowledge I have also intimidates me a little. At the same time, I greatly admire anyone who is able to look at a problem, and based just off of what they already know, they are able to work out a solution. I hope to be able to reach that point someday but at the moment I just feel like I’m trying to shove myself into an area of the university that is already saturated and that I would be more of an annoyance than a help.
Also hearing other students about how they got involved in research or other related projects so early in their college career makes me feel like I’m super behind and should have done so much more by now.
Research to me means expanding and challenging yourself beyond what you already know, and I’m scared that because doing research specifically doesn’t exactly interest me that people will think that I’m not motivated enough to be getting a degree in chemistry, or don’t want to “work hard.”

All of that being said, what I want to do is forensic chemistry- analyzing evidence and such.
The problem with this is that any time someone asks me what I want to do, the usually respond with “oh so you watch crime shows?”
I’ve never really watched any crime shows, and the reason I want to get involved in this field is from my experience in science olympiad and taking the forensics class. I’m not trying to “be like the crime shows”, because that’s not how things actually work, but I’m scared that most people assume that’s where my interest comes from- because sooo many other people express an interest in the field based off the tv shows.
So what I’m mostly worried about is that people within the science/chemistry will look at my major and what I want to do, and think “oh that’s a waste of a major” or “oh that’s an easy way out” or “oh poor thing she has no idea what she’s doing.”
Don’t get me wrong, I think that I have done very well in the chemistry department thus far, and I’ve been trying to push myself in my classes. But with my future career, I want to feel like I’m helping better something, and thinking about all of this combined, I feel really confused and slightly discouraged at the moment.
I don’t want to be letting other people down, especially my professors, but I’m so in my head about all of this now that I don’t know what to think any more...",02Oct2019,1
195,"This is gonna be a mess but I’ll try to keep it together. I’ve been living with my Dad since 2013, and for the past ~3 years we have been arguing almost constantly. We don’t go a week without almost yelling at each other. He gets mad at me when I have my anxiety attacks, which cause me to pull out my hair and cry and shake etc. Which pisses me off so I tell him time and time again why I can’t control them but every time he still gets mad and says “Oh here she goes with the hair pulling again”. Am I wrong to get pissed off about this? Should I be accountable for something I can’t really control yet? Another thing is that often, he’ll suddenly change his tone which to me sounds very much like he is agitated, so I ask him what’s wrong only for him to raise his voice at me telling me that nothing is wrong and then when I ask him if he’s sure he yells at me that he’s fine and he’s tired of arguing with me, which also pisses me right the fuck off because to me is sounds like he’s blaming all of our issues on me. So I try and tell him how I feel only for him to get quiet and just use that agitated tone again where he says stuff like “I don’t want to argue” and “what’s the point in talking when it’s just going to piss one of us off” and he just says stuff like that and “I love you” which at this point I don’t believe. I’ve tried telling him why I am anxious, and it’s mostly due to how unpredictable his reactions are towards me and how talking to him feels like walking on eggshells, and I have to constantly be weary of what I say as to not put him in a bad mood. When I tell him this, despite the fact he asks, he gets mad at me and says “I’m tired of arguing” etc. Am I being ignorant? What did I do wrong? How can I stop this?",02Oct2019,1

197,"I have a friend that I fear may be in an abusive and controlling relationship. Me and my friend are both 17, her boyfriend is 19. Today, when I was hanging out with her, was when the red flags started showing. Or perhaps I just hadnt noticed until now. But in any case, as I was about to leave, her boyfriend shows up. I greeted him friendly enough, and had told him that I was just hanging out with my friend. He says to me, ""leave"". Knowing he would be unwilling to listen to whatever explanation I gave, I shrugged my shoulders and walked over to my car. After getting in and starting the engine, he comes back over to me and says that I am to never contact her again. Yet for some reason, the realization that something was wrong with this dawned after he said ""thanks for not making a scene"". That hit, and I began fearing for my friend almost immediately. The way he said everything, it was like he thinks he owns her. It wasnt the first time I had met him, but Ive never felt too at ease around him.

I would be lying if I said I didnt have any feelings for her, she's helped me more than any other friend I've had. She seems to be one of very few people who actually understand me. Its hard to put into words how much I care about her. Thinking back, she was always hesitant about talking about her boyfriend and was usually pretty dismissive when she did. After some reading of case studies and articles, I was shocked by how much everything matched. Maybe its confirmation bias. But I cant stand the thought that she is being coerced and manipulated by someone she should be able to trust. That its possible she is the victim of some heinous emotional blackmail. But frankly, I still dont know much about their relationship.

So, with most context out of the way, this is my question to you. Am I right to tell her. To attempt to break them up. Should I talk to her about this? Im afraid for her. I care more about her than I honestly have any right to. I wouldnt be doing this were it only for my own gain.",02Oct2019,1

I really need some advice and support. My 8 week old baby rabbit passed away earlier. I keep beating myself up over it because of the way it happened. I think I knocked her off the bed somehow and heard a noise that scared me so bad. When I looked down her neck was broken and her face was blank (eyes wide) but she was on her side spinning in circles. I couldn't tell if she was breathing from how she was spinning. I calmed and slowed her down. Her tail slowly raised last before she stopped moving.

Is there anyway she passed instantly and it was just her body running after death? It breaks my heart to think she was conscious and felt it in her final moments... I blame myself, I hate myself for it. She was my baby and I wanted to give her a beautiful life. I feel so heartbroken and torn down.

Basically (unbeknownst to me) my college started a program this year that gives students access to online textbooks at a discounted (kinda) price, which is cool. However, this program is requires you to opt-out within a few weeks, otherwise you are signed up for the rest of the year. 

The ONLY way news of this program was spread was through our college email, and being a dumb college kid I pretty much ignore emails that pop up unless it’s from a professor. So I missed the deadline to opt out and now I’m stuck with a bunch of online textbook fines for texts I don’t need. Shocker: it’s not cheap. 

After looking into the program, I found out that my professors should have included information about the program in their syllabus and Blackboard (online classroom thing that we use all the time). They did not, and I was unaware of it until I got a notice about the textbook fines.

Should I pursue trying to get refunded? Or is it completely my fault because I didn’t look closely enough at my emails?

I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 10 months and it’s never been... great, I love him so dearly, but I’m not in love with him anymore. The first month or two was the honeymoon stage and everything was good, but never great like it is for all of my friends. 

An example of what I mean is our arguments always end the same, me crying because I’m upset and an overly emotional person (thanks BPD) and him calling me a baby, or too sensitive, and telling me to be more mature. I’ve talked to him about this, told him I don’t like or appreciate him calling me names and being rude to me, and all he says is that he’s trying to help me “man up” and that I always take what he says as an attack. 

I tried breaking up with him a few months ago, packed all my stuff up and moved 3 hours back to my hometown telling him that I need to get proper help with my mental health, and that I need to focus on myself. Something I’ve never been good at. He was civil about it at first and we sort of kept in contact, but he kept getting more and more aggressive and angry at me.  He got drunk one night and absolutely tore me a new one calling me all sorts of names and telling me how awful I am.

My dumbass decides after texting for about a month and a half trying to get him to leave me alone, to come back and talk to him, and I fall for his tricks all over again. We move back in together and things were good again for a month, and then I decide to get my own apartment because I can’t keep living somewhere that I have to walk on eggshells all the time. It’s now been a couple weeks and I still can’t figure out how to end things with him, talking to him never works and I need to get my Xbox from his place still so I can’t just up and disappear like I so badly want to. Someone please help.. I feel so dumb for not being able to end a relationship with someone who is so clearly toxic for me",02Oct2019,1

I’m a sophomore in HS and I’m high key stressed. 

I’m taking two honor classes along with two AP classes and doubling up in science. It’s a lot of work for me. I’m trying to switch out of AP Physics because I realized it’s too hard and they won’t let me because the deadline has passed. I tried self studying but that wouldn’t work and I got a 43 on the test. I’m supposed to be getting a tutor but all the tutors I contact never even contact me back. My mother already talked to my AP Physics teacher and he tried talking to my counselor and they won’t let me switch out. Therefore, my mom had to contact the dean of all final decisions for classes and she hasn’t replied. I had to keep bothering my mom till she’d FINALLY contact the dean and the tutor. I’m also mentally deteriorating because I feel like she doesn’t care. 

She told me she’d look into the tutoring options I sent her yet she hasn’t even done that. I’ve been telling her over and over. I’m getting frustrated. I can’t just sign up myself without her consent because I’m not paying. My brother even pointed out how she’d put me down constantly. It’s true I won’t lie. She’s never really tried helping me with school or anything yet she’d post on social media about my grades. 

I’m sorry for complaining if I am. 

I just wanted to vent anonymously.

We met some neighbours (a group of a couple guys and a girl) coming home from the club. They invited us in and my girlfriend and one guy started talking a lot. I told them where we lived (two houses down) Me, my girlfriend and my housemate go home alone. About an hour later, the guy who was talking to my gf comes in to our house fully univited, without knocking. He seemed like an okay guy so nobody said anything. Everyone wants to stay up and im tired so i go to sleep and expect my gf to come up. I wake up the next day and she tells me she had sex with him. Right off the bat she tells me she told him to stop, she tried pushing him away, she has bruises on her and her vagina was bleeding the next day. She told me they had sex on my floor. She gave him her phone number when she left which sounds like she wanted it. She went to the cops and the investigator told her it was her fault and she shouldnt press charges. She agreed not to. She could have screamed, she wouldnt have gave him the number if it wasnt raped, she would have came to bed with me. Also she was talking to him so much and I definitely perceived it as flirting.

I just don't know what to do. I broke up with her, thinking she cheated. But I fully believe everything she said, she's a very honest person. I believe she told him to stop and tried pushing him away and didn't want to have sex. She says she just wanted him to finish so that he would stop and she didn't want it at all. This guy definitely gave off rapey vibes. Also she says he initiated the sex without warning if that matters.",02Oct2019,0

At first it was just a simple “oh she’s cute”, but then she sat down with me for hours one day while I was doing puzzles and we just talked about anything and everything. It was super easy to vibe with her and easy to open up to her without feeling of judgment. Only problem is, she has a boyfriend, and a son. So couple of days pass and then I see she’s working on another unit and she comes and says hi to me and asks me how I am and all that Jazz. EVERY time she saw me. Then skip ahead to my last day there. She was working on the unit I was inand personally said hey to me in my bedroom and woke me up to say hi. She kept looking at me and smiling and just talking to me. Then I was getting ready for a shower and she just randomly comes into my room and starts just talking about stuff w me. A couple of hours go by and I’m outside playing cornhole and see that she’s talking to one of the therapists and she’s crying and just looking at me.  So once we go inside I ask what’s wrong, and she said they were wanting to move her to another unit and she was sad. I asked why and she said because she wouldn’t be able to see me again. ( mind you I was leaving the next day) and that’s when I noticed she was flirting w me. We kept taking and just looking at each other and flirting with each other. She said I made her blush and how she enjoyed talking with me. And that she kept sitting down to do the puzzle with me for a reason. She wouldn’t say it though. We both knew the reason but she wouldn’t say it. So the day goes by and it’s time for her to leave and she said she doesn’t want me to go and she would wanna hang out all weekend cause she worked all weekend. I tried to stay longer, but they sent me home. I had made friends there though and they were staying a couple days longer so I made up an excuse to visit them but honestly I just wanted to see her. So I drive up there and finally get to see her, and man, she looked great. And it was so nice to see her. She was all smiley and telling me I look good and said she missed me and was nervous to come see me. And how she was sad when she came to work and I wasn’t there. So we keep flirting and exchanging looks and such, and I ask her how she feels about me and she said it was irrelevant and she couldn’t answer it because 100+ reasons( work, boyfriend and such) which I understand. The next day I asked her again when I came to visit and she said “she liked me as much as she can like someone she doesn’t really know”. Okay. So I tried to text her after I left and no response.

215,"Here's a timeline of my employment here in Central Florida to provide context. I think it's necessary to understand my hesitation, but my actual question will be at the bottom of the bullets below.

* **Company A:** start-up company funded by the parent company. Company A was about a year old when I joined, the parent company was a well established fundings group. Company A is an online invoice management solution, and is a new take on an old business practice of invoicing, incorporating internet, social media, and a high focus on customer service and customizability. Company A customers use their software to interact, invoice, and reach out to their clients, so it was a way of keeping engagement with customers even when passively invoicing. I worked there 2 months as an office liaison, $29K/year, and was essentially the office errand boy for the executives and the CEO's assistant. I bought snacks from costco for the office, cleaned, delivered memos, ordered equipment and supplies, and did whatever the executive staff asked of me. The company was 1-50 employees. **I was laid off because they got hit with small-company problems, product delays, dropped customers, etc., and had to cut staff accordingly.**

* **Company B:** This is a huge company with 15,000+ employees in central florida alone. I am currently employed here, I've been with my team for almost 2 years, and was recently promoted to ""UI/UX Designer"" making $42.5K/year. I am doing the FULL job description of UI/UX Designer, Web Developer (HTML/CSS, JS, PHP, Angular, Bootstrap), AND Product Manager, but am being paid far less than the industry standard for ANY of those three titles. The team is fun, the work is consistent, and Company B will NEVER go away in my lifetime. Its rigid HR structure, enormous short-term goals with a brand new product that's going to potentially double their revenue, and immense workforce means there's never going to be an issue for employment. **But I'm underpaid and overworked and would like to grow out of such a cold and exploitative mega-company.**

* **Company C:** I was just offered a position as Associate Product Manager with a starting salary of $55K/year, so a 31% increase. This company offers full medical/dental/vision, 401K, 9 holidays. The issue is, I've been diligently researching this Company C all night, and have concluded that it reminds me a lot of Company A in its goals, field, and product. It offers a CMS that competes with wordpress, focusing on intensive customer support, targeting elite clients rather than a free-for-all, out-of-the-box CMS like its competitors, and is a fairly new start-up. It's older than Company A, it was founded in 2006, but for all my research, I can't find too many reviews on the company or its product. The employee feedback has a 4.5/5 on Glassdoor, the product only has 6 google reviews, one is 1-star and has nothing to do with the product, but is attacking the CTO directly for being a ""deplorable human being"". Their social media shows a lot of activity and involvement at conventions, but there just isn't much to be said about the product or the company itself. But that might be because their clientele is elite, according to the CTO, and they might be floated by very few clients, with high emphasis on client privacy.

**My questions are:**

is a 31% increase worth moving over into a small 1-50 employee company that I have no way to know how profitable it is, and does not offer a unique product?

Should I be worried about whether I will be laid off (not based on my performance, as I'm fully confident in my contribution to the company) because it's a small company, relatively new, technology based, and batting against giants for competitors?

Is it fair or acceptable to ask my potential employers at Company C how secure my position will be as an at-will employee, how well their business is doing, and what their promotion track looks like? Or should those have been interview questions?",02Oct2019,1

Not sure where the best place to post this would be so if you have a better suggestion, I’d appreciate it!

I am a pre nursing student, &amp; I am done with all of the pre requisites and additional classes needed for my degree(just waiting to get into the nursing program now). Most of my funding comes from federal pell grants and scholarships, with very little student loans.

I just received an email from my school letting me know that I have enough credits to graduate in May 2020 with an associates in general studies. I am hoping to get into the ADN program starting in August, which is 2 years for the associates and then an additional year for the bachelors degree after that.

I don’t immediately see any negative to graduating, locking in that associates degree and then (hopefully) starting the nursing program after. From the FAFSA website, I am still eligible for funding prior until I earn my bachelors degree. 

Has anyone been in this(or similar) situation? Am I missing anything/ being short sighted with thinking that it would be a good idea to  graduate? Any negatives that anyone can see?

222,"Hi there everyone,

I'm having an absolute nightmare of a life right now and I honestly can't take what is happening to me right now. I don't want to resort to suicide because that is never the right option. A lot of people probably won't believe my life is this hard or this much is going on in it. My goal right now is to get away from where I am right now, be on my own and start my own life by myself despite being underage. I honestly don't know if I can make it on my own or how can I hide myself without getting caught. But I seriously can't take it anymore. 

The reasons I want to runaway and be on my own is because the environment/town i'm in. Right now I live in a town with about 6000 people so everyone pretty much knows each other. Everyone here treats me like absolute garbage. I had to be taken out of public school because I was bullied so much. The school did nothing about it and that's why I had to leave. Girls and boys always HMU to make fun of me, bad talk me or try to fight me. Rumors are spread around that i'm a whore, slut and sleep with everyone. I dont' want to get into this topic but I've had things done sexually to me about 8 times now in my life and the last one was about 2 months ago which really pushed me to just wanting to get out of this place for good losing all hope in this place. I had a pregnancy scare because of the that incident and never ever want to go through that again. I didn't open up and tell the authorities about it because it's so hard to open up in this town because of how everyone views me. Drama starts and I get attacked even more. The person who had done that to me would have his friends after me. I couldn't tell the authorities either because I also have bad stuff with them and realistically I don't have any evidence or proof to back myself up and I don't think anyone would defend me. It would end up starting more stuff and making it worse for myself. 

Secondly my family. My family is the absolute worst and is driving me insane. I really despise them and want to get far far away from them as possible. I'll admit I sometimes start things with them and I'm part of the problem and take the blame because yeah I do start arguments sometimes and am defiant but it's because of how they treat me. I live with my grandma right now because I can't be around my mom because she gave me away and has given me drugs in my childhood. My grandma is the absolute worst to live with though. And yes she can be nice sometime and will buy me a lot of things that I ask for but how she treats me and the things she says to me is a nightmare itself. She calls me a whore, slut, worthless, loser, waste of space and breath. She threatens all the time she is going to give me back to foster care. She has threatened to break her own hand multiple times and call the cops on me and tell them I had done it to her. She has pulled a knife on herself and sat right in front of me threatening to cut her arm to show me blood. She says i'm the reason her marriage with her husband \*my grandpa\* has been ruined when all she does is take his money and gambles it away. I've had enough of her garbage and I want to get far far away from her.

Thirdly just everything right now isn't good for me. I barely get enough to eat at home and yes my grandparents make dinner sometimes but other times they refuse to feed me or tell me to make something myself when there is only like milk, lettuce and maybe eggs sometimes in the fridge which I can only eat for so long until it either runs out or I get super sick of eating it too much. I get treated like ass by everyone and it's just too much for me. I only have 2-3 years left until I'm able to leave but I can't wait till then. I can't go outside without getting groped, teased or name called. I have online school and stuck at home doing 6 hours of homework a day. It's an absolute misery for me and nightmare itself. I can't sleep well, I can't think well or pretty much do anything without being sad and depressed all the time. I really think running away in this case is the best option for me but I wouldn't know how to start a new life, lay low and be able to go to school and continue my education. If anyone has any tips or advice for me it would be most appreciated. Thank you for listening. &lt;3",02Oct2019,1

235,"This gets a bit long, so TL; DR at the bottom.

Yeah. Sounds bad, but hear me out. A bit of context first: I'm 20 years old, an agnostic, study music and have a good job that pays pretty well. Enough to live comfortably on my own. But, for now, I have to wait until next year to move out (I still live with my parents), since college and work and everything leave me no time to even think about the logistics of that. I've been thinking of moving out because my relationship with my parents is really, really... strained. We do love each other, but, well, it gets nasty. 

I'll be brief. My problems with them can be distilled to a few things: First, they are incredibly, overly, stupidly religious. They are pastors, by the way. Of a Christian Church. I found out all of the logic holes and moral mistakes on Christianity around three years ago, and obviously that was a big hit to them, since I decided being a Christian really was just living a lie and being a prick without wanting to be a prick. And yes, there are amazing Christians. But it made me a prick. My family wasn't thrilled to hear this, and my mom told me really hurtful things. They made me go to a psychiatrist. And my mom also takes meds for her mental disabilities and depression, so she freaked out from time to time. Second: All of that religiousness makes it so that they expect me to behave close to perfect. Weirdly, that only comes in bursts, and lately it hasn't been that intense. Until today. Oh, and third, their life choices were governed by religion. So a whole bunch of gigantic fuck-ups, basically. To name a few...

-I was beaten daily until I was 8. Not an exaggeration; I remember asking my mom what was wrong the days I wasn't beaten. Usually with a belt and for silly stuff (not finishing lunch or not making the dishes), sometimes with a ladle or wooden appliances. They've apologized, by the way.

-We went to another country for missionary work. Left that country suddenly, and with no money. I had depression from a combination of factors, basically the culture shock and the meds (Ritalin) I had to take. So I had depression since I was 8 years old until... I don't know, two years ago.

-They immersed me in the Christian culture. Them being pastors and all, wanting me to be an example for everybody else in the planet. You know, all that purity crap and not being worthy of anything. And yeah, sorta bad for my worldview since I became a homophobic, self righteous prick. And way worse when I realized I wasted my life following a fake idea.

-And last but not least, their advice wasn't really... sound. When I was 5, I started getting bullied, and they told me a good Christian kid doesn't defend himself. He waits for God. When I was 13, I started uploading silly stuff to YouTube, to my parents dismay. My mom wanted me to study (with good intentions, of course), but I didn't really listen, and now i have an amazing financial help from it. Really, it's great; it pays for college. They didn't want me to have a non-christian girlfriend, and it's been eight months and my girlfriend is the best human being in the world. 

So yeah, you get the picture. Of course, I understand they are human and make mistakes. But I have only moved forward when taking my parents as a bad example. My depression got better and better when I realized that the Christian God is not real, and that I didn't have to fear eternal hell if I wanted to... I don't know, count gay people as people or having sex with my girlfriend. When I realized I could take control of my life, I started studying seriously and I'm overall a better human being. So now. To what happened.

My dad sat and started eating, and my mother started telling me to stop trying to block them out and not speaking to them on the table. I didn't say a word, since usually not confronting calms them down. But then she said that if I wasn't going to follow the house rules, I could think of leaving the house (she doesn't know I'm planning to move out on January). And then my dad joined her. So I just waited till they were done and went to my room. Then I decided to explain that I wasn't disrespecting or anything, that was sitting there alone and that was that, but my mom started saying that she doesn't know what my problem is with them, and then steered the conversation to saying that I never accept when is my problem and all that. So then I said yeah. I have a problem. ""The problem is that I want to treat you as normal people, since I can't respect or admire you as my parents for all of what you have done to me.""

Yeah... That stung her. She got mad. Then sad. Then mad again. Then went into denial and said I was just mad. And I don't know if I completely ruptured my relation with them. I want to make clear that they are good people. Just... Confused or misguided or something. That is what religion does to you.

Sorry for the wall of text.

TL; DR: Had a blown out problem with my parents. Told my mom why I have a problem with them (Most of their choices were bad for my well being. Going against those choices made me happier, economically stable, and a better person). I don't know if it was the right thing to do, even if it is true. What to do now?",02Oct2019,2
236,Hey so im looking into doing one of those sensory depravation tanks and i wondering what experiences people have had,02Oct2019,1
237,"To introduce myself, I am a 'boring' kid who doesn't have a lot of friends.

So I messed up my exams and ended up in a not-too-good university with not-too-good students (or should I be saying, even more boring people than me) as well and I really don't feel like being friends with any of them so I just isolate myself mostly, it has been 3 months and yet I don't have any friends nor do I wish to be anyone's friend in my class and I am going to be stuck with these people for 4 years and I keep thinking about my friends from school from 3 years ago who were super cool people but we all parted ways and my two best friends went away for education which is making me feel very lonely at the moment.

Any advice on how to get over these old friends and try to find new friends?",02Oct2019,2
238,I was scheduled for a shift at work during class time at college and didn't even realise it. I've made it clear in the past I'm not available during that time and just didn't even think to check that day if I had work. What should I do??? I didn't notice at all and was not looking at my phone so I didn't see the store call me.,02Oct2019,2
239,"So a little bit of background of myself... I am in my mid 20s (M), I was born and currently living in somewhere that has a lot of unrest and I have a chance to move to another country which should be safer and more probable for a life. Here are the things that I have considered and some more in depth info on each of them.

1. Where I am living now,recently there has been a lot of unrest due to the government policies. The government is reacting to the unrest in seemingly unlawful ways. (You might already be able to guess where I'm from by now)
2. I have dual citizenship, for the place I was born and am currently living in and also the country I want to move to.
3. Most of my friends, family and my girlfriend wont be able to leave even if they wanted to.

For me personally, I think the sense of freedom is essential also knowing that I have the freedom of speech/religious belief and I wont be prosecuted just because I disagree with the government policies. Where I am currently living, those do not seem to be available anymore. This makes me feel unsafe and does not inspire confidence for me to have a life here anymore.

If I leave, I cant take my girlfriend with me which means I might have to break up with her, my friends will also be stuck here and I wont be able to help them. I just don't really see how I can live here for the rest of my life as it will only get worse.

What would you do? Would you give up you friends and family for a better life?",02Oct2019,1
240,"I’ve been wearing the same glasses for almost 4 years now, and my eyesight is really bad. Like after a a couple feet away, my vision gets blurry. In school I can barely read the board when taking notes and my grades are plummeting. I gotta sit at the very front of the class. I still keep falling behind.

My dad says he won’t get me glasses because he doesn’t have eyeglass insurance, but my mom does so he told me I have to ask her to get me new glasses. Everytime I ask her about setting an eye appointment, she gets angry and yells at me. My mom keeps saying she’ll set an appointment, but it’s been a few weeks now and today I asked her if she set one and she said “NO, STOP ASKING ME”.

I’m getting frustrated, I just want to see properly again and my mom doesn’t even seem to give a shit. I explained to her that ive been struggling with my eyesight for over a year now  and I’m tired of everything being blurry.

242,"When I was 15 I was the youngest man in Canada to be accused of sexual assault (so my lawyer said). Leading up to the accusation, I was actively involved in competitions where I was required to be constantly touching(non sexually) my teammates in order to complete the various tasks. I was never fully comfortable with it, but with the encouragement of my leaders, I grew accustomed to it. That is until my second year of competitions, of which after one of my practice's, I was approached by two of my leaders, saying that I sexually assaulted my teammate. Both shocked and devastated, I quit, and my parents threatened legal action for defamation if anything came about the accusation. Needless to say I am innocent; and I am so so thankful this occurred just a few months shy of the metoo movement, else my future would've been ruined.

I never expected to see the lady who accused me ever again. We were never close and although the incident scarred me, I sort of got over it.  Recently however, I recognized her amongst my colleagues during a lecture. Now I am more scared than ever. I go to one of the most liberal universities in the world, a campus which has posters on walls saying ""We promote better masculinity"", and ""Sexually assaulted? We believe you!"". Typically if a lady accuses you here, you are kicked out without evidence or trial. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to hope she wouldn't bring this up again, but then again I have no idea why she accused me three years ago! I don't know what to do, this is my dream university and my dream program; I am not ready for everything to turn to hell! I don't expect this to be a popular post so I beg that if you read this, please give me your advice on what I should do. University is stressful as it is without all of this extra crap.

246,"Me and my half brother weren’t really in each other’s lives growing up so I was always excited to see him because after all he’s my only brother, but when I did see him this last time he did something to me and I still can’t wrap my mind around it. There was a family party in June and we both went, it was going well until I left for work at 6-10pm and then came back. We were staying at the house where the party was so we could help clean the next day so we had to sleep on the couch together. It’s two separate couches that connect so I slept on the longer side and he slept on the shorter side. When everyone was asleep and I was laying down he started grabbing my legs and caressing them. I thought hmm okay kind of weird but maybe he’s asleep and doesn’t know he’s doing it. It’s just innocent is what I thought. Then the night went on and I just couldn’t sleep so I was just laying there, and he began to scoot up to my part of the couch and that’s when I was like uh okay what the fuck is happening. Then someone opened their room to use the restroom and he immediately went back to his part of the couch and then I thought yeah somethings not right. I was frozen with fear and confusion and wanting to give him the benefit of the doubt. But as the night went on and everyone else in the house was asleep he kept inching closer to me until finally he was right behind me and I could feel everything and he was touching my private area and rubbing it roughly and I just laid there crying frozen. I don’t know why I didn’t move. Or stop it. I don’t Know what would’ve happened if i did. Would my family believe me or would I ruin things. I didn’t know what to do or how to feel. He never undressed me or put his skin on mine but I just felt so violated and scared and disgusting. I was awake until the sun came out and the next morning we all had breakfast like nothing happened. I would keep this to myself and bottle it up but I have a younger cousin who he’s around as well and I’m just scared he might do something to her like he did to me.

My friend recently started getting really rocky in her relationship and is thinking about breaking up with him. My girlfriend and I are perfect right now, no problems with anything at all no neglect we speak daily and go out from time to time, perfectly normal. I hate that I started getting feelings for my friend after a while and I've been just sucking it up. Slipping over a large portion of the story she started to slowly get feeling for me too that became full on love and she hates it because hard still in the relationship. Yesterday, we spoke to one another and came clean with everything had a laugh but we both felt extremely hurt. You love someone but you can't be with them. We're both extremely against cheaters and cheating to the point we cut off a friend of ours for 4 years because she cheated once. Neither of us would even think about cheating on their partner. And she told me herself that even if she was single she would only make moves if I was single.

The noise is one thing, but they are literally shaking my whole room.

267,"A few years ago I began the journey of tracing my ancestry. I took two commercial DNA tests and at first I didn't understand any of it, just saw a bunch of cousins with names I didn't recognize. I figured it was on my paternal side, which my grandfather was adopted. 

A year goes by and I find out more information, his biological mother's name on adoption records. It matched a lot of the cousins that showed up as matches. 

After my half brother(same mom) did his DNA I was able to sort through the matches and decipher which was maternal and paternal. I did some research and found records on my great grandmother and discovered she was 16 when she had my grandfather . Soon after she married and moved across the country. 

I matched with my grandfather's half niece and found that the family was plagued with health issues, mental health issues and most of them were taken away from their parents(I spoke with quite a few cousins that had no knowledge of the family because they too were adopted)

I began to dig deeper into my matches, most would not respond. Then I went through them over and over and found that there was not one by a different name related to a potential father, except I matched extremely high with cousins that were showing up as first cousins, when they should be more like 3rd 1x removed. 

Reaching out to the one relation that would speak to me and I found out that my Great grandfather was my great grandmother's first cousin. It's also more complicated as his mom was her biological aunt, but his dad was also her paternal uncle.  Making them double first cousins. I also found his death records and he died from the same condition as my father did. 

So after all of that, I have aunts that have been trying for decades to figure this family mystery out, but here's the thing... I'm not close to them at all. I was estranged from my father when he passed away. I have been working for years to try and rebuild a relationship with that side of my family and I thought if I could solve this mystery of their grandparents, that they would somehow welcome me back into the family with more acceptance. Now, I'm not so sure that's the case.

268,"Ok guys, I've heard of these questions before, and I have one now. Please weigh in. Am I the bad guy?   


The background: I married my wife a year ago. Financially very rocky to start, I was the only one working because she refused to drive my stick shift car to find a job. We spiraled, and I had to sell my personal valuables in order to afford a car for her. Now she works at Waffle House, and makes pretty good money as a cook. We've very slowly climbed away from living hand-to-mouth. Very simple lifestyle. We decided to celebrate becoming financially stable by purchasing tickets to a concert that's happening this weekend. (Financially stable here means that we now have enough savings to not white-knuckle each month's bills). We saved up a bit more and I decided to purchase a new washing machine so we wouldn't have to use the laundromat all the time.   


((I'll admit, purchasing the concert tickets was not the wisest decision. But my wife was going stir-crazy and I felt she really needed the treat. She's usually extremely financially stable, spending very little money on treats.))  


Now here's the rub. ((It should also be noted that my wife has depression, wild mood swings, and is unusually heavily affected by the time of the month.))  


She has been increasingly unhappy with her job. I've tried multiple times to encourage her to apply elsewhere. I work at a casino, and there are jobs aplenty there. But she's refused to get another job, claiming that she'd rather be miserable where she is. I quit urging her to apply elsewhere, deciding to respect her decision. I got her to go to therapy, and thought she was going regularly ((she went once and did not go again, I didn't want to micromanage her by directly supervising. This was a mistake on my part.))  


Tonight she had a meltdown at work and messaged me asking if I would be mad if she quit on the spot. ((Her managers were their usual moronic selves and she cracked)). I asked her what the circumstances were, she explained through tears. I told her that I would not be happy with the situation, but that I didn't know all the details and I'd respect her decision without harping or ragging on her about it. However, if she quit, I'd have to try to sell the tickets, and cancel the delivery of the washing machine. My reasoning for this decision was based on the American Hiring Process, which grinds along horribly slow, and on knowledge of how my wife dawdled the last time she really needed to get a job. My reasoning is that we need that money, that extra stability, far more than we need a show. I don't want to live hand-to-mouth again. And I'm out of my own valuables to pawn or sell.   


My wife went BALLISTIC. Screaming at me over the phone, cursing me, telling me that she expected me to support her, accusing me of trying to force her to stay at her job. I did my best to reassure her, but she believes that it's my duty to let her quit working, and spend all our savings to boot.   


I have a great deal of difficulty understanding and respecting people's emotional reactions. My wife is an emotional bomb right now, and threatening to 'go doll'. Am I the bad guy here?",02Oct2019,3
269,"Last year I made friends with a kinda famous cosplayer by total accident. I enjoyed her cosplays and especially the energy she exuded in each post of hers. I commented on a few of her posts, she replied to some, I watched her lives and she started to recognize me and seem to get excited when I posted comments. We even starting DMing on Insta. 

I want to make clear I don't have any romantic feelings for her, I just enjoyed her company as a friend. 

We then realized that we have a common interest outside of cosplay and connected over that. She sent me a sample of her work for me to review and give my opinion on and that was right at the beginning of Summer. Unfortunately, that lined up with my steep descent into depression for very personal reasons. 

I pulled out of all my online and offline social connections for the entirety of Summer. It wasn't until the end of July that I started to feel like myself again but even then I felt I was 1 bad day from falling into the same pit again.

Now I've started to recover, and started rebuilding bridges I tore down. But I'm especially hesitant about contacting her. I had been such an asshole I hadn't even offered a single word of reasoning as to my absence. It's been just under 6 months since messaging. I really want to, but I also really don't want it end in disaster, I really liked chatting with her.

In her shoes would you be angry? Would you forgive this idiot?

I'm willing to answer any questions on the subject so long as it does not compromise the identity of me or the friend mentioned above as she has been active on Reddit in the past (IDK if she is now obviously but better safe than sorry)",02Oct2019,1
270,"It’s my first year in university, and though i generally enjoy my area of study, I can barely bring myself to wake up in the morning and go to class. 

Because of that, i’ve missed a good amount of classes, and that brings me stress because i realize how much i’m putting my future self, as well as my family in debt in order to be here.

Yet still i’ve missed at least 70% of classes, and its only my first month. 

So obviously i’m behind in all of my subjects, most especially chemistry. I have a midterm in that class tomorrow, and despite the fact that i’ve studied for hours, i cant bring myself to understand the information.

I already slightly accepted the fact that i will likely fail my exam tomorrow, but that still makes me feel terrible, and causes me to be even more stressed in the long run. And the other stuff that i have on my plate, due to other classes, isn’t helping either..

So what can I do to make myself stop feeling like shit, and what can I do to get my life back on track? As well, what can I do to stop myself from feeling more stressed if I do end up failing this midterm?

271,"I love my mom and would have no 2nd thoughts of harming anybody who harms her but yet I cant tell her that I feel lonely, depressed, and other things. 

I have no reason not to. She wouldnt make fun of me for it, she's the only parent I can tell this stuff to (dad is divorced and in jail), and she's the most readily available. She even told me that I should before since the increase in suicides around where I live but I just cant

The only person who I can even tell some of these things to is my best friend and even that is a pretty big maybe. I should tell people these things but I cant. I just want to be left alone to willow in my sorrows even if what comes from it isnt good.

273,"Last month was mine and my wife's anniversary. Four years married and five years together. We've had some rough patches, but we've had some wonderful times, too. 

We both have our issues:


- I'm insecure and I always feel like she doesn't want to be with me. I'll often lie in bed with her and ask if we are ok, if she is still in love with me, and if she still wants to be with me. Sometimes she starts crying when I ask things like that and she tells me that she's trying her hardest to make sure that I feel loved and that I feel like she's paying attention to me. I feel as if she doesn't, but I also feel like I am a needy person and that I read into things that aren't there, so in actuality I am causing these issue to appear from nothing.

- She gets depressed and overwhelmed easily. When she gets depressed she often feels emotionally empty. When she feels that way, she sometimes says that she doesn't know if she'd rather be alone or be with me. She says that she's just unhappy with life, and if I mention her depression, she says, ""Why does it have to be depression? What if I'm just not happy?"" 

This used to not be the case, but a few months ago she almost left. One night she completely shut down. Like she turned her emotions off. She said she wasn't happy and that she wanted a divorce. I was distraught, but managed to convince her to go speak with my mother with me so that we could get an outside opinion. My mother convinced her to think about it. She told her to not make a decisions that large on a whim, but instead to think about it long and hard. The next day my wife said that she wanted to work things out. She also apologized and said that it wasn't normal for her, or anyone, to shut her emotions off like that. She agreed to let me help her find help, and that I may need to go to therapy as well, or better yet we could go to couple's therapy. Sadly, we never did any of that.

Now, tonight, I feel like it is happening again. We were losing in bed, talking, and I asked her if she was ok and if we were ok. She said yes. I told her that I felt ignored, kind of sidelined, today and she started crying. I told her that I just needed to know if she was **in love** with me, and not that she just loved me. I told her that I needed to know if she wanted to be with me. She said that she's unhappy and that she needed to think about it. She began to get frustrated with the entire thing and she told me she was going to the living room to think. 

That's where she is right now, and I'm sitting in the bed typing this. I'm scared. My stomach is in knots. My heart is breaking because I feel that she's going to come back in here and tell me that it's over. I don't want it to be. I want her to be happy with our relationship and with her life, too. I'm 26 and next month she will be 25. When I met her she had a terrible life. She left it to live with me at my mom's before we got our first apartment. We worked hard, together, to get her medication for ADHD and bipolar disorder. We worked hard, together, to get her into college and into a veterinary technician program that only accepts 50 or so students per year. There have been many struggles we've worked through together, and many great times we've had. I mean just last weekend we celebrated our anniversary for the entire weekend. We went to a nice restaurant, went shopping at the mall, came home and relaxed, played video games, and ate junk food for the rest of the weekend. It all seemed perfect and then, BAM, this happens tonight. 

I just don't want to lose her. I can't imagine my life without her. It is literally painful to imagine it without her in it, much less anyone taking her place one day. It is making me physically sick just typing this out. 

My entire life could change in a few minutes. What do I do? If she decides to leave I'll be devastated. Neither of us can afford this apartment alone and we are both in college, but those things pale in comparison to the empty pit in my stomach caused by thinking of a life without her, and I know that it will be even worse if she does leave. 

I'm scared and I don't know what to do.",02Oct2019,1
274,"Hello all. I’m currently a freshman in college and I’m living with other people for the first time. Everything’s been fine except one thing. 
My roommate keeps her fan on 24/7. It’s a medium sized fan but it packs a punch. I understand having it at her side when she’s studying, but having it on at all times, especially when our entire dorm keeps the AC on full blast, it seems just unusual. I had to deal with it at the beginning of the semester when it was unbearably hot, and I got sick because the room was so cold and dry. It was hot, though, so I understood it, I just asked her to turn it off some nights when i had auditions so i wouldnt wake up stuffy. She’d turn it off for those nights but keep it running continuously throughout again in the morning. Now, recently we’ve been dipping to mid 70 to 80 in the day, and right now it’s about 65 at night. The fan is still on, and I’m getting sick again and waking up with a scratchy throat and congestion. I bought a humidifier that should be coming in a few days, but I can’t stand having it be this cold when it is already starting to get cold outside.

I didn’t think much of it at the time but the I realized that this could mean my SO might have a stalker. They know where she lives, what car she drives. and when she goes to work. There was also no note and none of the other cars on the street had roses on them. We don’t have any security cameras but I just bought some a couple minutes ago on Amazon.

About a week before we started hanging out/talking she posted some long ass paragraph about him and something he got for her!!!! I scroll back more and there’s pictures of them from the summer (these didn’t concern me because we didn’t even know each other). I am completely shocked and feel so hurt. I texted him right after and basically just said “do you have a girlfriend?” He denied it and explained that they used to talk but now they don’t and I brought up the fact that there was a post about him on her profile a month ago. Again, he denied it and I really want to believe him. These past few weeks have been amazing and he treats me so good! He respects me (I think lol) and always wants to be with me. I tried finding her profile again but he had deleted her comment on the tweet and unfollowed her.

285,"Throwaway because even if nobody in my close friends Reddits, they could see it on my phone.

Sorry for all the faults I'm not a native English speaker.

Anyway, I am 20 years old and currently in college. I have been with my girlfriend for 2 years now. She helped me get myself back on track with school and very supportive for those past two years, and I have been here for her too almost every time I could, during panic attacks or hard and sad moments. However for about a year or a year and a half, we began to fight a lot more, hurting each other psychologically because we're both very emotional and don't know when to stop. We were on the verge of breaking up numerous times but we never did it, but I feel like we don't do it not because we love each other but because we need each other. I need her to get me to stay on tracks and not to feel lonely, and she needs me because whenever she needs it I go to her, and with a lot of exams and applications for post-graduate schools she is in a lot of stress. However, we still care for each other, and we do everything for the other to be happy, but during the summer the feeling that she stayed with me mainly because she needs me or because I'm useful started to grow.

That was what I though until recently. Her best friend, who is since before we knew each other, is around us a lot, and even went on a trip with the both of us. She had a boyfriend for a few months during the first year, but he was a huge dick and she's been single for more than a year. But recently, she started seeing a guy and they are both interested in each other. From what I've heard, he's a really nice guy. I felt very happy for her, but when I heard about how close they became I felt my heart sink. I felt sad and jealous. That even threw me off for a couple days and I think I'll completely fail my upcoming midterm because it kept me from studying, I couldn't concentrate.

I know that she doesn't love me. She never openly told me, but I'm not her type of guy and even if she did love me, I know she wouldn't do anything because she love my girlfriend even more. I know that nothing could ever happen between us, or maybe in some years if we're both single. But if my girlfriend hear about all of this, that would destroy her.

So I would like some advice on how to keep all those thoughts out of my head and give up on any ideas about trying to be with her best friend. How to think about something else and how to not destroy my relationship and two friendships.

I'm sorry if that sounds very stupid or if I'm not in the right subreddit for those sort of posts, but I didn't know where else I could post it, as it's not relationship advices that I'm looking for.

Might delete it in a few days or hours to prevent anybody that I know from seeing that post.",02Oct2019,1
286,"So a while ago a government haphazardly allowed a 20 year old to acquire a version of protected documents. 

These documents discuss the relationship between a violent dictatorship and a government that would not typically be associated with them. 

It is also an election in the near future, and releasing these documents would likely influence public perceptions of our current leader, and potentially sway the public vote. 

Because of the nature of the documents and parties involved there is fear that my life may be in danger if I’m attributed to releasing these documents.

287,"So earlier tonight I was in a conversation with a few friends about sexual content. I didn't really say anything until most of the group left because I felt uncomfortable talking about these things with a group, let alone with one person. I've never watched any kind of sexual content or experienced anything of the sort, but I noticed that its a topic that comes up often in my group (whether it comes up as a joke or as an actual discussion). I'm the only female in the group and I'm always worried that I'll be seen as some kind of slut or someone who just wants attention. One of the members of the group has openly told me that he doesn't trust me and labels me based on women he's been friends with in the past, even if I ""haven't done anything wrong"". That being said, I often go out of my way to avoid conversations such as this because I'm scared that it'll stick out more than anything else anyone else in the group could say.  Sometimes I try to make jokes to blend into the conversation, but if anything it gets more attention and I don't want that.

But, tonight I got into a conversation with one of the more understanding members about storylines in porn. I told him that I've never seen porn, but hearing about the storylines interests me. I just hope he knew I meant purely the story elements and not graphic explanations of....you know. He was surprised, to say the least. He started explaining to me a storyline of a film that I should watch if I'm looking to get into that kind of thing. I tried to seem like I didn't mind talking about the conversation, but inside I was scared. I just wanted to talk about what they often did.  I feel like my ""confidence"" only made me seem more like a tramp. After the conversation, I wanted to tell him all this, but I felt like I'd only be overdoing it...I even went out of my way to change my profile picture on discord because I thought the face looked ""too suggestive"". I don't want anyone else to not trust me. They always talk about females they've been friends with in the past who have been slutty, suggestive, teases...I never want to be like that...I feel like I want to earn respect, and maybe me trying to talk about these things and make jokes with them is me trying to \*get\* that respect...But I just feel shameful afterward.

What I did was completely unfair, as I simply distanced myself from him in the hopes of saving our friendship because I did not want my feelings to jeopardise the lovely bond we had, sadly, I completely detached myself and the friendship from then on became awkward anyway. Later, we had a conversation about things going back to the way they were and I freaked out and said that I was moving on and the change was good. This was when I was 16, I was going through a confusing phase, I was finally focused and got reminded of the times I was so infatuated and consumed with the ""what ifs"", so I denied and moved on. We still remained friends and he was the only person who I genuinely felt connected with, and happy with. I enjoy making people laugh, but he was the only one who could make me laugh.

293,"TL;DR at the end as it is extremely long. 

English isn't my first language and I'm on my phone so excuse any grammatical and spelling errors. 

For context: my parents have been emotionally and physically abusive for as long as I can remember (I'm 16 and currently starting my final year of high school). My dad is also usually the one that will try to emotionally manipulate me after a beating/conflict occurs and essentially guilt trip me or make me believe  that it was my fault it ever happened in the first place. 

My situation as of now is extremely rocky with tensions high between my father and I (and unfortunately for me he is the most violent one). Recently we got into a small argument about me wanting to go vegetarian resulting in him emotionally abusing me (mostly about my academic achievements). He then said I have these holidays (2 weeks, currently halfway through my first week), to clean up my act or he'll cut off any support he's giving me and take away everything I have. This isn't new to me as it has happened before and he will go through all my messages, social media, contacts, photos etc. 

At home I am constantly scared and I feel extremely unsafe and it's beginning to take a toll on my physical health. So after the argument I decided that I should move out, knowing full well that I would no longer be accepted back home and may also be disowned. My friend has offered me a place to stay until I become financially steady and can move into a shared house. 

My dilemma is I am unsure if this is the right decision for me because I have a few financial worries. 

Quick background: I am about to start a job that offers $45.71/hr once the school term begins and I am legible for Government benefits (Youth Allowance) which gives me $554.20 a fortnight. The places I'm looking to rent are $160-250 a week (inclusive of bills). 

I am most worried about grocery shopping and Medicare (I'm EXTREMELY unsure of how this works because I use lenses and I don't know if the optometrist is covered by Medicare and how to apply for it in general). I also know that by moving out I will have to stop tutoring for a minimum of two months because I won't be able to afford it. But if I stay with my parents I will struggle physically and emotionally. 

TL;DR: my parents are emotionally and physically abusive and I plan to move out but I have a lot of worries regarding how to pay for everything (e.g. groceries) and how Medicare works.",02Oct2019,1
294,"I'm of the firm belief my brother has some sort of undiagnosed mental disorder. He loses his job quite frequently, and he's been averaging five jobs a year for most of his adult life. He won't bathe but once a week if we're lucky. Most of the time it's multiple weeks. He can't drive because he got a few parking tickets he never paid, and skipped court when he was summoned.

I've talked with some of his former co-workers and a few reasons why he was fired were stealing and ruining customers food. He lies about everything and has been doing it for his entire life. About three years back we caught him stealing and selling our belongings one by one. He'd target something we hadn't used in a while. We lost the same games almost once a month. We only found out after he had completely sold all of the comic books collected by my stepfather through the course of his life. 

He was booted but eventually allowed to stay in the house again because he was homeless. Nothing has changed. 

Now here's the current problem. Things have been disappearing again. I don't have evidence to confront him with but I have my suspicions. Tonight I tried to dig up my 3DS to play some Pokemon and it's missing. I'm pissed but maybe I lost it. I start searching and my old DS lite is sitting on my shelf. Missing the games inside and behind it. I'm near certain he's stolen them.

295,"Hey everyone! I really need some advice and I’m hoping y’all have some ideas. I graduate college in December with a degree in Advertising and Marketing from a school in NYC.  

I love living here and there’s plenty of opportunities in my field (even if it’s super competitive) and would like to stay. However, the starting salary for the types of positions I’m looking at is super low compared to the COL here, like 35-40 grand pretax. I don’t have car costs, just the subway, but rent is so high. I currently live alone (thank you to my parents for some help) and don’t think I want to give that luxury up. 

So I’m considering moving. I just have no clue where I want to go. I know I want to stay in a pretty big city. I don’t think I want to live somewhere that relies on cars. I’m not super outdoorsy, but I love concerts, art exhibits, comedy, etc. The only places I would completely rule out are the suburbs of anywhere or SF because it’s just as pricey as NYC, from what I’ve heard. 

I’m hoping to get into brand strategy with a media company, record label, beverage company (bartender here, lots of industry knowledge), or an up-and-coming tech startup. Once I’ve made some money and can afford NYC I’ll probably want to move back.

I don’t really have anyone I can talk to about this stuff, my friends are very “dude bro” kind of guys and honestly they’d just think it was cringey.

So I guess what I am looking for is maybe an alternative? I’ve tried dealing with it on my own but I don’t think I’m very capable of it anymore. Any advice would be appreciated, thank you.",02Oct2019,1
298,"So here's some background information. I'm a freshman at University and I've been friends with this girl since the first week since classes started. At first, I had a small crush on her but as the weeks have gone by, that small crush has developed into a pretty big one. We seem to have pretty good chemistry and for sure I consider her a good friend. This Thursday, I'm considering asking her out to go see a movie and get dinner after. Now you may asking right now: ""What seems to be the problem?"" Well as the title suggests, I feel like I have waited too long and that I may have missed my window. Without giving out too many details, I missed out on some signs that she MAY liked me (Ex: her saying I was so sweet after expressing concern about her going to a frat party) and now that my dumbass has realized this three weeks later, I think this may be too little too late. Now don't get me wrong, we're still friends. I've walk her to her dorm sometimes and I have made comments such as saying she looks cute or something among those lines, but I'm worried I may have missed my chance. Do I still have a chance with her or did I miss my window?",02Oct2019,2
299,"Hello people of Reddit. First off, I’m not looking for or deserving of any sympathy. My situation is due 100% to my own shitty life decisions. The past few years I have stumbled from 1 shitty scenario to the next but things actually might be in the up and I want to grab this opportunity with both hands. 

Very quickly my background. I spent 7 years in the Submarine service as a sonar operator but I left in 2009 to be with a girl I was madly in love with. I moved country to be with her, in 2010 we became pregnant and i was over the moon, but, I knew this meant I had to start taking my career seriously. So I decided to go back into the military by joining the Air Force (we both agreed this was a good move). My son was born in 2011 and things were great, I had a joining date of August 2012 and was planning to propose once I finished basic training. Sadly, a few days before I left my partner decided to break up with me. No explanation or reason. 
I still went to the Air Force and completed my training, things were fine for a while then long story short I realised that I had been struggling with Depression, anxiety and PTSD.
I left the Air Force last year and things have went from bad to worse.My car died and unable to afford a new one or the repair I was unable to continue work, with no income I fell behind with my bills which culminated in me losing my flat with a mountain of debt and ending up in a homeless shelter.
But things are starting to look up. I have been offered a place back home in a place specifically set up for veterans who are in hard times. There is multiple training and education opportunities here so I’m wondering if anyone knows which of these opportunities would be best to land me a career. I would really like to work offshore but I don’t know where to start. 
Any and all advice is welcome. And if you have any questions please ask. 

TL,DR: After being in a shit situation I now have a chance to get qualifications for a good career but don’t know where to start. 

Thanks all. If anyone else is in a similar situation please get in touch and I will help as best I can.",02Oct2019,4

303,"Last year I was in a fire which caused me to be in the hospital for 2 months due to drastic burns and lung damage. During that time, a friend of my family’s started a GoFundMe for me to pay for medical expenses and future cosmetic burn surgeries that wouldn’t be covered by insurance. I am so grateful for all the people who donated, and we ended up raising a significant amount of money to help me and my family. This is incident was a huge deal in my small suburban area, and this is probably the thing that I’m most known for in the world. Although I’m incredibly grateful for all the support, it’s already frustrating to me that I’m seen as victim by so many people and not as anything else. Every time I think about this gofundme, it makes me really embarrassed because it includes a terrible photo of me and describes me in a way that destroys the image that I want to project to people. It has 2.5K shares and I know everyone in my life who I’ve ever interacted with has seen this page. I feel very guilty saying this, because it was such a kind thing to do to raise money for me and I don’t want to be ungrateful. Everyone has already seen and read the gofundme so I don’t know why I care, I guess I’m just already struggling with self-image because of the extensive scars I have now. On one hand, it’s been a year since the fire and no one really donates anymore so I don’t see the harm in asking for it to be taken down. On the other hand, under no circumstances do I want people to think I’m not grateful or that I resent that friend for describing me that way, and everyone has already seen it so why not leave it up. Do you think I’m being petty wanting it to be taken down, and if not what’s the best way to ask without giving the wrong impression? 

TLDR: should I ask for a GoFundMe to be taken down because it negatively impacts my self image?",02Oct2019,358
305,"So basically my (21M) friend of 3 years is in love with me (20F). For the context let's call him P. All of our mutal friends told me this and it is quite visible. Now the problem is, he started acting weird recently and I became quite uncomfortable.

First of all, he buggs me to get coffee with him every single day in the week. And he gets mad if I don't invite him somewhere, like a party or something. He was pretty buggy before but I thought it was just because he doesn't have a lot of friends so he just wants to hang out. When talking to our other friend who is also his best friend (20M) I found out that he never does that to other people. I was a little bothered but oh well, what can you do, I tried talking to him but he didn't get the message clear.

He always seems kinda happy when my relationships go bad or when I break up with someone. He was so happy when I deleted Tinder because I gave up on it. It's just not that weird but he is the only one of my friends that acts that way.

We went out a couple of weeks ago. While we were in the club with our friends and this boy im sort of dating everything was normal. Then me and the boy started making out. Then P took out his camera and started filming us. We didn't know until later because our friend told us he was doing it and my fling confronted him but he started making up excuses. P doesn't have any social media and he did it secretly so I have no idea why he would do it.

Now the last major thing that upset me. The same night we all slept at his place. He took out an air matress and blew it up for us and he also has a huge couch in his living room. I slept on the matress and my friends were on the couch. I was wearing summer shorts (nothing sexual) and an oversized T-shirt. Just for context, I usually have some spare clothes at his place because we often randomly crash at his place. He gave me a sheet to cover myself with it. He is usually the one that wakes up before anyone else no matter at what time we go to sleep. At around 8 am I woke up for a brief second. Everyone was asleep. I was sleeping on my stomach. I noticed, while half-asleep, that he was moving my sheet and taking photos of me, specifically my bottom. Since I was pretty tired I just sort of moved, like you would in your sleep, and turned on my side and curled up in a ball. I fell asleep again after that. Now, the problem is since I was half-asleep I didn't react how I should have and just brushed it off. It came to my mind 2 days later and has been on my mind since. I would like to point out that we never had anything sexual, we were strictly friends and I NEVER GAVE HIM THE IDEA I WOULD DATE HIM. Not that that is an excuse for his actions but since I feel like some people might give me shit for that I have to mention it.

Honestly, I don't know if I should just confront him or block him and end our friendship. He was a great friend before, helped me with everything I needed, was supportive etc. I am highly uncomfortable with what happened. I haven't seen him since. What should I do? Did anyone expirience anything similar? What did you do in that situation?

TLDR: best friend is in love with me, is happy when my dating life sucks, took videos of me and my fling making out and took photos of me in shorts while I was sleeping, dont know how to act and what to do.",02Oct2019,3
306,"So, I’ve known my friend since 6th grade. We both graduated high school back in 2018 and we’ve been friends ever since. However, it’s really difficult for me to see her because her boyfriend is extremely insecure. He would think that her and I have some thing going on when I haven’t even seen her in months. Whenever she would send him explicit pics, the first thing he would ask is if she’s sent them to me too. Like what?? He would flip his shit if he even saw that she was texting me. She knows that what he’s doing is a huge red flag but she hasn’t really done anything about it. He tells her shit like “I don’t really like your friends” even towards her female friends.

319,"My SO and I have been together 6yrs. I live in MA, he lives in CT. He just finished college and got a new job, so we're ready to move in together. He has a high paying degree, so I've always said it would make more sense for me to move to him. And it's finally time. 

We found an apartment and decided to only put him on the lease for now. Because I have more shit to do, it might be a couple months before I can join him.

Car

* It's mine, but it's in my dad's name to make insurance cheaper. I'm guessing the best course of action is to move to CT, and have my dad gift the title to me and I re-register in CT.
* Then I need to figure out how car insurance works. Because it's in his name, my dad did everything except pay for it. 

Health

* I have a chronic illness, so a PCP at a minimum is a requirement. There's also special program in New Haven for my disease, so I'd like to see a specialist there. My current specialist is in Boston, so it'd be a pain in the ass to keep seeing him.
* Health insurance, also a requirement. Can't really pick a doctor until I know what insurance I have.
* Because insurance is gonna be iffy for a period of time, I'm trying to speedrun through doctor and dentist appointments. I had 5 appts last month.

Job 

* I just started applying to places. I put in my resume ""Moving to [City]"" because I saw that suggested on r/jobs, but I dunno how the interview process will go.
* My current job knows. I wasn't planning on telling them yet but shit happens. The timeline I gave them is before 2020. The dept is already understaffed, so hopefully they hire someone that I can train. Unfortunately, no one knows how to do the stuff I do. I've been making a How To book when I get a free minute.
* Good side to telling people early, everyone has been very supportive and offered to be a reference.

Vet

* My cat is allergic to life itself. Her current vet gives her steroid injections every few months. I found a new vet with great reviews, but I don't know if they'll continue with the same treatment. I'll probably ask her current vet for her medical records.

The Actual Moving Part

* Update address on everything, get a new state license. Probably other stuff I've forgotten. 
* Cancelling Comcast, because SO will be getting the cheap New Customer price.
* Finding a new bank, my current is a small local one. Though maybe I could keep it for awhile? I never need to go into the building, and I never use ATMs. 
* New pharmacy. I delegated that one to SO.
* Furniture. SO suggested delaying getting any until I move in. Which could mean him living without furniture for months. I'm starting to see where the bachelor pad stereotype comes from. 

And most crucially, learn how to use a dishwasher because I've never had one and there's one in the new apartment.

We're not so much dating but we're very romantic with one another though and we've both said we've liked one another and we do fool around with one another. 

So to get to the point, currently staying at his place right now since last time i was here i had a blast we both did. Every morning he wakes up at about 4 for work and sometimes him getting ready for work tends to wake me up, so he goes outside to smoke a cigarette and i go over to look at what i thought was my phone ( im all sleepy and confused so wasnt really paying attention), click the home button and i see hes still using the dating app we met on a year ago and my mind is just fucking racing and thinking the most horrible things right now.

I wanna confront him about it but i dont know how to cause i dont wanna look like i was prying which i really wasnt and i also dont wanna overthink the whole situation?? But who wouldnt when thats the first thing you see right ? So in conclusion i just really need advice on what to do about the whole ordeal im hurt and i cant stop crying about the whole thing .

333,"Hello everyone,
I would love some advice on something that's been on my mind for a couple of years now.

In 2012, I was at the beach with my grandparents and there was a family playing with an abandoned dog. Later on we found out they were going to call a shelter and have him picked up because it wasn't theirs. We had been there for a while and overheard their conversation. At the time I was only 11 but I asked my grandparents if we could keep him so he didn't have to be taken away.
Fastforward a few years and now I'm nearly 20 and almost done with uni. The dog is still at my grandparents' house. After I'm done with uni I'd like to rent an apartment with my boyfriend, this won't happen until last 2020, but I have been thinking about it more and more lately and I just can't decide what would be best.
My grandparents take care of him, he's bathed and fed but they don't really have that much time to walk him or play with him. I would really love to keep this dog once I have sorted out my living situation after uni and take him to the vet to get him checked out since he's never been to one. I would like to take him to live with me. However, I don't know what would be best for him, since I would be living in an apartment and my grandparents live in an actual house with some property. He doesn't run around free but he gets to live outside, which I would imagine would be preferrable compared to living in an apartment, at least it's what my family always tells me when I mention this issue.

I just feel really awful when I think of him outside every day nearly always by himself. And I know when I come to visits my grandparents he loves having me there cuz I always take him for walks and he just *loooOooves* going out.

What do you guys reckon would be best? Space would truly be the issue here, not money, I wouldn't think of bringing him anywhere if I couldn't afford it.

336,"I just read a psychology article about how the shortest man a woman will date on average is 5'9.

The average height of men is 5'9. 

Height standards are so encouraged, so funny, so exciting. The taller the better

I'm not an incel, I've had girlfriends, even taller than me. But when I have looked into it, short men are given less opportunity and respect in life.

The studies say taller men attract diserable women. 

I struggle to live with the thought that I would be given more opportunity, respect, and be attractive to at least some more women if I was exactly the same as I am, just taller

And before I get all the advice, I already know. I know how to work twice as hard, be a pro socialiser, get my money up... but you need to understand, some short men just can't show their power or ability. 

I never use to be bitter, because I know it gives people the excuse to feel superior, but seeing men who can't even mutter ""hello"" to a woman, who fall out of bed at midday and barely budge a muscle, will be supported and loved by a woman who find him physically attractive. And then see men transform their lives for the woman who chose them. 

Instead it feels like, to attract a desirable woman, I have a 20% chance of attracting her with anything at all since dating an average height or taller man is instantly what they're looking for


I have had matched women who were hot and heavy for me. And then after 1 date I'm ghosted. And I wish it was my personality, but they say it's my height.

And it all makes perfect sense too. I just wish I was ignorant and bliss again. Dating was never easy, but now it feels like hell. And I don't think I want to feel emasculated for the rest of my life.

341,"Hello! Being 18 years old, I'm having a really hard time looking to the future.

Though I wouldn't say that I'm afraid of getting old, it seems unthinkable for me to grow old. Like going through life for so many years would be just too much for me.
Sometimes I seriously think I will be the one ending my life because I don't want to carry my unhappiness through all of my existence, if it makes sense. But I'm still young so hopefully I will change my mind.

As stupid as it sounds, the reason behind all of this is that I have a dream amongst many that is dear to my heart, which is to meet at least one of my favorite artists once in my life. But since most of them are old now, I'm afraid of them dying before I can make it happen.

Dreaming is the only the thing that has kept me alive for so long and is still the only thing keeping me alive to this day. I know my dreams are most likely to never become true, but I don't see the point in living if not sticking up to the idea of my dreams and hopes potentially becoming reality, somehow some day.
I'm genuinely wondering if life is really worth it when it seems like there's no reason to believe in things that can make you happy. 

In the end, I think I just need someone to tell me that death only is the end of everything, and that dreams only die when you cease to exist. I need to find reasons to believe in a brighter future :(

Me and my best friend (and housemate) both love theatre very much and I'm nudging towards making it my career. 

Recently we auditioned together for a theatre group. It was my friends idea and she really wanted to join the group and i came along last minute. We both enjoyed the group very much, but she was a little more shy then me. 

Now a really nasty and both happy thing happened: the theatre group wanted me! But not her...

She's really really sad and mad about it and we are both kind of flabbergasted that she didn't get accepted. She has the feeling she didn't get accepted because they only wanted one of us. 

Now its up to me if i join the group or not. 

She feels betrayed by the group and i know it would make her sad if i joined anyway and it kind of feels like I'm taking her spot because it was her idea to join this group in the first place. Maybe it would be different if she went alone...  She says that if she were in my position she wouldn't join the group. 

On the other hand i feel like i can learn a lot from this group and i really enjoyed it. I do want to join.

She's shown some interest in me recently asking more about my personal life and just talking to me a lot more, we constantly joke to each other, tease each other and laugh at each other a fair bit so it's extremely friendly, we constantly catch each other looking and then quickly turning away, we've even started talking about some deep shit to each other and opening up about our pasts,

So about two weeks ago she suggested I go out drinking with some of her friends after we'd been talking about alcohol, she invited me out but they all decided to not go as they were indecisive whether to go to begin with, instead I suggested we just go somewhere and hang and asked her where she would like to go, currently she is thinking about a good place to go but I just wanted to ask.

My main concern about Blanca, the runt of the litter, not fed properly or taken care of when she was little. Initially neglected by my asshole sister - she's good obsessed. She growls and meow whenever you go even near where we keep the food. And don't let me get started on when she actually eats. 

Aside from all of this, she's surprisingly affectionate, even when you place your hand on her for minus a second, she'll start purring. 

I've realised that she doesn't know how to use her class properly, she gets it stuck in almost everything, clothing, couches, carpet, and will just look at you helplessly. I've already established that she has got problems of some sorts, however, I don't know how I can help her. 

I thought that she might have herpes, however if she did our other cat would've gotten it too. 

She always has gunk around her eyelids, mucus coming out of her nose (coming out of the mouth is a recent thing) she's also extremely bloated all the time, she's had a pot shaped belly since she was little, but now she is overweight.

She never has accidents in the house even when she's been inside for 8+ hours, yet this past month she has had an accident almost every week in the office. 

She goes at 5am when we leave for work. I take her for a long walk around the office park at 7am. She goes again at 11 and 12 when I'm going and coming back for lunch. Then we leave at 4 to go home. 
At first she was only having accidents in the afternoon so I started taking her out once at 2 or 3 as well. Only reason I hadn't been doing this before is its really hot and she gets very over heated. That seemed to help, but this morning she had an accident when we had been in the office for less than an hour. 

Its always the same spot too so I don't think she ""has to go"" I think something about that part of the office is triggering her. She is a marker so my best guess is she's marking her territory? I have started keeping her tethered to my desk and she doesn't have an accident as long as she is secured. Also the office is just one big room with desks so its not like I can keep her away from ""that spot"" all I can do is keep her tied up.

360,"# I am a 17 year old Boy, and I can't seem to figure out if something is socially wrong with me. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the mouthful here. I didn't really have anywhere else to go to talk about this stuff other than this board, so, prepare for some teen-edge.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

For the past year or so, I've never liked socializing.

 I can stand being in a social situation decently; I can make some small talk, somewhat keep eye contact, say relevant subjects and whatnot, but in the end, I find it to be draining. Every time I talk to someone, be it a friend, stranger, or even family member, I get this looming fear that I'm not doing something right. It's as if I'm always asking myself: ""Did I just say the right thing? Am I supposed to answer that? Should I sit differently?"" without end. Because of this, I end up becoming an awkward mess: looking around the room, fumbling with my hands, not being able to start conversations, and disliking myself for every little insecurity and detail. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Through this, I had found I have been under a constant blanket of insecurity that gave me thoughts that I might be disabled, autistic, or at least socially inept in some form.

 Eventually, these anxieties of mine had managed to creep into my daily life, leading myself to believe that every action I do and perform can wrap right back around and confirm that I'm on the spectrum or something. Every day I'd spiral deeper into it: I'd distance myself from people, I wouldn't talk as much, I'd seclude myself in my room and do endless research on ASD, ADHD, and SAD all by myself to try and find some kind of answer to my current state. Yet, most of all,

I hated myself for it, with every fibre of my body.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now, due to many reclusive habits, I would be seldom seen discussing my insecurities with anyone else other than myself. 

I was a loner, and thought that talking about me and my mental health to others would only make them see me as some weird narcissist, and drive them away. Because of this, I went into the all-familiar downward spiral of emotional instability. In this time, I had no friends, I couldn't enjoy socializing, and I'd become nervous as to whether I'd be doing something that an Autist would. And, as far as I can tell, this mood hasn't shifted with me for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'd hate to drag this on, but worrying about symptoms of mental disability has probably been my biggest cause of anxiety.

 At the time, I couldn't tell myself truthfully if I knew what symptoms I filled out for (prominently for having Asperger's) and what I didn't. All it felt like was an emotional roller coaster that flung me around, yet yielding no answers to what could be wrong with me. Naturally, I was too afraid to get help from a professional, thinking I'd look to paranoid and insecure about having a condition to my parents. Sure, I have met up with a counselor once or twice, but I couldn't even explain properly to them what was on my mind, leaving me emptier than before. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The symptoms I'd experience only made my mind race harder with negative thoughts: 

I'd bounce my legs, tap my fingers, and even rub my peach-fuzz of a mustache almost constantly, maybe as a reason to keep me occupied, or because I felt off sitting motionless. I'd have trouble sustaining non-awkward eye-contact with others, as well as having troubles asserting myself in conversations; I'd worry that I might sound too annoying, or ramble about something unimportant, so I'd stay quiet. I began to question myself as to whether if I played music and made art as part of my passion, or if it was some ""Special Interest"" that Aspies tend to have. The list goes on and on, and for each one, I don't even know if it's normal anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I think I've worked myself up an essay here already, so I think I'll cut myself short. I'm not writing this for some expert advice, or to get throbs of outer attention from people. I am writing this now with one single purpose, and that is to find an answer to my question: **Am I alone in this? Are there any others of you out there, be it my age or not, that can relate to anything I might be going through? I'm in no search of recognition or diagnosis, I only want to know If I'm normal...**

361,"Hi r/advice. I have a couple of issues with my life in general, and I don't know what to think at this point. First off. I'm a 30/M who is working at a IT company doing IT things. 

I will describe those two issues in this post, so please bear with me

Recently I got faced with the question about whether I do want a romantic relationship or not. I've been wanting to push this thing as much as possible, but I found myself needing to respond to it. Turns out, I don't feel like being in a committed relationship with anyone. Almost all of my past relationships ended up hurting me hard and I don't want to live that again. I had only one relationship that made me happy, but differences forced us to stop it.

My issue is that I know this is going to hurt my chances at anything. Whenever I look around, people are getting married, having their happily ever after, moving forward with their lives and I'm doing none of that. I'm getting old, and I'm realizing I'm lonely and with no one by my side. And I don't feel like I can give anything to anyone. I barely have friends where I live and meeting new people has been difficult.

And I believe all of this stems from fear of others. For some reason, the thought of being in a relationship makes me scared of the other person. I don't feel safe. 

As for my second issue... 

I'm starting to realize I really dislike working along with people. My company takes on clients and I gotta work at their place to solve their issues as external personnel. I hate how I seem to be struck by internal political things, and how I have to put on a face and pretend that I'm fine, appeasing the clients. Every single day I have a hint of anxiety and I cannot work more relaxedly because I feel like I cannot make any mistakes, and I feel as if our client is out to get us at any moment's notice if we let off our guard. Moreover there is always something that, as little as it may look like, irritates me and sours my mood every day, and it's a different thing each day. I enjoy what I do, but I hate doing it with others.

A little bit of context here, I'm a male and I'm the class president of our class so a lot of my classmates call me ""President"" instead of my given name. 
I have social anxiety (yes, crazy amirite)  and I can't say NO, I always say yes. It has always been my problem for years and it's stressing me out.  Anyway here's my situation: It's now time to go home and this one girl asked me if I can lend her 5 pesos ( small amount of money tbh) she said she'll pay it tommorow  and I told her ""Yeah sure, let me get my wallet first."" then I proceeded to do so. Then I was about to pull out the coin until she saw how much money I had ( i had a lot of folded 20, 50, 100 peso bills). Then she changed her mind to a 20 peso bill and proceeded to swoop out the 20 peso bill out (the bills were folded.) . I was a bit alarmed but I let it go. Then she thanked me then parted our ways. Now, the thing is, I know the amount what was in my wallet. And when I got home I checked my wallet ( to put some coins in my piggy bank.) and noticed three 20 peso bills ( again, small amount.) were missing instead of one. And now I'm having doubts about how much she swooped out.  I don't know if she really stole it or not. I have a low impression of her you see.

I'm about to confront her tommorow about the money she borrowed from me and I need advice on how to confront her. Do I tell her off? Do I just ignore it and let it go? Now at this point I don't really care about the money, I just want to know if she really did it. Because if she did, I'll be super wary of her and I will rarely talk to her again.

380,"Okay so I’m a 21 year old female who hasn’t done anything in her life at all. Once I graduated high school in 2016,  I went to college in 2016 but dropped out in 2017 to join the Marine Corps. I was dropped from bootcamp for medical issues and was told I can try and re-enlist in 2 years. So I’m 2018 I ended up getting a job as a receptionist at a doctors office and that’s all I did. I was still planning on joining the Marine Corps and so I wasn’t going to school and just worked every damn day and got my car eventually and got into a relationship with a Marine. I ended up traveling a lot in 2018 because of the long distance relationship I was in and because I was also traveling with family for the holidays so I quit my job. I also had lost my car a few months after I got it. Anyways, I ended up not having a job, being broken up with, and lost my car all in 2018. I ended up living with my parents for months and I got into escorting and being a sugar baby and all of that in 2019 and I got kicked out in June of 2019 because I didn’t have a job and I didn’t want to live with my parents anymore so I was hopping from hotel to hotel and I was basically homeless all summer working but making good money from escorting. I would escort on and off from 2019 of January-September 2019. I currently left that lifestyle due to it getting to dangerous and family almost finding out. ( my family doesn’t know, only my close friends do )  in August I went away traveling for a month to Puerto Rico and on a cruise to different islands in Mexico anyways ever since I was able to move back in with my parents in September I’ve been laying in the couch all day every day. I don’t have a job still, I don’t pay rent; I don’t have a car, I’m talking to someone who is trying to date me but I am scared they’re gonna see I’m not that motivated to do shit. Anyways my parents are moving to a whole different county 3 hours away from where we originally live due to my fathers work and so my brothers and I are going to have to find other places to stay @ since my parents will be moving on their own. So I have a month and a half to find a job, save money, figure out what I want to do with my life. I’m stuck between wanting to travel and work away and experience different things since I love traveling and plan on making YT videos for that to make some extra income. I’m also thinking about joining the marine corps again or any military branch but it is a 50/50 chance I can get in and it’s a longer process than before. I also just plan on moving to another state or country and study or work there or in the county I am @ with friends and family but rent a room on my own. I’m just so lost and don’t know what to do with my life. any advice please. if you’ve traveled or moved away to another place and started a new life how was it? Was it tough? Do I need to save money? I have no money at all and I don’t want to go back to escorting to try and make money. I’m so torn on what I want to do with my life and idk if I should travel away for a year and then come back and go to school or try to do military or if I should just try now. btw I’m depressed af and not motivated to do anything but travel like that is my favorite thing.

381,"First of all, I'm sorry that this is going to be long-winded and rambly. I'm not in a very good frame of mind right now and all I want to do is to have a solution that doesn't make me want to jump in front of a train.

I'm (18F) a university film student. I have depression, anxiety, and some very minor OCDP tendencies that I'm currently seeing a psychologist for.

For an assessment piece, I am working as a graphic artist, meaning I'm doing the intro and segment graphics for a show that we're producing. It's like a talk show, so there's a lot of names to pop up and segments that all need their own graphics and little bits and pieces that are adding up.

The filming of this live show is happening tomorrow night, it's the big day for our assessment. And I got a message last night from our director asking me to make a new graphic, a very intricate one that is very above my level of expertise, as I've only just started using the software this year.

I tried to do it, but it took me quite a while to do a very very small portion of it very badly, so I told him that I wouldn't have enough time to make it happen and that next time I'd need more notice. He got upset with me and told me that he's not trying to be rude, but he's given me enough time and that it's a small turn around and that everybody is trying to pull their weight, but thanks for what I've done. That he didn't ask me to do some of the other stuff I've done and that I don't really have that much on my plate compared to some of the other roles, which is true.

I just feel like a failure and so worthless to the team. If I had been able to do it, but just did it poorly and he didn't like it, I wouldn't feel half as bad, but I know how much I've disappointed him and that he doesn't realise how much this feeling is getting to me due to my mental health, and a part of me wants to help him understand, but I don't want to complain anymore because there's already so much tension and negativity and I don't want to give him any further reason to even think about me and the mess I've made.

I don't want to go to class tomorrow in fear that he's vented about my attitude and inabilities to some of our other classmates and that they'll know how pathetic and useless I am. I want to kill myself. I'm having a panic attack thinking about facing them for the three hours the class goes for and I just want to drop dead. I don't know how to go about saving face. I hate knowing that I wasn't able to do this and that I've been uncooperative.

I just feel so hopeless. Please help me

How do people go about dealing with these feelings? Should I try to talk about it with him or just get out of his way and let him do his job? How do I make it through class without having a meltdown in front of everyone? Oh god and how do I deal with the thoughts and feelings that everyone is judging me?",02Oct2019,3

385,"So around a month ago a lot of my friends left for University, and I left public education to do my A-Levels at home since I studied music for two years. I have no friends to really speak to, they're busy with their own lives and to very honest I doubt many of them would even want to meet up with me. I am at home right now with my head everywhere, I have all these different things I want to do but my brain can't stay on one thing and then nothing gets done, which is incredibly frustrating. I know a lot of my mood has to do with me not going out, I, only an hour before writing this realised that I have barely been out for a month and when I went to a rave for the first time recently, I felt so incredibly disenfranchised by the people around me, it has only recently dawned how much I barely get out of the house. I have no idea what to do with myself.  I want to go out but I don't know what to do, I live in London so obviously there are things. but whenever I go out I end up just wandering aimlessly because I don't really know the place and the stuff you can do there to the fullest extent. There are art galleries but once I visit them all, what do I do next? I don't have anyone really to speak to in person with me. My best friend, I had recently distanced myself from him because I feel like he doesn't truly value me, I planned to go somewhere with him yesterday, he agreed. He then completely forgets and doesn't say anything. He is going to meet a friend on Friday who I had a falling out with which is fine, just cause I don't like him doesn't mean he can't hang out with him I'm not a childish dick. However I guarantee he will remember that he is hanging out with him on that day and go with him, he has bailed on plans, lied to me several times, he broke my camera lens and has yet to pay me back after six months, yet he uses that money to go out drinking and smoking continuously. There is clearly a divide on who he prioritises; may I also keep in mind the guy he is meeting and meets way more often told him to fuck off and never speak to him, and they didn't speak for a year. And I truly realised that he is toxic and I need to cut him off. 

I have recently become incredibly distrustful, distrustful of the people around me. Due to many traumatic experiences, a lot of my friends made fun of me behind my back when I was young, a close brother like figure stopped speaking to me out of the blue and my last text to him was me explaining how I was afraid of losing everyone and him never speaking to me again after than that affected me deeply. I generally find it very hard to truly connect and want to be with people, don't get me wrong I can socialise and speak to people just fine but finding people who wanna hang out with me or vice versa is rare and top of that the people who I do hang out with, it ends up not feeling right.  

I have goals. I enjoy making music or at least imagining making it, I have a lot of cool ideas (at least I like to think so) but my home studio room, which was a spare room I used to record music and come up with ideas was taken as well as my music making software is being a bit annoying so I gotta wait a month for me to get it back. As well as the fact my recently divorced uncle came to live with us and consequently took the room. I am not angry with him, but rather the situation because I had waited a year for that rooms availability.   But to be very honest I procrastinated on music making a lot, A. I didn't know how to develop something solid afterwards due to writers block or B just a frustration of not being the best straight away, and not having everything I need to fully articulate my musical ideas. I also have other dreams for screenwriting, and being fluent in many languages 10 is the goal in my lifetime. I have dreams and aspirations and in a sense I also have the connections to get there. 

My love life, I have been on a few dates in my life; none of them ever lead to a second date. Now I understand dating by its nature is a vetting system, you don't feel the sparks? There's not much you can do. I'm willing go out there and meet people, but where? I have recently been to a rave and it wasn't my thing I like talking to people and bars are good for that but a lot of bars have people way too old for me, I am 18 and I meet people who are like 21 or 22. I also have an anxiety of approaching girls not because of rejection but because I am afraid I might think they are older than they actually are most of the time it's not the case but a few times, I have by accident. I obviously apologised and didn't know, my intentions were pure but it just makes me feel like a creep. So where can I meet people like me, I love art, philosophy, music is an obsession I spend a lot of time listening to music. And how do I kick that fear? Whether it's Radiohead, Post Malone, Kanye, Nick Drake, John Coltrane, Frank Zappa, JPEGmafia shit tons of people. Where can I meet likeminded people, what places do I go to? 

I feel very overwhelmed with ideas, but I have barely anything. I wanna know,  How do I meet people? How do I find love? How do I gain a footing in life? What do I do?",02Oct2019,1

We were doing things you'd think a couple would do for two months but never labeled it a relationship. She had just gotten out of a past relationship a couple months earlier, so I never wanted to ask about a potential relationship between us but I was so into her I figured we should talk about it. Towards the end of the summer when we brought up what we were, she thought about it for a couple days and told me she didn't want to get into one. After the summer was over we wouldn't really be able to see each other because our colleges are so far apart but I'd get to see her around holidays when we come back from school. I have not seen her for a month now but we still talk every day, and have a video chat once a week. I'm really at an odds because even though she told me she did not want to date, were still doing something similar to a long distance relationship by communicating this much.

395," 

I have an unexpectedly great decision to make in having to choose between two jobs and I'm not sure what to do.

The run down of them is:

Job A pays slightly higher but is across state lines in a city where rent costs double, over 2 hours from where I am living currently. Job B is 20 minutes drive from home, it pays OK.

Company A seems to present more interesting work though company B makes a more positive contribution to society, I like company B's ethics statement and the various charity work they're involved with. I do not know which would be best for my future CV.

Company A are established in my field and I think I could learn a lot there. Company B just started moving into my field recently so there I would be the one teaching others; looking at other people in my field who are working there they mostly have less experience than me.

My boyfriend has a job (not his dream job, but a job) in my current city. He is willing to move in theory but in practice he would have to register in the new state and it might be several months before he could work there.

Last night, my boyfriend of one year and nine months (my longest relationship) told me he has simply stopped loving me and doesn't think it would be healthy to try to continue and work through our issues together. I can't blame him, but it came out of nowhere for me. I still love him so much. I'm polyamorous and have another boyfriend who is doing his best to support me. During the actual breakup, he cried for the first time in two years. It was the first time I've ever seen him cry. We hugged each other tightly, we laughed, I comforted him despite the fact that he was the one who fell out of love with me. I promised him that I will always be there for him, that this breakup doesn't have to be permanent, that I will continue to love him, and that I will never hate him. He told me he could never forgive himself for doing this, I told him that it will take time and soon enough, this pain will be a faint memory. I left his car praying he'd be okay. I don't have many, if any friends. My parents were already asleep and I cried until I passed out. I feel empty and fairly alone. He's the first person to ever dump me. I don't know what to do. If it weren't for my other boyfriend, I'd be completely lost. 

I don't know what to do or how to heal. This is a new sensation, things were finally going my way before this. I got a new job where I literally play with dogs all day! It's been so long since my last heartbreak, I don't really know what to do or how I'm supposed to handle this. I need advice.

411,"May be a long block of text, tried to keep it short but couldn’t stick to it once I started writing all the thoughts out and needed to vent, thinking of posting to a couple subs, hoping this is a good one for this? Tried searching for similar posts beforehand but couldn’t find anything quite the same.
Tldr at the bottom

I mean if I’m out in public and am wearing something smart, for example for work, I assume everyone I pass by will think I’m a snob or may make a comment or even decide to confront me, I know that sounds ridiculous as I can never imagine that happening to anyone else. In fact I could see people daily dressed in full suits or others in just a track suit and never even register it or care enough to think about someone else’s outfit choice as it has no impact on my life, but then when I walk by wearing a similar thing I feel like I see some people glancing and I get tense walking past them with my first thought being that they will say something or at least that they’re thinking something negative and judging me.

If I’m with my girlfriend I get the same thoughts but much more intense, even fearing stupid things like what if someone decides to physically confront me and how would I have to react and what if something happens to her and my brain just goes into overdrive. It doesn’t matter whether we’re just out in shops, cinema or at a bar. As I have a full sleeve I’ve even started often just wearing T-shirt’s out regardless of weather because my brain justifies it as a slight deterrent for others to interact with me as I may come across ‘tougher’ or something which sounds embarrassing to even type out. 
I think this whole feeling became even worse after one night in a bar some drunk twat randomly came up to me while we were sitting down in a group of people completely unprovoked to slap me in the face.

I completely understood my thoughts before were somewhat irrational and I just had some spotlight effect but this felt like it just confirmed my absolute mistrust for people around me. I still try to go out with everyone as I don’t want to miss out or let anyone down but honestly for the last couple of years I absolutely dreaded the idea of going out anywhere especially bars and places like that every time it comes up, which I get annoyed at at myself, because while people are looking forward to events which are meant to be fun and positive, I spend the week wishing they would just be over with and over analysing everything that could happen beforehand.

TLDR; think everyone will judge me for what I wear and how I look and in a somewhat related way have a constant fear someone will confront me verbally or physically or decide to randomly assault me or pick a fight for no reason",02Oct2019,1

When I met my friend I was just out of a bad place and getting my life together. I am now mentally happy and looking for things in my career and improving my life. 

My friend isn’t. He is still in the same position that I met him. I have helped him Get into a job and now he is being awol. He isn’t helping himself. He is not eating good food and still smoking weed and other drugs since 5-6 years ago. 

I push him with what I think are his interests in music, in gaming and other things and he shows no sign of interest into the subject, but never actually doing anything if that make sense. He doesn’t want to improve his health or anxiety issues. It’s like he has no ambition. 

I have ideas on how to make money and improve my life, he says he wants to get involved but never shows anything back.  I feel like I can’t leave him on his own though. 

His girlfriend is very controlling and won’t let him go out. They have a very toxic relationship, he talks sometimes like he hates her to me, next time he is her best friend. She calls him on his breaks, she even goes to the toilet at her work just to speak to him on the phone on his break. He has like timers on when he has to go home if he comes to mine and just seems like a really shitty lifestyle. 

He is also getting himself into money trouble for his lifestyle, which is taking drugs and gambling in his house. 

He is on his last warning at work but I feel like it can affect me if he is showing bad signs at his own life management. 

I don’t really know what I can do to help him. I’ve tried everything. I have told him to take a break from his girlfriend as I think the issues stem back to her but he never acts on it. 

He is very energetic so I feel he would do good in his own creativity and has stated several times he wants to do YouTube etc, but still doesn’t.  It’s just the same conversation for 3-4 years. 

Do I just leave him to do what he does or do I keep chasing him and trying to help him leave this lifestyle? I am a bit lost with him and I care for him but I feel like there’s only so much I can do.",02Oct2019,2
415,I have to pass this class in order to graduate and each assignment is group oriented. The problem is that I can't do it on my own despite wanting to and even I could it would be impossible as the assignment requires two people. It hurts just thinking about having to ask someone if I could be in their group because everyone else in the class just stares at me like Im a freak (I'm pretty fucking hideous tbh) so what do I do ? there's not much the professor can do and I don't want to force myself into any one group.,02Oct2019,1
416,"Hi guys, so how do you deal with a friend who constantly invalidate your feelings and keep complaining about how sensitive you are and no matter what you're going through they always turn it around and talk about how they are having it worst. So let me put this in context, for example I've been experiencing some problems with a neighbor who's on the ground floor and I'm on the top floor and seems to make it his job to come to my apartment and complain to me everyday at 11 pm about things that are out of my hand like snow or birds disturbing him and which he believes it's my fault ,keep in mind he's married and is like 60/65 yo. So I'm really uncomfortable with his presence and avoid opening the door for him ever since he presses himself right against my back and behind ""to show me something ""while his wife was in the next room. So because of his constant knocking I kinda of developed a phobia where I can't stand knocks anymore and gets scared whenever I hear them. My friend noticed my discomfort and that I started to get spooked easily and decided to tell her about my problem with this neighbor and she made a poor joke about me dressing sexy the next time he knocks since he seems to like me. That rubbed me the wrong way and so I decided to tell her about my experience with what I believe was a sexual harrassment. The first thing she said is that there isn't a woman who hasn't been sexually harrassed in this world so I shouldn't have to overthink it. I was shocked and told her just because it happens pretty often that doesn't normalize it and that doesn't make me feel any better. She strarted complaining about my sensitivity again. I was really hurt especially since she's the only person I shared this with and was really hard for me to open up about the issue. This wasn't the first time this happens but this was the most hurtful one.How do you guys think should I deal with it? Was I truly being oversensitive?",02Oct2019,1

421,"On mobile, sorry for any issues. 

I (35f) and my husband (37m) are conflicted about this situation, and would like some outside perspective. Husband's little sister (21) is attending a local college for nursing. She is in her final year of her 2nd attempt (she failed the first time), and is struggling. Part of her struggle is staying up late, failing to get to class, not making studying a priority, and hanging out with her friends. 

To be fair, there are also things that have happened beyond her control that aren't helping. She still lives with her parents, and right at the start of the school year, they moved further away from the college. So she was packing and moving when school started, and now it's more difficult for her to get there on time. Their home isn't the easiest place to study, as they currently have 4 dogs (2 are hers), and her 40+ half brother recently moved in, and has issues of his own. She deals with anxiety and the situation is very stressful.

She had asked us in the past if she could move in (no). We have a 9 month old baby, and we just don't want a permanent house guest for obvious reasons. Now that school has started, she's currently failing one class, and was told if she misses one more day of her early class they will fail her. It's not likely she will get a third chance if she fails again. So she asked if she could stay at our house on Sunday and Monday nights, so she is closer to school for her early class and so she can study. 

We agreed with some reservations and rules. No friends/boyfriend over, we are not responsible for making sure she gets up for class, and this is a temporary arrangement. This week was her first stay, and she spent  nost of the time just hanging out and playing with the baby instead of studying. Then she asked husband (her brother) when he gets up for work so he can make sure she's up, as they need to leave about the same time. Not a huge deal, but his schedule varies, and she can't depend on that. I stay at home with our son, and he is my alarm clock (and again, we aren't going to be held responsible for her getting out of bed). 

Monday morning, husband gets her up before work, but he was on call at the hospital Tuesday morning. My son didn't sleep well Monday night, and didn't wake up until after 7:30 Tuesday morning (this is also when I heard SIL rushing out the door). She has said that she doesn't have a problem getting up for work (she was working 1 day a week, but put in her notice to focus on school) it's just school she struggles with. To me that says it isn't important enough. Husband has tried to talk to her about going to bed at a reasonable time, staying off social media, treating school and studying like a job, finding places to study outside her home (library, Starbucks, etc). She seems receptive but little has changed. 

Tuesday she texts and asks if she can stay the night again because her stuff is here and it's easier for her to study. We reply that she can this time, but she needs a plan going forward so this doesn't become a habit. She says ""make what a habit?"". We feel like she is trying to push the limits of our agreement until she's almost living here. If she starts staying a third night, what happens when she has some other reason to stay another night? We are conflicted because we do want to help, but we're new parents and value our time together as husband works a lot. 

She was obviously upset when she came back to the house, barely spoke to us, got her stuff and left. We feel like we're trying to do her a favor, but when we try to stick to the agreement, we're the bad guys. So are we doing the right thing? Or should we be doing more to help her succeed?",02Oct2019,2
422,"Do I have a right to be annoyed? It’s not about the money. My coworker comes in 20 minutes late every day to work because she goes to dunkin- she use to go in the middle of the day at first and would ask me if I wanted anything. I would always offer to pay back- first time she wouldn’t accept money and the second time I gave her my card but I don’t know if she used it. I wouldn’t accept money from her either- it was an I’ll buy today you buy next time thing.

If ever do go in the middle of the day I must inform her because she is the manager here. I started going in the mornings too but it depends on traffic and when I leave so I must go at noon sometimes. Past week it was awkward when I told her I was going to DD and didn’t ask if she wanted anything- she had this offended look on her face. I must add I brought 5+ cups for her

Today she came in with TWO coffees to avoid going during the day i.e. to avoid buying me coffee. I’m wierded out that someone who makes at least double of me is like this. 

Do I stop buying her coffee and let her get used to the awkwardness of not offering her something? I might only be so annoyed because I hate my job and have been looking to leave since day1 LOL .. someone let me know.. thanks in advance!",02Oct2019,1

426,"Hey everyone, I need some advice.

This is my first time breaking up with someone and I need some advice as to what exactly you do prior and ""post-break up"". So, how exactly do you act?

I'm planning on breaking up with my boyfriend this weekend. I would've done it sooner, but he has a lot going on work-wise and I'd rather give him the weekend to recoup versus telling him during the week and leaving him an emotional wreck while at work. I want to be sensitive to his feelings, you know? 

I'm having to do it over the phone because I'll be on a family trip (my aunt is ill) and I won't be coming back until next next weekend and I honestly don't think I could keep this to myself by then and I don't think it's fair to keep stringing him along when I know what the ultimate outcome is going to be. 

We are, also, long distance by several hours.

I *do* plan on meeting with him when I get back to do a proper ""face-to-face"" conversation and to help him take things out of his apartment that is mine, but, due to our situation, I'm starting it as a phone call (and rather, he's the kind of person who would rather rip the bandaid off than wait it out). 

Frankly, I'm having a really hard time keeping it together. Whenever he sends me ""I love you!"" text messages, I feel really dishonest saying them back. So, how exactly do I act right now? Do I keep up the facade and then come out and tell him over the phone this weekend? Or?

And how do I act when I meet up with him in person? Do I sit there and be an ear to listen to his thoughts and hear them out for closure? When do you know it's time to leave? Should I hug him and comfort him while he's crying?

I just want to make sure I'm doing this right. This is my first time breaking up with someone and I want to be sensitive to his feelings. 

So - any advice?",02Oct2019,2
427,"Hey Reddit. On Monday, one of my best friends checked into a therapy/rehab center after a short battle with drinking. Sometime during the summer, he had a panic attack at my house and felt really out of place. He went home to relax and felt better the next day. These feelings quickly returned however, and became an almost constant issue. Elevated heart rate, cold-clammyness, feelings of anxiety. He's never displayed symptoms like this before, and it kind of came out of nowhere which has been really strange to deal with for our friend group. He turned to alcohol to help numb these episodes (while also attending therapy and taking heart rate medication and occasional doses of Xanax) and it became an everyday thing. He finally realized he needed help, went to the ER to detox, and then made the decision to go to rehab.  


He just checked into the rehab place and is on a strict ""no-contact"" policy for 3 weeks (which I think is complete bullshit). When he comes back, we are going to do our very best to be supportive and helpful with his road to recovery. Here's the thing though: he was never an ""alcoholic"" until these symptoms started to manifest. I'm not sure if he's going to keep on the sobriety train or not, but I have a feeling that if he comes back able to handle his episodes, he may want to drink again.  


So, the question is: if he asks for a drink, do I give him one? How do I approach this conversation with tact and respect? And perhaps on a separate note, how do I help him continue to recover from his anxiety and return to normal life?  


tl;dr - friend suddenly started having anxiety/panic attacks, turned to the drink, went to rehab. If he wants to drink after, do I let him? and how do I help him keep his anxiety in check?

Thanks a billion in advance.",02Oct2019,1

429,"Hi all.

My wife and I got married two years ago. Before we got married it was agreed upon that she wasn't going to take my last name and I would take hers. When we told our families, there were mixed feelings. Her father was happy because he has two daughters and no one to carry on the name. My parents, however, pitched a fit, and acted like I was abandoning them. My dad gave me the reverse talk, that since I'm an only child, no one will carry on the name. 

In the end, I backed down and let the six month window for an easy change lapse. And it's bothered me ever since. 

Just to throw it out there, this isn't the first time my parents dissented about me doing anything to be closer to my wife. They tell them they adore her and approve of our marriage, but they also gave me crap when I wanted to move out. 

For perspective, I never cared for my last name. Its ""Bullock"", and I always got crap from people about it. The worst was substitute teaching this past year and a kid made a big deal of it.

Anyway, I did the research on how to change my last name, and it's a lot of footwork I don't mind doing. But the question is how do I bring this up to anyone? Though out my life, if I had to do something like this, I typically just did it and dropped it in everyone's laps. For example, when my wife made plans to move to Florida in a few years, I didn't leave room for discussion when my parents gave me attitude over it.

But I don't really like doing that. 

If I change my name, should I just not tell them until I have to? Should I do like usual and just do it and shut them out? I just hate the thought of arguing with them over something like that.",02Oct2019,3
430,"I'm sorry if I sound cheesy or an idiot, I don't know how to express my emotions and myself properly. 

I was raised in a household were emotions were not dealt with or were actively forced to suppress since we had food on the table and a roof on our heads any dissent was dealt with shouting or a belt, which was common for my culture. Also signs of affection like talking about things we liked, hugging, cuddling , parents playing with us were non-existent in my house hold. This left me emotionally stunted and unable to deal with my emotions or when things get heated I would suppress myself in an attempt to avoid getting my parents in my business since that never ended well for me I would just shut down. I never acted out violently or have had violent tendencies when other people are involved and I stopped having any outbursts after I understood it was stupid and hurting me financially.

At around 22 maybe, I started understanding that the way I was dealing with things was not right and while reading stories or watching stories I would learn a thing or two and I was generally improving myself though at a snails pace. I had a  big break came when I was 26, I met a girl who was much younger then me but emotionally she was light years ahead of me, she shed some light on why I did certain things when I was younger, yes she was my first serious relation, we broke up a year later mutually. Now by this time thanks mostly to her I knew what I wanted and how to achieve this dream. 

Fast forward 2 years, I am not the same man I used to be and I am very close to start achieving what I want. I feel I am emotionally  more mature but I am also a mess. I have a trait of not letting things go and since I failed at a lot of things in my life I keep trying to make up for them even though it doesn't matter now. When I am alone and something reminds me of a past failure I feel like I want to cry and I know it's alright to cry and it makes you feel good, but I can't do it I don't feel safe. But I still can function.

3 days ago I watched ""The Shape of Voice"" and it just hit me like a ton of bricks, I re watched it the day after and the day after that found the written story and read it but it didn't give me closure.  I could identify a lot with it. 

\- Characters that couldn't express themselves, found themselves being bullied or becoming the bully.

\- Characters mother standing up for their child when they know they were not in the wrong and a mother/grandmother talking to her child trying to understand them.

\- Characters that got the chance and took action to make amends for their failures.

\- Characters that understood their flaws and work tirelessly to fix them. 

\- Also other small things but these are the main ones. 

&amp;#x200B;

Physical symptoms.

 \- Feeling a lump in my throat.

\- Physically hungry but little to no appetite for proper meals. Eating candy is fine though. 

\- Jumpy

\- Fatigued, yet I sleep regularly though at irregular hours. 

&amp;#x200B;

Mental symptoms

\- Unable to study and code.

\- Usually a calm driver, I catch myself becoming more aggressive. 

\- Not suicidal. 

&amp;#x200B;

This isn't the first time I read a story that I could identify with and in the past it made me better but I don't understand why I am so much unable to deal with my feelings so much now.

I plan on seeing a therapist in the future, but atm I am not able as I feel this would be more then a one session thing and I am unable to physically speak about these things without shutting down.  I used to be able to mediate and clear my thoughts but now I find it impossible.

So I need help, I can't function.",02Oct2019,1

435,"My boyfriend has been acting strange with me for the past two weeks. he’s been very short and dry in text messages and gets irritated with me pretty easily.I saw him twice last week, Once on Monday after not seeing him for a week or really communicating at all because his phone had broke. And Once on Thursday. and both days  he was on his phone the whole time and it felt like he was in his own world. I had a short conversation with him while we were hanging out and I brought up the distance I was feeling. He said that he didn’t feel anything different. 

I had noticed while he was on his phone there was a contact by the name of “ K” in his recent FaceTime calls, his ex girlfriends first name starts with a K, I asked him about it and he said that his sister is still friends with her and I know that to be true. He says that his sister talks to her on his phone so he saved her name so a random number wouldn’t show up. Sketchy explanation.. hes logged into his Facebook on my phone and the same day I noticed her name in his phone I saw he had added her on facebook?? again sketchy. 

He brought up to me that his grandmothers death anniversary and birthday are coming up in October and that he’s been very emotional about it. I know he was very close with his grandmother and he loved her very much. And I understand that, I don’t not believe that he is going through a hard time because of that but I feel he is not being 100% honest with me. He apologized for being snappy with me earlier in the day as-well. But day after day he was still acting just very distant. Friday comes and he’s not as distant he’s calling me baby again and is texting me seeing what I’m doing. 

Then on Saturday he was cold and distant again so I had asked him about his change in behavior another time because I truly felt that he wasn’t telling me something else. He then tells me that he needs space to try to figure out his life, he’s been stressing out about trying to get his GED and get a better job and that he feels stagnant in life. He brought up that I had asked him to hangout on Friday and that he felt like I was asking him to come see me everyday?? which didn’t make any sense to me because I usually see him about once a week maybe twice max and Im fine with that? I’m not needy he has a life away from me. I encourage him to hangout with his friends and family.  

I’ve been giving him space I haven’t been texting him through out the day unless he sends me one so I know he doesn’t mind a quick chat. Maybe one phone call at night for 5 mins to check in but that’s it. he says he doesn’t want to breakup and that things are fine between us but I can’t help but think there’s something else he’s not telling me it’s just a strange feeling that I have and I cannot shake it. He is not one to open up about how he feels so I never really know what’s going on with him until I ask him multiple times. I know he’s going through a rough time but the way he’s speaking to me he’s very dry and seems uninterested and I don’t know what to do. I really think he’s being distant towards me because he might be talking to his ex girlfriend again. I don’t want to accuse him of anything crazy but I can’t take feeling like I’m an inconvenience to him.

TLDR, my boyfriend is being distant with me and says there’s nothing wrong, he doesn’t want to break up. He says hes being distant because he’s going through a hard time due to his grandmothers death anniversary coming up and trying to sort out his life by trying to get a ged and finding a better job. But little things have come up that make me think he’s talking to his ex girlfriend again and that is what’s making him act strange.",02Oct2019,1

441,"I just started a new university course this term and we’re 3 classes into it. Since the start the teacher kept referring to a set of hand movements he does as the golden rule to answering all questions that come up on his exam, but he never explained what the hand movements were or what they meant. He brought them up again over the next two classes but still never explained them.


The last time he mentioned his hand movements he said that by now everyone should know what they are. Feeling out of the loop, I raised my hand and said that I didn’t. He proceeded to claim that I never focused and that I skipped class, both of which aren’t true. The only people in class who truly understand what he means are the ones that had a private tutoring session with him, which I hadn’t yet received. After class I went and asked if he would explain it to me but he again blamed me for not understanding and instructed me to ask a classmate. 


I’m frustrated because I completely understand the material. Frankly his reply was rude and unwarranted. I’m considering filing a formal complaint but I’m worried that he’s the secondary-head of the subject I’m taking.",02Oct2019,2
442,"So there’s this one teacher I really care for deeply , and I wrote him a mail (for the second time) to thank him for being my teacher. 

In my first email , that was 4 months ago, I sent him a digital drawing I made for him along with  the text “Thank you for being my teacher this year” written in the description.  He really made an impact on my life , and I really felt like thanking him for it. 

The next day or so, he came to me in person , searching me in the halls, and told me that he read my message and was very touched by it. I was very glad and thanked him for that.  I was very touched by what he told me, too. He then spoke with a teacher of mine ( I was entering class in that moment) and pointed to me and they both started smiling. 

I keep having him on my mind. He means a lot to me (to be honest, I care for him more than my parents, that are quite abusive ) , but not in a romantic kind of way ,under any means. I just.. think of him really often and admire him as a person , generally.

In the second mail, which I sent on the 26th of September (6 days ago) , this is what I wrote (keep in mind, I don’t have him as a teacher this year) :

«  For Mr . ***** ,

I sincerely am not used to writing proper emails.

This can seem weird to receive a mail from my part, especially since it’s for the second time, too, and I doubt terribly that this is not strange....

However, I wanted to write you this in my first email but I wasn’t brave enough to do so, and , now, I still think of thanking you because of it , yet still, I am very scared of your reaction , and I’m trying to write this in the best way possible....

I admire you a lot as a teacher , yet you also intimidate me in reason of that, and I still keep thinking of sending you this message because I would panic way too much, and my words would be very incomprehensible due to my fault , if I would try telling you this in person .

You are a teacher that inspires me more than any other individual, as you are someone very unique , I believe , which makes you a very memorable teacher..

Having the chance of being this happy and invested in class made me more grateful than ever , and you made me passionate about a subject without me realizing. Thank you.

With my greetings and thanks,

-Insert my name-

(Thanks again...!) »

....Yeah. I’m really embarrassed , now...

Before knowing that he read it (until, like, 20 minutes ago) I did get to talk to and greet him a couple of times , and  he did not seem weirded out at all with me. Actually, he did put slightly more effort into greeting me ( smiling , raising up his intonation a little and bowing his head  ) than others. He acted totally normal to me, so I really don’t know what to say.

Until now , after leaving music class ,  I went up to him after saying ‘Hello’ to ask him for something. This is how the conversation went like : 

“Hello Mr. ** ..!” 
“Hello there !”
“ Um, Sir, I was wondering .. did you...by any chance, read a message that I sent to you?”
“ Ah..yes , I read it , but I didn’t reply because I did not know what to say...I’m not sure what you expect from me to reply to it.”
“ Oh, no , it’s nothing at all ! I’m just extremely sorry !”
“ Sorry for what ? “
“ I was just really scared and felt really bad for what I have written , I’m really sorry ! “
“ You don’t have to bow like that (he made a joke that I bow like the Japanese and kept saying “Sumimasen! Sumimasen!” haha ) 
There’s nothing to be sorry for . There’s nothing to be scared for. Don’t worry about it. “ 
...And so he headed to his class.

Although the conversation may have been quite relieving in some way for me (he didn’t yell at me or anything)  , I feel extremely bad. Maybe he feels weirded out by me and only tried to be nice to me this time but he actually hates me. It’s my fault. Maybe.. I don’t know. I wonder what he thinks now.. he must be thinking I’m really strange. 

I keep thinking about this , and I’m not sure what to do or say.. 

I would really appreciate your help . I’m not sure  if it’s my fault ,  what I should do, if I creeped him out.. I just don’t know what to do. I’m sorry.",02Oct2019,7
443,"I hate when others interrupt me or suddenly try to scare me by tapping my head or shoulder. 

There should be rules for socializing and not unwritten stuff. If someone says I am their friend, that shouldn’t automatically mean they are my friend. I have criteria for everything including what a friend is and even if it is rude, you’re not my friend.

My way of thinking is not atypical, everyone else’s is. Small talk is pointless and asking how someone is. Just go straight to the subject.

446,"I don't know what to do. I know my problem, which is that I struggle with self-love, self-worth, and insecurities. And I've been trying all year to improve it. I've been taking time out to care for myself, trying not to be as hard on myself, caring less what other people think of me. I even took out a full month to fly to an outpatient depression clinic, and later, I moved out to be closer to my college.  
And I've been doing a lot better... until I'm not. I thought I was fine  minutes before I almost decided to end my life, which landed me in the hospital for a week and led to the depression clinic I mentioned. This past week, I am ashamed to admit that I've sought attention from my boyfriend through self-harm, which is not like me at all. I'm coming to terms with the fact that it was wrong, and manipulative and possibly the worst thing I've done in my life. And I'm very sorry for it.  
What I keep hearing through all of this is, ""Focus on yourself."" ""Give yourself love and attention so that you are not dependent on external factors for it"", ""Your worth must come from yourself, not others."" But I've been working hard to do that. I thought I was. I'm sure it must be true that I need to give myself more self-love and self-worth. But what more can I do? I've been meditating, practicing good hygiene, sticking to my routines reasonably well. I've been identifying cognitive distortions in my thinking, doing breathing exercises, exercising self-compassion. The only thing I can see that I would critique is that I've been telling myself that my feelings aren't valid and trying to ""mute"" them so I don't feel those feelings of insecurity. The thing is, the feelings aren't valid. My insecurity is irrational and making my life worse. And no matter what I do, I can't seem to convince myself that I am a good person or that I deserve my boyfriend. I feel like even though I've been trying really hard, that my quality as a person and the quality of my life, has only declined. I'm lost. All I want is a normal life. 

I would really appreciate any advice you have to give. I know that my attention-seeking behavior was wrong, and I spend a lot of time shaming myself for it, so please don't add on to that. Thank you so much!",02Oct2019,1

448,"I work for a small law firm. I was hired as a secretary, and then I applied for law school after working there for a few years. I continued working at that law firm during school, where my role transitioned from secretary work to doing research projects. They hired a secretary to do the work I used to do. Currently, there are two secretaries. 

Now I'm in my last year of law school, and they offered me a job when I graduate and pass the bar. My job is now basically attorney as they're training me to have a smooth transition. The attorneys have always been fantastic. They treat me with nothing but respect, and they don't ask me to do secretarial work.

Here is the problem. The secretary I used to work with as a secretary myself has me help her a LOT with the secretarial work. The most annoying to me is that she'll let the phone ring and ring because she knows I'll answer it if she lets it ring too long. This secretary primarily answers the phones because the other one is usually away from her desk. I used to answer it because I assumed she was in the middle of something (even though I am too!), but I've caught her browsing on her phone while I'm doing her fucking job. I've stopped answering the phone all together now.

Also, if there is any secretarial work relating to cases that I'm working on, the new secretary will automatically hand that to me for me to do. For example, if we get mail for a client I'm working on a project for, she'll just throw that mail on my desk for me to deal with. For the current attorneys, she goes through several steps before giving that mail to them. I think her thought process is that I know how to do those steps myself, therefore I should just do it for these cases instead of her. This might not sound like a big deal, but it really adds up, and it isn't just mail.

Lately I've been asking the new secretary if she could do the secretarial work for my cases too, and she will, but I have to ask her every time. I don't know if I'm in the right here. It's a small office, and it's understandable for the attorneys to help out the secretaries. But I feel like they should be asking me instead of the other way around. 

You can see it's a weird situation though, because I'm not an attorney and I DO know how to do this secretarial work. I should note that not all of the attorneys at this firm know how to do these things themselves, but the reason they don't is because they don't NEED to know how to do them. I'm nervous that this will continue when I become an attorney if I let them keep doing this, or if I should just suck it up even then because I'll be the lowest attorney on the totem pole. 

What do you think, reddit? Am I being too sensitive? Should I just wait and see what happens when I'm actually an attorney, or do something about this now other than what I'm currently doing?",02Oct2019,2

She is constantly nagging at everyone about every little thing. She is passive aggressive, and rude to multiple people, but they're all programmers and so many do not have the confidence to tell her to fuck off (or the business equivalent) so she's always getting her way. 

If she doesn't get her way, instead of speaking to you directly she will go immediately complain to your supervisor, their supervisor, and the fucking owner of the company. 

For example, we submit timesheets every other week. I admit that I am forgetful and do not always get it in on time, but instead of just saying ""Hey remember to do your timesheet"" she goes to my boss ""lmhx didn't do their timesheet again!""

She's the kind of person who will complain about you before you complain about them so that it looks like when you complain about them it's for revenge.

And we get to talking and we start flirting. So I ask him to hoco because we were flirting with each other and at this point I liked him. He's hot and nice and has a wonderful personality and is smart. So he said he needed sometime to think about it and I was like ight take your time and let me know. So Monday he suggested we played truth or dare but like more hardcore. So we did and he basically said that he wanted to cuddle me and kiss me and I was like same of course. And so Tuesday rolls around which was 17 days from hoco and I say hey not to be pushy or anything but I kinda need an answer and he tells me that he asked someone else before I asked him which is fair and they just said yes Tuesday. Well he never told me that and so I never had a back up plan. And he genuinely apologized to me and I kinda went off on him and then I apologized because that wasn't very fair of me. And I just wish this never happened and he told me when I asked him to hoco that he asked someone else already. And I am not very happy about the situation and I am low-key avoiding him in the halls and everything. But I don't know because I still want to date him but I'm also hurt.

454,"so, a little context, i hate my job right now, it's a call center job inbound where i'm treated like shit, yesterday was the first time i ended a call shaking because i was so nervous, in 3 years at this job i was never like that, the air conditioner is always fucked up, either you die with a cold or you're too hot, the technicians don't solve and a month ago i got sick because of it, i said my supervisor '' i think im gonna go home because my throat is really hurting ( i got medicine with him the day before ) and he said '' come on dude it's just pain on the throat, not a tumor! '' and i was shocked since he is the type of guy who skips work just because he's hangover or doesn't feel like working that day. i love him because he is my friend ( and we talked about what i did right now, the meaning of this post, and he understood me ) but i was hurt anyway.    
I'm 23 years old and have a full life, i'm '' losing '' myself here for the minimum wage ( 600 euros ).  


before being on inbound i was on outbound and since i was so sick of sales i asked the big boss to become a supervisor since it was a position in need, he told me right away that he couldn't because i need to do something inside the company called jump ( you can guess the company now ) and i didn't do it, and that it was a new supervisor coming already ( great guy, terrible worker ), so i don't have chances here to grow up on the company, since all supervisors didn't need to do the jump thing but i do, and i don't want to do it since the others didn't need too ( after that, some girl who's still on outbound was temporarily promoted to supervisor too and don't have the jump too ).  


besides all that, this is not what i want to do for life, at all.  


so, now that you're kinda informed about background, let me explain the cause of this post.  


yesterday i was 5 cm away from quiting this job. i swear, i was beyond nervous with this, and at night i promised myself if i felt like this one more time i would quit, if not because of that, i would quit until the end of the year, no excuses ( i still live with my family so money is not the biggest issue here since even tho i help on rent etc i still can save some money ).  


some days ago my supervisor signed us all to a course about the thing i work on ( the thing i don't want to spend my life doing ) and i was like '' okay cool, one more thing to add to my CV '' but eventually i forgot about it.  


today they called the team to another room to talk with us about it and to sign a paper to do it, which was okay by me, until he said the condition...  


the conditions were, if we do the course we would have to be in the company at least 1 more year and if we resigned we would have to pay the company the cost of the course ( 175 euros ), the course had a duration of some months, if i'm not wrong.  


i was looking at the paper and my head was rushing, i felt like if i signed it that i would be traping myself to this shit life i have right now, the same type of life i promised to '' end '' yesterday.  


so i looked my superiors in the eyes and said i appreciate the offer but it's a no for me.  


and i left, everyone signed but me.  


after i spoke with a co-worker and she was like '' please don't leave '' etc but i don't care, i'm done being here just because '' i love my friends ''. i can still love them out of here.  


and then my supervisor came to me to speak about it and i told him that, that is was not about the money but the feeling i would be trapped here and he understood, i hope.  


so, in your humble opinion, did i do the right choice? i'm always telling myself to be braver than i am to quit this brain-eating job but i can never push myself to do it, but i think that this decision was the beggining of something bigger in my life.  


what's your opinion on this?

Then later on campus I'm getting a bus from the gym and realise that I MIGHT see him and understand what I'm doing is not okay so I move away. I've since avoided my impulses to see him.

I mean, it was intentional that I got off the bus earlier than usual and I knew that I have to walk past his area. I think I was hoping to see him on all of those occasions. I was going home but I also was at that bus stop hoping to see him. Another occasion went to the bar with my friend because he sometimes goes there with his friends. Not cool, I know.

Worth noting, it's a leather couch. The cushions are VERY soft, so maybe that's all it is, the cushion where I've been sitting it just the only one that's gotten much use?

When he got clean, he perked up a lot- every time he spoke it had this energy that now seems to be missing (like it was when he was using last time). He's also got dark circles under his eyes all the time.

I know these seem small, but I can't shake the feeling. I know his current GF would NOT be okay with him using (she lost her brother to OD). But as my husband pointed out, we don't even know if she knows he was a user before they got together. I know he's with her all the time, and I'd like to think she'd see the signs, but addicts become very good at hiding things, and she works full time so there is plenty of time that they aren't together.

What do I do here? I really don't want him around the house if he's using (husband agrees to this) But how do I know he's using again? And should I talk to his GF about it? I don't really want to out his past, but I also feel like she has a right to know, and I'd like to know if she's seen any signs (she works as an intake counselor to rehab facilities so I feel like she'd very likely recognize it, UNLESS she doesnt know about his past, then the honeymoon stage may make her brush it off as something else).

461,"So I need some advice on wether I should drop out of university. 

Here’s some context:

I’m a first year student and I started my course (let’s call it “a”) about a week ago and so far I find my lectures boring and I already dread going to them + doing the assignments which I already have. Thing is I know that the course isn’t for me and I’ve known before even showing up to my first lectures. For months now I’ve been planning on switching courses (to course “b”) and universities and reapplying to study in 2020. Transferring courses within my current university wouldn’t be an option since they don’t offer course “b”.

I have considered taking a gap year previously yet I thought it would be best to just try out course “a” and stick it out for a year, and in the mean time work on my application for course “b”. I’m also 17 years old and will only turn 18 in about 6 months so I thought that I wouldn’t have many opportunities within a gap year.

But now that I’m actually here at university I feel as if I’m not ready for it at all and the course is worse than I thought it would be. I’m really not enjoying my time that much and I’m already struggling to find the time to focus on doing stuff which will be useful for my application next year. I’m just currently trying to juggle settling into my university and finding some friends, keeping up with the course work since if I stay for a year I can’t fail it and at the same time work on my application and do stuff which is useful for my future.

So right now I really feel as if I should just drop out and take a gap year and focus on figuring myself out (as cringe as that sounds). Also because I feel as if this year at university would also be a waste of money... I’m just worried that I’ll regret this decision and that I won’t be able to find anything to do during my gap year as a result of my age. (At the moment I haven’t got any concrete plans of what I’ll be doing in a gap year, I’m planning on finding a job, internships if that works out, volunteer, maybe get my drivers license and so on but nothing is planned out at all.)

We meet up and check out each other’s laptops both work completely fine. I told her specifically I’m not forcing her to do anything it’s her choice and it doesn’t matter to me. She agrees to trade, we shake hands and it ends there. A month later she messaged me that the MacBook broke and she needs her old one back. I decline and she is trying to argue that the issue was there prior to trading. What do I do ? I told her she’s out of luck it’s been a whole month.. anything I should keep in mind ?",02Oct2019,0

I seem to be lost and confused and completely unaware of what to expect or look for, prepare myself for etc for a career.  

I have been researching how to become a developer and learned that after a long time you can get a career being self taught.  But I have never thought about being one before and don't actively watch videos about it or research it much other than how to make it a career.  I don't know or don't think this is the right mind set before pursuing something.  I'm basically treating it like a get more money eventually option.  I have no particular interests or hobbies other than video games and hanging with my friend Emily.  Kind of just going with the wind at this point.

476,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. My aunt has become highly addicted to many drugs. Weed, pain killers, and numerous other drugs that we don’t know about because doctors can’t tell us that information without her permission. A little background on the situation: I, 19, live with my two (grand)parents, my aunt and my two cousins. They moved in about 4 years ago when my aunt hit rock bottom, not being able to support herself or her kids because of her addiction. Beforehand, they used to live in a really unsafe area in a shitty townhouse with my aunts now ex boyfriend (from what we believe). Her addiction began to start or get bad after her divorce which caused her to get this horrible way of life. She was always sleeping and when she wasn’t, she was out doing god knows what, leaving her two kids alone to take care of themselves (around 6 and 12 years old at the time). She rarely bought food for them, never had extra money to give for school stuff and was just never really around making my older cousin responsible for cooking and taking her little sister to school. At that time, my parents and I literally lived right down the street from them. Her boyfriend at that time was a huge enabler. We believe he is a big reason for her addiction. CPS has been called one or two times for the kids by neighbours because of the constant fighting between my aunt and her boyfriend. A case was obviously made and investigated but thankfully they never got taken away. At the same time though, if they were given to their dad, I feel like their quality of life would have been better and less traumatic. Police have also been called for domestic violence reports. My aunt and the bf were both in the wrong though, like lets be real. During this time, my parents and I moved out of the area. I can’t totally remember why but eventually it was crucial that my other family members renting the basement of the new house move out so that my aunt and my two cousins could move into the basement. At this point, we were already in a bad situation space wise meaning not enough bedrooms so one person was always stuck either with their bedroom set up in the living room or downstairs out in the open area. 


Anyways, over the years of them living here, my aunt has just ruined absolutely everything. My parents are in their 60’s now. It’s hard for them at this age to have this amount of stress on them everyday. To start, my aunt hasn’t been paying rent. I think we pay about $1800 in rent a month. My aunt is only obligated to pay $900. She makes $1000 a month just from her children’s fathers and she has a job waitressing which she constantly fucks up because SHES CONSTANTLY ON DRUGS. We also know she is getting money from the government for other things. I don’t know what exactly because I barely talk to her but supposedly, she is making a fair amount of money, presumably more than my parents do from working a shitty job with shitty pay and some old age money. But somehow, every month, she never manages to pay anything for rent. Not even like $200. I’m sorry but it’s absolutely fucking pathetic. She doesn’t pay for groceries (at least $400 a month) which her kids eat, my father is paying for one of her children’s phone bill, my mother does all the cooking and cleaning of the house because my aunt never bothers to or is just never home. She’s about 34 now but she acts like a teenager. She’ll constantly make new friends and after a month or so, she either drops them or has a fight with them from talking shit and then getting caught and then you never hear from them again. She had a great new boyfriend who was a hard worker, made good money, loyal, kind and caring and she dropped him as well after a month or two of dating. And trust me when i say this: there was absolutely no reason as to why she broke up with him. She just simply can’t keep anything good going for herself for selfish reasons ie: losing numerous jobs due to lying/laziness. She always complains about feeling tired, sick, in pain, her head hurts, her teeth hurt, her stomach hurts. And don’t even get me started on the constant sniffling. 24/7 you can hear her sniffling because of how long she has snorted drugs. Her nose is absolutely destroyed but we know for a fact she still continues to use. 

She never has any money. Ever. She could get her child money and it’d be gone in one or two days. And no, it’s not gas/car money, it’s not food or groceries or a phone bill. It’s drugs that shes buying. I could support that answer with many instances but one instance was recently when a “friend of hers” was selling a TV for $300. She kept nagging my mom to buy it off of him despite us not really even needing a TV. We believe he’s also a drug user or dealer and needs that money to pick some up for her. She has major mental issues like bipolar disorder, depression and anxiety obviously and she’s extremely manipulative. She lies and steals like crazy from everybody. Gift cards and money have gone “missing” many times. She also snoops in my parents rooms and probably mine as well looking for money or pain killers when we’re not home. My dad and mom take a few things for arthritis and other issues they deal with that are totally normal but they’ve learned over time to never leave anything they care about lying around or in drawers. Same thing with my cousins. Birthday money is hidden well because she has taken it many many times. 

I forgot to mention some important details: she overdosed twice in the past 2-3 years and the second time, her youngest daughter saw her and had to yell for help. She lived both times but because of confidentiality, the doctors weren’t permitted to tell us any information on it because she is an adult. We can’t force her to get help, she has to admit herself to rehab. We didn’t even get to find out what drug she overdosed on. We have found small baggies in her room so it could literally be anything. The funniest part: after she got out of the hospital, she had the audacity to tell my mom it wasn’t an overdose despite her seeing my aunt slouched off the toilet losing consciousness. 

Mainly my mom, me and my 16 year old cousin have started to get really tired of it. She goes out at weird hours of the day and if her kids are home, shes out. She never does anything with them. If they’re at their dads for the weekend, shes home. It’s like she doesn’t even want kids. Like I said, she’s a teenager in an adult body. No responsibilities. My parents have tried to talk to her about not paying rent or helping out with groceries but it never gets through her head. My mom has given up on it. And I try and tell her to keep asking but she says shes done with it. She told my dad to no longer complain to her about my aunt not paying because my dad also doesn’t do anything about it. He’s too soft to say anything because he still feels bad for her whenever she complains about her teeth or head hurting (even though the drugs are the literal reason she always feels like shit and even worse when she doesn’t get her fix for the day). My mother recently got some money from my very old grandfather (her dad) and she was keeping it secret because she doesn’t want to run out. My dad goes along and promises my aunt $700 to get a root canal. He doesn’t have that money so now my mom was responsible for paying for it. I said “why wouldn’t you just say no?!” She says “because dad promised her” and I sit there and just think why do you guys do this to yourself constantly. Stop letting her take advantage and fucking say something! Be mean! I don’t care if shes your daughter. She’s literally a horrible person! 

Im in need of serious advice. I’m sick of this way of living and at the sounds of it, my mom said she’d rather move out on her own. I’m 19, I know what I’m doing after college but I’m worried about my parents giving up on each other because of my stupid aunt. Theres so much more to the story but I don’t want to make it so long people don’t even bother. Please give me some type of advice even though Ive tried probably everything I personally can.",02Oct2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

Been in a little bit of a low spot this year, everything has just surfaced at once. Im 28 years old, still live with my father and brother. Havnt achieved a girlfriend ever. Never had a savings ( besides having a partime/fulltime job , part time at 32 hours to 40 a week)..... I always had to contribute to the house, so i could never save.. My question is, how can I start my life? what can i do to spark something to get my life going?

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a little context. Bullied all my life, elementary and highschool. My mom passed away half way through Highschool ( 17 years old) due to alcoholism... I managed to get a job at a grocery store, and eventually started receiving 4 to 5 days a week... So my time was pretty preoccupied in that dead end job, 12 years, 6 of them doing 5 days a week... Didnt really achieve any promotions,but i was just so stuck being comfortable and going through the motions of life...

&amp;#x200B;

Any how, now adays, I live with my father and brother who are both alcoholics. Ive been really wanting to move out, but dont know how to start/ what steps... etc. I dont drink , I smoke cannabis daily, maybe thats holding me back....

I feel lost,hopeless and soo stressed I dont enjoy/feel like doing anything now adays.. Not even Netflix, or gaming. . im just a shell.

Just want to break out and start life. and its really building up.

He openly talks about using a form of Oxycodone (don’t know exactly what it’s called) and Prozac. He says he takes them twice a day in the morning and at night.

489,"This has been going on for years, and I just don't know what to do. Some background: I am a very intelligent person, and I have high goals for myself in my future. I learn extremely fast, to the point where even in my TAG classes, I get bored many times because we aren't moving fast enough. Right now, I'm a Junior in high school, and I am currently taking all AP classes (AP calculus AB, AP physics, AP english 3, and APUSH). Aside from that, I also do many extracurricular activities, including competitive swim, orchestra (cello), DND club, Solar Car Club (look up solar car challenge for info), Boy Scouts (close to eagle). I have a lot on my plate, but I have enough time for everything. I also want to point out that I do have ADHD, and take meds for that, which has helped so much in many things.

Even though I can do the work itself, I just can't seem to make myself do it. It's not like I don't *want* to do it, but I can't find a way to motivate myself to do it, or just force myself to do it. I'll tell myself that I'm going to do my homework that night, but I never follow through. It's gotten so bad that right now, I have a 16 in physics because of missing work. A sixteen! And have the best test grades in the class! This stuff has been happening since I was in 6th or 7th grade, and has just gotten worse. I have tried so much for this, but nothing seems to work. I also just want to state that its almost never forgetting about said assignment, as I know full well I have said assignment, and know exactly when its due, but more rather i just don't do it, and I don't know why. We tried medicine, but that helped with focus, not actually getting the work done. We tried going to a therapist, who specialized in TAG students, and still had no effect! This also carries over to other things, like scouts, where the only thing I have left for eagle is merit badges. I've already done my eagle project! This'll also apply to some other smaller things. 

Now my parents know my level of intelligence, but know about everything else as well. As my dad put it, ""OP, you're the smartest person I know, and the stupidest person I know."" While I love them dearly, look up to them, they don't seem to understand what I'm going through. (Also just let me say that they are NOT abusive in any way) Whatever they do.just seems to make it worse. They take away video game priveldges, and it might work for a day or two, but I always end up where I was before, or even worse than before. They take away clubs, and the same thing happens. My mom thinks I'm just being defiant and purposely not doing it, saying that I think I'm ""above it,"" which for the most part, isn't true. I tried getting her to take me to a psychologist or a psychiatrist, but refused, telling me that it's all just baloney, as evidence of when she tried a therapist, when she took my brother to a therapist, and when she took me to a therapist (all for different reasons). Despite my doctor recommending a psychologist or psychiatrist, as they are quite different from talk therapists. 

At this point, I really am at a point of hopelessness, and I just don't know what to do anymore. I don't know whether it's something I'm doing, something my parents are doing, or something out of either of our control. I don't know if I'm depressed, or if its something to do with my ADHD or if its something to do with my meds. I just don't know where to go from here anymore. It just goes to show you that what you don't know *can* hurt you.",02Oct2019,1

Her family is aware i have anxiety and depression, and doesnt treat me any differently because it runs in their family.
Her sister very causally oversteps boundaries and has lead to multiple panic attacks on my end
I happen to be the young one in this situation, being 19, my fiancee 21, and her siblings 26 and 29. Her sister, 29, causally attempts to take food ive paid for without asking (just a ""what do you have? Well i need carbs"" while reaching in for something)
Ive had a severe contamination anxiety that has come from ocd and disordered eating on my end. My fiancee is the only person ive ever shared food with, for context of the extent of my anxiety. Ive had full fledged panic attacks because my siblinds have picked up my drink, and refused to drink any more because my anxiety makes it impossible.
The sister (in law? Idk) has overstepped boundaries, and stuck her very obviously greasy hand (we had just finished eating burgers and the grease shine was evident on her hand) into my mixed chocolates and taken many peices while commenting on how she ""loves that mystery chocolate"". I tried to brush it off until the second time she did it, and i explained to her later about my contamination anxiety and how severe it is. 
The main issue:
This morning i was looking for our clothes (me and the fiancee do loads of laundry together) and couldnt find them in the dryer. I looked on the couch and found them, hidden under some things, and i realized that while having a conversation with the sister in law earlier in the morning, she had her feet (with her dirt-caked  shoes)buried in our clothes).

At first I would slightly over-eat at dinner, but as things changed in my life it escalated into a bingeing every night. Things have gotten worse in the last month though. I stopped going to the gym ( I used to go 5 hrs a week) due to school commitments. I would binge more and more from the stress, and because I had stopped excising I was scared I was going to gain weight. I had the bright idea to purge (vomit everything back up after a binge) as a one of thing, and I promised never to eat that much again. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would uncontrollably binge the next night and purge again, and again and again. I now (and for the month leading up to this) stopped eating at day and would have a 2-4 hr binge at night resulting in me going to bed on an empty stomach after purging. To make matters worse, upon starting  a bulimic habit I've lost weight. Everyone compliments me, especially my mum. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not one person knows about my binge-purge cycle and ( no pun intended) it's making me sick seeing myself fall into this dark hole.

Because of it I dont really have much friends or have much a desire to make them because I'm afraid of hurting them. I even deleted all my social media platforms because I dont want to suddenly fly off the handle at some poor unsuspecting person. 

How can I work on fixing this? I feel like I might just have temper problems but it might be difficult to overcome since it happens very suddenly. Thanks for any advice in advance.",02Oct2019,1

Over the summer I had to switch from working part time at a job I loved to working full time at a job that's overall a good job but I don't love it. Im having a hard time focusing on school because I'm always so exhausted when I get home at the end of the day. I cant bring myself to do school work outside of class. And I hate getting home late because of all the things I now have to do after work since my job is M-F, 8-5. 
I know my job now is not going to let me cut back to part time and I really dont need to because I have bills to pay. In previous semesters I was able to go to counseling at school due to me working part time, whuched helped me with a lot of issues. Now I'm not able to and I cant afford to see a therapist that isnt offered by the school. Any advice on ways to help balance this and help me focus on school more?

Some days he brings home live, mutilated mice and I'm at lost of what to do. I have nursed/ released them but some are so heavily mutilated there is no chance of survival.

501,"I am applying to a science entrepreneurial fellowship based out of California where they provide 100k in funding plus salary and benefits for me to develop a technology with the premise that I'd then go on to turn my development into a business.  If accepted, this would be a once in a lifetime opportunity for me to become a business owner of my own technology.

The problem is I currently coparent my almost 7yo son in an every other week schedule.  I absolutely adore my son and always look forward to my weeks with him and he does the same.  I can't fathom the concept of moving away for 2 years and giving up my half of custody for that long, but am I exaggerating this?  Is this comparable to fathers that are deployed overseas?  I feel really selfish for even applying and don't know what I'd do if I actually get accepted, which I stand a very high chance of achieving.  

The program comes with a 12k travel budget so I could fly home frequently to see him, but it'd be a sliver of our current amount of time we get to spend together.  Plus I'd be asking my ex to take on full custody for 2 years.  This always feels like a huge ask, but I do think he'd understand the rarity of the opportunity and the potential advantage it would bring to his son.

502,"I attended a job interview yesterday. It went really well and was told that I'd find out by phone call either that day or the following day whether I was successful, as the starting date would be tomorrow (3/10)

As the manager and I were walking out of the interview room, he was full of smiles and said ""I shouldn't be saying this but I think you're going to fit in really well here""

Obviously I was taken aback as I know that he still had candidates to see, but this comment left me with a lot of hope. 

I haven't received any calls today, so I called the company and enquired with the receptionist as she said the manager wasn't available. She literally told me ""I think the positions been filled, if you haven't received a phone call then you obviously didn't get it"" 

Am I right in feeling quite annoyed by this? To have my hopes raised by the manager, and to not receive any contact to let me know I was unsuccessful?

507,"So, I'm in my 10th grade year of high school and we recently had our homecoming, which alot of people enjoyed (but some didn't). And because I'm in SGA (Class Treasurer) people came to me and said that maybe we should set up a spring or winter dance. However this has been suggested previously but was always denied, but people never really pushed for it because they couldn't get SGA really on board and just lack of real effort. But I would really like since so many people want another dance (most other schools near us have more than one) I want to get the idea hyped and try to start something up, but I dont know where to begin. I really think people would love it, but I'm not sure how to make a compelling reason why, other than it would raise money for the school and would be really enjoyable.

Our school does only one all-inclusive dance which is homecoming, in the fall. Then we have senior prom in the spring. So I want to set up at least one more dance for the entire school, i know it's a big leap and will take a lot of work to set up, but I could really use some advice on how to push this forward and do something nice for my school community. [I did get my 10th grade class president on board but I still need to talk to the rest of my class officers].

509,"I made a friend (or so I thought) just a few weeks ago at the beginning of this semester of college. However, I noticed my ""friend"" starting at me quite often but in a creepy way if that makes sense, the way he stared just made me feel uncomfortable. Soon he insists on hanging out more and getting my phone number, I declined because I don't give my phone number away to anyone really and I'm paronied that someone will end up stalking me. I did however feel sort of guilty for not giving him my phone number and gave him my Facebook so we can message on there (I never post anything on facebook and I only have it to use messenger).

 The reason I felt guilty is because part of me wanted to believe that he really just wanted to be my friend and nothing else. The same day after I give him my facebook he starts messaging me and he texts sort of flirty, I ignore his flirtations and try to give him direct questions to his answers. Feeling uncomfortable by him still flirting, I lie and bring up that I'm dating someone. I didn't know what else to do and hoped that telling him that I'm dating someone would make him leave me alone. He does admit that he wanted to ask me out and complains how he's such a nice guy and every girl he likes rejects him. When I see him in class I still sometimes see him staring at me and it's making me really uncomfortable. Yesterday, after I got out early from a class, I sat down to do some work and he randomly came up to me when I didn't even know he was there just to tell me something about another class we have together (we have 2 classes together). 

I'm really uncomfortable around him but I don't know how to express that or if I should even express that. I want to cut ties with him but he's in 2 of my classes, and he sits next to me in one and I can't move seats because they are assigned seats. What do I do? Do I express to him that he makes me uncomfortable? Do I just suck it up and remain friendly until this semester ends? Should I remove him from facebook after the semester ends and give him an explanation why or just remove him with no explanation?",02Oct2019,1

I didn’t think to much of it at first because it could have been a family member stopping by to pick up something. I thought enough of it however to ask my parents if someone was suppose to come to the house that day and they said no. We called everyone who knew our garage code and everyone said it wasn’t them. Nothing seemed to be taken or moved around so I let it go. 2 weeks later I noticed it again. Then 1 and a half weeks after that I noticed that my review mirror inside of my car was pointed completely down and to the side towards the passenger seat. It’s not lose and you have to grab it to move it and by the amount of force needed I can tell that it wasn’t just simply bumped. I had went a few places in my car that morning so I knew it had to of been moved within a span of a few hours between running errands and then when I got back in my car to go somewhere else. In that time period my garage door was closed and I was inside showering, doing laundry, eating lunch etc. I had spare cash, my wallet, and my keys in my car but nothing was taken.

512,"Hello, I wanted your help/advice on a matter that has been bringing some fights into our household. I have a room, like many other my age; a bed, like many other people my age; but for some reason I can’t get an ounce of bloody privacy.  I ask my mother not to come into my room while I’m in (and out) of the house, not because I’m scared she’ll find something, nor is it because I’m trying to push her away. I consider my room, MY area; a place where I can have my world without any annoyances. My bed is one of the most precious things I own, for it is an escape of the troubles of life. Many MANY times, my mother comes into my room (whether I’m in my bed or not) and sleeps there. Whenever I’m sleeping and she comes, it’s always the same ending; I get progressively more frustrated with her and ask her WAY too many times to leave my bed. I’m bloody 17 for god sake, I don’t need her or wish her im my bed. When I’m out ( which was the case today), she simply came and installed herself in my bed, took a pillow of mine and slept. For some it might not be the end of the world, but let me give you some background; I ABSOLUTELY, most definitely, most affirmatively, hate sharing stuff with people. I do not eat with the same fork, spoon or whatever, if someone has eaten with it. I do NOT share my pillows, where the head rests, nor do I share drinks and the like. I even disinfect the toilet seat before I use it (at home). 

So EVERY single time, I get angry, and the more often it happens, the quicker I lose my temper. I don’t shout, but apparently I make faces, which seems to be enough to make my mother scream at me like IM the bad one. Oh...I’m sorry, I’m not the one INVADING SOMETIMES PERSONAL SPACE. Nothing beats coming into my bed while I’m sleeping, this is like breaking a store window in front of a cop, they ARE going to notice. Since it’s always when I’m asleep, I get woken up and after that happens, because I have to fight with her, I can’t go back to sleep.

516,"This is probably gonna be more humorous than anything else, but I’d really like some help. I grew up in a small town but went to a bigger town to go to school. Not even a city. A larger town. 

I have no idea how crosswalks work. In my small town, we just jaywalk everywhere since there are no crosswalks. If there’s someone in the crosswalk or close to it, I just let them pass, but I don’t know if I’m doing it right. And don’t get me started on walking through one of them. If I’m on the other side of the street from a crosswalk and there’s none on my side, do I have to cross the street via another crosswalk so I can cross at the crosswalk?

Why do some stoplights have that blinking number? Why do some not? Why do some elevators open from both sides? Apparently lesbians think I’m pretty attractive, which is something I’ve never dealt with. Do I act the same as if they were a guy and I wasn’t interested? That sounds rather insensitive and I don’t want to be unnecessarily mean without meaning to. What about racial minorities? I’ve never come into constant contact with so many people who aren’t Caucasian. What if I’m racist and I don’t even mean to be? That’d suck.

519,"I have a tendency to drone on so I'll try to make this short. Over the past couple years (yes it was at the election), there has been a widening gap between myself and my parents, primarily my mother whom I am admittedly closer with. She is actually the reason I have quit Facebook because I was tired of seeing her and her friends post disparaging comments about causes I believe in. Although this has helped our relationship, I still hear about some issues from my sister, whom is much more like me on social issues, and it greatly troubles me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have 2 children and plan to have more with my wife, and all of my parents (mom, dad, and step-mom) are wonderful with them. Our children love it when they come out and we always have a great time when any of them come out. Politics, race, sexuality is never brought up and if I could verify that it would stay like that, I wouldn't have an issue. But it's going to happen, my children will get older, they are going to get curious, and if my oldest is any indication, she will listen to a lot of what my mother says and I don't want her to.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not here to argue politics, but I and my wife are super liberal and my parents are diving further into the conservative mindset, which includes conspiracy theories against Trump, climate change, and both are very vocal (in their lives outside of my family) about being against gay rights (my mother is more of the ""I don't want to hear or talk about them"" but is also very anti-trans). I dread wondering their opinions of racial topics, although they have either mellowed out or have stayed silent since marrying my black wife (parents have never said anything outrightly racist about anybody, but my mother has stated ""I love (my wife) so much that I don't even see her as black or white"" and I have talked to her at length why that's not an appropriate thing to say but she insists she doesn't mean anything negative by it, in addition to her mentioning how she thinks Affirmative Action only serves to hire lazy and untalented people).

&amp;#x200B;

I struggle constantly with the idea of confronting them about it, but until now we've all been at a truce, with neither side bringing up topics that could potentially lead to arguments out of an outspoken respect for the others opinion. But, and I admit, I am finding myself respecting their opinions less and less and am worried how they will influence my children in the future. My wife is of the belief that we should just take each day at a time and readjust as necessary, but she too is bothered by their lack of empathy to others (because that what it is), and while I agree with her for the most part, I worry about our children.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I just need to know if a conversation with my parents is appropriate at this time, or, because it's never been an issue to the family as a whole in the past, to just take each day as is? Because at the end of the day, they love me and my wife and ADORE their grandchildren, they've never said anything hateful about anyone while in our presence, and despite their political differences, there are aspects of all three of them I would kill for my children to have.

To be clear: He hasn't done anything abusive or illegal or anything. If I fuck up (99% of the time it's schoolwork) all he'll do is yell at me.

I'm so scared that he'll yell at me that I never tell him anything, even good things. This ends up with me getting in more trouble because I didn't say anything. Alternatively I'll impulsively lie about stupid things, like saying I've finished homework when I haven't or lying about where I am even though I know he'll be fine with it.

I'll hide stuff from my mom too, even though she doesn't yell ever. It's just second nature.

523,"So the obvious answer is “yes you’ll regret it if you don’t, what’s the worst that could happen, she can’t say yes if you don’t ask” but it’s a bit more complicated than that. 

See I’ve had a crush on her since December of last year. She’s given me many signs since then that she could be interested in me, both on purpose by seeking to want to get close to me, spending a lot of time with me, dirty jokes, sometimes even some flirting and psychology stuff like dilating pupils and body language, voice pitch, looking at me when she laughs and laughing harder etc. 

So I would ask her out, but she’s got a boyfriend, and I strongly believe it’s kind of a terrible thing to do to make a move on someone in a relationship. So I’ve been trying to get over her but I’m just too in love, it’s at a crappy Hollywood romcom movie level, she just has every attractive trait that I like, and has none of my turn offs. And then and then and then, I really genuinely care about her, when she’s down I start to feel worse than, when she’s happy I light up. Which is even more reason that I don’t want to make a move because her happiness is more important to me than how far we can go together. 

So, since I was having so much trouble getting over her, I had the idea of getting it off my chest; telling her how I feel and saying that I don’t expect anything to come out of it, I just needed it said, and that I won’t make it awkward if she doesn’t. And this is terrible but a part of me is hoping something will come out of it.

I'm referring to living a life where if anyone in the world found out you do a certain thing, you wouldn't be anxiously trying to hide that fact. For example, the media finds out you sit backwards on a toilet seat and instead of trying to downplay the fact, you own up to it because you're living up to a set of values you have defined for yourself.

A less comical example would be, being comfortable with the fact that your mom knows you watch porn, she's visibly not in favor of that because of her religious background but you own up to the fact and respectfully disagree with her because you didn't break any rule from your personal book of morals.

Basically, boiling it down, ""If you've got nothing to hide, you've got nothing to fear, ***but*** maybe other people do so don't take away their rights to privacy.""

So last week I was talking to my coworker about this guy I used to have a crush on but now think of like a really good friend. It was going fine and I was talking through it until my other coworker walked by as I said 

“I love him but not like that and I’m pretty sure he doesn’t really consider us friends, you know?”

To which my coworker said “oh he loves you! Right,(random coworker walking by)?”

541," 

So, there are a handful of scenarios that I have from when I was a kid that happened between me and my mom. I'm having a really hard time trying to decide if this is actual CSA or not, and maybe I'm just reading to much in to it.

1.) I'm not sure how old I was but my mom used to kiss me all over my face and neck, it'd leave a tingly feeling in my stomach, essentially butterflies, she did this multiple times. I don't ever remember telling her to stop though.

2.) I remember one time I either had a UTI or something as a kid, and that area was really irritated, and she blew on it to essentially bring the irritation down. I remember feeling really uncomfortable

3.) She would constantly walk around the house naked, and come in to my room when I was changing, we had no privacy.

4.) She always demanded that I kiss her on the lips whenever we hugged each other, her reasoning was ""because I'm your mother"" it still is this way

5.) She slept in bed with me for years because I couldn't fall asleep, I also would go in to her bed when I had nightmares and I distinctly remember her only having a nightgown on and her bottom being exposed.

6.) When I hit preteen age and started to get my period I remember her showing me how to put in a tampon on herself, and I wouldn't put it past her that she actually put my tampon in for me.

Any advice would be great, because I have massive memory gaps in my childhood except for these memories, so i'm not exactly sure if this is what I was blocking out all those years or not because once I started focusing on the idea that I could've been SA then these memories came back. I also have all the classic signs, bed wetting, lack of intimacy with partners, uncomfortable with contact, lack of willingness to be feminine, hatred of my body, etc.

My aunt was living with my grandmother. Because of that my mom wanted her sister to stay with us. 

My aunt didn't come for a year and started coming this year. She has been with us more than a month and my dad is always telling my mom for her to leave.

Also there was another unneed fight between my mom and my uncles. They swore to eachothers on phone so my dad told the people at the door (I don't know what it is in English. ) to never let them come in.

Today, my uncle drove her to our house. Their fight was maybe the biggest one after my dad tried to cheat.

My dad is saying how he will move out and leave. My mom is implying that he is cheating again.

548,"To preface this, I am a 20-year-old female. I attend one of the biggest schools in my state and my major is Telecommunications with a minor in Cybersecurity. 

I am so unhappy. I don't feel anything. 

I went to a different school during my first semester freshman year of college, then left that one to attend a community college in my hometown. After about a year there, I left to attend the school I am at currently. I have been at this school for about 10 months now. Everything was going fine, I had a great part-time job that fit into my schedule, a pretty solid schedule for classes (except that one darn 7 pm lab!) and an okay social life because a lot of my close friends in high school go to this school. Though, my social life is not perfect. I've never even had a boyfriend, or let's be real, one even closely resembling one. I don't take risks, I don't let loose and make stupid mistakes. I don't really have anything interesting or fun to show for my life. But, overall, everything was going as well as it could be going. I knew I didn't get excited or feel much in general, but I thought I could stomach it until I graduated. How long can a person go without feeling much of anything without having a complete and utter self-implosion? 

I don't even know why I am in school honestly. I have absolutely no passions in life. I have tried so many different things from film studies, business, computer science, and now telecommunications. I hated high school and learning, but it was always expected of me to move onto college once I finished high school. My mom always tells me ""You can do whatever you want, just get your degree first."" 

So I've been in school for 2 years now, and I just learned I still have 3 more to go before I am able to graduate. 3 years is such a long time to be unhappy. I could try to take more classes, but that would make life even more miserable as I would have even less time to do things I want to do. 

The way I see it, I have two options at this point: 

1. Stay in school. Spend three and a half more years feeling nothing, not having time to do anything that makes me happy (besides getting high at the end of my day, the only release I feel I have anymore), and ending it all with a degree I'm not even interested in or passionate about. The only thing that makes me want to stay here is the (not even promised) idea that I'll get good money and finally have the time to spend it on things I actually care about (which I don't even know what that is). 
2. I could leave school, disappointing my family and wasting the advantages I have to go to school in the first place. Though, when I think about leaving this fucking state, just getting an entry-level job, and just living life without having to invest so much time into things I couldn't give less of a shit about, I don't know how I feel. Wouldn't I be screwing myself out of a better future? Will I regret this down the line? Will I have lost my shot at being the best I can be? 

So, in conclusion, I am utterly and completely lost. What are you suppose to do when the only ambition you have in life is to be happy?",02Oct2019,1

I live in US-MD with an unmedicated disturbed guy. Lives in the living room (center of the house). Hes always laughing alone (usually excessively loudly to the point were I cant sleep). Sometimes he gets hostile (or violent, though rarely; had to fist fight him once). Has erratic behavior online (says lewd stuff on Facebook or stalks people) He tends to go on trips, probably to stalk people (specificallywent to Florida once and literally went to the house of stranger that he met on Facebook). Spends lots of money on schemes (buys a sewing machine to make clothes, gets expensive instruments to start a band, takes out loans). Tends to jack off too. Parents want him to move, but whenever he decides to leave, they basically won't let him go. Privately, they'll confide in me their feelings about the situation, which is to say they're sick of this crap. Recently he said he was ready to move, but of course it wasn't to a shelter or apartment, rather to a boat. They refused to let him go. Basically any time he wants to leave, they fight about it.

But I feel like he should leave and I keep telling them that. They agree he should go, after he gets help from a doctor. He, however is not comfortable about seeking help (in denial about being sick). He'll fight you over going to a psych doctor, believe me police had to get involved once. His psychosis is disrupting my productivity; my sleeping is off, can't focus on school.

571,"Hey everyone :)

I just finished university and I'm super anxious about life right now. I don't know if I'll get a job that pays moderately well or if I'll end up in retail or without a job at all. 

I'm still really anxious because of my last exams that I took in late July, I just can't rest because I don't know which way my life will turn. I used to love treating myself (food, clothes, luxury makeup etc), but now I try to save every penny possible in case I won't find a job.

I still need to turn in a short written assignment and I can't get my actual diploma until then. I originally wanted to turn it in now, but then realized that I won't be able to continue working in my job if I'm not a student anymore (it's a specific contract for students). If I don't hand in the assignment, I'll be able to work there until April, which gives me much more time to look for a proper job. I'll talk to my supervisor to see if I can get a regular 6-month contract instead (so I can finally get my actual diploma). It is a well paying job that I won't be able to replace. I just feel really stressed and uncertain about the future.

I live in a place where the percentage of people without jobs is low (3%) and the place is an industrial hub in general, I just feel like there might not be a job for ME. 

I currently live in a huge room in my parents house (basically a studio apartment with a bathroom, kitchenette etc) so I'm not even pressed to pay rent or anything like that. I'm just super super tense and anxious and I don't really know what to do about it.

574,"TL;DR:

* How do I stop being envious of the accomplishments of my peers?
* How do I stop making careless errors in mathematics and physics?

I don't think I've ever considered myself stupid in the past, but recent events have called this assumption into question. I'm still in high school and have recently completed my ordinary level examinations and have graduated to my advanced subsidiary / advanced levels.

I guess my insecurity began during my ordinary levels, particularly with math and biology. In math, I'd constantly make careless errors despite the fact that I'd checked my answers twice and sometimes thrice over. I'd complete the test paper thinking I'd cover all my grounds using all the time allotted to me, and then receive the graded paper next lesson, utterly gobsmacked that I'd forgot to change signs or thought 3 \* 2 = 9, or something equally stupid. 

Its incredibly frustrating since I didn't remember making the mistake. It felt like another me did it and the real me was being punished for it. I have no problem understanding the concepts, except for these almost minuscule mistakes that lead me down the wrong track and prevent me from finishing the problem.

My problem with biology was the fact that I could never decipher what the examiner wanted me to say. A relatively open-ended question was posed and I had to figure out which points were on the mark scheme, and almost always I'd end up dropping a point or two because I'd forgot to mention a specific point or end up bungling the whole question because I'd gone into a completely different vein than the question wanted me to. Once again, I have very little trouble understanding the concepts that were taught to me.

What made this especially frustrating was my friend, who seemingly wrote answers exactly to the past exam board mark scheme that was given to us after doing the past papers in class. I tried to improve and to acquire a sense for what the question meant (to that end, I pored over past mark schemes and examiner reports) but nothing really seemed to help.

These days, I've been accepted into an advanced mathematics course and it feels like i'm barely treading water. My aforementioned friend and one other peer appear to be human calculators, deciphering problems and the routes to their solutions in less than a minute and solving complex algebraic expressions with absolutely 0 errors, whereas I'm about 5 questions behind still not able to find the minus sign I've forgotten to change, preventing me from progressing forward. I've wasted upwards of 15 minutes searching for what was wrong with my method, only to start from scratch all over and then get it right. If I do this in the actual exam, I'm dead.

In physics, the friend is able to pinpoint experimental error, pick up on subtleties in wordings of the question that lead him to the answer and find the most direct route to the answer almost instantaneously, whereas I'm left in the dust still weighing options. To improve here, I've tried to expand my reading on physics, reading up on and solving different problems from a wide variety of textbooks and resources outside of our curriculum. I've not seen any tangible results yet, but I'm still going to persist.

On top of this, I come from an Asian society which staunchly places their faith in extracurricular classes outside of those offered by the school. My parents force me to go for one class (which can have up to two lessons per week, each 2 hours long) for every subject I take. All but one of these classes I feel just parrot back the syllabus to me, just a different teacher. Consequently, when I return home, I'm too tired to continue exploring the subjects on my own, which I feel would help me understand more than these classes would. My parents won't listen.

At this point, I'm ready to chalk it up to genetics and just accept the fact that I won't ever be intelligent enough to appreciate the intricacies of math and physics, and won't ever have the satisfaction of pursuing an interest that I'm intelligent enough to be proficient in.

I'll never be able to live up to expectations with them setting the benchmark of high achievement.""",02Oct2019,1
575,"Some context:

&amp;#x200B;

When my sister and I were in high school she suffered from anorexia. For a long time she wouldn't eat anything except salsa and carrots. As we grew older she overcame this and began to eat normally again. We're in our early 20s now.

&amp;#x200B;

The last two years her and I have lived together and during this time I noticed she began to gain weight.  One day while grocery shopping with her she asked me if she was getting fat. I admitted to her that I did think she was gaining weight.   

&amp;#x200B;

She thanks me for telling her. She had a trip to Vegas coming up and she wanted to look good for the pictures (she also got engaged on this trip.)

&amp;#x200B;

I had already been meal prepping and working out 4+ times a week for longer than I can remember at this point. I invite her to join me.

&amp;#x200B;

Her and I began to meal prep together every week.  I wanted to track our progress for weight loss but she was too scared to step on the scale. Instead of weighing ourselves, her and I agreed to do measurements instead. We did this for around 3 months.

&amp;#x200B;

Then my sister and her fiance moved out.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to the present about 3 months later. She's gained so much weight that she absolutely will not fit in her wedding dress. She can't return the dress and she spent over $1000 on it.

&amp;#x200B;

If she doesn't fit in her wedding dress she will be devastated. I know this because she was extremely excited when she bought it. She'd took tons of pictures of her in it and loved to show them to friends and family.

&amp;#x200B;

The rest of my family has noticed that she has gained weight and agree with my concerns.

**TLDR:**

**My sister who suffered from anorexia is getting married in a little under a year. She's gained too much weight to fit in her wedding dress. Should I confront her?**",02Oct2019,1
576,"Hey y’all
Just a young dumbass guy that has a serious question. Whilst having sex with my gf, condom broke and obviously didn’t notice. She’s on the pill and its her last day... How fucked am I?",02Oct2019,0
577,"Here’s some background. Me and my sister had a crazy life with crazy meth addicted parents. We lived with our mom most of our lives and I had to help raise the kids while she wasn’t around but before my mom dipped to a whole new state to get a whole new life about a year ago (she literally just had another kid &amp; married some guy she just met) she dropped my sister off in a children’s home. My sister eventually got kicked out &amp; was defaulted to my dads custody. I got her out of that situation because he isn’t fit to raise her either and brought her into me and my girlfriends townhome that we just moved into after just living inside a trailer. Things were great at first, my sister was safe and away from bad influences. Until this past month or so. Before I get into that, let me just tell you my 13 year old sister has the looks/mentality of a 16+ year old and has a current “body count” of 10. Yes. She has been with 10 different guys. And yes, most of them older than 18. Because guys her age just aren’t mature &amp; “big” enough for her. But she betrayed us beyond a point even fathomable because she’s some horny teenager that had too much free time. While she was with us for these 6 months she’s been out of school until about a week ago when I finally had to drag my dad to get her into school. But then a couple days ago I feel the need to snoop through my sisters phone while she left the room. I did and only in a quick amount of time I found 2 videos of this naked guy in her fucking room in my fucking house. We eventually confronted her and see what she’d admit to but all we got was her not remembering how many times this fuck face was over and that she also brought 2 other guys over for threesomes on 2 separate occasions with her and the guy from the videos. We then figured out, not by her honesty but because we took her devices away we discovered in her deleted pics she was asking the main motherfucker to come over pretty much EVERY fucking night while me and my girlfriend were asleep in the next room. She not only was fucking them in her room but in our garage where my girlfriend spends a good amount of time because that’s where she likes to smoke her cigarettes. We know the name of the main guy she was having over and one of the threesome buddies. And we are planning on turning to the cops for those 2 so they can throw their asses in jail. I have no idea how to feel because I brought her in only to help her and she totally took advantage of that. As for my girlfriend.. she can’t even look at her. She wants her gone or my girlfriend is leaving. My sister physically makes my girlfriend sick to her stomach. I understand everything my girlfriend is feeling and I don’t know what the fuck to do. My house is the best place for my sister but if she’s gonna betray us and keep telling us lie after lie why would I have her stay with me? My girlfriend is my soulmate and my sister is family. My sister has always been troubled and I honestly don’t know how to handle this situation. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",02Oct2019,2
578,"After my first rollercoaster relationship we decided to call it quits and I accepted it and got on with my life. I see him all around campus and sometimes he talks to me. Before talking to me he unfriended me on Facebook so I just got on with my life. However afterwards, a couple of days later, I accidentally like one of his tweets one evening, and he deactivated the account. And I only realised this after two or so months. Then on his birthday weekend I on two occasions get off the bus early from uni to my house and his area is along the way to my place. Then later on campus I'm getting a bus from the gym and realise that I MIGHT see him and understand what I'm doing is not okay so I move away. I've since avoided my impulses to see him.

I mean, it was intentional that I got off the bus earlier than usual and I knew that I have to walk past his area. I think I was hoping to see him on all of those occasions. I was going home but I also was at that bus stop hoping to see him. Another occasion went to the bar with my friend because he sometimes goes there with his friends. Not cool, I know.

What if he saw me? What if I ruined his day?I feel SO GUILTY. I feel like dying. I know what I did isn’t okay, but I just need some help. I’m sick to my stomach. I'd appreciate your input as my friends, therapist and family keep on saying I'm NOT a stalker but I just can't get out of this spiral.

579,"TL;DR: I like girls but recently I get uncomfortable when they like me. I wish I didn’t have sex and it bugs me weirdly a lot that I have. Am I being a pussy about this?

18m I have a weird problem that I’ve never met anyone else with. I’ve always been straight, I like girls, when I fantasize it’s about girls. I’m not questioning that. But I HATE sex. Or even real flirting or touching. When I was younger I wanted to get a girlfriend, and I was on the wrestling team in HS so as I got older and more athletic, girls started to like me. This was cool, I liked it, I chose one I liked and dated her. Everything normal so far right? 

So she comes to my house and wants to have sex, but I get uncomfortable and say no. This happens again and I say “uh my moms coming home soon, let’s go out somewhere”. And then the third time it happened I said no, and she stayed over cuz it was late. Later that night I did it. And I want to clarify, I WAS attracted to her. She was pretty, and I liked her. I didn’t think much of it at the time, and we kept doing it. But I started seeing it as such a chore, like something I did to keep her happy. After we broke up, having sex with her feels like traumatic memory. I stay up late thinking about how gross it was, and all the fluids and stuff. There’s been 3 times since her that I’ve been in a situation with a girl where she’s cuddling up to me or whatever at my house, and every time Im just scared she’s gonna ask and I want her to leave.

Everyone treats me like I’m crazy for this. I feel crazy for this. It’s almost like I’m so scared that people will reject/get bored of me and leave that I don’t want to even try. Also, my roommate is basically in incel territory (not an incel, but close) and he treats me like such crap because he sees me as a chad or something for doing it once. Anytime I’m not perfectly social and positive, he interprets it as arrogance and calls me spoiled/ungrateful. I work out a lot to improve at my sport, and he always makes comments like why work out if you don’t want pussy or something. He’s also bi and hits on me a lot. It really gets on my nerves. Luckily I have another roommate who is chill and I’m good friends with.

While I am in no way qualified to diagnose it, a quick Dr Google indicates it can be temporary or it could lead to permanent damage.

On one hand, I don’t want this person to suffer the worst case. However, if I am wrong, then they may hold it against me and the relationship will be destroyed. Finally, regardless of the outcome, I would come across as a prying ass.",02Oct2019,1

My brother and I are nothing alike and my family isn't very outwardly emotional towards one another so I am thinking of showing how alike we actually are and how after countless hospital visits between us fighting-he actually helped me out when I was most vulnerable. 

So far I have two options for speeches:

1. Nobody knows this but me, my brother used to write rap lyrics as a teen so I was going to write and read out a fake rap that illustrates that he is actually as artistic as I am. (the bride also loves early 00's rap)-Then I am going to list many different instances where we were fighting and he ended up in the hospital trying to beat me up, and contrast that with a last instance in which he actually helped me out when I was most vulnerable. -Showing that he was just looking out for me all along and I know that he will do so for his wife and also be able to handle her because she kind of messes with him.
2. Option two is forget the rap and use the ending that I have in the first option, thinking that reading a rap might not land as a joke. 

I haven't asked anyone else as a friend, because I don't want to spoil the joke. Any advice please!",02Oct2019,1
583,"I turned 27 last month and realized I have no idea what I'm doing with my life. I am very fortunate. I came from a fairly affluent family. I went to a top 10 university. When I graduated four years ago, I moved out to Los Angeles to pursue a career in the entertainment industry, wanting to either write or produce. I've been here for four years, and work as an assistant to a TV executive at a top company, and I am losing it.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought I wanted to write. So I've been trying to write scripts and have a few, but am completely dissatisfied with them, and I look around and see people my age who are established writers and think maybe I should give up. Like, if I had the talent, I would be further in my career by now, I would be a TV writer or a successful producer or SOMETHING. And on top of that, I thought I loved writing and creating and telling stories, but lately I have been so unhappy at work and outside of work. I'm single (female and straight) and would really like to find a partner. I date, and have had relationships in the past, but no one I could see a future with. And finding the right person is not something I can really work towards in the same way I can with writing a story or my job. It's out of my hands. I think about moving back to the town I grew up in where my friends and family are, but A) I don't know what I would do for a career if not television and B) Most of my friends back home are engage/married/or in long term partnerships, and if I moved back, I think I might feel even more alone and behind them in life, especially if I move back and also don't find a partner. And then I worry I might regret having left Hollywood and all the progress I made in my career.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel utterly lost. I've worked my whole life to be in a field I'm questioning, I want to be in love but haven't found the right partner, and all I want is to be happy. It feels like I've lost sight of who I am and what I want. Do I even want this thing I am pursuing? I'm not sure who I am anymore, or how to figure that out. I just... want everything to be okay.

584,"I know this girl named Mary. I had a group with her and two other girls and we'd go out to dinner every month. Two of the girls left for college. It's only Mary and I in our town now. She put up on Snapchat a bit ago that he parents were kicking her out of her house. I saw this and messaged her to find out what was wrong. We were on a really long call about it. A short version would be that her parents said when you turn 18 either pay rent or get out. She says she won't pay rent where she's not happy. They say get out in x amount of time. Mary decides that she'll live her Grandmother. Her parents say basically,""If you live with the grandparents they will no longer have access to their grandson (Mary's brother)."" I talk to my parents after this and it's decided that if she needs a place to go she can stay with us for a bit. I see Mary at a dance class one day. I talk to her and she says that her parents want her out in 3 weeks and she needs to get her own phone. Keep in mind, everytime she says something I clarify by saying it back to her and she says yes. So, a few weeks have passed. Both of the other two girls in college are back for a bit. We decide OG dinner club meeting at my house. So Mary and another friend (Freckle) show up together and we're all having a good time. Mary gets a call from her dad. Freckle and I step out into the hallway to talk while Mary is on the phone. We compare notes basically and realize we have two VERY different stories behind her leaving. So, when Mary is off of the phone and we're back in my room, Freckle and I ask her about it. She tells me that Freckle's version is the truth and she never said what she did to me. I say yes you did. She says that she has receipts to prove me wrong . She doesn't all of this was a phone call or in person. She tells me that I misheard her. Freckles version: Mary's parents say get a GED or pay rent. She say not paying rent and no GED. They say idk what you want us to do. SHE says i'll move out. The three weeks was a personal goal not a kick out because she's not being kicked out. I'm silently angry the rest of the night. This was in August. I don't text her and she doesn't text me. She shows up yesterday to a class that she hasn't been to in months. She says to me, ""I feel like there's tension between us and I want to resolve it."" I fully expect an are you mad at me kinda deal. Nope. she says, ""I feel like you're not inviting me to anything now that Freckle isn't here."" wtf. I had one other get together thing and it was a fucking group chat that she's not in. I say that and she's like, ""ok! I feel so much better now!"" I'm thinking ok that's the end of that. As she's leaving she says, ""I'm sorry I never texted you. I was going through a withdrawal form my antidepressant and I wanted to kill myself."" (my mother has clinical depression and can say with confidence, that's not how that works.)  This part is important. My mom had a loooonnggg chat with Mary's boyfriends mom. Because they're friends. Come to find out that Mary tricks her boyfriend  constantly. When she doesn't get what she wants she threatens to kill herself. So, my mom brings up that Mary moved out her house. Boyfriend's mom in unaware of this. So last night I got a snapchat message from Mary saying that she knows that my mom said something and that she shouldn't have. Mary NEVER said this was a secret. I said what do you want me to do about it? and she says, ""I didn't think I needed to plead."" I said, ""If you have an issue with my mom bring it up with her."" (My mom had asked me to say that.) Radio silence till this morning. I get the notification that Mary screenshotted our chat. Then 30 minutes later a text from Freckle asking what's wrong with Mary and I. Mary told Freckle that I was refusing to talk to her and that I was emotionally immature. Freckle isn't even in our town currently. Mary has my phone number. If she actually gave a shit she could talk to me about this but she hasn't yet. Freckle said that she texted me because the things that Mary was saying didn't match up with how I act. I'm not going to stop talking to someone without a good reason. I am about a half step away from saying something to Mary about it. There's still so much to this. Like other shit she's done.

587,"Tried posting this in jobs but it was automatically removed because my account is a throwaway.

I'm a recent college grad with retail experience, so I decided to take a Whole Foods job while searching for something that I actually want to do for a career. Upon being hired, I realized that they do not provide training for our department (specialty cheeses), even though I was promised they would teach me so I would be knowledgable when helping customers. They have you shadow another employee for 2 days and then throw you onto the sales floor and let you sink or swim.

The hours also really stink. I'm scheduled for every closing shift, and the commute on the subway takes about an hour each way. I don't really feel safe traveling on the MTA at 12 in the morning on a weekday, when it's a literal ghost town on my ride back home. A week ago we had a store meeting at midnight, which I find incredibly strange, and I didn't get home until 1:30 in the morning. At the meeting, they let us know that part-timers weren't guaranteed 32 hours a week anymore and that they were slashing benefits for everyone who isn't full-time, which really put a bad taste in my mouth.

The kicker is that even though I'm the newest employee, they signed me up for inventory a few days ago which is scheduled until 1:30am. After counting every item in our department, they made me stay until 2:30am helping another department count their inventory. I didn't get home until 3:30am. Earlier I had taken a nasty fall in the cooler when someone left a small ladder that I tripped over back there, after I'd spent an hour freezing my butt off. My arm hurts and I've got bruises on my arms and legs as a result. I called out of work today to recover because I can't lift boxes since my arm is shot.

Other things bother me, specifically that they'll work you for 9 hours at a time but only give you a 30 minute lunch and a 15 minute break. I've been extremely anxious since taking the job and its affecting my mental health and drive to apply for other jobs that actually relate to a professional career I want to pursue. I feel really bad because I know the other employees and team leaders aren't to blame. I really like my co-workers and I don't want to totally leave them hanging. I'd give a two week notice, but I can't continue to work past that. What's the best way to explain that I want to quit and turn in my notice? I've only worked there for a month.",02Oct2019,2

Based off of what I have heard about them and seen, I think they will act up at least a bit. They have been treating my family member very poorly. They also won't like that the person who is going to be up there marrying them is an African American who is a lesbian. They are racist, uneducated, and will yell as loud as possible to try to get their point across. They won't shut up ever. I want it to be a good day for my family member and the person they are marrying and I really don't want anyone to get in the way of them having a good day, but I suspect his parents will act up at some point during it.

602,"I work an archiving job at my uni. It’s fairly easy and seriously inefficient due to lack of supervision and lack of resources. My boss somehow is unaware of the fact that when there are 5 computers and 9 people on the schedule 4 people are just sitting around doing nothing.

Today we were sent an email stating that all work in this building needs to be scanned by October 18th (little over 2 weeks) when we have about 40 cabinets of papers left to scan and each cabinet takes a single person about 2 weeks to finish (because of the system we have set up we aren’t allowed to have 2 people working on the same cabinet). We have maybe 12 employees I work with and we’re all in agreement that the deadline is seriously unrealistic. I don’t think my boss is entirely in charge of this deadline as she sometimes says things like “They are expecting us out of here soon.” So none of us really know how to tell her that we will not be able to get the work done within her timeframe.

603,"So, I've never really done one of this but, I'm a 20 Year Old Male from Europe.

I've always been the stereotypical overweight kid, not many friends, even less relationships in school.

Infact I've never had one. Up until 1 month ago-ish. And this is where my issues begun.

I've always strived for attention and acceptance in school so I always lied about my relationships, sexual encounters etc, in order to ""fit in"". When confronted where abouts my significant other was I'd just say they were from another state/school and we'd meet on the weekends. This always followed me up until now.

I met this girl in a state faire and we kind of clicked, her more than me. She started messaging me very often on the daily and I replied, just assuming it would end as all other interactions with females did, I'd get nowhere just because she wasn't interested or I'd try too hard and mess it up. But to my surprise, we eventually started dating, I guess she went past the looks although she says I look good, I can't see it myself. I should also state that I've had a very low self esteem all my life so that might also be one of the causes to this.  
She clearly seems to love me and really care for me,I thought I did too at the start but now I don't think I do as I don't really feel that need to be with her or to be in constant contact with one another. I think I just walked into this as it was gonna be my first relationship and I wanted to experience what it was like for the first time in my life. The only feel I am having for her is having sex as sad as that may sound, but even that comes with a problem. This week she has given me clear indications that she wants to have sex and invited me over 3 times on 3 different days, however I always made up an excuse to not have to attend to that. Why? Well for one she believes I am no longer a virgin so I'm dreading the possibility of being done in very little time and it being embarassing, and I also don't have a very long member I guess? Everyone seems to claim theirs gigantic and this may sound stupid but this also took a tool at me. So not only am I ashamed/insecure of my looks as I am of how much time I can last and my size.",02Oct2019,2

My coworker has a creepy landlord who was always hitting on her and propositioning her in exchange for a lower monthly payment or to skip that month entirely. In addition, he would regularly enter her residence without her consent or the 24 notice required by tenet laws.  This made her feel very unsafe as she is a single mom with 3 small children. Needless to say, she has decided to leave and not renew her lease.  When her lease was coming to an end he tried to get her to stay. She refused and cleaned everything up for her move. When she was moving out yesterday he approached her with a statement for $800 with a long list of ridiculous things. So on top of keeping her deposit, he is demanding she pays him for cleaning the blinds, walls, carpet, etc. She isn't sure what to do. she has text messaged, witnesses and even a voice recording of his propositions. we just don't know where to go from here.

616,"Hi everyone, throwaway here. I'm nervous to write this because it's been a lifelong problem that's only gotten more complicated and overwhelming as I age, and people will probably give very dismissive or overly simplistic advice. But if you've got time and a sincere desire to help an internet stranger, I'll take your suggestions into deep consideration. Thank you in advance.

So basically, I was raised in a very fundamentalist religion. I broke free from that religion and became ""spiritual but not religious"" in my teens, thinking that since I chose this new path for myself, it was inherently healthier than being blindly devoted to my parents' faith. However, over time it has become alarmingly clear that ""religiosity"" deeply impacts *every* facet of my life, from what I eat to how I choose romantic partners. I can't even begin to describe just how deep this shit goes. It's like I've been programmed to make *everything* seem magical, profound and transcendental, even the most average occurrences. This has caused me to make some very major, very stupid decisions in life that have been financially, emotionally and sometimes physically disastrous. 

I guess you could call it a combination of grandiosity, delusion and magical thinking? All my decisions and thoughts are grossly entangled with a motley of borrowed beliefs from different systems, all of which contradict each other and confuse me, but when I feel confused I just commit even more deeply to them, thinking that the issue is not that *the beliefs are wrong*, but that *I am just not understanding them correctly*. And so I consume more spiritual and religious texts and become more painfully confused. It's like an addiction. 

But I can't stop. I can't even conceive of perceiving life without a glittery aura or dark shadowy edge on *everything*. Recently it got to the point where my magical thinking was so severe that I seriously thought I might be developing psychosis (which we have reason to believe might run in my family). But I don't legitimately hallucinate or meet the diagnostic criteria for any mood or personality disorders, so I hesitate to seek conventional treatment. Is my issue ""bad enough"" to warrant medication? I don't know. I just know that I have lost a great deal of trust in my own perception &amp; judgment of reality, and if I continue with this ""harmless spirituality"" I might lose my mind forever.

So now, my question: How does one make this stop? I want to make peace with mundane life. I want to give my brain a fighting chance at peace and contentment, instead of driving myself into insanity by continuing to chase abstractions like ""enlightenment"" and ""self-realization,"" etc. I want to be okay with normal, ""boring"" things like just sitting and drinking coffee without a sense of impending doom over my head. I want to have a nightmare and be able to self-soothe without thinking I'm under ""psychic attack"" (please don't laugh :/). 

 What kind of solutions are there? I've tried a bit of mindfulness, which helps when my thoughts get carried away into lala land. My instinct is to continue cultivating a deeper relationship with my body &amp; senses, to negate the effect of overactive imagination. But beyond that I can't imagine how to begin addressing this complex issue. Are there other things I should try? As much as it begrudges me to say this, I'm even open to reading atheist literature -- but please, if you recommend any, let it be something on the more compassionate side, not condescending Dawkins type shit. I don't need to be kicked while I'm down.

Hope that all made some sense. I welcome advice, particularly from anyone who's had experience in extracting religious delusions from their mind.  Thank you.",02Oct2019,3

The internship would also likely be unpaid and I don’t even know if the internship would actually help with my career, given that it may not even *be* a foley internship and I’m fearful it might end up being a money pit. 

The second option is a $7,300 trip to Japan. It would only last for the month of May and I would get my 3rd year writing and cornerstone classes done, however I wouldn’t get any type of internship and it would essentially be a glorified vacation since the classes I’d take would be online. I also may not make very many close friends because the majority of kids taking the trip would be art students and my classes would be online.

I have $500 saved up for personal expenses, as well as $300 from previous work, and thankfully my dad is endlessly kind and makes enough money that both would be feasible options.

Not really a typical r/advice question but I don't know where else to ask!

So I currently am paying on a 2011 Subaru Outback. The purchase price was $10,000 and I still owe around $7,000. I pay $200 a month. 

I love the car, however, for the 3 years I've had it it has been nothing but a money pit. I could have bought a new car for what I have paid in repairs on this. I just made an over $1000 just a couple months ago and I found out today that it needs another $1400 in repairs. It also has an unspecified electronic issue that causes the parking brake to get turned on and won't turn off. I've spent a couple hundred in diagnostics on that but no one can figure it out past ""it's a Subaru issue"" and offering to replace some electronic panel for like $3000.

The current repairs it needs do not stop it from running so it's not a total junker i.e. still has some trade-in value currently.

My concern is that I don't know how to trade in a car I'm still paying on and I don't know how to get a good deal. I really need my payments to stay at or under $250 a month for the time being. I'm okay buying another used car but kind of terrified to after my experience with this one. I don't have much in terms of a down payment right now, maybe a few hundred.

I just don't know the right way to go about this and I'm a woman so I know any dealership is going to screw me if I go in there unprepared.

So to be clear, this means an online-only relationship where he sends me an allowance. I met this guy through the r/sugarlifestyleforum and I set up a PO Box where he could send my gift cards. 

He never really asked what amount sounded good to me, he just sent one off &amp; I thought it was fair for what he was asking of me at the time. He’s sent me a few so far, and it’s been going really smoothly until the recently. 

I’ve received 3 cards in the time we’ve been speaking, which on average comes out to one card per two weeks. I didn’t mind this because he didn’t really ask for much, but last night he sent me an actual LIST of things he wants from me. 

Now, personally, I’m the type of person who finds it hard to send my order back if they prepared it wrong. I don’t want to come off as selfish. But - if he’s willing to ask for more (a LOT more) is it fair for me to ask for a little more in return?

Originally I didn't tell them I wanted to move because I knew they wouldn't like it, but they have since figured it out and have constantly been telling me how I am making a horrible mistake. They have always been super controlling and every time I have any big life decisions to make they always seem to only support any decision that leads to me not moving out and staying dependent on them. (Eg: didn't want me to move away for college, didn't let me buy a car for ~2 years after graduating so I was dependent on them for transportation)

I'm summing it up but it's really bad. I hate this woman. I thought she was great at first but every day that admiration and respect dies a little more.

Eventually, I asked in person if he wanted to hang out and he seemed pretty excited about it until he later cancelled it. That happened twice and I decided to not be clingy and let him make the next step, but recently he's been getting really friendly with this other girl who, I feel I should mention, is both personality- and appearancewise the polar opposite of me.

TL/DR: Budgie is alone, fairly old, and no one has enough time to properly care for her. Looking for advice in getting support from them and how to properly deal with the situation. 

INTRO:


Over the years we've had, by my count, 15 pets give or take a few that I was too young to remember. Few have been cared for adequately. For example, a budgie, who none of us have enough time to fully cater to, kept alone for multiple years after her mate died at a young age. Our dogs are very rarely walked due to heavy work schedules (one dog is afraid of other dogs, but this doesn't even nearly excuse it, because there are ways to build confidence and ways to privately let them walk), and I was forced to fight for a week to get a gerbil after my current gerbils partner died young (I made the mistake of buying from pets at home originally, it seems he got a respiratory infection that despite medication he could not fight). There are likely other cases with Guinea pigs that I only remember mildly, but as far as I know where kept in the shed alone when their partner died (I haven't researched Guinea pigs, and like I say my memory is fuzzy). 


MAIN:


I have managed to give the gerbils the best life I can (I am still hoping to get a bigger cage at some point but it's adequate for now), and am now hoping to help our budgie. She is kept alone and is a few years old (3-5 afaik) I am hoping to get her an younger male budgie to bond with or if I can't trust my family to care for them both properly, to give her away, but neither are acceptable to my family. We cannot care properly for this budgie and they won't face it. They think I'm a kid on a power trip to make himself look good without actually caring but I genuinely give a shit about these animals. I understand why they're apprehensive but if they researched fully they'd understand better. It is a fact that none of us are willing to give the time it needs to engage a lone budgie (I need to care for my gerbils, and due to dogs we can't take the budgie out the cage for engagement if anyone were willing to put in the days it would take with her apprehension which is doubtable). This leaves us with the two most humane options that I can see (rebonding or giving away). She is old, but still has years ahead of her if properly cared for. I'm looking for advice in both the best options and if necessary convincing my family to support it.

652,"One of my friends asked me if I was okay a few days ago because I had been quiet over text message and I responded with not really and so of course they asked what was wrong. At first I tried to brush it off because I didn’t want to put what happened onto him but eventually I decided to tell him and briefly explained what happened. And I basically said:

“I was messing around with a guy I trusted and he was rubbing himself against me and I made it clear that I was becoming uncomfortable with what was happening and he reassured me that he wouldn’t penetrate me and that was the only reason I allowed it to continue despite becoming slightly uneasy with the situation because as I said I trusted this guy a lot but then shortly after that exchange he basically pushed into my ass and I said stop and called his name a couple of times, he paused after a second or two and then eventually pulled out”

His response to that was pretty blunt and caught me by surprise. I understand that maybe he was upset but he seemed like he was just angry with me. He basically said “yeah I knew that was gonna happen, but like you had sex with him before so I can guess that he wants you a lot. I don’t want to be rude but I think it’s better if you stop being stupid”. He said that he’d told me not to stay in the guys room and then I did and then this happened and that he’s tired of this friendship. 
He ended up kinda backtracking and saying that it wasn’t my fault and that he was just upset that he couldn’t protect me again (I was sexually assaulted by my ex boyfriend before and he knows about that and his response was caring and kind so I’m even more thrown off by why he would react like this). But I feel like he really did mean it and that it wasn’t just him being “sad about not being able to be there”.But I feel so upset and alone. It’s made me feel worthless and I don’t know if I’m just overreacting or how I should maybe bring it up again and explain to him just how much that hurt me

Last year I started high school with no one I knew but as time went I made good circle of friends as 5 really close ones leading up to this day. One of them joined a few months later than us so we decided to make friends with her ,let's call her Dena. She came from Sweden and so wasn't very good with the English language or any of her subjects so we all try are best to help her. The trouble is with her is that she's really toxic and patronising, if she doesn't get what she wants she will complain and strike all she wants and almost all ways gets the teachers side. Now I'm sure were all familiar of the k pop fandom that sometimes gets a little crazy,me being a fan myself considers them good but she is addicted to give you an idea she has a folder dedicated to them and fantasies about them loads. Now here's an example of what she's done:we were in a group project for music and had to make a medley,she wanted to do a Korean song and when the rest of us said not she sat in a strop and refused do anything and when we called the teacher she burst into tears like she was the victim. Other than complaining immensely when she doesn't get her way and her annoying as addictions she actually is a nice person. She's helped me out a lot and never fails to listen,she has a more sister attitude than my actual sister,she is kind and never hesitates to help people. Now all though the friend group isn't exactly find with her and has the same problems with her as I do I feel it would be a terrible thing to do,our entire friend group including me are quite smart so we're a good crowd for here and her other friends are the girls who probably will end up shoplifting and drinking alcohol by 14. Abandoning her would be a bad thing to do because in a way she completes our group. If I blow her off I want to do it gently as she is moany and impossible to work with so with that wall of writing, any advise?

Sorry in advance for lengthy post and any spelling errors.

Hi all just really here to vent and see what people say I should do....here's a little backstory.
In 2014 I (Male) met this girl at my old job.     (we were both in our early 20s) and we hit it off we were great friends that never went past that but I did the one thing you shouldn't do I fell in love with her and I don't know why I guess it was because of how I felt when I was around her or she was the only woman to ever show me any kind of care. Well I guess I didnt say the right things or what but eventually it all fell apart when I found out she was talking to a guy when she was not with me, her friend  noticed and asked if I liked her and I told her ""yes""
well she eventually found out and told me she was sorry.
Well here we are 2019 and I still think about her all the time, I purposely avoid other women in hopes of reuniting with her, sometimes I try to talk to other girls and the moment it starts to get serious I think of her and bail I cant help i hate that I'm like this but here i am.

I can't go to my friends anymore they just tell me to man up or find someone else (as if in my head she was easily replaceable) to them women are a piece of meat to me they are more then that and they can't grasp how hard I felt for her. And I can't talk to my family they are either the same or want to know every detail about here so they can harass her (yes, my family is crazy).
I just don't know what to do anymore every year or so I run into and we talk and that's it won't be another conversation for a while.

I just don't know what to do anymore part of me believes I'm being punished (for what for I'll never know) the thing is she knew I liked her but I never told her I loved her and I guess that what's hurts me the most. I pray to god for her, and I pray for god to protect her from harm and to make sure she is happy as of right now that's the best I can.

It's been really hard having no one too talk to my friends brush it off and my family is crazy it just hits me all at one time not knowing what to do I'm on vacation trying to enjoy myself and I can think about is, ""I wished she was here with me"". 
As far as I know shes happy and that makes me happy although I'm extremely jealous of her boyfriend and I hate that about myself.

Any advice would help, please don't be rude I'm already feeling down.

669,"My coworkers don't seem to like me for some reason. I don't know why. There does seem to be a little bit of a clique problem, but I didn't think it was that bad. From day 1 a couple of my coworkers were kinda cold towards me, I figured it was because I got hired right after Black Friday and the holiday season was stressing everyone out, but more and more coworkers grew cold toward me for seemingly no reason.

A good majority or at least half of my coworkers are LGBT. A majority have some kind of anxiety/depression going on (same). A large amount are anime-loving nerds (me too). And quite a few are stoners (yup you guessed it). I thought working at this place, I would be introduced to a group of very welcoming, accepting people and it would be easy to make new friends. But I was wrong.

I have really bad anxiety and also a weak immune system that makes me get sick more often than others usually do. These are the only reasons why I think they wouldn't like me. Due to my weak immune system and also family illnesses (serious ones where they need to go to Dr appointments at least twice a week), I have to call off or change my availability a lot (transportation). I understand that people that wouldn't know about my personal life would think that I'm just being lazy and calling off cuz I don't feel like coming in to work. That's not the case. Nevertheless, even the coworkers that do know about these tend to be cold towards me.

As for the anxiety. It's really bad, it makes me extremely socially awkward and causes me to overthink everything, including my walking style and stuff, so sometimes I'll walk weird or do weird things while walking because of the anxiety. The anxiety also causes a visual tremor that is almost constant (think Chihuahua), and an occasional noticable twitch. If people are really avoiding me because I have an occasional twitch, it seems like they have a lot of problems with themselves they need to sort out.

So we recently got someone new hired into my department. He was pretty shy and didn't talk much at all. Sometimes he would say a couple things to me if our registers were near each other. I noticed he would look at me a lot and his brother (also a coworker) asked me what I think of him. I figured he might've had a crush on me but I am strictly not allowing sex or relationships with coworkers so I kept it short.

One day, he had an angry customer and after she left, he and I were talking and he was super funny and sassy and I could tell he was gay, so no issue with crushing. He started talking to me and talking shit about customers with me every day for like a week and it was fun, I finally felt I had made my first friend in the year I've been there.

Things changed fast when he opened up to other coworkers. He quickly became well-liked, especially among my LGBT coworkers. He slowly stopped talking to me and I noticed he talks to one if the ""popular"" managers a lot. This manager seems to reeeeeally dislike me and I can promise you all that there is no reason for this unless it's one of the petty ones listed above. The more he talked to my other coworkers, the less he talked to me. It turned into him not talking to me at all and not sitting with me at break even if I was alone at a table.

This really sucks and I feel really sad and upset about it. Obviously some of my coworkers talked shit about me, he joined and stopped being my friend. I feel even lonelier every day at work than I did before.

I don't know what to do about this whole clique problem nor do I know why everyone dislikes me. I mean I'm sure there's a reason that's beyond my knowledge unless they truly are as petty as they seem to be. I don't even know if I can do anything. 

My friend works at the store across the street and I thought of transferring over there, but this friend used to be my best friend and I learned she was talking shit and telling everyone about my personal life and now everyone that works there thinks I'm stupid and a hoe. She's the type of girl to strive on male attention, so if one of my friends that works there had a crush on me or asked about me, she probably talked shit so that the attention would remain on her.

671,So I’m mixed and my moms side of the family is pretty racist. Me and my uncle have been in MULTIPLE fist fights throughout my life because he always has to say something slick to my mom or me. Anyway I beat him up again this weekend admittedly probably a little worse than I should have but he really doesn’t know how to keep his mouth shut and this has been going on for at least a decade now. He said he’s gonna press charges since he had to get his jaw wired shut and is saying he’s gonna sue for medical bills and blah blah blah. And it’s not like I don’t make a valiant effort to avoid this man because I refuse to go to family events just because of him and I really only pop by my grams (where he lives) to help her out cause his bum ass can’t do anything. I just don’t know what else to do all I know is I’m never letting that bum punk me out because I already have once and it hasn’t stopped since.,02Oct2019,1
673,"I know I'm not the only one who feels this way, and I don't want to draw attention to myself but, if I do anything wrong or silly I worry so much about it, like it I do something stupid and a teacher tells me off I get worried on how that would effect parents evening. I also get worried like when a guy asked if it was a train to blank  and I said I didn't know and it actually was I was so angry at myself for not telling him the right answer. The guy said it didn't matter but for me it did. I was angry that I didn't know and angry that I made him take extra time to wait at the station.

As well as being anxious I am also lonley, I really want a bf, everyone else I know has one, and I'm always the odd one out and having to third wheel. I want someone to support and them to support me. I just feel lonley and anxious.

Any advice onto how to stop myself being anxious and find a relationship?",02Oct2019,3
674,"I grew up in South Florida and moved back here after college but I'm ready for a change of scenery. I narrowed down 15 options to get my current top 5 which includes Denver, Seattle, Charleston, Austin, and Portland. This decision is hard so I just want to hear any opinions you have. Feel free to suggest a city not in my top 5.",02Oct2019,1
675,"I got bullied for the whole of high school so I think it’s engrained in me my whole life. It started to really come about at my past work. I always stick up for myself but that seemed to make things worse. I’m also a guy who really likes a joke and a laugh. But it’s like everybody saw me as weak. I guess I have really low confidence and I used to look for acceptance and if what I was doing was correct and that it didn’t offend anybody.

So today I was driving past my old work. A truck was pulling in for ages so I was stuck in traffic. Some of my past work colleagues were stood outside. One was genuinely asking me how I was and stuff, then the others were saying hello. Then another decided to come down from the steps and lift my windscreen wiper up. I took it as a joke but I will tell you some back story on this guy. He seemed to dislike me for some reason, I never did anything to him. Like in a group he would never laugh at my jokes when everybody else did. Then he would try to belittle me in front of everybody. The same with a lot of people at my past work. They would try to belittle me, it was always me. I’d answer him back then he wouldn’t say anything. So today it wasn’t a joke. I don’t get what he was trying to achieve, it was like he was trying to show off, yet nobody was laughing. Then what do I do? Am I supposed to get out of my car and smack him? Or just drive away and laugh like it didn’t affect me (which I did) the other guys I just mentioned who said hello also saw me as weak when I worked there, it’s like I was at the bottom of the food chain. But this guy has everything. A proper hot girlfriend, a kid, he was popular with loads of friends. Then I have none of that, just a nice car. It was like he was trying to push my buttons as my car is where my money went. Yet if I did anything they would see me as over reacting and that I was the asshole. 

Fast forward to my new work, I think it’s happening again. I started working with this guy (he’s not my boss or anything but he acts like he is) at first I did what he said. As he was showing me what to do so I can’t turn around and say no. It’s hard to tell if he is trying to use me or is genuinely helping me out with the work. I did something today and I found out he was using me with it. This woman began to tell me not to listen to him and stuff. I can see it though that she sees me as weak as I just do what he says. 

I’m not looking for acceptance anymore, I couldn’t care less. But in a working environment I don’t no how to handle the situation. He started walking around last week shouting my name saying I am a pussy. I just carried on with my work. Again is this a joke? If I react it shows it got to me. I’ve actually just got a promotion in 3 months so I must be doing something right.

So what am I supposed to do? Plus why do they target nobody else? It’s like they respect the other person not to do that stuff to them. That if they did they might be consequences but with me they will be nothing, they can do it, they can shit on me. Why do it to me? I’m tall and pretty muscular as well and I’m not exactly soft. I’m never the one to start anything or belittle anybody because it’s not nice, there’s no need for it. Again in the workplace I can’t physically stick up for myself. But why not do it to other people, why do they respect them and not me? The guy with the windscreen wiper wouldn’t of done it to nobody else apart from me.",02Oct2019,1

680,So this has been going on for the past year and I am just tired of it my mom has changed for the worst. Last year I was going through a depression and I met people who really help me get through it and my mom got mad that I was telling them about my feelings then telling her even tho if I told her she will say “ you chose to be depressed” same with my dad. My mom didn’t lie and make things up until this time. She been jealous that I tell my friends things. I get if it’s family stuff but it is not it’s stuff between my friend group. She will go into my phone and say “ you shouldn’t tell *insert name here* because he/she will tell the other person and they will be hurt. Yet again I don’t talk bad about people and I only tell people I trust. I already established that my family doesn’t like my friends. Christians friends who don’t do drugs or anything bad or get me into trouble. I am thinking of texting my friends on a different app because I am tired of her looking into my phone and getting mad that I tell my friends stuff. Also one other things I went somewhere a couple weeks ago and my mom got mad at me for going and said “you said you weren’t going and then you go” when I never said I wasn’t going I  told her the night and morning that I am still going but no she made stuff up and told everyone that I said I wasn’t going. I feel like I won’t be happy until I am an adult. She also said that I only want to go to college because my friends are going. My friends are not thinking about college nor do I talk to them about it.  I needed to rant but also to seek advice or anything I am kinda just annoyed and done. Also if she hates my friends for no good reason and hates the people who I known for 10 years and call my family and tell me straight to my face they are not your real family  I should have the right to not like her friend who  is a creep who wants to be my BFF when he is 40 and is OBSESSED WITH MY FAMILY and also threatens to scare off any boy I date and my guy friends in general which is 90% of my friends and I will NEVER call him uncle,02Oct2019,2
681,"I'm trapped living with my parents and abusive brothers. My Father is disabled and has to be cared for, he can't do much himself and can't be left alone for too long. I end up being his full time caretaker so my Mom can go to work.

I don't mind taking care of my Dad but living with my brothers is making me suicidal. I'm not going to get into all of their issues but long story short they're awful people and they walk all over me and my parents. It causes a huge rift between my Mom and I because I want her to make them move out (they're mid 30s) but she refuses to. She just says ""i'm not going to make them homeless"".

I think i'm done though. I know me moving out is going to cause an enormous amount of stress for my parents but I don't know what else do to. It's not right that i'm forced to live like this. 

Problem is I have no vehicle or access to public transportation so I have no way to get to and from a job. A few years ago my Dad was in the hospital for a few months and my Mom took off work to be with him. We desperately needed money but there's really no way to make thousands of dollars from home if you don't have an education or skill.

I think it was on reddit where I saw someone say the only way to do it is camgirling. So yea...I camgirled for a bit and was able to pay my parents bills so my Mom could stay with my Dad. I know some people can do that kind of stuff just fine but it was really difficult for me mentally. As dramatic as it sound I feel like I killed a part of myself so I could whore myself out for money. 

Now here I am again considering doing it. I hate living here and I need to get out. If I could get some cheap apartment in town then I could walk to a job. Then I could get a car, start taking coding classes again and maybe years down the road have a career instead of just a job.

I want to have a normal life. I have no friends and I don't think I've hugged a guy that wasn't related to my since I was in middle school.

682,"I (17F) have a friend (17F) who basically lives alone. Her dad pays rent and medical bills and stuff but she has to pay for everything else. We’re in high school so she has a part-time job. She can rarely pay for her own things so a lot of the time I will buy things for her when we go out if she says she can’t afford it, which is frequently, and she says she’ll pay me back, but she usually doesn’t. I have always been understanding of this because she’s in a really tough situation in my opinion but my other friends talk about getting annoyed about her not paying them back for things when she says she will. They know about her situation too though.

This year, I’m doing dual credit at the local college, so I never go to the high school. But, she needed one more person for her carpool list to get a parking spot at school so I said she could just put me on the list. 

She ended up putting me down as the person paying for it - it’s $300. She told me it was an accident and I believe her so, she promised me a month ago she would get me the money before the due date. 
Well, it’s due Friday and she still hasn’t payed me; I don’t have the money to pay for it either so I had to call my mom and ask for her to pay. 

When I told her about what happened my mom got really mad, not at me but at my friend. Her points were 1) $300 is a lot of money to pay for something that I’m not ever gonna use (which I agree with) and 2) She told me that she was sick of my friends constantly using me. 
The second point really hit me because I will admit, I let people walk over me really easily. But in this situation I didn’t feel like that’s what was happening. I feel like I am helping a friend who needs it. 
My other friends say that I am enabling her behavior and need to stand up for myself.

They've been dating each other for 3 weeks now, and have now made it ""facebook official."" Yes, I'm totally irritated at that because he's on social media (fb/instagram) all the time just posting a crap ton about this girl. I've unfollowed his posts on both platforms, but it's hard because we also hang out and see each other. Not very often anymore, but he basically told me ""we should hang out **MORE**."" Mind you, we hung out like once a week, every week the whole summer. That's excessive. I've been pretty hands off now since he started dating mostly because I'm annoyed and need space! We've set boundaries to not talk about our dating lives, but he's always on the social media talking about her or mentioning/tagging her in posts. Like some real cheesy sh\*t.  We're both in our mid to late 20's BTW. Cheesiness will never die no matter what age we are, will it? I do want to mention, I'm NOT jealous of her.

688,"I just went through my first breakup. It’s been a week since it happened and I don’t know how I feel. (18f)

My boyfriend and I had been together for a year and a half, we were very good friends basically best friends before we had got together. When we got together I never felt happier it was the best thing ever, I was literally dating my best friend. 

We had our few ups and downs and little arguments but who doesn’t? We didn’t have major fights, small arguments that would be resolved quickly. Lately though we hadn’t had any arguments, everything was fine so I was shocked when he decided to break up with me. 

He told me he wanted to break up but remain friends, I just remember crying a lot that night and when he told me that. I asked where this was all coming from as a few nights prior to him breaking up with me he told me was happy with the relationship (clearly not if he broke up with me). He just told me he was unhappy, unhappy how though? Was what I was curious about. I told him we could try and work on the relationship, we could do more things outdoors instead of staying in and watching movies. I thought of everything, but it was no use he had his mind set. He told me i had small flaws that began getting too annoying, this hurt me as he too had many flaws yet I still loved him. He kept saying he loved me which hurt because I couldn’t understand if you love someone why break up with them why give up? He wanted to remain friends as he really values our friendship and before we got together we had a really great bond he says. But I can’t even see how exes can become friends after a breakup, like I can’t imagine me and him ever communicating again.. 

It hurt because as naive as I may sound I really had a feeling we would last long term, my first boyfriend would be the person I would marry. My friends also thought the same and he did too... he was my first everything, first kiss, first cuddle, first moment of intimacy. 

The first few nights I kept crying, I couldn’t help myself it hurt so much that my nightmare had become a reality. I kept wishing I could turn back time and change things. 

It’s day seven of my breakup and surprisingly I feel not too bad, I haven’t cried today. I’ve been able to get work done and I have been able to talk about my breakup without getting all teary eyed. But even though I am trying to slowly get over him, there’s a part of me that keeps thinking what if he comes back and changes his mind, what if he regrets his decision and comes back to me. I feel that his hopeful unrealistic thinking is making it difficult for me to move on.. 

I also wonder if he is suffering as much as i am- not that I want him to feel terrible.. but I don’t want to be the only one impacted by this change in my life.

689,"Recently I've been noticing I'm more anxious and been starting stupid arguments with my bf. I keep
making him feel like he'd doing something wrong when it's me. When I get very anxious I nitpick at everything and slowly start panicking. I know
My behavior and I know what I'm doing wrong but how do i calm myself down so i can act rationally?

I was in an abusive relationship for two years and for some reason during fall my anxiety increases so much. I have never seen a therapist but I really believe I have ptsd because whenever something reminds me of him I start to panic and I completely break down. 

My bf is very caring and VERY patient with me. I'm so grateful for him and i want a future with him. But i need to start seeing a therapist so I can be my very best for him. He doesnt deserve me acting out on him like this. It hurts me so much I end up crying and feeling like the worst person ever. I hate myself so much for making him feel like he isnt a good boyfriend. It's been a few months and we live together. I try helping him, I cook all the meals, he and I clean together and I let him do his thing after work. He and I have had to deal with a sexual harassment case for 2 months now and I feel it's adding to us arguing. We always end up talking it out and trying to understand eachother. And I always end up crying because I feel like I'm out of control with my emotions. 

I talked to a doctor who whats to get my thyroid checked (i cant gain weight very easily and this anxiety just barely goes away) and he set me up with a therapist. I'm ready to be better but I'm also terrified to start. I know my bf loves me, but I can tell it's not easy for him to put up with me. I made him dinner and it was the first dish I ever cooked him. I even went grocery shopping with my mom while he was at work to surprise him last night. I'm trying to do things for him so he knows I appreciate him and I want him to know it wont always be like this. I know couples fight but ours are too frequent because I'm being too sensitive (he's never said that, that's me saying it) He always does things for me when he knows he messed up and I want to do things for him

I need help with how to calm myself down, and I would like some advice on how he and I as a couple can help with my anxiety together. Sometimes he'll just hold me telling me it's ok but I'll feel stuck, like i feel I'm in quicksand not able to move and all i can think about is just the over all feeling of dread and worry. I just need some advice, we argued before he had to go to work, we made up but i'm still worried and I want to do something. i already planned dinner and since he and I work at the same place i'll see him in 2 hours at work and work the entire rest of the shift with him.

The problem is I realized im not that close with friends- and i don't really want to be? I don't exactly dislike people in school, i'll talk to them if they talk to me.. but I really want to drop them. They aren't toxic people but I just feel a sense of tension when im around them and like im expected to be someone different (especially because they're more extraverted) I usually don't want to be around them and often i would wish I'd be somewhere else, given the exception that i had something better to actually do, which unfortunately I don't. i mean, i hear a lot that eventually after a few years you just never talk to the people you talked to in secondary/high school, except for a few and only on occasion? So would it really be wrong of me if i just ghosted them as soon as this year ended and found my people that I actually feel comfortable around in university?

691,"okay this is going to be a long one, and a complicated one, and a messy one, but please bare with as I do need help. 

back in april i met this boy on tinder. we clicked instantly but have just settled for being really good friends. we’ve only met a couple of times because he lives almost an hour away and we’re both at university full time and working. he’s been my absolute rock over the past few months, and i know ive been his. 

at the end of july, he told me that he thought he may be depressed. i wasn’t expecting it at all because he’s the furthest thing from the “stereotypes” of a depressed person. he has an incredible job, incredible family, owns four cars and he’s only 20, makes really good money because of his job, but he’s also been through a lot this year. that’s not my stuff to tell but i guess an accumulation of small things has just completely built up. i told him he needed to tell his parents and get help but he assured me that he’d be absolutely fine and he’d never do anything stupid or irrational. over the next few weeks he really seemed to become himself again and as i spoke to him everyday, knew that if he seemed to become more down id notice it. he told me just by talking to me he felt a million times better. 

the subject of him being depressed wasn’t approached again until this past saturday. he texted me at about 11pm telling me that earlier in the week he had tried to kill himself. i can’t even begin to describe how physically ill this made me. the one person i just love more than anything doing that. he was drunk when he told me but told me he was absolutely petrified and was desperate to get help. he also told me that I was the only reason he hadn’t gone through with it. it’s now wednesday and he’s yet to make a doctors appointment which terrifies me. 

i have no connections to his real personal life. he’s told one of his friends but he was too hyped up on cocaine to care when he told him. i don’t know any of his friends personally, nor do i know his parents. i know his address so my thinking is to send his mum a letter. i know he would hate me, and I know it would absolutely kill her, but I don’t know what else to do. im genuinely absolutely petrified. i need help. im only 19 and didn’t think this was something id ever go through. im scared of him pushing me away and im scared of him thinking id be better off without him when in reality i don’t know how id cope without him",02Oct2019,1
692,"This is partially my fault. I allowed my dad to cosign a car with me due to bad credit after i was kicked out 3 times starting at age 18 (ran a credit card up for groceries and whatnot while having issues finding a simple job). Finally I have a great career going, my own apartment, and I was allowed to sign off for this car with my dad's help 1.5 years ago or so.

Fast forward: The car 3 months in was given $10k in damages to a hit and run i was in. That de-valued the car already. Later on, I was pulled in front of in the rain, and the other driver didn't yield to me- so that was another $12k in damages. Recently I was in a wreck due to being run off of the road into a curb. That was FIXED.

I had my car in and out of the shop after the last wreck, left and right. Finally I took it in for an unrelated repair, and the dealership stated that they needed to keep the car for a week to try to replicate the issues. I got my car back later on, and noticed it was clunking. I took it back to the dealership at my best convenience (I am on the verge of losing my career over this car) AFTER calling them to let them know the issue. They explained it's safe to drive, and to bring it in so they can take a look. They said it sounded like a tool was loose in my hood or something.

I took it back, and when I did so, they stated there is an ""absurdly large amount of damage"" on the undercarriage of my car. That's weird, because I would have known if I had impacted the car THAT badly. The EXACT same parts that were repaired and PROVEN to be repaired at an authorized body shop were somehow now damaged since the last visit to the dealership for that unrelated repair previously mentioned. The dealership was VERY shady when asked where in the dealership they ""parked"" my car, they said ""over there"", and couldn't give me an accurate answer. There is a lot of construction and ditches there, which is where I was and am still skeptical.

Here's where the issue is now: I have been without a working car for 3 months now. I am paying monthly payments of $400+ on a car I cannot use and that has not run right since getting it back. Insurance and the dealership are telling me I have to file ANOTHER insurance claim, which is NOT what I want to do to my rates when none of this should have happened. I am on my parent's insurance (I am 24, 23 at the time of the wreck), and they are not allowing me to file another claim unless I am on my own insurance. There is still a $17k note on my credit that my parents are holding on my credit as hostage to the fact that I moved out on my own recently, and they did not want me to move out, so now that's how they're manipulating me. We DO possibly have the option to total the car, which would take care of most, if not all of the owed note balance. However, my parents are not allowing me to total it, and have been putting it off for 3 months now, and I am about to be homeless again. I am VERY close to losing my career, and following everything else.

If I put the car under my insurance and get it fixed, then another issue arises. Since my dad is the main cosigner, he (as did before) will call the police, if threatening the police doesn't work, and claim that the car was stolen from him.

I can also total the car. But then again, I can't total it unless my parents agree to under their insurance apparently.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my question is: how do I get this $17k note off of my credit or get myself back into the car? I just want to get this over with, and all I am doing is wasting lots of my money on this car note while my parents keep declining calls from the insurance company as an attempt to manipulate me to have no choice but to move back home and beg for their help with being homeless again... I don't even know what my legal rights are anymore, because every time I propose a solution to this madness, they shoot it down with ""that would cause us to sue you"", or ""that will kill your credit AND my credit!"".

&amp;#x200B;

I CANNOT get another car note until this $17k note is zeroed out completely in some way or fashion. I have tried everywhere to get even a cheap car that nobody would want to drive.

694,"To (attempt to) make a long story short, I’ve been working for shady company for a while. One of the managers recently left and advised me to try to get a job at the place she was hired on. I’ve been going through the whole process and am at the point of signing my offer letter and going to another state a few hours away to train for and indefinite amount of time in a couple days. At this point during the process so many things have happened that have given me bad vibes and what I once was excited about, I am now dreading. Even though it makes my stomach turn, I feel that I can’t go through with it anymore and obviously need to let them know. Basically I am here asking if anyone has been through a similar situation and if you think my message declining the offer is appropriate. This is what I plan on sending:

‘This is not an easy e-mail to send. From the beginning of the hiring process, I have had some negative gut feelings about working for your company, but was still excited and figured the pros outweighed the cons. After speaking with you and thinking things over, I no longer feel it would be right to accept your offer. I feel like I have had to agree to things I didn’t feel comfortable with, and I shouldn’t do that to myself or to you. I can imagine how upset you may be by this, but I also know it would be worse if I make this decision after traveling to ‘BLANK’ and starting work. I sincerely apologize and am sorry for the time you have spent recruiting me and wish you the best of luck in finding another candidate.’

*None of the names used are actual names*

So, I'm sitting in my college's student Union having lunch with some friends and one friend (Gertrude) starts telling a story. This story involves a trip they went on, in high school, to Europe through a program that other people from different schools go on this trip. Gertrude was explaining about these stories about people on the trip all hooking up and cheating on their SO's.

Now, I also have another friend (Harriet) that goes to another university about an hour away. They live with three dudes, one of these dudes (William) also went on the same trip as Gertrude. William has had the same girlfriend throughout highschool and into college, they even have plans to get married someday. And he, you guessed it, was one of the promiscuous people on the Europe trip. The timeline definitely matches up to a time when they would have been already dating. I only connected the dots after they said his name and I asked some questions expecting to get no where. We confirmed it was him after I showed a picture of him, to my friend, on Facebook.

Here's the thing. I've met William once, and it wasn't even really a meeting. But, do I tell my friend Harriet about what happened since she knows him so well? Because my rational is that I would want to know if my SO was cheating on me, but is it my business to tell this to my friend so they can let the girlfriend of William know?

TLDR; Friend tells me about an offhand story about people hooking up on a trip. I know one of these people through a friend of a friend and that person is in a long term relationship.",02Oct2019,1

I [20 F] work with this guy [25 M]. Before I broke up with my ex he would flirt with me, and I’d just brush it off. After I broke up with my ex I started flirting back and it’s been like that for the past 2 months. We flirt, he helps me at work, and at the end of the shift he walks me to my car. I didn’t think anything of wanting to date him until people started asking if we were a thing. That’s when I started considering the idea of dating him.  And every night I work with him I have deeper feelings for him.
A few nights ago he got a call and as soon as he answered he looked annoyed and walked away. I asked who it was he told me no one. I made a flirty comment and he started smiling and joking again. Then I found out it was his gf of 4 years. He never told me about her. I’ve dropped hints that I know about her but he ignores it. I don’t know what to do. Should I back off? Should I try moving on from him? Can I keep flirting?

This episode affected my entire life deeply. It affected my relationship with my partner, it affected the bond with my family, and I found out who my real friends were. Since then I have begun to get my life together.

However, after I got kicked out and as I attempted to get my life together and still attend grad school, I have noticed that my levels of anxiety have skyrocketed and gone through the roof.

706,"So I recently went to a festival with my 2 friends, and they actually bought my ticket for me because money was tight and I was unsure if i’d be able to afford it; but they were adamant that I go with them by any means. 
Anyways, throughout the festival things turned sour and now that we’re all home, we are no longer speaking or even friends.

We (verbally) agreed that any shared expenses (aka uber) that was put onto one persons credit card/paid for by one of us would be split evenly and paid once we’re back home. 
Once I stepped foot into my house I looked at the “tab” they had written me and what I owed each of them, and now my ticket was included in this “tab”. 

So when the ticket was bought we were all best friends, and it was a gift/surprise for me (which I did not ask for, but i’m still grateful for it) and now that we’re not friends, I suddenly owe them for the ticket.

Personally I believe I do not have to pay them back, as it was a gift and nowhere was it said that I would be paying them back for the ticket; but I just want to get another opinion in case I run into trouble once I confront them about this.

708,"So today was the last straw for me. I feel that at work I have not been appreciated. I have been getting paid $9/hr when everyone else is make $13. I brought this up to my boss and she said that she will raise my hourly rate to $13. That was 2 months ago and still nada. Everytime I asked about it she got super impatient and told me it is still processing. Another issue was that I broke my phone a week and a half ago and told her that my phone is not working. I told her this multiple times as she would constantly tell me to answer my phone more. I am trying to buy a new one but right now i make nothing, my husband is is grad school and not working, and I am supposed to be scrapping to just survive. Rent and food is definetly first priority over a new phone. She never told me I was required to have a phone at work. If so I would have bought a temporary one while I am waiting for money for a new one. Anyway so  she keeps forgetting right. Then today I was told to come in at 9. Ok no big deal i usually come in at 8 but thats cool. I am on time and at the door at before 9 but all the doors are locked, there is no way into the building. I have always been able to come in through the front door. I am locked out! I start looking around the building for any way in. I see a couple people walking by and I ask them if they know a way in, but nothing! At this point I am 20 minutes late and I feel defeated so I figure that I should wait by the front door because someone is always sent out to different parks for various tasks and they will see me ( I work for parks and rec). Eventually while I am waiting I see my boss come storming out of the door looking like someone just killed her damn dog! She yells wait are you doing, I was startled and was not expecting such anger so I took a second to answer. I said I was locked out and couldn't find a way in. She continues to say the I should have called her to let me in. I told her that my phone is broken and I have told her many times. Anyway she is completely angry and I decide I want to stick up for myself because I did not feel that I really did anything wrong so I say ""Well I just thought it would be normal to expect the doors to be unlocked when I come to work."" She flips off and though out the rest of the day is glaring at me. Finally at the end of the day I am about to go home and I am told to come in at 10 the next day. I say ok, then I turn to a co-worker and ask if I can stick with them so that I can call if I need to get in since they were supposed to come in at 10 too. I thought this was to show that I wanted to not let the mistake happen again, but instead my boss goes off the rails and says that I should be an ""adult"" and that I should figure things out on my own. I couldn't see how I could possible want to work with someone who treated me this way so I told her that ok, but I am putting in my two weeks because I know I am not at fault here. She says ok.

I currently have a full time job and a part time job. Wanted some advice on what to say to the guy when I plan on quitting tonight. Some specifics is that it is a small mattress shop and I have been doing all of the crappy work, such as making beds and delivering, etc. I mentioned to the boss a couple weeks ago that I am on the fence about it and he was getting a little excited since it is hard to find reliable people in the area I am in. Since I have a degree and am trustworthy I got hired on the spot pretty much.

I told him in the beginning I would give him some notice when I am thinking of leaving. He really rely's on me since otherwise he will have to do the work but its part of owning a business. Note I have been working here since Mid June and am just ready to say screw it and just work my full time position. I really only did this for some extra cash so I don't need this business on my resume at all. Should I tell him I will be leaving in 3 weeks, or just tell him 2 weeks and if he gets pissed I will walk out and hand the keys over and carry on with my life?

722,"Hello. This story is kinda complicated, but I decided to make a throwaway account and talk about this.

I [16F] have been dating my BF [17M] for a while. Needless to say, I love him very much and I'm very happy with him. Until now we've never had any actual fight or problem, but of course, nothing is perfect.

Now, I have a lot of male friends. My BF knows this and is comfortable with them (also I think I need to add this because I've got this kind of opinions: they are not ""secretly into me"", thank you). One of them, A, has been my best friend since middle school. Along with my BF, he's one of the very few people I trust. 

One day last month, BF and I were hanging around in our highschool's campus when 2 of his female friends showed up and hugged him (let's call them B and C). I raised my hand to greet them, but they kinda ignored me (they knew BF and I were dating). I felt weird about it, but I blamed it on my anxiety. This whole thing repeated once or twice the following days: they greet BF like they haven't seen him in decades and they hug him and then ignore me. Not even look me in the face. But I mean, I don't know them, right? They aren't obliged to say hi to me. 

One day I actually asked him who those girls are; they're just friends he met through someone else. I always trust him and I know that if there's something, he'll tell me.

However, this whole thing started to slowly piss me off. Like at least say hi or return my hand-wave, don't let me hanging. I keep blaming it on my anxiety, there's nothing to worry about. I'm not going to lie, some of my male friends don't always greet BF when he's coming into my classroom, but they do when they run into him on the street. Also, my friends don't hug me all the time. 

At some point I started to believe I was slowly turning into a stereotypical nice girl, obsessed with her BF's female friends. I brushed everything off, until one day, when I tell A about this situation. Unfortunately, at that time I hadn't caught these girls' names (my auditory memory fails me often). He understood how I feel. 

Today, BF and I were getting lunch when we ran into A, B and C! The girls hugged BF, A hugged me too, but he was frowning at the sight of B and C. He whispered into my ear ""I know them, they're B and C, really shitty people"". We don't get to talk too much about it. Later this evening I ask for explanations.

So, here's the complete story: B and C gossip about A a lot because he is gay. They talk shit about him (or this is what A heard). What he confirmed however is that C *takes pictures of him* on the street. Like every time they are in the same space, she takes pictures of him without permission to send to other people, but doesn't mind being stealthy, and A notices every single time. C is also A's classmate's BFF; once this classmate asked A to hang out in town and A declined, not because he was busy or anything, but because he had scheduled a meeting with other people, and simply couldn't spend time with 2 different friend groups. While in town, C sees him, *takes a picture of him and sends it to his classmate*, proving he's not busy, he's just trying to avoid her. B is also part of this group and she talks behind A's back. A told me that they definitely do this hug thing with BF for a reason and not just because they're friends or something.

After A told me all of this, I thought about discussing with BF. I do not feel comfortable around them because they mock my BFF for being gay. A asked me not to because he's not 100% sure about the gossip part as it's hard to find the source of it. He told me to simply talk to my BF about how I feel about B and C hugging me all the time and ignoring me. The thing is, it's not like we two spend hours hanging out with B and C, their presence only bothers me for less than 30 seconds, once a day at most. But I'm scared of what they're planning. I am anxious as fuck and I don't know what to do. I don't want him to give up on his friends because of me, I don't want to be a nice girl.

736,"My brain keeps going back to my experience in primary, middle school, and early high school... in almost every stage of my life I was bullied physicly, verbally and psychologically ever since I was 4 years old in kinder garden until I was in high school and simply learned to escape form people except those that I knew very well, but I know exactly why I was bullied. 
 
I always stuck out like a sore thumb, I was always much taller than everyone in my class, I was a nerd always talking about shit that almost no one understood and they made fun of me for it, I couldn't hear very well so I was always talking loudly without realizing it, it was hell, every day was the same, I hated everyone and everything but thew all that for some reason, I had one thing, I had hope, Every year that passes that I was treated like shit in I thought to myself ""This year is almost over Next year will be the best just wait and see"", I didn't just think that I truly **believed** that and I worked hard every year for things to get better, and I remember that even when times were at their worst I would say to my self ""Now that I think about it this year is not going as bad as the last, And next year will be perfect"", I never gave up hope on anything every day I thought to myself I'm great look how much I'm improving I can be the best and I will some day, That hope was so sweat, It pushed me to greater and greater hights, even as a 10-year-old even when my OWN PARENTS made fun of me and toled me how much worst than other people's kids at almost everthing, I never gave, I respected and loved myself and was truly as happy as I can when my small world spit in my face kicked me to the ground and declared me filth, When I walk passed some duche bag I didn't panic with fear, I thought to my self If lays a hand on me I will punch him in the face, and most importantly could guess other people's emotions towards me fairly and was not hurt by the thoughts of people's thoughts of me...  

I don't understand what happened when or how exactly... but something is went wrong, I know It wasn't like this before, now When people talk to me my heart starts racing thinking (I'm going to stutter or say something stupid and they're gouing to make fun of me), If I get overexcited in a conversation or keep getting ignored I will uncontrolably think about it for days even if it most likely was nothing, When I'm in a group of people being quiet and listening or talking my hands will get cold and my heart will start beating fast and I would have no idea what's going on or even worst I would let anxiously talking non stop or interrupt everyone as a way to delay my dread of the situation which will make it way, way worst later on but I can't help it when I'm in the heat of the moment... and if let's say someone makes fun of me, even as a silly joke it will stick for longer than you can imagine, because in my subconscious mind that silly joke is true even if it's not and them making fun of me now will only mean that I will be thier punching bag later as well... I know that people could care less about what you said or did in a week's time, but if that thought made any difference I would not be posting here...",02Oct2019,2
737,"So lately I've been thinking about going back to college. I went to college when I was eighteen straight out of high school and majored in something I wasn't really interested in, and long story short I ended up not making it past first semester. I had controlling parent who never let me go out, so I basically went into college with no life skills, and was immediately overwhelmed with all the sudden responsibility I had. I know I should have taken initiative myself, so I'm to blame as well, I definitely took on too much at once. 

 It's been two years since then and lately I've been thinking about going back to college for something I want and not something my parental figures wanted, but I want to be sure before I just jump the gun. Here are a few details to my situation.

\-The reason I got taken out was because I did not go to my classes like I was supposed to, instead opting to stay in my dorm room and hide. An example of me not handling my freedom well.

\-The college I attended was in Ohio, I now live in Nevada and want to know if that would affect anything.

\-It's been a while since I went to high school, so how would I go about retrieving information for college applications. ((Also my ACT scores as well.))

Since then I've distanced myself from my toxic parent, learned a bit more life skills, and also how to manage my time better. I think I can do this, but like I said I don't wish to take any chances that aren't worth it.",02Oct2019,1

This person treated me poorly, they were manipulative, but above all I was the only one trying to make things better. I was the only one trying to be a better person, and they just never tried to be better. They were more concerned with being in the right about everything than trying to fix issues. They said that they won't change who they are, and if that means they are okay with being a self centered, self serving, unempathetic and manipulative I don't want to be there for them anymore.

747,"Hi all, 

I’m currently a senior at a very expensive private university in NYC. I’ll be graduating in May as long as everything goes okay with about $40.5k in debt ($12.5k in private loans, $15k in government loans, and $13k in a loan from my grandparents). I studied mathematical sciences. 
I’ve been accepted into graduate school in England for data science as my boyfriend is from there so I want to actually let us be together and the grad programs over there are actually significantly cheaper than the ones here. I can use American government loans for that program as they’re eligible for FAFSA and that should cost me about $18k in loans as well. So all in all, I will graduate with two degrees for about $59k. Which I guess doesn’t sound too bad in today’s education situation. 
However, in order to get a visa to study,  I need to have over $11k in my bank account to prove that I can support myself, and it’s just not possible for me to reach this number. So now I’m thinking that I will have to take another personal loan out just to be able to get the visa, leading to nearly $70k in debt. 
I’m honestly freaking out at the idea of all this debt. The fact that it’s nearly doubled from my undergrad and that even upon graduation from my masters, I won’t make nearly as much in England as I would working in America just because of the differences in pay. 
I’m scared, I’m anxious and I feel so burdened and heavy by these numbers and to be 23 and have to owe $70k. I’m scared I’ll never be able to live my life because I will never be able to pay them off.

Have you ever gotten the feeling when you just completely lose perspective of your future, what you want, who you are and why you're doing what you're doing?

Well, i'm in such a situation rn. Past few weeks I've been feeling really, really shit. I don't know how. A few weeks ago I went to Cambridge with a school trip. It was absolutely amazing, I had decided that I wanted to go to Cambridge (or at least try my best getting in.) That trip and the week after I was filled with motivation, joy while looking forward to all the preparations. I'm in my last year of high school, and want to go to college in the UK, and this was such a motivational boost.

Now, three weeks later, I feel horrible and it's like the motivation I had is gone with the wind. I don't know what to do, i've tried alot (vitamin D supplements, getting up early, working less) but nothing seems to help. I'm really afraid that this is going to affect my school grades (ergo getting into university) negatively.

762,"So I went to take basic English and computer knowledge tests for a call centre I applied for, passed the tests with a score of 79 out o 80, with the latter being the highest, as told by the HR representative who said that, besides hinting that I'm most likely getting the job, and to show up on Friday morning.

I was sacked from my last job for unjustifiable and completely bullshit reasons (long story) and I'm taking their case to court if a settlement isn't reached. Been there for almost four years.

Now, when I filled out a questionnaire for the job I'm applying for, I did not lie, and when asked the reason for leaving my last job, I said that I was fired without mentioning reasons. I was adviced not to lie although I wanted to even omit the company from my CV, and as far as I know I'm not a very good liar. 

I was told to show up on Friday, but then received the following email:

Dear [applicant],

Thank you for completing your first step toward your new career!

If you are selected to move forward in the process, you will be hearing from a member of [the company]. We will be thorough in our review of your application and greatly appreciate your patience.

Thank you again for your interest in a career with [the company]

Sincerely,

[the company]

I'm confused as to what they meant by this. On one hand, the HR lady who set up the tests told me to show up on Friday, that my score was super high, that I was the exception of the day, etc. She seemed very nice and friendly as well, and told me that there would be two additional tests to do on Friday.

On the other hand, I get this email which I responded and did not get an answer, and on the other I'm told to show up on Friday. I got the email after I was told to show up, and also suspect that it might have been an automatically generated email after doing the tests. 

So the question is, should I show up on Friday, or not show up? What would you do in my position. I forgot to mention that no-one answers in any of the numbers they have listed.

Show them how I write jokes and how much time is truly spent writing. Then show the open mics, and talk about the entire process, and basically show them that anyone can do this. And take them along my comedic journey. 
My questions are- is this a good idea? Do you think people would follow this? 
Second set of questions- how does one even start a social media page from scratch? What type of first post would I make to gain a following? Also, I assume my page would mostly be daily tweets/ or daily Instagram stories. 

Any advice would be so helpful. Thank you.",02Oct2019,1
771,"Hello all. This is my first time actually using Reddit and not just mindlessly browsing, so if I don’t do this right please bare with me. I came here to seek some much needed advice on what to do. I live in a nice housing community and have no complaints. The problem I have is that my neighbors that live a few houses down from me have been throwing their dog outside, all day and night.  It barks from about the time I get up for work (around 6 in the morning), until I leave, when I come home for lunch, and is still barking when I get home in the evening. Where I live, the summers aren’t too bad. The high is about 85 degrees, but that is still a bit too hot to be leaving a dog outside all day. Even though we are only a couple of weeks into fall, it’s already below 40 degrees at night, and about 60 in the day, with cold winds. I know that’s not safe for any living creature, human or animal. Yet, the poor dog is outside and barking into the night. I recently purchased ear plugs to suppress the barking noise so I can sleep, but now I am genuinely concerned that this dog is being neglected. I sometimes walk to retrieve my mail and I can hear the clanking of chains hitting the fence everytime I walk by, followed by aggressive growling and barking. So that leads me to believe the poor thing is tied up. Any advice on what I should do? At first it was the barking that bothered me, but now it’s the fact that the poor dog sits chained up all day is what’s really pushing me to call someone about it.",02Oct2019,1
772,"Hey reddit!

I have been thinking about my personality and behaviour a bit recently and wanted to gain some insight from others.

I'm a person that does not fall easily for new interests, but when I do I fall for them HARD. That topic will often consume my entire free time, not to the point that it interferes with my studies or personal life, but still to a great extent. In just a few days I will probably know more about it than the person who originally introduced me to it because I dive deep into every bit of info I can find about it. Depending on what it is it might well change my routine and schedule quite a bit and I fear that it sometimes borders on obsession. And this type of interest stays for a long time, it's not some quick fad, even though the relevance does lessen after some months or years. I just fear that it is both unhealthy for myself to devote myself to something so thoroughly. 

A recent example would be KPop. My best friend got me into it barely two months ago, but since then I've picked up learning Korean, started a KPop cover dance class together with her and at times feel like I do too much, not for me personally but for my friend. I'm a much more driven person than she is, and I fear that I hurt her - we created the group together even if I do most of the organising as she does not like doing that too much, and I feel that thats fine, but she started learning Korean almost half a year earlier than I did yet I'm already better than her because I actually study whereas she does not often. She does not say anything like that outright and I have no clue how to bring it up, but I think I know her well enough to notice this. But how would I go about this? I don't really want to stop studying something I enjoy, she doesn't really want to study together with me because she doesn't study in general. Just not mentioning it doesn't really work either because we often talk about or watch Korean shows or Music or artists together, where it inevitably comes up. 

And aside from her I find it weird how quickly I can change my entire life around something so insignificant. Again, barely two months ago I barely knew Korean Popculture and yet today half my hobbies revolve around it. I don't feel like it negatively impacts my life at all - I picked up a sport and a language, found new friends, I manage a group and I do stuff I enjoy. Still, I have this weird sour taste in my mouth as I wonder why I let myself go so hard over this. I know it'll last for a while because I know myself, but it still feels like I obsess too much. 

Let's be honest, I don't even know what kind of advice I want. But yeah, I needed to write this down somewhere. If any of you have any input, please let me know! Thank you for sitting through this rambling. Cheers!

Oh, and if you notice any mistakes, please tell me, English is not my first language and I still need to improve in several aspects of it!",02Oct2019,2

i recently started dating this guy. i’ll call him M. M is amazing. He matches all of my boxes and then some. I’ve never clicked with someone like I do with M. 

But there’s one problem. And it’s a major one. 

M doesn’t want kids. Not now, not ever. Which is absolutely fine by me. 

Except I have a three year old already. 

He doesn’t seem pressed about her now. He hasn’t made any strides to get to know her or even really speak to her when he’s here (they only see each other in passing, there hasn’t really been a “formal” meeting). 
I don’t mind right now because it’s all pretty new and he didn’t expect to have to deal with a kid along with a new relationship. 

But I’m worried. What if he never comes around to the idea of always being around a kid? What if I’m setting us up for failure by continuing a relationship with a man who I know doesn’t like kids? 

Extra maybe unimportant note, but I don’t really like kids either. I love mine and wouldn’t trade her for the world, but I wouldn’t want more and I totally understand his hesitation to want to interact with her. I just don’t want to put someone in our future wrongly.

Because I work I offered to take her out and treat her. She has literally ignored me as I know she’s been active on all social media platforms. I feel like she’s all for show and does not care. In the 4 years I’ve known her, she’s never wished me a happy birthday yet I was willing to go out of my way to take her out.

I gave him my advice and even got them together. I worked a little magic and they’ve been dating (or I assume so) for several months. I had both of them on my Instagram and liked a picture of them together and his comment on her post. Why would I not? I hooked them up... for some reason he unfollowed me right after. I feel like that was rude asf because I worked him through his shortcomings and hooked them up, when we weren’t even really friends and now I feel like the bad guy. I feel like maybe I did something wrong by liking the post and comment.

794,"Hello everyone. Here's a bit of backstory: About 2 years ago I was diagnosed with major depression. I was in highschool at the time and while I've tried hard I wasnt able to finish my 12th grade. Since then It's been 2 years and while a lot has happened, my mental health is still in very mediocre shape.


I just can't seem to be able to do anything productive. I was supposed to start my GED this past month but I wasn't able to go to class for more than 1 week. I got suicidal and ended up at the hospital... And so I took some time off and here I am, still in break... 


Why can't I be happy? I'm trying so hard and I always come back to this semi suicidal state where I feel like nothings worth doing. I mention to my father that I might take some more time off and then he got angry, arguing that if I just wanted to do nothing and sit at home all day, to simply say so and stop kidding everyone around me. That kind of hurt because I'm trying so hard, things just never get better it seems.


I've read on an ask reddit thread that if you ever feel like youre at the end of the line, why not just do something that you want to do before ending it all? And that advice kind of stuck with me. I don't think I could kill myself (not for now anyway) but I'm just so done living like this. Ive been trying for 2 years and I'm still back where I always end up.


This brings me to my question, maybe the usual path just isn't for me? Maybe school then university then job just isnt a viable path for me? Ive tried so many medication combination but nothing seems to work. I've been trying to go with what my family wants me to do, but so far, it hasent worked either. I feel like it's all a dead end and I'm not sure how Im gonna make it thru alive.


Ive given some thoughts to the question of what do I REALLY want to do and right now, I kind of feel like moving to Thailand and living simply for a few years. The climate is amazing (better than the 6 months of snow we have here in Canada), it's cheap, the people are great, etc. I'd be learning muay Thai maybe, working a couple hours per weeks at a chill job, studying Stoicism, meditating, hitting the gym, etc. It jjust sound like a life Id want to live, at least for a little while, because studying for the next 5 years of my life just aint it. Maybe eventually, when my mental health is more stable, but for now, I dont think thats what I want.

Option 1 (2 phones, 1 work and 1 personal):
Work would pay for my work phone as well as cover it’s monthly bill. I would pay for my personal phone and it’s monthly bill. This option would allow me to more easily separate work life from personal life, but i would have to pay for my new personal phone as well as it’s monthly bill.

Option 2 (1 phone for both work and personal):
Work would pay for a new phone as well as cover it’s monthly bill. I can use this for personal use and work. This option saves me money as I would now not have to buy a new phone or pay a monthly phone bill, but I now can’t really escape work on weekends, nights, and vacations.

2 things i’m considering are...

1. I’m not sure if I want to be bothered with work related calls and emails at night, on weekends, and on vacations.

797,"I'm young, naive, and frankly quite stupid and I know that. But I also feel like I'm wasting potential. 

I don't know what I'm good at. Or of I'm even good at anything. I love music. I've played ukulele for 5 years. I wouldn't say I'm good at it because I don't seem to practice anymore. 

I enjoy video games, or at least I used to. About a year ago was the last time I remember being happy and that was when I was a hermit. I'd sit on my dads computer for 8+ hours straight playing my favourite games with even better people. 

I have a job at a pizza place where I'm currently taking over as the manager. We're tiny and only have 10+ workers. But I've been working there since the beginning of the year. Barely any pay. 

Then I met some shitty people and they turned me into a shittier person. Doing things I never wanted to do before I met them. 

Now I'm away from it all. Doing the same thing I used to do a year ago but everything's different. This new group of people taught me a heartbreak I never thought I'd feel. Heartbreak from myself and officially loathing who I am. 

And my work schedule is practically daily. Today's my only day off and I'm so done with the world I'd rather trap myself in my room.

I've been depressed for as long as I can remember. Not caring about myself. I'd always care about everyone else. I'm trying to care for myself but nothing seems to work. Like I'm betraying something. 

My plans are to move in with two of my best friends that have stuck at my side through thick and thin. I have some cash saved up to buy the ticket and to try and help as much as I can. But in the end I'm scared I'll let them down too. 

I'm currently living with my dad and his girlfriend. I stopped talking to my mom early 2018. And I have chosen not to go back. I know I'm in a shitty place in my life and I'm making shittier decisions but when I have someone over my should telling me that every single day, I break. That's not parenting to me that mental illness. 

My dad is one of my favourite people but his girlfriend is like the devil on his shoulder. Because she's already raised two successful kids, she's the one trying to call the shots for me. But my dad and I agreed she wasn't family. Even though he loves her. 

Being in either home for me just made me more insane and I seeped back into my depression even more. Trying to live already is a war within myself and they don't make it any easier. But I know my friends can and will. At least to get me back on my feet.

I don't think back to my childhood often. But I know my parents went through some shit in their relationship when I was growing up. My fractured knowledge of what a relationship or a friendship should be is nothing but a small notepad of what it shouldn't be. 

I don't know who I am or how to figure it out. How do you center yourself and know you're going to be making the right decisions?

Any advice would help. Ask any questions you'd like.",02Oct2019,1

Then while walking to the bus after school got out I saw a girl wearing a scrunchie that looked like it could be mine. I asked her about it and she said her friend gave it to her last week (I coincidentally lost my scrunchie last week...). She also said it's from Amazon and came in a pack.

She was nice about it but my mom (who's a psychologist) says she could easily be lying.

I think I'll approach her tomorrow at the buses and ask her about it again cause I'd rather embarrass myself and get my scrunchie back than not get it back at all and let it eat me up inside.

So they ask each other if they think I took them, come to the conclusion it could only have been me, talk about my clothing choices, and some other things. I cannot stand gossip and I go out of my way to be kind so this hurt.

Today, I hear the same 2 and 1 other, and I freeze up, listening to them talk about someone. I'm paranoid at this point, and it sounds again like it's about me, (they mentioned things I say, and another physical characteristic) and the convo ended with them saying I'm definitely not normal. 

I have ADD, a healthy dose of social anxiety, and deppression, and do my absolute best to hide it. This can sometimes be crippling, as I'm always worried about how im interacting with people.

How should I handle this? Confront them even though I cant confirm? Drop hints that you can hear EVERYTHING? At this point I'm stressed about what they think of me, paranoid that they're talking behind my back, and overall disappointed in the entire environment. I like the job and dont want to dread coming in to office gossip everyday. Help?!",02Oct2019,2
804,"Hey Reddit! May be a dumb question but I’m not sure if I should follow up again with this in-person interview I had two weeks ago.

When I interviewed (Wednesday, Sep 18th) I thought it went pretty well. I was told that because they were looking to move things quickly, I would hopefully hear back early the next week. I know the manager is busy as he mentioned that he was going to be out of office wed-fri, but he told me to anticipate knowing by early that week. He also mentioned that their fiscal year was approaching so they were busy. After my interview, the hiring manager asked if I would be able to take a call early the next week (last week) while I was away on my trip. I told him yes and that I would be hiking, but I would be sure to call back if I miss it. While walking me out he was telling me about the gym and the other perks of working in the building. The additional manager I interviewed with stated in the interview I was the perfect candidate and had an ideal background. 

Flash forward to “early next week” (aka last week) when I was supposed to hear back...I got no email, no call. I sent a kind follow up on Thursday stating I was still eager about the opportunity and for him to get back to me at his earliest convenience once he returned to office. Now here we are, two weeks later and I still haven’t heard back. Should I call him? Honestly I’m upset because I feel like they wouldn’t have said that stuff if they didn’t think I was a good candidate. If I didn’t get the job that is ok, but I would rather know than not (I have bad anxiety and it’s looming). 

What are your thoughts/ should I follow up?

TL;DR I interviewed with a company two weeks ago and still haven’t heard from them even after sending an initial follow up a week later - should I follow up again?",02Oct2019,1

806,"some background:

i'm an indian american teen living in texas. these past few days have been part of an important hindu holiday which lasts for nine nights. every night, people participate in dances called garba and dandiya. they usually occur inside a temple or large hall. i usually go every year, with people i know from school, and usually on fridays/saturday's cause of school.

so, my parents have been insisting that i go this weekend. but honestly, i don't want to, because

1. i'm really tired. i've had a lot of homework this past week and i have not been getting enough sleep. i just want to lay in bed on friday and saturday night.
2. i don't like the people who go. a lot of people from my school's indian american group are going, as they do every year. i don't like them because there's almost always drama and gossip, and they usually just form a giant group and stand there taking more pics than dancing. i feel really uncomfortable around them, and i never got along with them very well. they're basically the popular kids.
3. it's very loud and crowded. especially on weekends. the music gives me a headache and i'm constantly bumping into people and my feet get stepped on every 2 minutes. (everyone gets in big circles and dances, following one another)

overall, i'm just not a fan of the event. i really like dancing but i can't stand that place (it usually happens in a local temple)

i told my parents all of the reasons above, but they won't listen. they keep telling me to go because apparently i don't have a lot of friends and i need to spend more time with people (honestly i'm just an introvert and i'm happy the way i am now. i don't like the people who go there anyway, and i've known them for years. sorry if that makes me sound crappy)

i've been fighting with my parents every day cause of this. its honestly not that big of a deal if i don't go (like it's not mandatory religiously or anything, and i'm not even religious anyway) but they're making it seem like i'm committing a crime. my mom got so mad at me today it was kind of scary, she just refused to talk to me.

i feel like they think i'm going to have fun if i go but i know that like every year i'll get a headache or feel tired and just leave early, or even fake that stuff to leave early. 

i even asked my mom if there were any events held in a different place where there weren't as many people. she refused to answer and i asked her two more times before she yelled and said i should go look it up myself, since ""you always do what you want anyways, whats the point in me telling you anything""

i'm just so pissed i don't want to go and they don't seem to understand that the event makes me feel shitty. i don't know how to convince them to let me stay at home, besides, its not like they go anyways. i usually just go with people i know.",02Oct2019,1
807,"Hi! So I have thought about things for a long time. It’s about my mom. I have graduated college and I am living at home to save money and move out in the next year or so. 

Regardless, my mom has quit two jobs since I have been home (1 1/2 years). The first job her boss was emotionally abusive to her and the other employees. She would come home so stressed out. When she told me that she was quitting, I got concerned because we had been in a situation where we were very tight on money (my last semester of college) and I willingly paid for everything since I had some money from my savings. 

The second job, she was happier but didn’t want to stay for too long until she found a better, more stable job. She still comes home, a little stressed. We always talk about our days together and when she does she can get very rude saying “I can’t wait to tell someone off tomorrow” and will laugh right afterwards. I would always get confused as to why she would laugh.

She has also been very condescending when I would want to be by myself. For example, we all have different shows that we would watch every night. I don’t mind if she comes and sits with me, but when I don’t talk to her for not even 10 minutes, she gets mad and storms out of the room. I never said “you need to leave” or “go away”. She assumes that I don’t want to talk to her.

Another example, I have started to eat better since I’ve been home. I usually know what to eat and what not to eat. I also have joined a gym just to get out of the house. When she asks me what I am eating, it’s always in a nosy kind of way, like “what is on your plate?” “Why are you eating that?” I just simply tell her that’s it’s fish or rice. She huffs and storms away. When I ask her what’s wrong, she tells me “I didn’t cook that for you! Why didn’t you tell me what you were making?” So I stand there and say “I don’t know. I’m sorry.”

I have thought about going to therapy just because it can get an awkward vibe in my house, even though I don’t realize I’m doing anything wrong. I’m not ungrateful for either of my parents, they have supported me and I have thrived after graduating. But I don’t know what to do. 

I feel like she assumes that things are against her, when nothing is wrong. I never talk back to her, ever! Is there anything to say to my mom without walking in eggshells? Please help, thanks!",02Oct2019,4

810,"*my other reddit account that I’ve had for years is the same username as my Instagram and I want to keep my sister’s identity private. NOT A TROLL*

Today at my high school we had a sexual assault/consent presentation. They basically outlined what’s considered consensual sex, and what’s considered assault. I’m a senior, and my little sister is a sophomore. She too had to attend the same presentation. On the drive home from school I asked what she thought about it, only to give me a shoulder shrug. I didn’t think much of it. As I was on my way out to baseball practice, she asked why I was leaving. I told her that it was my usual evening practice, and then she pleaded with me not to go. I sat on the couch with her while she cried her eyes out. I just held her, and asked what was wrong. She said the assembly was triggering for her. I asked exactly what she meant and she told me something she had been keeping to herself for years. 

About 4 years ago, for a short time, we lived in an apartment complex, after my mom and dad’s divorce. My mom worked with my aunt at her tax firm so she was gone from 8 am to 8 pm most of the week. We had some sweet neighbors that lived on the floor below us. They were older, about late 50’s, and had made friends with my mom and said they would watch out for us. The wife was battling cancer at the time so she spent most of her days sleeping and resting and her husband was a retired electrician. Sometimes I would get picked up by my friends, and hang out with them after school while my sister would be at home by herself, and the wife would send her husband to bring her food since she was by herself. My sister told me that he would do things to her at those times, and then pass it off to his wife that he had dinner with her and kept her company. He would do all the terrible things that you would expect a child rapist to do. I am in shock about this. I’m so sick to my stomach and most of all, my sister thinks it’s her fault and has locked herself in her room. My mom is due home soon, and I don’t think my sister wants to tell anyone else. I’m not sure what to do. And before anyone says to report the guy to the police, he passed away shortly after we moved from diabetic complications. His wife called my mom devastated. I’m not sure if she beat her cancer or not, so I have no idea if she is still alive. I feel terrible and like I want to throw up. I want to be there for her but for now she’s shut me out. I feel like I failed as a big brother, and that I should have been there to keep her safe.",02Oct2019,2
812,"I (26 M) was visiting my parents house for the weekend when they asked me to go upstairs to get something from my (24 M) brothers room. His room used to be my old room so I am pretty familiar with it. When I opened the cabinet I found a  dildo with one of those suction things to stick it to surfaces. I ran out of the room and did not tell any of the family. Now, I'm not passing judgement. I have two fleshlights and a fleshlight launch. I just feel strange because I have never ever thought he might be gay or bi. We have always talked about girls but he's only had a couple of girlfriends. I would not care if he was bi or gay at all and I don't even know how to bring it up and I already feel like shit for invading his privacy. Our family is not religious and our family would not care if he was gay. How do you think I should handle this situation, because if he is gay I want him to know it's fine and that he can come out to the family and no one would think any different of him. Do you guys think he's gay or maybe just enjoys playing with a dildo? Should I even approach him about it?

813,"Hi, I’m a 22(M) that works full time, in a relationship and balances school at the same time. May not sound like much but I’m having a hard time trying to keep up with my class, only one class, this semester.

For some context: My work shifts are usually 5am-2pm every day and sometimes Midnight shifts. I’m currently taking an online class that doesn’t require me to be on the school campus.

 I’ve always struggled with school and have always been an average student. This is now my 6th semester and I’m going through the same cycle again where I lose track of school and lose motivation for it. I like to think that I’m a student where if a class doesn’t interest me, I don’t give it the time of day. I know school is important and it’ll get me the career that I’m looking for in the end but as of right now I can’t see the finish line, and if I do it’s very far away.

I make decent money for my age living in the Bay Area and it supports me well enough but not enough to pay rent and bills with added ‘lifestyle’ purchases on top of it. My job can be pretty laborious for the most part and can tire me out towards the end of my shift. By the time I come home all I want to do is sit down and relax, grab something to eat, shower if I need to and wait until my GF is off of work and then head over to her place to hang out.

I guess what I am asking is how do I manage to put school as a priority first before I get to do all the “fun things” I want to do after work. It seems like the only thing I’m looking forward to is my paycheck every week because I know that my hard work payed off and I got rewarded for it. Whereas school seems to have no reward atm and won’t pay off until the very end. It scares me because I don’t want to be stuck as this current job forever, but I know the only way I’ll be able to improve is to stay with school.

While suffering the entire time and still doing well, toward the end of my college career, my suffering from a bunch of psychological issues including manic bipolar depression, drug addiction and also coping with the death of my father became debilitating, not to mention I had no other choice but to work 40-50 hours a week while taking 5 classes at a time.

817,"Hello, 

In need of some advice regarding renting my flat. I’m 26, and bought my flat in December. 
Bought it as part of the perfect five year plan. Basically applied to go back to uni for five years, didn’t want to still be renting at 31 so used my inheritance towards a flat. However, plan went to pot and now I have a flat and it’s too much commitment for me. 

I want to move to a new a new city to study but don’t want to sell the flat. Anyone have any advice to offer? It’s a really nice flat, two bedroom, and perfect location for transport and city centre, just a little off the beaten track. 

Just want to know if any current landlords out there ever struggle to rent their property? Is it worth getting tenants in or should I try stick it out in the flat and study in the same city? How stressful is it? On average, how long do tenants usually stay? Would you recommend using and agency or doing it alone?

821,"I'm 18 (F) and my boyfriend is 23. I live with him currently and have found out more about him now than before which was expected as we were online dating for a long time.   
Yesterday we went to visit an old friend of his and they talked about drug use. Like how they tried shrooms and LSD. I knew about his past drug use and am okay with it as all of my immediate family smoke weed and I have friends who do shrooms. I personally don't do drugs of any kind besides maybe eating a few edibles on occasion.   


The part that freaked me out was when his friend brought up the fact he now does ketamine and wanted my boyfriend to try it. This kind of freaked me out because I think ketamine is one of the more intense drugs because you snort it and it's some kind of tranquilizer.   


After we left his friend's house I asked if he actually would try it and he said yes. This kind of freaked me out more and i'm not very good at expressing discomfort with other's actions for many, many reasons. So I tried to be neutral but expressed concern. He went on to say it's not a 'big deal' and his friend has a lot of health problems so it's most likely safe also that he'd only try it once. After awhile of me kind of being concerned and a bit childish (I go silent and start fidgeting when I panic/get worried/ feel really uncomfortable) he said he probably wouldn't try it. This made me feel bad Because I feel like I pressured him into it but that wasn't my intention, i'm just really bad at confrontation and expressing my discomfort.    


I'm still a bit worried because I feel like i'm holding him back from things he wants to do and it's his life but I get this really bad feeling about him doing ketamine or wanting to try drugs like that. How do I talk to him about this without sounding 'controlling' or stupid? Am I in the wrong for feeling uncomfortable about what he chooses to do? Like is ketamine really not a big deal?

827,"Hello! Glad you stopped by! Well lets begin, I'm writing this because this feels like something I cannot/will not tell people about and i'd like to hear some of your guys advice, so thus you are my outlet to feelings that I cannot explain to people for fear of scaring them. I'll start off with letting you guys know that I'm currently a sophomore in college and I've had a ""nice life"". Born into an upper middle class family we had our struggles (as does everyone) but my quality of life from this point of view could be seen as amazing. I'm here to tell you why its not and why I need help.

It all started my first year of college my girlfriend from highschool who I'd been in a relationship for 3 years has cheated on me. When she told me I immediately ran to the bathroom and threw up.... I still don't know why that was my response but none the less she proceeds to tell me how I'm a terrible person and that It was MY fault she did the things she did. This didn't help the fact that the self-talk I had  (ya know the voice in your head) had been 90% negative since I was a young boy. So i spiraled out of control I started smoking weed heavily to counteract/ignore my feelings and it worked (for the most part) I then focused more on myself still having very negative self talk occasionally thoughts such as ""maybe i should just end it"" or ""maybe ill just kill myself"" and found myself pondering how I would do it but these thoughts slowed when I was alone and single. 

The tables turned for me a few months later I focused heavily on work and growing my YouTube channel to I size I thought could never happen and I met a new girl she was kind and always liked being around me. We would leave our houses and actually just drive around till about 4AM talking and we had a ton in common. I eventually ended up taking a trip to Colorado with this girl for a weekend flying out there then driving back. Then a few months later she started slowly talking to me less and the relationship fizzled, but I still really liked her. I ended up in a skiing accident about a week later fracturing 3 vertebra and almost paralyzing myself and she came to the hospital to see me, even gave me a stuffed animal with her perfume sprayed on it. Now I had known she was talking to other guys at this point but I was just glad to see her. About a week after that she just stopped hanging out with me and contacting me unless I initiated it, I understood but was upset, after all I had done so much with this girl and still really liked her. My depression worsened after this I started to do the only thing I knew how to cope with weed, this eventually led to me taking LSD and experiencing 3 hours of bliss and beauty then another 9 of pure panic attack and feeling as if I died, I tried calling her during the trip to help me she just left me on read. a few months later weed stopped working as well to mask my feelings I started taking Xanax infrequently to drown my pain and thoughts of suicide and inadequacy. soon after that I became a recluse sleeping until 2PM just to go to my 3PM shift then stay up all night smoking then eventually taking a Xanax to stop feeling, I stopped doing YouTube as I felt no will whatsoever to get up and be productive. This eventually led to me mixing Xanax with alcohol to shut up my negative self talk I would always force upon myself  

Fast forward a few months and I'm here still a daily smoker and I do still take Xanax i'll be it about 20% what I would normally take at night but I still cannot get rid of the negative self talk that I have I frequently find myself hating who I am. How do i fix this.",02Oct2019,1
828,"Hi! Please excuse the block of text, because this is kind of a long story. I could really use any input, especially if you work in Human Resources or are a manger!

So, I’ve been working at a local branch of a national non-profit for going on two years. I was hired to be ½ of a team that assists and counsels participants age 17-24 as part of a grant funded program. The job was split evenly between the two of us, and after I got the hang of it, I really started to enjoy it (and I also really liked my coworker—we’ll call her B.) I found that I was decent at the job too, which made it even better. B and I would commiserate about our supervisor, a super quiet, passive gentleman who has the worst communication skills imaginable and often got overwhelmed (we’ll call him M). But, since he generally didn’t care what we did and was hands-off, it was tolerable.

Well, last October, the company did an overhaul and a lot of the dynamics changed. B applied for a promotion in a different program that I wasn’t interested and got it, so it was just me left. M got a huge promotion as well— he is still my superior, but now he facilitates and oversees ⅓ of the entire corporation. To say he has a lot on his plate is an extreme understatement! I was suddenly a small fish in a big pond when it came to M, but I was excited to prove myself and enjoyed not having a direct supervisor anymore. While they looked to hire someone else, I was a one-(wo)man show, and was thriving. I loved it. When I heard talks about bringing a co on for me in order to satisfy the grant stipulations, I sat down with M to ask if that was really necessary, or if I could apply for a small raise and continue running it by myself. I also floated the idea that maybe the co didn’t need to be full time. I was immediately shot down, and they moved forward with hiring a new co— a hiring process that took 5 MONTHS. 

I don’t even need to give the new co an acronym because she was terrible and barely lasted 2 months before leaving. While she was there, not much changed— I was still doing all the work. However, now I watched as M allowed new co to get paid for doing nothing, while I busted my ass day in and day out. It’s been a month since new co left, and once again, I am alone. Still doing all the work, and M is getting berated for having a program with such a high turnover rate. I’m doing 2 people’s job for one meager salary. Again I fielded the concept of changing the program to M...again I was shut down. I decided to take further steps, and approached the division VP (S). S is M’s boss, and has been keeping a keen eye on M since his promotion, since he knows M struggles with communicating as appropriately as a leader should.

S is AMAZING. He is a kindly gentleman who is a pastor in his free time, and is extremely eloquent, patient, and considerate. He invited me into his office and we had a long talk, which ended with him requesting an outline for an ideal program concept from me. I happily created that, and we had several subsequent meetings in which he began to piece out how my program could work if I was promoted as a supervisor (essentially M’s old job). We talked logistics, he invited me to present outcomes at cabinet meetings, I formally created a portfolio and requested a title change, and we even began to talk about salary increases— S verbally suggested a 15% raise, which I happily accepted.  He mentioned that the grant holders have been impressed with my work, and have been hard on the company to promote me or otherwise reward me for doing twice the work when others have quit. These 1:1 meetings were at least an hour long each time, so it’s not like I’m assuming anything or reading between the lines. Everything was laid out in conversation and I left each time absolutely thrilled. Now, everything wasn’t always perfect every meeting. S gave me things to work on, which were often hard to swallow, and said I’d go through the standard probationary period that everyone at the company experiences when they move up a level. He also was very transparent and empathetic regarding M during our talks, saying that he has concerns about if M can handle his new role and asking about my experiences working under M. I gave responses that were honest, but diplomatic. S told me that, in no uncertain terms, I was talented and needed to believe that I can do great things within the company, and that he’d love to give me that opportunity. I felt great. S highly suggested I write a formal email to M outlining what I think I need to work on so that we’re all on the same page for the probationary period, and I did, and also forwarded said email to S. He also said I could begin looking to interview someone to be on my staff (the plan was that I’d take on a supervisory role and have someone who worked for me.)

Fast-forward to today. S is out all week at a training, and M has been incredibly standoffish and avoidant towards me lately. However, today he called me into his office for a meeting in which he negated everything S said in previous meetings and scoffed at my “assumption” that I’d be getting a promotion. He went so far as to say that he has concerns about me in any other role besides the one I’m currently in, and so I immediately knew he hasn’t read the email in which I addressed these concerns and shared my plan to fix them. He also said that I had no right going to his supervisor (S) and that I should have just brought it up to him (I had in the past, remember? And got immediacy shut down.) He also said that he never approved any ideal program (but S did, and he’s the one who requested it from me,) and that they already hired me a co and he (M) will remain the supervisor of my program, along with his new current role that he can barely handle. Everything he said was the exact opposite of S and I felt like I was being gaslighted and that M was being spiteful.

I was very, very upset. I outlined all of this in an email to S, knowing that he was offsite and busy but would eventually read it.  Later that day, I was asked to go to HR, in which it came up that M told her that I was acting as if I’d get a promotion and insinuated that I’m stepping on toes. HR said that S never brought any of this information her way, and that she couldn’t imagine how I’d get a raise because the budget was so tight. I felt so helpless, and like she immediately took M’s side without seeing/caring about allllllll the evidence I’ve had from my meetings with S. She said that she’d talk to S on Monday, but that this was an M decision and she reiterated that i should have left it with M. An hour after I left her office, I got a calendar invite in my email to attend a meeting with her on Monday. No other information; no word if S or M will be there. At this point, M is straight-up ignoring me as I try to do day-to-day work with him in the office. 

My question is: What do you think I should expect/aim for from Monday’s meeting? I am so, super nervous about it. I have debilitating anxiety that manifests itself in tears, even if I’m not overtly sad or frustrated or mad. It’s like they’re involuntary, anticipatory tears! It’s one of the things both S and M have said I have to work on if I got a leadership role, and I have; that was even one of the areas of weakness that I outlined in my email. S also said I need to be more assertive, which is why I’ve stepped out of my comfort zone in order to facilitate these meetings and craft these plans and emails. Now I feel like this assertiveness was off-putting. I’m afraid I’m going to waver or tear up in the meeting and I won’t be taken seriously. I’m also afraid that S is going to make me look like a crazy person and stop supporting me like he has during our previous 1:1 meetings. Even if I don’t get a promotion, I’ll still have to work under M; I feel like he’s acting this way to be spiteful and I know that if he “wins” then I will secretly feel spiteful and it’ll affect my work. If I don’t get the promotion, should I ask to be transferred to another branch because M isn’t being fair? I feel like S would take that seriously and be afraid of losing me. I’m fairly young but I’m book smart and I’ve always been described as mature and capable. Two programs that are adjacent to mine are directed by people younger than myself who have been with the company less time, so I know the concept isn’t out of the question. Also, I really really need this raise. I know everyone could use more money, but I need it in order to make rent. And frankly, I feel like my work output deserves it! I feel like my company is taking advantage of me because they know I’m sensitive and I like my job, and I don’t know how to proceed on Monday. 

TL; DR— I feel like I’m being gaslighted; I’ve been all but promised a promotion from a higher-up since I’ve been going above and beyond in my work, and now my direct supervisor (who I see/deal with daily,) is denying it and being impossible to work with.",02Oct2019,1

The title says it. I'm just attracted to my friend. I've only known her for over a year. Not until recently did I feel that way toward her. When she flirts with me, touches me, I feel comfortable, and I like it too. 

It really started when we were hanging out with our friends months ago. We were basically cuddling on the couch while everyone else was spread out. She was holding me and I was leaning on her. She kissed my face and I kissed her head..I know friends don't really do that like my best friend doesn't do that to me. Why would she. I don't know. She always finds reasons to touch me, especially in areas like my boobs or butt, my leg, and she comes behind me and hugs me. I don't touch her as much as she does, cause I'm scared it's just her messing around. 

I'm not looking for a real relationship, not with her or anyone, I want my freedom. Just want to get with her or something. I'm home alone for the month and want to invite her over and see what happens. I'm really confused as I've never been with a girl other than a kiss but want to try more.

832,"Since my childhood, my mom would often give me advice or try to get me to do something. For example she would often come to me at the end of the holidays and tell me to start doing a little bit for school. I knew I had to do it and it wouldn't have been to difficult for me to do it, but somehow the fact that she told this to me build some sort of frustration.

 I don't want to get angry at her because I know  what she tells me is certainly the right thing to do and she's taking care of me by doing it. I often thought of what I would think of the situation if I was an observer from the outside and I often didn't find it wrong at all. But during the moment she talks to me, often anger builds up inside of me and I was frustrated because anything she said and how she said it was more or less fine. I feel like Im unable to express myself. Often I say nothing and act annoyed when in fact I would like to share to her what made me angry and take her advice. The problem is not that she's not opened to listen to me or talk, but the fact that I dont know what I am angry about. She is a not yelling at me, being rude or anything.

I talked briefly about this with friends, some had no trouble taking advices, some didn't like getting their parents advices but none of them seemed to have my problem of feeling powerless to my mom giving me advices. I would like to just be able to take them positively.

835,"Hello.

I am trying to provide help to a trans friend of mine. She has been repeatedly harassed by other students at her school and has been physically assaulted. She has had threats against her life. She is fearful to tell the school because, so far they have done nothing, and the school would tell her parents, who would punish her for causing a ruckus. Her parents are unwilling to help because they are unsupportive of her.

She wants to report the death threats and assault to the police, but they will probably tell her parents.

Her school has proven that they are unwilling to assist and have actually attempted to blame her.

The question is what should she do? What can she do? Is this something that the police should get involved in?

A few additional notes: 
She lives in North Carolina. She’s in middle school. Harassed by other middle schoolers and high schoolers.

no phone in my room (so i can rarely text or facetime people, at least i have my computer), no dating, can't hang outside of home anywhere without a trusted adult (even if i'm with friends, so thats why i don't hang out with anyone), must get straight A's, and they keep pushing me to study either medicine or STEM related fields, neither of which i have any interest in.

my dream is to become a musician, make music, live in an urban area, spend a lot of time outside, etc. i know that might sound kind of silly but i can't imagine myself working a regular 9-5 job.

but they won't let me express myself. i want to dye my hair, dress in cool patterns and colors, all that stuff but they're against it and want me to be as simple and normal as i can be

i sound like a really angsty teen, lol sorry, but i honestly just want to express myself and learn music and make art. i'll still focus on school, but the whole ""get straight A's"" thing stresses me out to the point where i don't get enough sleep at night cause i stay up late studying. 

a few years ago i wanted to learn how to play guitar so i asked for one for my birthday and my dad got me one, but i got busy with school right after and he got angry saying i wasn't interested and returned it. i was pretty angry tbh

idk how to convince them do let me have more freedom, is there any way i can do this stuff while still living under their roof? please, no ""wait until you're 18 and then move out"" because it would be really difficult to wait that long and also to support myself at that age",02Oct2019,2

I have been at the company for 6 months and I was recently promoted to a manager position. When I was offered the position last friday, there was no mention of a possible pay raise. I told my boss that I would think about it.

Of course I thought about the pay portion of this new position and would definitely want a pay raise.

861,"Never thought i would be asking reddit for help. But let me start by explaining my job.

I use a pressure washer, and chemicals to clean screens. Not phone screens. Printing press screens (the stencils they use to put designs on shirts.) Its a good job. It fits with my school schedule and my coworkers are awesome. Its not hard either. But you do need to lift alot, and you have to be fast. 

Now i can only work 4 hours a day due to school. The other four hours belong to another girl. Introducing lazy, bitch or LB. I havent met her but shes allegedly 400+ lbs, always on her phone, rude, and incredible sensitive. The daily goal for screens cleaned is 20. AT LEAST. Ive seen her leave 15 clean screens at MOST. This is a ridiculously low amount. For comparison in much smaller (5ft 4) much weaker i assume (lifting 80lbs max atm) and i clean 30+ screens a day. 

Just to rly prove my point, because im so fast sometimes i dont leave any screens to clean. By the morning she will have only 5 or so to clean. My manager had to tell me to leave 10 at least for her at the end of every day so she can get hours.....okay. Im polite so i listen. So on days where im forced to only do 15-20 i have to TRY to go slow. Like on days like today. I normally never pull out my phone at work. (thats why im fast). I have so much time, i write this whlle post. 

Anyways, she was suppost to get fired. (woo hoo! i can get hours!) But that was weeks ago. (why wont my boss fire her!). Thats basically the backround. But also everyone at work agrees with me except my manager who shes buddy buddy with so she can ""never do wrong!"". 

Two days ago i left up a sign ""Please wash mostly 150-165 mesh. Were low :) (check downstairs if were out up here!)"" I added that last part because she NEVER carries the screens uo the stairs because its the hardest part of our job. But that means i have to carry twice the load when i shouldnt have to. The next day i found it in the trash, and there were few 150-165 mesh's cleaned at all. I put it up again. Today its down, but 15 150-165 mesh's have been cleaned, sweet. My manager then tells me ""yeah uh, dont put up that sign again. LB flipped out on it because she feels ""dominated"" by you. I tried to calm her down but she was really upset. No more signs ok?"".  

I need this chic fired. Im sacrificing hours for her so she can have some too. Im dealing with doing all the extra chores of the job (cleaning, re filling, emptying bins ect.), im carrying ALL the screens when i shouldnt have to. On top if that, she NEVER cleans anything extra. That means every month I have to clean the filter. I have to dump out the dump tank. Both things are extremely hard but neccesary. 

She has to go. I can obviously handle the job myself. How do i ask my boss to fire her without his brother knowing (my manager). Or how can i frame her to get fired at least.

862,"I'm a 16 yr old girl in 11th grade and I started smoking weed about two months ago, beginning of August. For the first month, I was really good at hiding my ""materials"" and my parents didn't have a clue that I was doing it. But then, about a month ago, my mom caught me smoking weed. She's been on my toes about it ever since. Last night was when she got SUPER nosy about it. I guess while I was sleeping, she looked around my room for the bag that I kept all my stuff in and she eventually found it. My dad gave me a talk about it this morning which is how I know they had it (albeit he was pretty cool about it, my mom is a different story tho lmao). I don't know if they just put the bag somewhere or if they destroyed everything. I know that they got rid of the weed (sad) but idk about the papers, lighters, ect.

I brought up flunking school because, well, I'm flunking. I failed four courses last semester, and I haven't been attending my classes this semester either. Depression has been kicking my ass since last year and I haven't gotten any help or support for it so... I'm kinda just existing as of right now. Things are much better than they were a couple months ago, but I'm still in this tight spot. Anyway, weed is just one of those things that gives me temporary happiness. Or at least something to actually feel when I'm having a depressive episode.  I smoke multiple times per day and I'll catch myself daydreaming about how good of a joint I'll roll once I get home from school.

865,"So for some background I have always been extremely naturally skinny. I was a picky eater until about two years ago (I’m 17) but I was still pretty thin, like underweight. I was used to being nagged about eating but since I was really picky I only liked certain foods and didn’t really get hungry for reasons I don’t know. My dad and his side of the family gave me their thinness.

Now, I’ve never struggled with weight or appearance other than the fact that in my early teens I hated being thin. I saw how my friends had more womanly bodies and I was jealous. 

Im 17 now and i can say that i have more shape which I like but I gained a significant amount of weight where my family points it out and kind of analyze me. That makes me SO uncomfortable. 

I went through a difficult time last year (death of a family member and surgery) which caused me to be pretty thin. I was too anxious to eat well enough or spent too much of my time studying. I was 5’ 7” and like 105 pounds ish (less on most days, but I’m not even sure tbh). 

In 3 months or so I gained around 20 pounds which really doesn’t seem healthy to me. I got a job and can’t fit eating well into my schedule so I opt for unhealthy foods more often now. 

I actually really love my body. I’m finally not severely underweight according to my BMI and I have a womanly shape. I think it just makes me upset that people are commenting on my body and almost forcing me to look back on how I used to look and making it into a negative thing rather than positive. It makes me critique myself and I hate that and want it to stop before this whole things turns into something else. 

Has anyone that have experienced this give me any advice?",02Oct2019,1
866,"Hello all,

Baout two months ago my parents moved out of the city and to a small town - they did this due to health concerns and I also had to move out on my own to stay within the area to a small apartment.

We had our cat go missing (he was an indoor outdoor when we adopted him from the humane society 12 years ago) he was gone from February until September which now he has reappeared at the animal services in the city.

They left messages on my grandmother's phone telling her to pick up the cat or she would be fined (unsure of how they received her number) but my grandmother is quite old we and didn't think our car which had been missing for such a long amount of time would ever show up agian.

I am in no position to take the cat as my apartment is pet friendly and my parents have our dog (older dog, trained) and are taking care of him as the dog and my father were inseparable.

Today mail was forwarded to my parents new house for a fee of $600. I tried to speak with the humane society but as I was not on the list (I was very young when we adopted) they will only speak with my parents who are hours away or my grandmother who is very house ridden.

I am not quite sure what to do and they are charging by day which means another 600$ bill will come in a month.

Tldr;lost cat reappears months later after both my parents and I moved. Humane society is charging us.",02Oct2019,0
867,"I have a really close friendship with a girl, and recently I have started to develop feelings for her. I invited her to prom, and she accepted and seemed excited. She invited me back to her prom, but both proms are the same day, so we won't be able to go to each other's prom.

The problem is that she has been giving me mixed signals, like telling me that I look cute in my new profile photo, asked me to go watch It 2 in the cinema with her, but also she takes too long to text back (2-3 days) and she tells me about her crushes.

I don't know I if should tell her that I like her, because I feel like it might ruin the friendship, and even if she likes me back she is going to leave my country the next year to go to college. What should I do?",02Oct2019,3
