0,"Hey, reddit!  I've recently been having sexual feelings towards some women. I haven't acted on them because well, 1. I'm awkward and 2. I'm not the most attractive so I don't like to approach anyone to flirt.

I don't know exactly where to go from here. If I do meet someone and go out with her, do I say something like oh hey this is a first for me? Meeting guys is easy because Tinder or whatnot. Do I do the same thing for girls? HELP. I AM SO LOST.",16Jun2019,1
1,"This past year has been the worst of my life, easily. I'm 20 now, and ever since I turned 19 it's just been awful.

My gf of a year and a half broke up with me a few weeks before my bday in late May of last year. Since then I've been with one other girl, didn't date her, relationship was on and off for about 3 weeks.

Ever since she broke up with me my life has just been awful. I had the worst semester of college, and dropped my GPA significantly. My first summer back home was terrible, I was so depressed over her that I wouldn't eat, I couldn't sleep, I just wanted to fucking die. I had to move back when school started and I was commuting and living with my father. He's an emotionally abusive alcoholic who would constantly put me down and be absolutely shit faced every night, I honestly believe if I was smaller than him or wasn't as strong he would've physically abused me too. I had no friends up in college, because I commuted I was never forced to be around people and that combined with him just destroyed my college expirience. This made it so for the entire month of August I just layed in bed, alone, sick, and crying over my ex. I tried reconnecting with her. I was the reason for the break up, I wasn't a bad bf but I did enough lying where she just couldn't trust me, I don't blame her, she was too good for me and I always knew that. I just thought that if I had her back in my life, even as a friend, I'd feel happy again. But it didn't work, I just couldn't help falling in love with her, and she didn't talk to me the same way she used to. I went from the light of her world to some dude she doesn't even consider a close friend, and it still guts me. Eventually around October , after a few months of trying to keep some sort of relationship with her, I just stopped. It's really a long story, I made a whole other post about it a while ago. 

I failed every single class my next semester, now I'm suspended for a year. I just didn't care enough to go to class. 


But I'm doing better now. Eventually I moved back with my mother, the only caring parent I've had, and am away from my father. I started exercising again and am getting back into shape. My plan is to work this whole next year and re apply at another school, I figure I'm only 20 so all my highschool grades are still eligible and my SAT and ACT scores as well. 


But I'm still so depressed. It's over a year and I still miss my ex. She was my soul mate, I've accepted that there's just always gonna be apart of me that loves her and cares about her. I don't even think she thinks of me anymore, she has a new college bf who's way better than I ever was, she's happy. But I still love her, if she asked me to drive her across the country and for all of my money right now, after months and months of no contact, I'd gladly do it in a heart beat, just to be in her presence again.


I'm just so starved for affection. I'm never truly happy. I'll smile, I'll enjoy doing things with my friends (the limited number I even have anymore because I'm a loser). But at the end of the day all I want is to come home and lay in bed and nuzzle my head into a girls chest, tell her I love her and fall asleep. I want someone to cuddle up to me so I can stroke their hair. I want another pair of big beautiful eyes to look at me and tell me how much they adore me. It beats any drug I've ever tried. It's the most amazing feeling in the world, and I don't have it and I won't have it for some time and even if I did it would never be the same as having it with her. 

I just wish I could live any single day that I was with her over and over again. Days where I'd come over to her house and we'd cuddle and watch a movie together, and id just spend all day holding her or her holding me. I'd live any one of those days over and over again for an eternity, my entire existence could be dedicated to one day with her and it would be better than any form my life could take from here on out. She was perfect and I was too stupid and emotionally immature to realize that my actions could turn her love for me sour. We were just obsessed with eachother and I destroyed it.

I'd never try to get her back now. Love is selfish, I want to, I really really do. Some night I look at my phone and just want to message her. Even if she messaged me and told me ""I hate you"", there'd be a brief moment where I'd be happier than I have been in over a year, just because I heard from her. Then I'd probably kill myself. Honestly, it's not much of a debate in my mind, if I ever found out she hated me or she told me she did I'd kill myself, my soul couldn't take it.


I should just stop being a freak and get over her, but I can't. I just want her to show up to my house, lay down next to me and hold me in her arms. I'm such a fucking failure, I'm doing nothing with my life while everyone around me is on their right tracks. 

I'm making steps to improve my life. Like I said, I've been exercising and losing weight, I'm finding work to make some money. My plan is to drop out and then re apply after saving money for a year so I can get out of home and go to some city and start a new life. But at best I won't be able to do that for a year, at least.


This is right now and it sucks, it sucks and I just need her. She's the only thing that really made me feel like my life would be worth something. She's the first girl I ever looked at and wanted, needed, to spend the rest of my life with her. I've cried more over her than every other event in my life combined. I'm utterly obsessed with her and I don't know what to do. I'd give anything just to hold her for a minute, and have her stroke my hair.

I'm crying again, this sucks. I just want it to end, I want that love back, it's all I care about. I'd gladly work a dead end job making pennies if I could come home to her every day. But I know she deserves better, she's literally one in a million and the only thing that brings me true happiness is knowing her life is improving. I just miss her so much.",16Jun2019,1
2,"First: I’m not entirely sure if this is the right sub to post this, so I’m sorry if it isn’t. I’ll be glad to post it elsewhere if you have any other suggestions. 

Okay, so I’m a college student with a temporary job that pays about $8.30 an hour and I average about 50 hours biweekly. I have an iPhone 6s but the charging port is messed up and I’m looking to replace it. I want to stick with Apple because I’m used to it and I like the design, etc. I’m looking for suggestions for newer phones to buy with my job and the fact that I’m in college and will need money for the next two semesters.

3,I'm scared. If my Mom was gone long she would've told me. It's been two hours. She needed to drop off a check because my relative's (I think cousin) mom was beating him. I'm afraid she died.

4,"Age 25. I immigrated at a very young age and spent most of my adulthood here as well. However my entire family is overseas in China (mom immigrated with me and then went back, I stayed for college). I'm at a point where I can decide to uproot my life to be closer to family permanently.

&amp;#x200B;

**PROS of moving back:**

\- Less regrets over people dying because I'll have spent enough time with them.

\- More fun times with family because we'll be geographically closer

\- I don't get lonely and depressed in the winter (the winters in Canada are brutal)

**CONS of moving back:**

\- I don't know how to navigate my career in that culture

\- I heavily disagree with how people think and talk; values clash

\- My Chinese is at a middle school level: good enough for colloquial, probably not enough professionally

\- Major differences in lifestyle and loss of independence (I like the sense of knowing my way around a place)

\- Because of my foreign passport, I'll have to leave the country every few months and try to re-enter

\- I tend to become more irritable in China due to being surrounded by rudeness on daily basis

\- I'll become heavily dependent on my family and if they stop being supportive, I've got ***nothing*** left; So it's a very codependent thing. My happiness there has direct correlation with my family's behaviour, which is ultimately out of my control. 

\- I'm LGBT and probably have a better chance of finding a partner here

&amp;#x200B;

The pro-con list overall heavily skews towards staying here, but due to being apart from family for most of my life (left China at age 6 - only visiting for a few months every summer), I have a heavy complex of ""not having spent enough time around them"" and ""not having a family"". It's a very significant gaping hole. But I'm not sure if the price to pay to fill this hole is worth it. So basically, I need some outside perspectives. Also feel free to share your own experiences and how it turned out, if you've gone through something similar.",16Jun2019,1
5,"So I have been organizing with my group of friends a trip to the summerhouse of my grandparents.
The problem is that this friend wants me to invite his friends, I would consider them acquaintances because I only see them a few times per year and I don't know them well.
We are already too many people because I don't want to pick friends and the ones that wouldn't come would feel left out 
His friends aren't bad people but even if it sounds harsh, I don't trust them because we have only had a few conversations. 
So they haven't asked me directly, but my friend has been telling me that they want to come and I have told him that we don't have enough space for them but I think he hasn't mentioned this to them. 
I suck at saying 'No' and they seem to be interested in coming to my house but I can't help them. I don't want to be the bad guy but I have been put in a hard position. 
Should I tell my friend that he has to tell them that they can't come or should I message them directly?",16Jun2019,3
6,"I work at a bar and one day I walked in o the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new (about 2-3 months) who I haven’t talked to stared at me kind of smiling a little as I walked in the doorway as she was sorting glasses and she didn’t look away but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding might have been nothing) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Darren’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off.

9,"I posted in here about my 22year old sister before, but never got any advice back. I hope this time I get some kind of response because my family is honestly afraid to piss her off because she will retaliate. My sister has hit me before because I didn’t open a door and lord only knows what she would do if she found out we snitched on her to the police. 

She has a warrant out for her arrest right now, but the police haven’t searched for her. She’s a thief. She steals everything from petty items from Walmart to multiple cars a month. one of the last cars she stole, the girl who owned it was found dead in a different state. She’s taken our family car before and this time, she stole her best friend’s. Not to mention she is a meth addict who has hidden drugs in my room in hopes I’d find and use it. 

My mother and I have had enough of her, but she won’t call the police because she said she would retaliate. The people she hangs out with aren’t afraid of robbing or possibly assaulting us if we tell the cops or even the girl who’s car was stolen where my sister or the vehicle is. We don’t know what to do. She has no respect for us and brings other addicts and thieves into our home so they all know where we live. 

My sister has beat me before in the past just because she felt like it. I’m afraid myself to say anything because I have no doubt in my mind that she would kill me if I ever opened my mouth about her whereabouts or crimes to the police. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want her endangering my family by doing illegal things in our home and pissing off the wrong people who come banging on our door. 

I really just don’t know what to do. I’m leaving for college in August, but I still have family who will be stuck dealing with her. They’ll either continue being a doormat to her or they’ll end up fucked if my mother opens her mouth like she wants to.

10,"I'm a wee bitty tipsy apologies if I make any mistakes

I'm a decent artist, top of my class in high school, love it (any medium/style/etc), always want to improve, so on and so forth. 

I also love English, film and specifically writing. (Please don't get all ""but what will you do after?"" I want to cry with my fear of it all and trust me I'm trying my best to get any experience/etc and I'm writing a lot) So I'm studying an English lit and writing course that lets me study all that stuff and then some general fun humanities learning. I do enjoy it. I'm good at it, I got an award for my grades in first year (this year). 

But I just want to do both. So badly. So fucking badly. In February I even talked to the heads of art courses at my uni and I'm at a good enough level to go to second year directly- but that's not what I wanted to do either.

Anyway now a girl I was in art with in high school has finished her year of illustration at college and got into a top art school in my country and I am happy for her. I know how much she wanted to go there. I know. And yet I can't stop the insidious jealousy and I HATE it- the feeling of jealousy I mean. In high school she didn't even seem that into art- I would (and still do) draw in my free time, but she admitted to only ever drawing in school because she couldn't be bothered to at home. But that's my jealousy making me want to discount her which is unfair. 

I love and miss art. I guess I also feel like I need to prove myself at everything so not having that recognition and admiration of studying art somewhere fancy &amp; now just doing it myself via self teaching and life classes I buy gets me down. Idk why can't I just be satisfied?? I want to be as good as I can at all the things I love but the way my uni works doesn't let me do any art classes alongside humanities. I don't know what's up I don't want to feel jealous whenever I hear about people I know studying art",16Jun2019,3

I'm being sucked into somebody else's mind,  and it is literally confusing me. I don't understand what is going on. I trully don't.

I'm afraid I'll lose my way and that I  won't be able to reverse this. I think you should know I am already feeling lost. I have very little hope of setting things straight.

Literally nothing, I don’t know whether I should be a bigger person and text her about meeting. But a few times between I was the one texting her, and I haven’t hear from her in about 5 weeks since my birthday.

16,"I'm not sure if I am just hurt by being rejected or if he actually planned to do this all along.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently quit a job. The last day I was there the lead manager(40M)  asked me(26F) out. I thought he was younger, like 35. He told me hi age on our first date. He had been flirty and kind to me at work and I was attracted to him so I agreed.  I'll admit he had a reputation of asking women out at the office but I thought I was too moral and smart to fall for tricks. I was wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

We went out that night.  

&amp;#x200B;

It was going well and after we left the bar, we had two drinks each, I didn't want to leave him. I gave into the devil on my shoulder and we went back to his place. I left in the morning with a smile on my face even though I felt a bit sad and disappointed in how fast we got to sec in our relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

The week went on and we went out tuesday again. 

&amp;#x200B;

And this is where I might have messed up, I'm not sure if this is unattractive behavior though. He told be long ago that when he has a girlfriend he makes time for her, so cool I figured he would have time to see me and talk to me throughout the week if we were dating. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well he wasn't. He canceled a date to work on on a Friday night, which is fine if he let me know BUT I called him and that's how I found out he was going to cancel. He wasn't going to tell me. I think he forgot our plans that night.  So we postponed. Monday talked and I brought up how I want to date someone who has time to see me and if he only has a day available every other week there was no way to build anything so I wouldn't date him.  He assured me he would make more time for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe that's being too aggressive and demand on my part. I never said I expected HIM to do anything. Just that I won't date anyone who I can't see regularly. Maybe that would be fine for some people and he just didn't have the time? IDK

&amp;#x200B;

We had a date the following night, tuesday. Our third date. After that he ignore me for a week and a half. I called him friday night and left a VM saying I hope he has a good weekend. No response. I text him wednesday asking how his week is going. No response.

&amp;#x200B;

A week later he messages me sorry busy at work type deal.

&amp;#x200B;

I ignore it because I felt like I could't trust him after being ignored. I deleted his number from my phone and that's that right. Right?

&amp;#x200B;

....No.. I'm not proud of myself but a week later I found his business card and texted him. 

&amp;#x200B;

First asking how he's doing.

&amp;#x200B;

Then after five hours with no response, I ask him to tell me if he doesn't want to see me because I find it painful to be ignored... 

&amp;#x200B;

No response.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a feeling that he planned on sleeping with me and not ever dating me which might be the case or I might just have  low self-esteem.

&amp;#x200B;

Did I scare him away? 

&amp;#x200B;

I was able to do my work at the office well so I had confidence there, and he was very accommodating to me on the job.  We have similar personal habits and I felt myself connect with him. I felt I could trust him and I thought we enjoyed each other so him ghosting me is really having me doubt myself. Did I imagine our connection? Did he never actually like me? 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm missing out on a chance to be with a great guy and I want to make sure I never do this again. I feel crushed right now. Like there is something caught in my throat and a pressure on my chest.

&amp;#x200B;

I just think someone his age should know what he wants. We've known each other for months so how could he ghost me unless this was his plan all along. Some power/dominance thing to have secs with all the young women at work. I'm hurt, embarrassed, a bit confused where exactly I went wrong, and I want to avoid doing thi again.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if this will be read, it's a lot and a bit jumbled. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I get there, I ask for a replacement and asks me why I didn't come sooner. I tell him because i noticed the problem when I left on vacation and that i had just came back. He says he doesn't believe me, that i probably broke the phone and its impossible that they would sell a defective phone.

27,"Nothing in my life could have possibly prepared me for a decision like this, and it's taking all the willpower I have left not to mentally break down while writing this post. I think I ruined her life, but here goes.

Btw, my girlfriend knows my actual reddit account, and am using a throwaway. I feel like a bit of backstory might be necessary to help you all come to a decision.

I met my gf at a frat party in my university. Now, I'm a really social person, and I love engaging people who I think are shy, so it was nothing out of the ordinary when I saw her leaning against a wall alone. I approached her, one thing led to another, and we both realized we liked each other a lot. We became a couple not long after, and love spending time together.

Here comes the part where I can't forgive myself. She confided in me that she doesn't have many friends, and asked me for advice. I told her that joining on campus groups with people that have similar interests is the best way to make friends. I recommended the swim club, and she started going to meets regularly. I was really proud of her, and she seemed to be more confident in herself than before. One day, I get a call from her really late at night. She was uncontrollably crying, and kept trying to tell me something, which I couldn't make out. I got to her dorm, where she told me she was raped by someone from her meets. After a particularly late event, person X had invited her to his apartment where she was told other people would be as well. Like I said before, she didn't have friends in the first place, and went along optimistically, until she found out X lied and forced himself on her, being drunk. Knowing that I told her to go to swim meets, I haven't been able to forgive myself since.

The next few weeks were nightmarish. She was really traumatized, and it showed. She would break down crying sometimes when we hung out, and I had to calm her down. Soon, it became much worse, even though she started seeing our university's psychological counseling services. She won't sleep all night, and would call me at erratic times (3-6 am and during class and meetings) and tell me how she's really scared. Again, I got her to be calm, but it worsened. She would call me multiple times at night while I'd be sleeping and eventually asked me to come over. I'd walk 20 minutes at pitch black darkness to her dorm on the other side of campus and her roommate would leave us alone, where I'd lay with her and let her know everything would be fine. It wasn't at all. This had gone on for about 2 weeks, until someone else ratted me out to the RA (our university does not allow visitors after midnight) and I got hit with a one time discipline warning. She was devastated, as this meant I wouldn't be coming over anymore, but I still stayed up with her at night when she called, and we eventually started meeting at various points across campus outside her dorm. At this point I am horribly sleep deprived, which makes me feel like absolute s\*\*\*. My diet is awful and my grades are horribly suffering. I still check on her throughout the day, and when she calls I have to excuse myself from class to tend to her as she would not stop calling anyway. I don't have time for such a huge outside commitment, as this takes precious time away from my projects, and my overall quality of work is much worse than before. Out grocery shopping once, she thought she saw X and broke down instantly and I had to take her away. I have never been depressed and anxious in life until recently, as I slowly watch the girl I love lose herself to paranoia and look at life in such a negative and lethal manner.

To make matters worse, I can't get help from my racist and religious family (they would rip me for even dating, which they prohibited until college finished and my gf is from a different ethnicity). I thought to myself that I should break up with her, but still keep her as a friend, and asked other people. Some of my friends have told me to stay with her, saying that she would get better, while others were infuriated that I even suggested something like this. At this point, I'm losing myself to constant headaches, feel her pain myself when we're together and keep second guessing myself, which I have never done before either. I know it would be the best decision to step away such a distraction, but I feel compelled as it was I who suggested the swim club and feel responsible for what happened to her. I am also extremely baffled as to how she seems to be worsening with whatever our counseling services are doing to her, and am considering other options. I don't know what to do and can't think clearly (if at all atm), and need judgement on whether I am the a\*\*hole.

Thank you sincerely to everybody who will respond.",16Jun2019,5

Throwaway account because my friends know my reddit handle. 

Ok to start, I live in Florida and go to a pretty small high school (maybe 500 or 600 kids) and I am good friends with the majority of the kids in my grade (I am a sophomore). I’ve never had an issue talking to girls, I’m not socially awkward or anything, but I’ve never had a real girlfriend. Just playground stuff in elementary school that doesn’t really count. Anyway, I am friends with this girl, Samantha. We’ve been good friends since 7th grade, and there was never really anything romantic between us at all. She had a small crush on me in 7th grade, and I had a small crush on her in 9th grade. We just never liked each other at the right time I guess.

Anyways, I’ve been developing feelings for her recently, and this past school year, she began to become one of my closest friends. This entire time, however (the last 2 years) she was in a relationship with another guy named Franc. Franc and I knew of each other, but never really hung out. Anyways. Samantha and Franc just split up. Like two weeks ago. Since this, Samantha and I have been talking almost nonstop. We both hit each other up several times a day, way more than she used to before. I can’t help but feel like she’s starting to feel the same way.

If she does feel the same way, however I have some fears. I really don’t want to be a rebound. I can’t help but be afraid that she’s only taken an interest in me recently because her mind wants to heal an emotional wound, and the second that wound is healed, she’ll stop caring about me. This thought is really bugging me.

Secondly, I’m also paranoid that I’m misinterpreting things, and that if decide to make a move and ask her out, it will ruin our long-standing friendship, that I seriously DO NOT want to lose.


Please help? I really don’t know what do to, and I really can’t turn to anyone else except the internet because talking to parents is awkward, and talking to friends will eventually just lead to people spreading some not-so-false rumors, and all this informational will get out. You can PM me if you’d like, or you can just leave your comments here. Either will work. Thanks 



TLDR: Me and girl are friends. Have been friends for years. Girl suddenly ended 2 year relationship. Girl and I have been talking a lot, several times a day for the past 2 weeks. I think she’s taken an interest in me. I’m afraid of being a rebound, and I’m also afraid that I might be misinterpreting things, and could end up ruining our friendship by asking her out. What do? Pls help thanks.",16Jun2019,2

30,"I live in a big apartment complex and about a week ago got a new upstairs neighbor, (I'm on the first floor, he's on the second) I haven't had much interaction with him so far and don't really know him. The last few nights I have discovered that apparently the same time I take my dogs out to ""water the grass"" for the last time before bed is when he likes to water the plants he has up against his sliding glass door. I have a couple concerns, first and foremost I think he's watering those plants way too often but more awkwardly, he waters the plants without pants and standing in front of the sliding glass door, blinds open, with all your lights on while it's dark outside... well it's hard not to notice the man in the tighty whiteys. 

So I'm not a prude, at this point it's a new fun anectodefir me, I'm not offended at all - should I say something to him?  Does he not realize we can all see him, or does he just not care?  

The way I see it my options are
1. Do nothing
2. Make a subtle comment about how little privacy those 2nd and 3rd floor sliding glass doors have 
3. Leave an anonymous we can see you in your undies note in his mailbox

31,"Hi all! Long time lurker, first time poster.

My family is in a very difficult situation with my aunt. My aunt is my mother's older sister, and she has more than her fair share of demons - she's an alcoholic, has severe anxiety, depression, and OCD, and the death of my grandmother (her mother) 5 years ago is something she has never been able to move past. She has become incredibly difficult to be around for many reasons - she is a belligerent drunk and constantly shouts, she monopolizes every conversation and reminisces about her childhood endlessly, and whenever you try to have an adult conversation with her, she becomes defensive, mopes and sulks, and then wants to revisit the conversation over and over again and rehash everything that was said. My aunt has also refused any therapy or medical treatment for years, and continues to refuse when we tell her to get help.

I am feeling very frustrated by this, as are my mom, dad, and brother. I am 24 and my mother and I are incredibly close, but I live across the country. I have not been home in 6 months, and I was looking forward to being home and enjoying time with my family, who I haven't been able to be with. Instead, my aunt decides to stay with us for the week and it has become the biggest stressor in our family. My brother and dad can't stand to be around her at all and now just ignore her most of the time. My aunt insists on doing everything with my mom - EVERYTHING. If my mom goes to the grocery store, gets gas, leaves for 5 minutes, my aunt has to go. I haven't had any alone time with my mom because my aunt insists on being there. My aunt's husband is severely ill and likely on his deathbed a few states over, but instead of taking care of him, she's here staying with us.

The biggest issue is the future. My aunt makes comments all the time about growing old with my mom, about moving into our house once her husband dies and living here, and having that be the rest of their lives. She guilts my mom into this kind of thing, and I am incredibly nervous that if something happens to my uncle (which could happen at any time) my aunt will pack up and move into my family home. My dad has said he won't put up with it, and neither will me or my brother. My aunt constantly texts my mom manipulative things about how bad her life is or how crazy she feels, and it makes my mom scared to confront her about anything because she doesn't want to hurt my aunt. My aunt also tells everyone that she ""doesn't need friends"" because she has my mom. We were supposed to have a nice family weekend celebrating a graduation, but my aunt has made it almost impossible for any of us to enjoy it because we are stressed and frankly appalled by a lot of her behavior. My mom feels that she has to start setting boundaries now, but doesn't know exactly how to go about it because she doesn't want my aunt to feel hurt and potentially act irrationally, but at the same time, we can't live like this. My brother and I will not continue to come back for holidays or weekends if she is here, because it ruins the time with our family. I know that if my aunt were to move in here, it would ruin my parent's marriage and I would never forgive her for that. What should we do in this situation?",16Jun2019,1

35,"I don’t know if this is the right place to post, but I’m really torn and need some advice. This is kind of a weird problem to have, but here it is: my best friend and I both like to play Fortnite together (yeah Fortnite bad, I know) because it’s a fun way for us to talk and interact when we aren’t meeting up in person. To put our relationship simply, she’s my closest friend and we’ve both always been there for each other through everything— we’re pretty much like siblings. About a month ago, she left the country for a 2-month long vacation, but we’ve still talked every day, especially in Fortnite. In the game, there’s a gifting system for cosmetics like skins and dances, and we had both gifted each other a few things here and there before she left. However, since she’s out of the country and doesn’t have her console (which has all of her v-bucks on it), she can’t buy any cosmetics in the game. One thing I should add here is that I try not to buy a ton of stuff in the game, whereas she buys anything she wants on a whim (which is fine by me, since it’s her money). However, before she left the country, we made an arrangement that since she can’t purchase stuff I’d gift her whatever she wanted and she’d pay me back once she returned from her vacation. This deal wasn’t a problem for me, and in the first few weeks she was gone, I bought her a couple things she’d requested. However, over the past couple weeks, I’ve spent about $150 (which is *a lot* for me) on cosmetics gifted to her.  Every time a dance, pickaxe, or skin comes out in the shop, she demands that I buy it for her and then nags me until I do (“Don’t forget to buy me this!” sent several times, each time). While she does add that I don’t *have* to buy her this stuff, she clearly gets upset and annoyed if I hesitate to buy her something. Before, I was happy to gift her stuff, and she was very thankful each time I did, but now, she says “You’re buying me this or this once it comes out.” At this point, there are 2 leaked items that cost $12+ each that she wants, plus whatever else may come out that she wants. My dilemma is that I can’t buy much more, maybe a couple things for her, but I know she’ll want more than that. Again, she’s my best friend in the world and an amazing person, but at this point I feel like she’s taking advantage of me and my (very scarce) money to buy anything she wants on a whim. I don’t want to say no to her (and I’ve always had trouble saying no), and part of me feels like I owe her these gifts for being my friend and for everything she’s done for me. Plus, I know that if I speak up and refuse to buy something, she’ll get angry. So, I’m just not sure what to do: suck it up and spend another $150+ gifting her stuff every time she demands it, because that’s what friends do, or be honest and say that I can’t afford much else and subsequently upset her, which is the last thing I want to do. 
This got longer than expected, but hopefully it explains everything thoroughly, and thanks for reading everything. *TL;DR*, my closest/best friend is constantly demanding that I buy her things in Fortnite, and I don’t want to say no to her, even though I’m a broke college student that’s quickly running out of money.

36,"I’ve had two friends for a few years now and everything used to be great between us. We would hang out and be there for each other during times of need, like a family death or surgery. For the past seven to eight months something has shifted between us. They act fine with each other, but with me it’s completely different. They confide in one another while ignoring me when we’re in the same room and regularly write down notes on paper and give it to one another so I don’t know what they’re discussing. I’ve been the same me where I ask how they are and inquire about their family and lives and yet they both react to me differently than they react with each other. The biggest change has been in our group text. If I text something (topic can be on anything) then ignore it 99% of the time. If one of them texts something then the other responds. I can add in my two cents and am still ignored while they chat on. I’m at the point where I’ve withdrawn myself when we’re together and I keep interactions to a minimum. Yes, I’m still respectful, considerate, and friendly with them, but my personality has taken a 180 degree change while they haven’t noticed a thing. 

Advice or thoughts would be appreciated. Background info: we’re all adults, we work together, I have no other friends, and I’m sick of thinking back and trying to discover what happened.

37,"My father is a Jehovas witness. ever since I was a little girl he was very restrictive. Things such as listening to rock music or watching movies with sex scenes were the triggers of very awful episodes of abuse. I'm 23 now, I graduated from college and I just got a job but the salary it's just not enough for me to leave the house. Right now I have a boyfriend and last month my period came 2 weeks later. Even though I use protection I got a pregnancy test and my father found it. Even though it was negative this brought up a fight about me not waiting to marriage to begin my sex life, my sister who is the closest person to me said I wasn't supposed to get a pregnancy test every time I didn't get my period on time and that also my polycystic syndrome had to do with me having sex with my boyfriend and That i should take a break from having sex until I get better. Which makes no sense to me.

My mother acts like nothing is going on and the day I called my boyfriend of two years to share what I was going through he got mad  because according to him I don't know how to handle the situation. He says I should leave or not let it affect me as it does because I've lived with this for so long. Also he told me that he doesn't want to live with me because he feels I'm using him as an escape from my family situation and that living together will add an enormous emotional responsibility on him.

Right now I'm planning to leave the house even if I have to get in debt for it but I literally feel like I can't count on my boyfriend, nor my sister or anyone of my family.

I’ve been friends with this person since Childhood. He was always a bit socially non-conforming, but when we were younger it felt more quirky than anything. My fiancée is also friends with him, so naturally we decided to ask him to be in our wedding party. 

Recently however, his personality has changed. He’s become emotionally and at times physically abusive. I don’t think he realizes he’s done this, but it’s hurt my fiancée and I a lot, and it makes us feel unsafe to be around him.

He refuses to take any blame or criticism, and any attempt to bring up a perceived wrongdoing results in denial, gaslighting, and an escalation of anger. So far the physical abuse has only been to me, and he believes he is joking, but he threatens violence and physically hits me consistently despite me asking him not to touch me every single time. We can’t get the police involved as we do not have any actual evidence of the abuse, and we do not want to ruin his life with a domestic violence charge anyway. We just want him out of our lives.

41,"tl;dr my parents and sister fight a lot about problems that create bigger knots in our family, wondering how to help both sides of the situation.

&amp;#x200B;

So for context here: My sister (12 years old) and my parents are arguing almost consistently at this point, and this type of behavior is making my family hate each other more. Most of the time, I'm trying to be the mediator of the situation, but I don't understand how to find the best balance so that what my parents say is the ""final word"" and my sister who recently has started arguing back with her reasoning being that she is done being the bigger person.

Obviously, my parents do have authority over my sister, but the way they present it does not do much justice. My dad has been influenced a lot from the way that he was raised, and so any talking back or whatever is met by him yelling about how you shouldn't do that and whatnot.

My sister is also dealing with drama at school, and a lot of the arguments stem from this. Just recently, we were in the car and my sister saw some kids that she was in drama with on the sidewalk, and so she hid trying to prevent them from seeing her. We were at a red light and my dad thought it would be funny to blast the radio to the people walking on the street (type of person he is). Well, my sister had yelled for him to go (drive), but my dad didn't hear it because of the radio being turned up. After yelling that they saw my sister, just kinda said ""oh look"" but that was too much for my sister. My mom had apologized because she realized my dad had not heard my sister but she snapped saying that it shouldn't of happened like that. My mom started to snap back saying that she should not talk to her like that and my dad continues by yelling about how she shouldn't snap at my mom like that and also saying ""who cares if they see you.""

It wouldn't be something I would want advice on if it resolved itself within the next few hours or days or something like that, but for my sister it piles on and her hatred for my dad increasingly grows after every fight. After some fights where I feel like they were both in the wrong at some point during the situation. Obviously, this specific fight here is on my sister, but others fall more on my parents and both sides believe that the other should grow up and be more respectful.

My main question for advice would basically be how do I help draw a line between my parent's authority and the way that my sister wants to be treated? And what would be the best approach to try and make them understand this?

48,"Please do not judge me, because I already know I'm kind of an asshole here, but my question is on how to move forward. 

Long story short, I got sexually involved with this girl a few months ago. She is 18, and I live in a state where the age of consent is 16, though I would never go that young (frankly after this I don't think I'll go below 20 anymore) Some people see an issue with this, some don't, not really the point here. She approached me for sex after I added another older friend of her's on Instagram, I guess she was having a dry spell, but we met up and had sex a few days later. Now I'm not going to defend my performance too much here, but I was tired, and tbh not really in the mood, but I was also scared of her losing interest, so I kinda tried when the motivation was low, so to speak. It was decent, but not mindblowing for either party. We continued to talk after, but she still lived with mom and dad, and despite her being 18, I think we all know some parents have a ""my roof, my rules"" attitude, I dated a 23 year old who had similar issues, but of course when you're 18, breaking the rules is a little more ""verboten.""

I preface all this for the simple fact that I'd like to make the point of why I was frustrated. It got to a point where she would promise to hang out, and then have to cancel too often, and I got fed up with it, not to mention she was trying to hit up my brother too! I more or less said she could have him, and went on my merry way. 

Fast forward a few weeks, and guess who's hitting me up? We made plans to hang, and just talk, though I will admit I lowkey was hoping for more. Frankly I didn't much care for her personality, and if sex wasn't involved, I wasn't interested in being friends. Once again, I'm kind of the asshole here, I know, you don't need to rub it in. Well guess what? The meeting gets cancelled again, and I don't really understand as it seems she has plenty of freedom to go out with other people, guys and girls, some my age (23.) I decide to just let her be when she messages me asking for a favor. She doesn't have a car and needs some Juul pods, she asks if I can buy them for her if she gives me money, and I do. After this I inquire about meeting again, and she's kind of waffling on the idea. Now I KNOW I should've hung up my hat a while ago with her, it's not like she's even the only person I'm involved with, but I got pissed. She specifically tells me that she no longer wants sex, which is valid, nobody should be forced to have sex, but I succinctly tell her that if she wants me to continue doing things for her (IE buying her stuff, alcohol, etc) I want some benefits, and if she wasn't willing to have a mutual relationship like that, then I wasn't interested. Once again, not forcing it, but I think that with how much women use sex to influence men, this was a fair negotiation. She says no, so I tell her that's fine, and that I think it's best we stop talking. 

Now this is where the advice comes in. She more or less freaks out, she claims I've been harassing her for sex, and that he step-dad is in the secret service and she's gonna ""get him involved"" if I don't leave her alone. I tell her I wasn't harassing her, and that I'll gladly let her be, and wish her a good day. She responds with ""what's your age again?"" followed by a ""nevermind, my dad (step dad?) will figure it out. 

I'm not concerned about the age thing because once again, she's 18, and even if she managed to slip that one under my nose, 16 is the age of consent in my state, no way in Hell she was less than that considering the Instagram friend that prompted her adding me was in college and graduated a year prior to her, she had no reason to lie. But what I am concerned is some power tripping asshole harassing ME when it's his daughter hoeing around asking dudes on Instagram if they wanna smash. Just to reiterate, not really concerned about legal ramifications (unless anyone can enlighten me to one) but I am concerned about what to do next, any advice may help, and once again, please no judgement, this is the last time I get involved with anyone more than like 2-3 years younger. Fuck that drama man.",16Jun2019,1

Her mom does not want her to go to the doctor for her anorexia/bulimia, but she is going to have to go to the doctor next week. THE CATCH IS, her mom is going with her. If my friend decides to do the right thing for herself and be honest to the doctor, her mom will flip. And my friend is already stubborn enough about getting the help she needs to begin with.

53,"Pretty much the title. I decided to finally attempt to talk to someone. I'm going to try the online video session my provider offers.

Immediately after submitting the appointment, I found myself struggling with feeling sort of relieved and almost like ""yep, this is the first step toward feeling good"". I get that -- in one way or another -- it *is* the first step to feeling good, but I have a lot of concern that the doctor may or may not be capable of helping me (it's why I've dragged my feet with this so long).

How should I be letting myself feel? Should I push back that relief feeling? I've just heard so many stories of doctors giving bad advice or people feeling as if they are treading water for months.

Appointment is Wednesday, by the way. Thanks in advance you guys.",16Jun2019,2

62,"Y’all wanted an update so,
Rn my friend is over. I told her about how I feel about my brother and she being my best friend, understood it all. :) I told her because she had been in a incident that occurred in her family even though it didn’t happen to her, she was still involved. I asked her if I could tell you all what happened and she said yes so here’s what she said: Her dad lives in a different state then her mom for job reasons. He cheated on her mom multiple times with another woman and her mom didn’t find out until the woman was actually pregnant. The woman was practically homeless and a drug addict so she lived with my friends dad for a couple months until her dad found out the woman was stealing money from him and then he kicked her out. The sad part is the woman took my friend cats with her and sold them for money or did something to them and my friend was depressed after that. Now, she’s stuck with divorced parents and I think my friends step sister  is like 2 now or something but my friend says she’s really sweet. She told me that my family is already broken and there’s nothing I can do to save it so I should just report my brother if my dad talking to him doesn’t work. I don’t really wanna ruin my dads fathers day so I’m just going to tell him on Monday.  So yeah. Also, tysm guys for all the love and support I deeply appreciate it and your advice has really helped keep me motivated to end this. I understand some people think this is fake and I can completely see why but it really isn’t. I’ll try and keep you all updated  Also here’s a question: is there anyway my brother can find out my Reddit? I really hope not because he has Reddit too and if he finds this I’m pretty much toast. I like Reddit because the memes are funny and the community is nice so when all of this is over, I’m going to abandon this account and make another. Anyway, I’m going to hang with my friend now so yeah :D bye guys 💜",16Jun2019,34
63,"Hi,

So a little bit of context ; I was some sort of a r/foreveralone guy untill end of 2018 when I started drinking at parties. I was against any alcohol at that time. I was thinking it makes people looks and acts stupid. Which is the case but hey ***I don't know how to finish this sentence. I'm just dumb now I guess***.

Anyways. I became really close friend with someone from my class. I know for a fact that I was hated by like 90% of my class because I caused some problems between the students and the school. So it was  a relief that I was friend with someone that actually invite me at parties. That guy is like the pillar of the parties for my class. So he invited me, others peoples and we began to have a group of 6 peoples who were there everytime. We all became friends and that's fantastic. 

The problem is that they all drink &amp; drive. I get it, I have a car, I live as far as them from the place were we go (spoiler : not that far). Actually it's been 4 years since I last took a public transport. I don't want to take the bus at 4:00am. So I take a Uber. It's 6-7€ and in my group of friends, the one that lives the further away would pay 11€. 

I am worried. Really worried. I know how dangerous drunk driving is. I saw how some people of the group drive when they are drunk. It's awfull. Seeing someone going fucking 50kph (30mph) in reverse in a city street is what makes me want to ask you advices. 

I also need to confess that when I'm drunk I'm easily influenced by them. So sometimes they drop me off at my place but I have nothing to say. One time I called a Uber with my phone and they took my phone and cancelled it. Like, wtf. 

What can I do ?",16Jun2019,2
64,"I’ve been told by a couple people I know that I should quit my job. I just want an unbiased opinion from someone who doesn’t know me. 

I’m 25 years old, and I’ve been working in sales for 7+ years for the same company. A year and a half ago I was promoted from a salesperson to a supervisor, and six months ago I was promoted to a manager. A lot of people have told me I do a really good job, but this recent promotion has been a bit of a struggle. 

I went from being hourly to salaried, and where I work that means I’m expected to answer emails, calls, and texts from work all the time, on my days off, late at night, early in the morning, you name it. Also going on to work on my day off to cover for somebody or to just work more is typical for me. So my work life balance is like 99% work. 

I do get three weeks of paid time off, but whenever I ask to use this time off, it doesn’t get approved. I did take six days off five months ago, but if I even ask for a three day weekend off it doesn’t get approved. And anytime I have taken time off it hasn’t really been a vacation because I still have to deal with work stuff the whole time through calls and emails, and come back to a crapload of work.

I know this sounds awful, but I do like the company I work for, and it pays pretty well. I don’t want to be a quitter and I feel like if I were better at my job I wouldn’t have these problems. But I am stressed out and depressed most of the time, and anytime I talk about work to my family they tell me I should look for another job.  

Is this just how sales jobs are, or are there better ones out there? I only have experience in sales, so I worry that if I did find another job, I would have all the same problems.",16Jun2019,1

My boyfriend works graveyard so he thinks when he leaves for work I'm going out doing shit I shouldn't be doing. Today while I was just doing my eyebrows to experiement doing it differently than I usually do, he proceeded to tell me that I get ready when he's either taking a nap before work or as he's getting ready to leave or that when he comes home I look like I went somewhere the night before.

On days where I have nothing to do, I watch a lot of YouTube and that usually means a few makeup tutorials so yeah, I get inspired and wanna fuck around with makeup a little. I also like to pull out my eyelashes on my right eye so when I wear fake eyelashes or when my makeup is done, I leave em alone. The other night, I caught myself picking out my eyelashes so I put falsies on to make myself stop and was wearing them when he got home. And even when I do go out, 1. He knows about it because we talk while he's at work and 2. Its with my family. I have no friends. 

I feel like my reasons are legit, and that I shouldn't have to explain myself whether I'm feeling creative/experimental or low key stressed. 
In all of my relationships, me wearing makeup has been an issue. I don't know how to get through to him that I do it because I like it, if I go somewhere hell know about it and that it makes me feel better even if were not going anywhere. I feel its unfair that I now need to think about when and when not to play with/wear makeup. I also get really insensitive towards his feelings when he's accusing me of cheating/lying.

71,"I took a forest service range job last year, basically spraying weeds most of the summer. This was not in the job description but I stuck it out for the season because the area was beautiful and I liked the people. There was an incident when one of the other seasonals mixed this nasty herbicide 10x too hot and I basically got sprayed w it. I told my boss and it was pushed under the rug. I was told they were going to start w a clean slate next summer and not hire any of the same seasonals back, because of this incident even though I did nothing wrong. Well come feb I get a call from the new boss and she asks me if i want to come back and tells me I’d be doing mostly range stuff while the other seasonal would be spraying weeds. She also brought up the incident from the last year and asked if I didn’t like spraying weeds. I said I didn’t care that much except when someone is dumb and makes it concentrated, so she knew about this upsetting/ traumatic incident. So come summer I am back at the job and within 3 days of starting she told me to go out and spray weeds. I asked her if we would be spraying weeds all summer and she said June and July. It’s not so much spraying weeds as it is her telling me I wouldn’t be doing that and her knowing I was uncomfortable with it. I’m angry and resentful towards her already. She has the applicator license and we spray under her “supervision” which means she says go out and spray, figure it out basically. She won’t spray herbicide because she said it gives her “migraines”. I shouldn’t have taken the job to begin with after what happened last summer but I liked it besides the weed spraying. We spray large amounts of herbicide from a truck, and sometimes with a backpack or hand wand.

Turned out they were Kirby salesman and wanted to show off the vaccum. They barged right in and the woman left after the gentleman came in with her and he began to give his presentation. He was very nice and polite. When I advised that I didn't expect this to happen and I didn't have any money to make a decision on anything he immediately packed up and left. Although he calls his ""manager"" to tell them that I am not the one who makes the decision on the vaccum (since I mentioned that I am watching the house for my folks) and asked about coming at a later time.

I asked for a card or some way to get back in contact with him and didn't have any. The only other thing I can think of that might make them legit is that he had to sell so many to win a trip to cancoon.

77,"Hey there.

This is kind of emotional for me, since I have never open up to anyone, never have I ever spoken out about this and I am scared because I am a male and I was taught to believe that men should never say they can be abused.

I was going to use a throwaway account, because this account I normally use to search subreddits of games i like and talk about my country. But it's been so many years, so many years in silence, that I thought it'd be a little bit of a coward move if I used a secondhand account.

This happened to me and I can't do anything about it anymore.

This is going to be a long story, I'm going to keep a lot to myself because I don't know how much I'll be able to tell before I break, but fuck it I am already writing this post.

I didn't have an easy life, I don't like saying that because I don't like taking the place of the victim, but I believe it is true. I'm Venezuelan with a German mother, my mother married my dad in germany and we moved to Argentina, I would spend most of my childhood in Argentina and Venezuela, spending various months in each country before traveling back to the other one. Life in Catia slum was not easy, but I actually have better memories there than I do about my other house in Argentina.

My mother is a busy woman, she works doing massages and selling beauty products, which, in a small town in Argentina, didn't give us too much income.
She would work a lot of hours and left me alone from the early morning to very late in the night alone, in a dangerous neighborhood. This was when I was around 5.
My father, which was living in Germany at the time, after they divorced, was outraged that she left me so many hours in complete loneliness and threaten to take me with him back to Germany (at the time my dad was living on a couch in Berlin in a friend's house, after being homeless for a pretty long time).
Finally, my mother got a caretaker for me and my sister, she was from a very, very poor part of the city, really violent and problematic. She was very nice to us however, was good at cooking and although she watched a lot of TV we liked her a lot. Only a few years later did I found out that she was stealing from us, that's how the candies my father sent to me from Germany dissappeared - - but thats a story for another time.
She had a young son, sometimes she would bring him to our home when she was taking care of us, well, more like taking care of me because at the hours she was at home my sister was in school.

So, she would bring her son to our house, he was 13~ i was 5~. Sometimes she would leave to go buy groceries because my mother asked, once a week in fact. When she left her son would show me porn in his phone and masturbate in front of me. With 5 I had almost no idea what was going on and I would distress a lot, to the point of crying. He would touch me and tell me that men are suppose to watch porn and that only girls don't like it and it was terrible. It was sickening.

I never got the courage to tell my mother about that, but it went on for years, until I started watching porn with only 7~ years of age and masturbate which provoke me to have premature puberty and caused me serious social trouble at my kindergarten.

This isn't the abuse I am taking of, however. It is a different one. It was in my hospital, or praxis? I don't know what is called. There was a female doctor that would check on me every few months. My mother would leave the room because this doctor always said that ""I was big enough to do it alone"", then she would masturbate me, touch me and tell me dirty stuff, I felt hopeless and she would hurt me. I once told my mother crying that I didn't like being there and my mother told I was overreacting.

I never told anyone any of this. No one, not my girlfriend, not my dad, not my mother, not my sister.

I forgot about everything for years, I was mentally blocked and I didn't remember a thing, it was like magic, like another person's memory.

Only lately I've been having a lot of trouble and it caused me to remember everything. I had a very bad experience in Venzuela last time I went and I was almost shot. I left my country in the middle of the crisis in 2014~ to never come back and left my entire family there. The dictatorship was not kind to me or my family and a lot of people I love died, of sickness and violence. I got serious PTSD and tried to commit suicide not so long ago. I moved to Germany with my father and this PTSD caused me a lot of pain and suffering which lead to going a lot to the hospital, that's how the memories came back.

I don't know what to do anymore. I feel so hurt. I don't love my mother and I can't tell anyone I care about because I feel ashamed. My country and my family are falling apart and I am powerless. My grades and every single thing in my life have gone downhill, I don't know if I have anything more to live for anymore.

I'm sorry for this long post. It's been 14 years since all of this started I just want to cry and die, I feel so pathetic telling my most deep secrets in reddit, really shows how many people I have in my life that would care to hear them.",16Jun2019,2
79,"I have a good friend who's currently being stalked by a person. For over 6 months, my friend has been receiving horrible phone calls which progressively got worse and began being threatened and knew where she was all the time. She started receiving things through the door, her house was broken into and things were stolen. The police were involved with an investigation but dropped the case due to a lack of traceable evidence. He is apparently still threatening her friends and also pretending to be her online. The police will only re-open the case if they have hard evidence and only suggested hiring a private investigator however she simply cannot afford it.

I really want to help her. She is a genuinely lovely girl and does not deserve this all in the slightest.

82,"      So me and my neighbors all around the same age have been friends for around a year now. And through out this time period we've been pretty good friends, hanging out, going places etc. And over the period of a few months, things have felt off. I was in the car with one of my neighbors listening to loud music as teenagers do, and she turns it down to say this. ""You know, I've really respected you and our friendship for a while and I don't normally do that. I've been through some tough patches when it comes to people I know and I don't normally trust very quickly, but it feels different here. I really hope we can be friends for years to come"" (this is based off memory but I feel it's close enough) 
Once we got back to the house it was dark, and I decided to chill at her place. The adults were drinking and doing their usual Friday night stuff. I had a huge crush on her and frankly, having met and helping drop off her boyfriend sorta killed me but I tried to go through with it like I needed to as a friend. 
Flash forward about a month, I did her a favor and took her friend to their junior prom because she would've gone stag and that's not cool. Let's call me date R.
Me and R go and we take pictures I buy her dinner and all, but with the money my neighbor gave me because I was a bit short. There wasn't anything left over except like a dime. I had just enough to pay to get into the prom which was $70 for both me and my date. We arrived a bit late and the prom was dying down. People started to leave but there was still a substantial amount. When we went up to the front they told us to just walk in bc we arrived late. (The staff that is) and so we did, and unbeknown to me, my date had already bought a ticket from her school to get in, I was under the assumption she hadn't. Either way I was willing to pay the difference. We walked in, met up with my neighbor, her friend, and their dates. Me and R danced a bit, she was the sorta outback-y type. And loved taking pictures. Really charming to me but this was probably a one time thing. We danced had fun etc. etc. When we left neighbor asked if I had change from the $5 she spot me, I said no not really and she went ok and we went back to the house. 
The next day I was woken up to my mother yelling at me about $40 that I spent without permission and that I still had a load of money because I snuck in the back of prom to get around paying. ""Yeah I still have the $70 cuz they told me to just walk in bc we came in late"" she says ok and we had a talk about the money and when we were going there neighbor was low on gas. I spot her $10 I hadn't realised we were going to eat at this point. so I gave her the $10 on her tank, she paid, we left. Party comes etc. And she goes and tells her mom that I only have her 5, she gave me 10, and I owed her $45... ""What""
I ended up paying her $45 bc I figure she might be lost it and couldn't explain to her mother, whatever.
 now time has passed we hadn't talked for around 2 months. We are back talking again. Her boyfriend moved back to Italy because he was an exchange student. We started talking more. She invited me to go to the local speedway at 5:00 western mountain time. She never texted me about the tickets she was given. She took somebody else. She didn't tell me this, I found out on my other neighbor I associate with's Instagram. How do I react? She's made up countless stories about how I've backstabbed her and tried to extort money out of her... But I still have this huge crush and I fear it's only going to get worse. I'm normally That Asshole™ but I consider myself nice to close friends. I don't know how to deal with this and it's upsetting... Anything works",16Jun2019,1
84,"We were walking in the city and I (25M) said ""look at that fake butt. It looks so odd."" 

Her (21F) response ""You like looking at other women's butts? Oh I see."" 

Then she proceeded to bring it up for the next 5 blocks. 

Whenever a guy tries to talk to her, she feels the need to tell me and look at my face for the reaction in hopes to get a rise out of me. You dont need to tell me EVERY single time a guy tries to talk to you, she's a pretty girl so I'd hear about it all day. As long as you respect our relationship, lets keep it moving. 

She's very attached and she is constantly trying to use a scenario (real or joke) concerning a guy talking to her to get a rise out of me. My idea is to just straight up confront her about it and explore what the root cause is together because 1. We're a team and 2. its honestly annoying.

Those are my thoughts though. What are you all's?",16Jun2019,3

He will finish school next year, while I have two years left to "" beat"" . ( once failed a grade and had to repeat it) .
He has an average grade of A- ( 1,5) , while I have mostly C+ ( 2,5).
He is mostly liked by other people ( including his humor) why I am not ( including my humor)
I could continue this comparision for probably 3 pages ...
In brief: He is superior to me to me in EVERY way

86,"I started texting this girl that I saw on the bus every morning and we texted a lot for about a week. Then, we met up and went out to eat lunch and just walked around in the park and talked about stuff. When we were out there was some awkward silence sometimes, but we just looked at each other and sort of laughed softly.  During the date she always tried to keep the conversation going and she also walked very close alongside me. When the date ended we hugged and said goodbye. 
I think it went well, but I’m sort of paranoid at the same time thinking she will never want to see me again because after the date we stopped texting as much and whenever I get on instagram she gets off shortly after. She still seems interested since she still chats with me and sends emojis in texts.

87,"Gee, I don’t know where to start with this. It’s quite a long story so please stick with. Background on me first: I’m female, 29, born in the US and now living in between London and Berlin. I read business at college and now run a successful medical company. 

For the sake of this post, I am going to change names. I met Tim, aged 58 at a work event 4 years ago. He followed me on social media and took an interest in me and my work. I’m usually reserved around new people but we hit it off very quickly. It seemed like we had so much in common and he was interested in my work. We started with occasional dinners and coffees and developed a platonic friendship. At the time, he was unemployed with no qualifications but seemed bright and clued in. So I offered him a job. 

He started to work for my firm and progressed quickly, eventually becoming one of my most senior members of the team, amongst 2-3 others. My friends thought I was crazy and several of them told me they were concerned because we were spending a lot of time together. I was dismissive and told them that age was just a number. 

Outside of work, we continued to spend a lot of sociable time together. He would come on vacation with me and came to a few family events. There was immediate tension between he and my father and quite often I was made to feel trapped in the middle. There were many arguments and I would usually side with Tim, feeling my dad felt threatened. 

I broke up with my fiancé at the time and was stuck temporarily for somewhere to live. Tim had a spare room and willingly said he would host me. At the time it felt like the right idea and after a few weeks, we decided to continue living together. My friends told me once again that I was crazy. 

Over time, I started to feel suffocated. I was living and working with this guy and when I was away in Berlin, I’d come home and my things had moved in my bedroom and he’d done all of my cleaning, chores and washing. I once came home to find my underwear drying in his bedroom. 

Around 2 years ago, I met my current partner and we recently got engaged and are moving in together. Since I met my SO, Tim has been increasingly unpredictable and emotional. We have had various conversations around him overstepping the line and I have told him how uncomfortable it makes me feel to receive constant text messages from him and to discover that he had befriended most of my friends on Facebook and was inviting them to his social events. 

Aside from me, Tim doesn’t spend time with others and so I have always felt under pressure to include him and to ensure he doesn’t feel displaced around my SO. 

Aside from all of the tension around my SO, I have discovered that Tim had lied and manipulated situations between me and my dad and caused a rift in our relationship (of which is now healed). This caused tension and when I confronted Tim calmly, he was outraged and threatened to turn my investors and colleagues against me and made a physical threat to choke me. I left and stayed with my SO and then told Tim I would be moving out. 

I moved out and things seemed okay at work. We were professional and Tim apologised for the things he said to me. Then I received a concerned call from one of my lead investors. 

To my horror, Tim had hacked into my personal iMessages and had been reading all of my conversations with everybody for weeks, including intimate messages with my SO and very sensitive messages with relatives and other close friends. He had downloaded messages where I was calling him ‘mental’ and ‘insane’ and saying that I needed him out of my life and that I really hated him because of what he had done to me. 

I was forced to apologise to Tim and to acknowledge I should have not been talking about him in such terms, but I feel like my privacy has been violated and am unnerved knowing that he has been reading all of my private conversations with people for weeks, if not months. 

If I remove him from the company, it’s likely he will lash out and create damage to me and my investors. Equally how can I trust him? I am physically and psychologically intimidated and scared by this man. 

Am I being stalked? I feel backed into a corner by this man and have seen a side that I’ve never seen before. My friends were right all along and I’m scared. 

Interested in other perspectives as I don’t know what to do. Thankfully I’m now in Berlin for the next week so I have some space to figure all of this out.",16Jun2019,2

89,"Obligatory English is not my mother tongue.

My sister has been my bully for the longest time. She is older than me by three years, and she used to treat me like absolute shit. In our teenage years, where kids were the most sensitive, she called me things that gave me insecurities to this day. I'm a chubby person, and she has called me ""a fat cunt"" since I was 12. She brings this insult back whenever we have a huge argument, and she is an absolute dick about it. I train for two hours around 2 times a week for a labour-intensive sport, and I'm slowly dropping the numbers. My confidence is coming back up. The last time we argued and she called me ""a fat cunt"", I was hurt still, but I told her I wasn't insecure about it anymore, and she retorts with ""You should be"". Set me back to ground zero. Whenever I bring this up to her in a regular conversation, she would reply with ""but I don't do that anymore!"" like it solves it. She still does it whenever she's angry, first of all. Second, just because she ""stopped"" doesn't mean the insecurities are gone. She does the same with ""You have no friends"" ""You are terrible with people/with socializing"" ""You have shit grammar"" (or just correcting my grammar in general, we grew up in a country with English being our second language, with her being older, she was much better at English when we moved to Canada) and all have that gave me lasting scars because of how true they were, and how much I loved her. Did she care she was hurting me? When she was younger, maybe. She has written me notes about being sorry but doing the same the next day. She has played very sick jokes on me that threw me into a complete panic attack, which I ended up calling my friend, crying through the entire phone call, calling kids help phone right after, and being very close to dialling 911. There were also forms of physical abuse, but there are some things I won't say because I'd breakdown again if I had to. 

That doesn't do her terribleness justice, but I'll leave it at that. Time for my asshole-ness. Now I would find everything I know she's insecure about: terrible grades, unstable relationships, failing her driver's license, and poke fun at it. Today I found her crying in our younger brother's bedroom(whom we both love and fight over) because of something shitty I did today. She has been treating me better recently, but I can't forget what she had done to me. She told me she had depression, ADHD, and anxiety. She hasn't been diagnosed but she is very sure of it. On my side, I have been diagnosed with ADHD and Social Anxiety. But she mocks me constantly for it, and has even gone to screaming at me in a restaurant for being unable to get our server to come and saying I was just ""being lazy"". At this point, I don't know if I still have any love for her left. The main reason she is upset is that she is treating me ""well"", by letting me sit at the same table as her, by helping with school, etc. She would always be insulting me the whole time, but help is help, and her acts of kindness are still there. She acts like this month of niceness can cover up my trauma, and that if I'm mean to her in ANY way, I'm a shitty person. I'm beginning to feel like I am. She's treating me like I used to treat her but worse, and I'm treating her like she treated me just without the physical abuse. How terrible am I for doing so? Should I be trying to fix our relationship? Should I ""forgive and forget""?",16Jun2019,6
91,"So I have a very odd sleep cycle. I don’t need much sleep to function normally, like 4/5 hours of sleep is enough for me. 

But, now this is not enough sleep for people like I should have 8 hours of sleep at least, right? The problem is I feel like crap if I sleep for anything more than 4/5 hours per night. I could skip in a nap in the afternoon for like 45mins to an hour, but, that’s all. That is also not enough.

95,"I think it’s important to note that we’re both minors still living with our parents. A month and a half ago when his dad got upset and my boyfriend tried to walk away from him, his dad yanked his arm back. I know to some that may not seem like something to declare as abusive  but it was the force used that distinguished it from being “come back here” to just aggressive behavior. Then today his dad got upset again and hit him. Not “hard” by what he told me but hit him nonetheless. For me the line that distinguishes abuse and discipline is when the parent is doing it because they are upset and not because the child did something wrong. I grew up in a physically abusive household and I don’t want my Bf to go through what I went through. I can clearly see his dad going down that path due to his mother not caring about his dad doing what he did. Positively reinforced behaviors are ok but not for a negative behavior like this one. I just know it’s going to get worse if some kind of action is not taken to stop him. His dad is slowly crossing the line into being abusive towards him.",16Jun2019,2

102,"So long story short, my pup had to have emergency surgery last night on his abdomen. He is home now and resting. However, he hates his cone, hates his crate, and constantly squeals for one of us to be in the room with him. I was with him the last two days, non stop. Giving meds, giving love, and trying to juggle full time school work and keeping my house in order. My fiancé comes home this evening and becomes increasingly agitated at his squealing. I told him to just give him some attention and be with him while I catch up on some house work, like laundry. Eventually, he gave up on giving him attention and decided to go outside and hangout on the back porch to grill something for dinner. I got upset and bitched at him about not helping. He burnt the pork chops that we were having and completely flipped out. Yelling at me that he is just a dog and dogs whine. He’s had about enough of all of this. He goes into the bedroom and shut and locks the door. He texts me and tells me to sleep on the couch tonight with the dog and that i can be an overbearing bitch sometimes. I know that I pushed him to the edge tonight but I honestly did not mean to. My anxiety has hit a whole new level tonight with all of the stress going on. 

I guess my question is, am I an overbearing asshole that needs to chill out? I know he had a bad day, and I wasn’t giving full attention to him talking about his day when he gave me full attention when talking about what went on today too. But sometimes my mind can only focus on one thing it high stress situations and I tend to lash out when not getting help.",16Jun2019,3
103,"A couple of months ago, I switched into a gym class at my school. In this class, there was this senior guy, who I took a liking to. I thought he was cute, but didn't really think about him outside that class we shared. Three weeks later, I noticed that this same guy would literally show up everywhere I was (at school). Initially, I told myself that I was just being delusional and that maybe because I had a crush on him I assumed that these were anything but coincidences. (basically thought I was tripping)

At first, it was innocent, explainable incidents, like bumping into him in the halls. But it started to get more.... weird. I would be on my way out of the building and he'd be standing near the door-way I always left through (as if he had been waiting for me). One time I caught him staring at my mom's car for a good minute or so as I was getting into it. Another time I would be having a conversation with my friends in gym, and he'd hover around us, as if he was listening in. When I went off-campus for lunch, he literally showed up to the sane resturant as me when I had literally seen him at the school cafeteria five minutes before.

I took all these incidents and thought I was being delusional and that they were all coincidences, but my friend says that it seems like all these 'chance encounters' are a sign that he is interested in me. I'm a muslim girl and don't really do dating, so I wasn't sure how to handle this type of thing. My friends kept encouraging me to speak to him, but I always chickened out at the last second and begged them not to do it for me (after they offered to talk to him for me). Now, its the end of the year and he's going to be moving away soon, and my friends want me to reach out to him before he leaves... (I'm not even sure if he'll show up to school anymore btw)

What do you guys suggest I do about this situation?",16Jun2019,1
105,"School was always a drag-- never did well academically-- and in year two of college (after flunking everything) I decided to drop out and pursue a career in a highly competitive creative industry. By some massive stroke of luck, I ended up establishing myself fairly quickly, and at age 21 was getting jobs that much older folks were giving their all to try to get. There was a point where I was truly white hot and in-demand by (it seems like) everyone in the industry. Then I began noticing these burnout periods. At first they'd last a few weeks and I'd come back reinvigorated and better then before, then they started lasting a month, two months, and finally, here I am, over two years without work, stuck in a perpetual rut, with absolutely no motivation or ambition. It almost feels as if though I'm content with the nothingness. 

Almost five years ago my father was diagnosed with a horrible disease and while he wasn't doing so awful at first, we definitely took notice. The progression was both slow and rapid. Slow because we (my mother and I) lived with him and big leaps in his decline didn't just happen from day to day, but rapid because just a little over four years after being diagnosed he passed away this past September. Growing up it was us (my parents and I) vs. the world and it always remained that way. To see one of the two pillars of my creation crumble in front of my eyes has had an immense effect on me, that I won't even attempt to begin to describe. Part of me wants to so badly believe that his slow but steady decline had some massive impact on my decreased drive, but if I'm being honest, I truly don't think it did. We are still in the depths of mourning and I can't begin to describe what it feels like not having this life force that you were attached to for 28 years suddenly not there anymore, never to return... But also part of me is so tired of doing nothing and I want to get back into the swing of things, but I just don't know how anymore. 

The industry I worked in (and hope to reintegrate myself back into) was incredibly hard to break into and harder still to stay relevant in, so after a two or more year hiatus, I'm a nobody. The landscape in that time has also changed significantly and most of the contacts I'd established have either moved on or in another country. The idea of starting from scratch makes me want to quite even before I've started. The time and effort (and money) I put in at the beginning truly were a young mans commodity. I've got the time now to do anything, but just don't have the drive (or money). 

As I needed some sort of income, I started a side business while I was no longer working in the creative industry. The side business actually generated some great income, which I blew like a fool. Eventually I lost interest in maintaining that side business and entered the dark age which I've been stuck in for a solid year now. Life has been completely stagnant, no changes, other than another ailing parent who I love more than anything and care for. She's not doing nearly so bad that it's an imminent situation, however I hate the idea of not knowing how long we've got together. I have no social or romantic life and my mum is my absolute everything. I just want her to get better and to live for a long time still- she's only 65. 

So here I am, about to turn 30 this year, with no schooling and no game plan whatsoever. I've completely forgotten how to live and, sadly (but it seems these days more importantly), how to make money. The life I've been living for years now is simply no longer sustainable and I've got to start real life- I just really don't know how. I have this desired skill-set, which allowed me to work at the top level of a very difficult to break into industry for years, yet I've no idea how to bank it anymore. I've completely fallen out of touch with the industry and don't know who to approach for work. I need to start earning a living so that I can support my mother (who has, along with my father, sacrificed so much for me throughout her life) and myself. I would also very much like to eventually start a family of my own, but that seems like such a far away fantasy currently while I have this great big mountain to overcome first. I truly feel like the biggest failure the world has ever seen. Age 30 still living at home, looking for the easy way out, no income, no prospects, no relationships, no nothing.",16Jun2019,1

114,"So last Tuesday I emailed my resume for a position that explicitly states “no phone calls”. But my situation is a little weird.

He basically said that I’d be good for the positions and stuff.

The person I’m shadowing said I should on Monday just re-mail her, not even acknowledging my last email. Just send my resume as if I never had before. This seems like a weird approach and in fact I’ve heard from places before that this is a thing I should not do.

116,"I’m a grade 10 guy, and I have a metal shop class with this girl who I will not name.

So ever since the beginning of the school year, this girl has asked me to help her work on what was supposed to be the first project of the year. The project was a mini cannon. I decide to help her, since from past experiences in highschool, she’s been nice. 

But the problem was that she didn’t do anything to help make HER project. Whenever i showed her how to do it, she would “try” for a bit and then say that she can’t do it. I felt bad for her because I know she’s dealing with depression and is suicidal. By now(near end of school year) I should have completed at least 3 projects, but I spent my entire year helping her make her project while making mine. She’s also lost so many finished pieces throughout the year, and it’s the most annoying thing ever. My teacher knows that i’ve helped her make the project, so I still end up getting a decent mark even though I’m way behind.

So here’s the big issue, a few days ago, I wad screwing my cannon parts together with a screw driver, and she asked for it. I was still using it so I said no. She then asked again, and I also said no. I was in a bad mood that day, so when I was done, I put the screw driver to the right of me(away from her). She then decides to agressively kick me, and then says things like “you’re so f**king annoying” and “i hate you”. I don’t really care what she says so I don’t say anything. So after i’m done putting my cannon together, I then reluctantly give her the screw driver. She struggles to screw the f**king piece together and then out of frustration yells “IM GOING TO FUCKING KILL MYSELF!”. But at that point, I didn’t give a shit. It’s like she was trying to gain attention, but it didn’t work. 

May I also add that she has only said thank you maybe once the whole year for helping her. It’s not my f**king job to help you, I was kind enough to help her, but she hasn’t shown any appreciation.

117,"Hey there. So, I’m not going to go into much detail about my job because it’s not that important. The town I live in is like 80% t-shirt shops, so that’s my job. Fold shirts, clean the store, blah blah. Anyway, to the reason I’m asking for advice. A few days ago there was a little storm with thunder and lightning. The shop puts out these big sale racks to get rid of unwanted stock from last year, so, obviously, I ran to try and get them inside before they got wet (I should also mention that our doors are always open). I get one in and as I’m wheeling in the other, I just see this bird on the ground. He’s not hurt, he’s standing and just sort of looking around. My first response was “Uh...hey there little guy” and I kneeled down to try and gently shoo him out of the store. This lead to about 20-25 minuets of me trying to catch the bird (which I did twice, the first time he just flew back in) while also trying to explain the situation to customers that come in so they won’t scare him and he doesn’t scare them. So eventually I grab him gently with a shirt and take him outside where I put him in a little garden patch. He didn’t come back. Until today. Today, along with running the shop normally, I was given the job of switching any hangers that were completely black plastic with ones that have a wire hook instead so our store down the street could have more hangers. I text the guy working in the other store and he agrees to meet me half way so we didn’t have to be away from our shops for long. As I walked to meet him half way, what did I see? The bird, just kinda chilling by the doors to a shop two doors down from mine. I tell the guy, he laughs, and we go back to our business. However, when I enter my shop, I hear chirping. In the big display window at the front of my shop is...yep, the bird. So I spend a good 5-6 minutes catching him in a shirt again and putting him in the same garden patch as before and then continued to see him for the rest of my shift. I’ve named him Brian.

So, I’d like some advice as to why he’s doing this and how I can get him to stop. It’s not that I don’t like him, he’s adorable and small and I love him, but I can’t have him pooping all over the store and freaking people out. Please don’t tell me to kill him or something, because I’m not going to have feathery blood on my hands. Thank you.",16Jun2019,1

119,"So I just stopped talking to someone I was going out with because we both sucked at telling each other what we felt. I fucking hated not being able to get a read of her and I suppose she felt the same way, she started being distant with me. But I supposed it's because I had a lot of girl followers and she thought she was just one more girl (when she was the only one), or it could be because she isn't into seeing each other anymore and that's fine.

I've never been good at telling her how I felt. We were too similar. So I stopped. But now, I can't stop thinking about her. She's the only thing that's in my head. It's gotten to the point where it's annoying and I can't get to focus on anything.

124,"My brother is far too busy. 

He has to work two jobs, which is fair enough as he needs to survive, but he's also a student and does various other things. I think he also plays some gigs for a little extra cash or because he feels obliged sometimes, and goes to classes to practice his language as that's what he studies. 

He needs to work, he needs to study, he needs to spend time with friends (most friends are his work mates, but he's said in the past he often finds it hard to leave them of they want to do something after work), and his housing is not secure so he has that to deal with too. He's also trying to date someone but in the past he's struggled as he can't give a girl enough attention. 

He's always tired. He's stretched too thin. He wants love but can't find it when like this. 

I'm not sure why he feels he has to do so much, he's been this way for years so it's not just that he's busy now, although that it an excuse he keeps givin. I don't know where he could cut down, but I think someone needs to tell him to slow down and I'm not sure how to approach it.",16Jun2019,1

Now, it hasn’t been large yet (only two sightings so far) but we were warned by the people leasing the apartment that this had been a problem in the past. We do not have agency over sealing the area off to prevent the problem, unfortunately. I want to get a dehumidifier for the apartment, because according to the Internet humidity can be part of the problem and we have a bad shower drain, but my roommate is ardently against it, claiming that the dryness irritates his skin.

131,"My mental health is always a hell of highs and lows. I loved my job. I was a manager of a couple cute small stores and I absolutely loved my job. It was never hard to go to work. Even a bad day at work wasn’t so bad and it was a great distraction for me as far as being “okay”. But this time I’ve had this cloud over me for months now and I’m afraid it won’t ever go away. I feel so hurt all the time and I’m so absolutely alone I don’t know what to do. 

So I guess what I was your opinion on is this:

My fiancé has a good job and has been working a lot trying to make a little extra to cover my slack. (I had quit my job because I moved hours away) He did so happily and I got a job, but the problem is this. I don’t think I can handle it. I did everything at the other place, but this job I can’t do it. I wanted to cry my whole shift but shoved it down. Clocked out, balled my eyes, bed, wake up, pre work cry, work, repeat. I can’t do it. It’s been SO hard to do it and I only do it to keep my half of rent. I feel like it’s really taking a hit on my mental health. But I’ve only been two weeks and all my coworkers are super sweet and great— it has nothing to do with the job to much I guess more so my anxiety and everything else can’t handle it. I feel worse about quitting because I’m afraid to be jobless again but I don’t know what to do.  I’ve already been feeling pretty bad and I think this job might just break me but I don’t know what else to do.

133,"Thanks in advance for any advice!

If you don't read any of the rest of this post, at least answer this question: do you prioritize living where you love and maybe not having the greatest job, or loving where you work but not liking where you live?

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the details on my situation:

My job is not perfect, but it has a lot better of an atmosphere than many other similar facilities. It's probably as close to perfect as I will find. However, I hate where I live. I'm younger than most of the population here. I haven't even been able to make friends in this area and I've lived here for almost 3 years. I can't make friends here because there is absolutely nothing to do here and most people are married with kids. I'm single, no kids. Pretty much everything I want to do is about 45 minutes away, and I can't make it to anything throughout the week because the drive is just too far. I get out of work at 6 so most things have already started by the time I get home from work. So I feel like my entire life is centered around my job...I basically work, come home, sleep, rinse and repeat. It's very isolating.

I decided to consider starting a business in a location that I love about 1 hour away. This would mean moving and leaving my job of course. While I'm not sad to leave this location, I do feel sad about leaving my job and the house that I own. However, I know I will have a more fulfilling life if I move to this new location. But I worry that I won't actually be able to start my business and that will leave me with having to work a crappy job somewhere...so while I might love where I live, I won't enjoy my job.

My girlfriend suffers from depression and they’re days when she doesn’t have the motive to talk or text at all with anyone including me. It causes me some stress, but it’s all out of worry for my girlfriend. When me and my friends would hang out they would notice the stress and I would tell them a few reason with my girlfriends depression being only one out of the many reasons I am stressed. After a few weeks they came to the conclusion that my girlfriend is causing all of it. They told me that my girlfriend isn’t good for me and that she treats me like crap. Even though I tried to tell them about her depression, they made up the excuse that she wasn’t trying hard enough to better herself. This generally made me mad even though I didn’t show it and it still makes me mad when I think about it.

136,"Hi! I'm a 19 year old female and *I never had a boyfriend*. I think the reason is that I'm anxious and socially awkward. I'm really curious of what it is like to be in a relationship. I'm so bored of my life right now and I feel so empty I need to fill the void of emptiness with love or happiness since my parents don't show me affection. I'm just looking for a meaning in life because I want to change myself for the better. Maybe love will change me in a positive way? or in a negative way.  I apologize for any grammatical errors. Not a native english speaker here.

Anyways I'm rambling. Well, I used to be friends with the guy I like before in 8th grade. He was my classmate and I get really shy to talk to him but online, we talk a lot of things. Almost everyday. We had deep conversations even in midnight. He is really nice and we have a lot of similarities. We also have the same sense of humor so it was really fun to talk to him. I kinda avoid him in person because everybody talks and I'm scared of people trying to tease me. I think he noticed that but it never came up in our conversations maybe he doesn't mind idk. I never let my friends know who my crush is because one of my best friends had feelings for him too. We stopped talking online in 11th grade and I feel so alone. Maybe he stopped talking to me because he got bored or he thinks that I hate him since I avoid him idk.  I never let my feelings show. Our friendship was platonic and I like it that way. I miss him. Last time I saw him in person, we had a group project for some reason and he was in our group (we're not classmates anymore). Anyways we met up and he greeted me a happy birthday before he left. I was so happy he did not forget my birthday. From all the guys I have a crush on, he was the only guy I **really like** till now and I wanted to confess my feelings to him before but I chickened out fearing he might avoid me.

137,"Hey Redditverse!

I’m in a tough situation at the moment. 

Basically, one of my oldest friends and I have been drifting apart slowly for the last 3 years or so, up until 3 years ago we were inseparable, but, things just started to cause us to drift apart. 

Now, we’re different people, we don’t share common interests anymore, we don’t get along like we used to and we always seem to be going at each other, arguing over the silliest things and feeling more and more frustrated with the other. 

I’ve noticed that we’ve started to bring out the worst in each other and it completely breaks my heart. 
Both of us so badly want to hold on to the relationship but we’re both just clinging to the past, the time where all the good memories exist. 

I feel like all there’s left to do is walk away, while we still have some care in our hearts for each other, but it’s not going to be easy. 

We’ve tried it before, tried going separate ways even opting to remove each other from socials, but for some reason we just can’t keep it up long and we always wind up running back to each other, promising to get better, but never following through. 

I don’t like the person I turn into with them. I’m not typically an angry or argumentative person, but with them I always seem to become that and it saddens me how sour I’ve become. 

How can I get over this friendship? I so badly want to leave it behind, but, the memories of the good times keeps bringing me back, even though I know I should stay away, I just can’t. Please help :(",16Jun2019,1
138,"Hello all,  
I have a friend whose life has just fallen to pieces. I don't know how to help him and he doesn't know what to do about it all. I have been friends with this guy since first grade, around 2000-2001. I know pretty much everything about him and him me, he used to spend the night at my place pretty much every other day. He has lived a relatively tough life in a lot of aspects. He has always had trouble making friends despite being a friendly and kind person, the few people he has dated have all been terrible in some way except his current girlfriend; who has been both of our friend for 10 years, and due to recent life events he has become afraid to make new friends.  


His family has also always been on the poor side and had rotten luck, they have lived in and out of hotels half of his life. When we were neighbors the other neighbors hated his family and would throw eggs at their cars and one time flooded their house (which forced them to eventually leave on top of his grandfather having most of his money stolen for something he invested in).  
He grew up with his grandparents, his father was completely out of the picture and he never knew who he was for about 15 years. His mom was abusive towards him when he was younger but it has gotten better now.  
He was molested for years by a family friend, he was bullied pretty bad growing up, he sometimes didn't have money or food for lunch at school, and overall things sucked.  


I admire him for the path he chose however. Instead of getting angry at everyone and everything he told me ""I won't fight back. All fighting does is cause pain and I would be no better than them. If I don't fight back and don't let anything bother me then they will give up."" He hopes to influence people positively so people are more kind to one another, he takes ""life's too short"" very seriously. Unfortunately he now has a really difficult time talking about his problems and pretends nothing is wrong because he doesn't really want to make other people upset or make his problems someone elses.  


He got in a relationship with the wrong kind of person and she abused him for years. She pressured him to drink, found ways to keep him from talking to me and his friends and family and put his name on bills he didn't know about or was asked about. She used his car on the toll roads without telling him and now he owes tens of thousands. They had a baby and when someone crashed into him that left him with an injury he still struggles with today, she dumped him and kicked him out into the streets at night far from me, his few other friends and his family. She was a bit on the rich side and accused him of abusing her without evidence and told me and his friends. I called bullshit and all but two of his other friends believed her. He had videos and recordings of her punching and kicking him, he has a scar from a knife wound she gave him, and even a video of her hurting their son but his friends didn't give him a chance to show them.  
She won full custody due to her having a great lawyer while he had none and with his injury it's hard for him to work. He found a job he really enjoys but he can't make the full monthly payments for child support because it is more than he makes in a month and he has wage garnishments from the bills she didn't tell him she put his name on. He works full time, sometimes overtime on top of that. This is his highest paying job he has ever had and with his injury he is usually in bed all day on his days off.

  


He got rid of all his social media accounts and stopped playing video games which he used to enjoy and every day since that day he has been more depressed than I have ever seen him. He only talks about how he is over $40k in debt, he tries to sell most of his stuff on ebay, he keeps offering to give my girlfriend and I his stuff for free, but most concerning of all was what he told me last night. He wishes he could just kill himself but he doesn't want to make anyone sad. He said there are so few people like me in his life now, and he is very thankful for it but wishes he could die without leaving me or anyone else upset. He questions if he did something wrong for his ex to treat him the way she did every day and because of her he has a hard time doing things on his own. He has to ask people for permission to do anything, even use the bathroom because of the way she conditioned him. His great grandparents passed away recently, with both their last words to him asking how his son is. He hasn't seen his son since before his first birthday and all he could do was say he didn't know and cry afterwards. When his grandparents pass away he believes he will be homeless or a huge burden to his current girlfriend or whoever and with how his ex left him he doesn't see any way he can save any money to live anywhere. He has always wanted to visit another country, it has been his dream pretty much but he can't get a passport anymore because he is past the amount of owed child support now to get one.  


  
So basically, this is my brother from another mother and he is honestly a really great guy and life has completely shit on him in a lot of ways. He wants to kill himself but won't because he doesn't want to make his family and me, his girlfriend and his other friend living with that sadness over our heads. He has tried to kill himself a few times in the past, they were all pretty bad hence my worry. I am very busy with university and work and his mom has told me he spends most of his free time just laying in bed except when his girlfriend and I visit, it's been like this for over a year now. I want to help him but my hands are full with my own life with my own problems until later in the year (He is fully aware and doesn't expect anyone to fix his problems for him, but I think he seriously needs help in some way). Is there anything I can do to help him? Can he be helped? I really don't want to see him be friendless and eventually homeless the rest of his life. He hasn't made any new friends outside his ex at the time in over 5 years and as of last year he has been completely closed to the concept of making any new friends. He is still friendly with people, just doesn't trust anyone he doesn't already know anymore.",16Jun2019,3

145,"My former doctor Father has been gaining weight gradually over the years. He used to be a healthy 180 pounds, but is now up to 250 pounds. Since he is getting older and his joints are giving him problems, he can't exercise as much. If this was the only issue, I wouldn't be so worried. The major issue lies in that this weight is centered solely around his stomach and has caused numerous health problems including back and knee pain. He is having trouble tying his shoes, getting dressed, and even driving because of this. When he tries a diet, he can only do it for about 2-weeks before giving up due to misery from hunger which then causes him to sling-shot further than his initial weight at the start of the diet. He has tried many different diets but none of them work for him. One of the main problems that I have noticed is that he is constantly snacking throughout the day, in addition to the usual 3 meals a day. When I confronted him about this, he gets defensive and says that he is always so hungry and that we (referring to science and doctors) don't fully understand how human appetite works. When I recommend healthier snacks he gets more aggressive and says that no one in the house of 3 will eat the healthy stuff. I tried telling him to stop buying the unhealthy snacks, like cookies and brownies, and he refuses and then proceeds to eat them mostly by himself. His doctors recommend him to limit eating, change his diet, and try exercising and all of those are hard for him to do now because of one thing or another. When I recommended seeing a dietitian or someone more knowledgeable about these situations, he brushes it off with the excuse that they will say what he has been hearing this whole time and it will be a waste of time and money. His weight gain has also accelerated in recent time, so I feel this is something that is important and needs to be fixed or at least addressed seriously before it becomes too late and spirals out of control. My Brother also feels that this is becoming a major issue for my Father and has tried to help him to no avail. It seems as though my Father has given up hope and stopped trying to lose or stabilize his weight, but he does continue to monitor it and keep tabs. What can I do to help him as this consistent weight-gain is ruining him slowly and giving more and more health problems?",16Jun2019,1

She also doesn’t help much around our house so that’s not exactly helping either.

149,"There is no need to go into great detail of every little thing, but I was stalked and harassed by someone that wanted to keep me around emotionally, but would constantly confuse me and say things that were offensive. 

I got fed up with it and made a stand for myself; only coming to realize that I missed them like hell during the period of no contact I intiated. They would call me week after week, which would depress my sense of moral in what I was doing. 

My reasoning was that it would be better for the both of us to just move on. They left a letter in my car on my property, and then showed up at my work with a phone I had lost months ago in their car. They told me they took it as a sign to communicate with me. 

I was upset, but since I had missed them so much it was like ""okay, I guess I'll allow this."" 

And then, at the end of the interaction, which was a talk about why they could never love me nor put me first, and how their ex (who they rubbed in my face constantly) was emotionally abusive. I had sympathy for them, but at the same time I knew we had to rip the band aid off and just stop speaking. 

They follow me on an art platform, and like a lot of my work constantly. Seeing their name on my phone is a trigger of anxiety, and obviously makes me think of them. 

I'm still trying to figure out what the right thing to do is, because every single night I have thought about seeing them and trying to work out a friendship with healthy boundaries. 

When I realized today all that had truly happened, I wondered why I wanted to keep them in my life. Directly after that, I started to recognize who else in my life might not be treating me with respect.

151,"This week I got two job offers. The first offer was conditional that I pass an intense government background check. Although I don’t see an issue with this, there is an issue that they don’t have a definitive date for when training begins and the commute kinda sucks. The second job offer starts this coming week, it pays less, they aren’t very accommodating with my last two semesters of school, but for whatever reason I’d like to get a feel for the company all the same. 

It’s weighing on me that I accepted them both. This is my first big kid job and I don’t want to let anyone down. Both jobs have cons. I should mention Im in a ‘at will’ employment state. Is there any legal issues I should be aware of for accepting both of these job (I realize this isn’t the legal advice sub), did I make a big oops? what should I consider when deciding where I should go?

155,"In 3rd grade I (19F) had just one of the most amazing teachers ever. I don't want to go into detail about how great she is but she's always left her mark on me.

I saw her once when I was like 12 or 13 at a school event but being an awkward preteen, I did not get the most out of seeing her because I was really shy.

Anyways, she was at my high school's graduation ceremony last year. She saw me from a distance and waved at me ""HI __SHADOWWALKER__ !!"" I waved back and called out hi to her. I tried finding her afterwards but the place was huge.

Now a few days ago my little brother was graduating from 4th grade. I saw her during the ceremony but stayed where I was because I did not want to disturb. Afterwards I tried to find her but was told she had left.

So I sent her an email. This isn't exactly what I had sent so it's a rushed similar version:

""Hi Mrs. Name! I just wanted to say hello and that I hope you're doing well. I saw you last year when we waved at each other from a distance during my graduation ceremony but I unfortunately could not find you afterwards. Today I was at my little brother's 4th grade graduation ceremony at Blank Blank Elementary School and saw you from a distance, but when I looked for you afterwards I was told you had left. You were always a wonderful teacher and person and I will always cherish the year that you were my teacher, so it was nice to see you even from a distance.

158,"Ok so I know my question is a little weird but here is some back story.
I live in a not so good neighborhood. I don’t hang out with the kids who live here because it’s that bad.

Anyways there is this guy (for sake of the story I will call “Barry”) who has been teaching to play guitar (I have been playing for like 2 or 3 years now and I asked him for help on bar chords because I was having trouble with them).

I first met Barry when I was walking my dogs, we would wave at each other from time to time. Then he started talking to my dad. That’s when I asked him if he could help me with bar chords.

Anyways we had been playing together for a few months and at first everything seemed fine, until he started calling me mama. He is like 30 years older than me (I’m 16) that so that kind of creeped me out. But I thought it might just be something he does because he lives in New York.

Anyways it was all well and good for a few weeks, but then he started drinking more around me, and when we were messing around, on the guitar, he would make up songs about me like he had a high school crush. I decided I didn’t want to be alone with him anymore and told my parents as such because he was just giving me bad vibes. On top of this he is always really close to me whenever we play, and i mean like face to face close.

Then I think today might have been the last straw. I was walking my dog and saw him sitting outside and so I decided to go and talk to him (his WIFE was home so I didn’t think it would be a big deal). We hugged to say hello (I am a big hugger) but when he put his arms around me, he touched my butt. Then when he pulled his arms away he brushed the sides of my boobs, which could have been an accident because I have bigger breasts then most Women I know. Then we talked for a few minutes and all was well and good. Then I said I should probably head home because I had to walk my other dog. And we hugged Goodbye which he proceeded to kiss my Neck. You read that right he kissed my NECK.

He is from NewYork and he does do the kids on the cheek thing. But it was my neck. I walked away in shear aw of what just happened.

Anyways now that you have some backstory I want to know if I should continue to hang out and play guitar with him. Barry seems like a nice guy but I just don’t know anymore.

I don’t want to stop learning from him but I feel like if I keep hanging out with Barry that I will be put into an unsafe situation.

TLDR: There is a guy who creeps me out but I like playing guitar with him. Should I still play with him?",16Jun2019,2

160,"I am going to be going into my senior year of high school. I decided a couple weeks ago that I would take spanish 4 over the summer in order to get that standard 4 years of foreign language and take a different AP class in the school year. I've of course taken spanish 1, 2, and 3, and done very meh in them. I've never been good at it. 

I started the online course a week ago, and I am struggling my hair off in this. An example is that the section has a module, and each module has several parts, and each part has a ""lesson"" with 2 assessments. Each lesson has like several pages with several side assignments that I don't understand. It takes me around an hour just to get through like 2 or 3 pages, and thats WITH attempting to translate everything I don't know. Then it comes to the actual tests which are even harder.   
I am seriously debating just straight dropping this summer course. I have always disliked spanish the most out of my classes, and it has always been somewhat difficult for me. However, I am constantly reminded of how important it is to have the standard ""4 years recommended"" of a foreign language for several colleges. I am pretty stressed by this class, and I do have other college related things to do. I am concerned that it'll affect me being accepted into colleges because I already have a very average weighted GPA and SAT score (which I am retaking in August with thorough studying), but I feel like I will be under way too much stress and that it is too difficult for me without constant assistance. It's also accelerated, so the heightened pace really does not help, as 26 assignments/tests have only 3 days time to do work on, so that means I have to spend the entirety of those days on this, which I feel is far too much.   
I'm being told just to stick to the class or put it back onto my schedule for senior year, and I really do not know what to do. I honestly don't think this course is worth its money and effort if I already struggle so much in it so soon into it, have already been very poor at the course, and have a general disliking for the class. I am also somewhat scared at the repercussions of dropping the class. I just don't know what to do.",16Jun2019,1

I talked to her face to face and she basically said “I don’t like you. It’s not Bc of what [the friend] said. It’s just I don’t feel that way. I did have a crush on you in fifth grade but that was just a tiny crush. I don’t think I’ll ever like you.” Hearing those words would make anyone wanna give up but I just can’t. Every part of me says that she’s the one and I can’t let some other guy date her and treat her badly. I don’t know if I’m ever gonna get over her even if Highschool is over(we both plan to go to college within our area.) I did tell her some things that I felt which I think she really took to heart such as “I’ve been attracted to other girls in a “oh she’s pretty” way but the way I’m attracted to you is much more deeper than that” and she said things like “I know 2 girls right now that like you. You should give them a chance and not waste your time on me.” Which I replied “I don’t care ab them. All I care ab is you.” We aren’t even awkward Bc this isn’t really news to either of us.

169,"I'd like to first make this clear that I am making this post with the actual victim's consent. They have read through this post and allowed it to be sent to this site.  
I have known them for a couple months now, and as time goes by I've slowly learned more and more about their situation. For the sake of making this easier to read, let's call them ""CS""  


Originally I thought CS was a pretty normal kid (roughly around 13) who likes music and playing games. I noticed they talked about bullies a bit, and on numerous occasions came to me for advice about exactly that, but nothing much further. I only began to really worry once they disclosed why they were being bullied. They told me of scars, bruises, and other marks left upon them from abusive parents. CS still lives in the same house as them and is still experiencing abuse. This, in turn, has left a lasting effect upon them. According to CS, they experience  ""ADHD, anxiety, depression, an eating disorder, panic attacks, visual impairment, and seeing people that they love die right in front of them plus trauma.""  
they then tacked on "" All that is cuz my dad""  


This is obviously horrible, but what's even more concerning is that CS's future may be in jeopardy. Their mother has planned for them to *skip high school, and actively discourages CS trying to choose a career of their own* because she wants her child to work for her.  Now, none of this is my business, I know, but I feel it's important because CS has actually said that they want to go to high school and pursue a higher education, and most importantly, pursue their own desired career if they can. Nobody should be denied a life of their choosing, and it's especially troubling that the person doing it is the one person who they're supposed to look up to the most.   


The whole incident that pushed me to make this post is receiving frantic messages from them in the midst of a panic attack. The story, as I was told it, is that CS returned home after a week at their aunt's house to see their keyboard, musical sheets, and other personal belongings destroyed. They say that their siblings did it, and their mother completely condoned it. CS absolutely loves music as it one of their only escapes, and their sibling's disregard for it and their mother's complete ignorance towards the destruction of property is an absolutely horrendous sign of a broken home.  


A broken home that CS so desperately wants to get out of.   


They've detailed to me attempts of running away, calling child protective services, and talking to school counselors only to be ignored over and over again due to mental illness and disabilities. 

Now, I don't know the legitimacy of these claims, but I'm inclined to believe them. My own past is one riddled with abuse and neglect, and having been someone who spoke out numerous times to blind eyes, I don't want to see another person's life ruined because of it. They have absolutely no way of collecting evidence since all technology that they own has been destroyed or removed.   


So I ask you for your thoughts, how can they get out?",16Jun2019,2

Her family is super strict and doesn’t allow her to leave her home since she is the middle child, I barely get to see her. Unless she sneaks out... which I tell her not to Incase she gets caught.

She is literally using her sister’s phone, because her’s stopped working randomly. So automatically through text we are very cryptic and low profile.

The only people in her family who knows about me is her six or ten year old sister, her sister knows I’m trans. She is very supportive of our relationship although she doesn’t know my girlfriend said yes to being mine.. My girlfriend is the hated child in the family, they take everything out on her.

She recently came out as bisexual and her family lost their cool..

She has an older brother who is going to our high school. It’s a campus with several schools inside we occasionally share floors.

Here’s where things get tricky. Her brother is very well known in all schools because he is a big athletic handsome guy. He is really homophobic like her dad.

Everyone in every school knows me because everyone comes to me for LGBT related questions. He knows about me. He knows I’m her friend but doesn’t know I’m her boyfriend... we keep a low profile at school. Considering her brother goes there and her aunt works security....

So if I want to get physical and display my love for her, I have to watch out for cameras and etc. 

She calls me my dead name in front of her family so her brother gets knocked off with who I am. Because her brother knows my voice and knows my reputation at the school. So she is afraid if they find out I’m her friend they’ll see. 

So Friday she and I were kissing on the stairs where there is no cameras and her brother was waiting for her downstairs and.. he pressed her about why she took so long. She lied and he knew she was lying. So he told her that he’d find out what was going on because he had connections to several people in our school he is gonna be in 12th grade.

Today her mom questioned my girlfriend on why she calls me so much and talks to me on the phone till nighttime. And told my girlfriend she couldn’t do that anymore. 

I’m at a lost for words. The summer is here and the only time I see my girlfriend is school.  The only time I can hold my girlfriend is in private for both our safety. Her family doesn’t let her leave the house to meet up anywhere so, I’m at a lost for ideas... I literally just want to her to feel safe. I knew what I signed myself up for but damn...

183,"Hey guys, before you read anything further know this: I have stopped completely. I hit my one year of being clean earlier this year, they are not new cuts, all of them are completely healed and all good. I don’t need any “oh, the easiest way to hide them is not not make them!” It’s a little late for that. I find that any time I try and talk about this, people assume I’m still cutting, but I’m not, so I thought I’d get that out of the way first. 

I self harmed for about two years, from the age of 13 to 15, and I was doing it pretty heavily for a solid few months at age 14. This left me, understandably, with heavy scarring all over my left thigh, most of my upper right thigh, and light scarring on my stomach. I live in a REALLY hot state, (it hit 112° today) and most people own a pool in their backyard. Luckily, I don’t, but my grandmother does, and I spend a lot of time there. The scars make it where I definitely can’t wear a suit, and swim shorts don’t cover enough. It’s been over two years and I’ve refused to go into the pool, claiming that my bleached hair would turn green if I did. I cut my hair a few months ago, though, so I can’t use that excuse anymore. My mom really pressured me to buy a suit at the store today and get into the water with everyone, and she seems really suspicious as to why I won’t get in. I really need help coming up with ways to tell her I don’t want to swim or wear a suit that won’t ring alarm bells. 

I can’t just tell her about my previous struggle, because once in that bad period, she caught me asleep and saw my stomach. She then yelled at me that she would get me committed if I were self harming, because she wouldn’t be seen as a bad mother. I just blamed it on our cats and she bought it. So now, I’m seriously worried that if I tell her, she’ll take me to a mental hospital and leave me there because I’m still a minor. So that’s not an option, unless anyone has ways I can tell her without insulting her parenting skills or whatever. I’m not, like, ashamed of my scars or anything, my close friends know, &amp; sometimes I wear shorts and skirts to school but it really sucks not being able to wear them at home. Sleeping in long cotton pants every day in 100+ degree weather is honestly awful.

Any advice on how to hide them around her and be able to wear swimming attire, or ways to keep me out of the swimsuits, or ways to tell her would be seriously appreciated. Thank you guys so much.",16Jun2019,2

186,"The first time I drank it was three and a half shots on a semi full stomach and nothing happened. The second time was tonight and I drank a lot (not in the aim to get wasted) but even though I drank a lot and am even on Prozac (which lowers resistance to alcohols influence), I was just tipsy. Four white claws, a shot, and a mikes hard and I felt nothing like how other drunk people feel. It’s weird and I’m wondering if maybe there’s something wrong with me?

187,"Basically, I’m an introvert. When I’m in a group setting, such as in a classroom or on a sports team, I’m good. I can add to a discussion, crack jokes, give an opinion on any topic, but once that’s over its radio silence. I don’t post on social media, don’t really text anyone (or have many peoples’ contact info), I never leave comments, and I barely even like posts. The thought of reaching out to someone gives me major anxiety (not claiming to have an anxiety disorder) so I just don’t do it. I feel like if anyone wanted to talk to me or hang out then they’d reach out to me right? One person at least once? But nothing. 

I’ve pretty much always been like this which is how I used to prefer things. When I was younger I played sports pretty much all year round so between school and that, I saw my “friends” very often and didn’t feel the urge to spend the rest of my free time with them as well. Never in my life have I had a best friend and looking back I really failed to form deep connections which is why I say “friends.” Throughout my first 3 years of high school I’ve managed to systematically tear down my network of “friends.” I stopped playing football after my freshman year and was cut from the school baseball team. This year I didn’t even try out because I felt like I was on an island anytime we were all working out together. 

I had decided while school was still in session that I would just wait it out until I was off to college where everyone was new and I would have a larger pool to find a group of lifelong friends. But now that school has been out almost a month, I’m going insane. I work almost everyday then I come home and waste my entire evenings and still don’t go to bed until 2am then do it all again. I have younger siblings and both parents but I literally don’t have a single person outside of that to talk to. I feel like an unwarranted dm to someone I don’t know wouldn’t go over very well and even if it did, everyone else has their own group they mess with and I’m just over here solo dolo with nothing going for me. 

From my POV, I can carry a conversation very well if I know at least one thing about the person but I can’t fathom how to transition to texting or hanging out and off the top of my head can’t think of one person in the world that I’d like to hang out with because that’s how many people I know like that.

188,"Let me start out by saying I would appreciate no negativity about this post because yeah I know it’s messed up. 

Two months ago I (20F) got dumped through a text by a guy I really really liked and had feelings for. I thought we were going to be so much more and it really really hurt me. But I decided it was his loss and I needed to move on. I started talking with this guy who I shall call John (23M) we were talking on a bf/gf level but I’m not sure if it was labeled that. 

I randomly met up with this guy I’ll call him Matt (don’t really know his age I believe 25 or 26) and smoked together and that led to us having sex. We didn’t use a condom and he pulled out. (Obviously didn’t work) after that night I felt bad like I cheated on John so I ghosted Matt right after that. 

Fast forward to last week and John saw messages from Matt and he came to the conclusion that Matt and I slept together. He hasn’t left me and still talks to me the same except his snarky remarks about me “being with Matt” or something like that. I was a week late for my period and John knew that and he said “you’re pregnant with Matt’s baby” but the day before my period John and I had sex for the first time without a condom. (Another story for a different time). However I doubt he’s the father seeing as though I’m already having symptoms. 

I am in fact pregnant and have been to the doctors. I have talked to Matt about the baby and were trying to figure out what to do and how to go about it because we don’t even know each other in the slightest. One thing I do know is I will raise this baby to the best of my ability. So I guess my question is, how do I go about telling John. Do I try and save the relationship with John or do I work with Matt to make this little “family” work. Please any advice helps

189,"I live in a school dorm.

On Thursday, we were told that there's going to be counter top replacements happening in the kitchen. Once i got back to my dorm from work (summer), everything was finished and I didn't think once about it.

They said that this is to prepare for ""asbestos abatement"" in the piping system underneath the kitchen sink that's going to happen on Saturday. They said a specialist will be brought in and all government standards and procedures will be followed. And that the air level will be monitored constantly through out the process. I wasn't worried about this as it seemed like they knew what they were doing.

But on Friday, when I came back, I saw that our kitchen was taped off with tape that said ""ASBESTOS - DO NOT ENTER."" There were vacuums running.

Then I open my email and see this:

https://i.imgur.com/zrt3V4l.png Now, the email is trying to really trying hard to sound like nothing serious happened... maybe trying to ease the tension with a pizza party. But I have my concerns...

It wasn't just ONE kitchen that was being cleaned for asbestos. All other kitchens in different buildings were being cleaned and taped off as well. This tells me that it wasn't just a tiny ""oops. nicked the wall."" mistake that caused this incident. The contractor must have royally fucked up when installing the counter tops and drilled into walls when he shouldn't have or something. Otherwise there's no reason that all the kitchens in different units are being cleaned. It's something that was repeated through out the installment of countertops in different kitchens. Not just a tiny bump into the wall or something that nicked the wall. This makes me worried because obviously, the scale of damage would have been bigger if this was the case.

From what I've heard, asbestos travels incredibly easily and floats for days in the air. If the kitchen was contaminated, there's no reason that our suites weren't contaminated as well. Any time someone cooks, the smell travels upstairs instantly. Any dust that floated around the kitchen would have gotten into our rooms. This means that I was breathing in all this dust yesterday.

and the last thing that pisses me off the most... WE WEREN'T NOTIFIED OF THE INCIDENT UNTIL THE DAY AFTER WHEN THE CLEANING CREWS ARRIVED. This means that on the night of this incident, all the students used the kitchen freely. I didn't even wipe my dishes that were stored in drawers with huge gaps at the front.

190,"I’m 19, and currently unsure how to feel about my living situation. I currently live with my parents, and I’m not really paying for anything except a few of my own expenses (most of my food, my phone bill, my tuition, and then just any other random things I want to buy). I go to a Commuter University full-time (18 credit hours/semester) and work part-time (usually a bit under 30 hours a week). I just can’t shake the feeling that I’m overstaying my welcome with them; they swear up and down that I’m okay to keep living with them for as long as I need, and don’t ask me (or seemingly want me) to help contribute towards Rent or anything like that. I also know that my parents aren’t really confrontational people at all, and if they did have problems, they wouldn’t really bring them up with me.

192,"I showed up to work today slightly sick, but no one noticed because I did my best to act as I normally do. The store was a fairly busier than it normally is because of Father's Day weekend, so I'm glad I was able to tough it out. I'm scheduled tomorrow at 10 am (our store opens at 8 am) but I think I'm going to have to call in sick. After I got home everything got worse. I have a huge headache and a lot of nausea and I think I'm getting a fever (maybe the flu). I also didn't eat at all today because of my nausea so I'm feeling fatigued too.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Our older cats can either move across the country, stay in their city but in a much lonelier household, or possibly cramp into a one bedroom apartment with me. None of the options are ideal. What do I do? :/

&amp;#x200B;

I’m going to leave out the emotional details of this, but basically my mom is taking a job across the country and moving with my youngest sister while my dad stays in our home city. My middle sister and I will also be in home city attending college, but neither of us live with our dad. I am the oldest, my younger sister (2Sis) is a couple years younger than me, and the youngest is a preteen (3Sis). 3sis is the one going with my mom.

The living situation (Relevant to give context on where is the best place for pets): My mom is getting a relatively large house for her and 3sis in the new state. Geographically, the distance between home city and new state is over 20 hours by car, so the only feasible way to travel there is by plane. 

My dad is moving alone to another equally sized home they have in home city (dad’s new home is very close to our current family home).

I attend the state college in home city and currently live alone in a one bedroom apartment downtown, about fifteen minutes from dad’s new home. 

2Sis will also be attending the same college as me in home city, and will live in semi dorm-style student housing. 2sis and I will live basically within sight distance of each other. 

Our family has two cats. We have had them for about 13 years, since before 3Sis was born. Although they are technically family pets, 2Sis and I each chose one (the cats are siblings) and each think of one as “ours”. Our whole family loves these cats immensely, they are incredibly sweet and have been a huge part of our lives. It’s difficult to imagine being without them. Therein lies the problem. 

Basically, the options are either the cats go to the new state with my mom and 3Sis, they move to dad’s home in current city, or possibly they come live with me in my apartment. There are issues with each of these options.

Going with mom: Firstly, obviously 2Sis and I would be devastated by this, and although we can and would visit, new state is far enough away that we would need to fly. We are both college students and this won’t be frequently feasible. Also, the cats are kind of old and we are worried about the health risks of transferring them across the country and then into a new place. But probably the biggest issue is that 3Sis is adamant in wanting to buy a dog at the new house and my mom seems to be okay with this. 3Sis wants a large dog, and 2Sis and I are very worried about introducing the cats to a new animal this late in their lives, especially one that could possibly terrorize them. However, this option is the one where the cats would be around the most people (my grandparents also live in this state and may move in with mom and 3Sis).

Going with dad: Originally, this seemed to be the best option by far. The cats have been to dad’s home before, it’s very close, and it would be easy for 2Sis and I to visit them (we both have cars and are close as stated before). However, my mom also loves them and would miss them, and so would 3Sis, although she is more excited about getting to pick out a dog that would be “hers”. Also, I’m worried about the cats being lonely- they love people and all their lives have lived with our family and are used to being surrounded by people. My dad’s job means semi frequent traveling, and I’m worried that 2Sis and I’s schedules won’t allow us to visit as often as we’d like. Also, the cats always sleep in one of our beds so us not being there at night might be detrimental to them. I also worry 2Sis and I may start to feel stressed/guilty about them being lonely.

Living with me: This option probably has the most issues and may not be possible this year. I would have to make special arrangements with my apartment complex for them to be allowed to live with me. The cats are also used to a 5+ bedroom house, and I worry that my one bedroom apartment will be way too small for them. Safety wise, I also have a very high up balcony and I’m scared of them either getting out and falling or one of my friends accidentally letting them out when they visit. Additionally, I will be away from my apartment a lot so the issue of the cats being lonely is also possible. The only positives would be I guess my own feelings and that 2Sis could pop by anytime.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve spent a whole lot of time wracking my brain over what to do here and gotten nowhere, so this is my last resort besides possibly trying to ask a therapist. My own feelings about the cats aside, my biggest concern is their comfort and happiness. I love them more than I’ve loved anything in my life and I just want them to have a relaxing place full of love to spend their last years (hopefully a lot of years). I think the final decision will primarily rest on me as the oldest (my mom has basically left the majority of the decision to 2Sis and I as they were originally “ours”) and I don’t know what to do. I would love any advice Reddit has to offer, especially from pet owners who have been through similar situations or from anyone who has read through this novel of a post. I sincerely appreciate any responses.",16Jun2019,2

I'm on the verge of losing my mind. I know I'm in the wrong for holding grudges, and holding grudges is bad, but I just can't forget. Punishment in my household was spanking until I was around 10 years old. The worst it ever got was when my little brother brought back bad grades, Mom was already in a bad mood, and she made him pull his pants and underwear down so she could spank him. He cried, of course, and my mom just kept repeating, screaming, ""stop crying! crying doesn't solve anything!"" and I know it doesn't. Oh, I know. I know I know I know. Crying is bad. Crying isn't allowed in the household unless it's in a little hidey-hole where no one can hear you. 

Then there was no more spanking after a while, just the screaming. She gets mad at me when I'm unable to clean my bathroom. I was never taught to clean my bathroom. She then teaches me how and gets mad at me when I don't understand something on the first try, so she just ignores me until she feels like talking to me again. I can't drive properly. My driving sucks because I hardly practice, and I'm too scared to ask for practice because I don't want my dad to slam his fists around or yell at me. Memories pop up of spankings or yelling or times where I felt hopelessly lost, and the few times I've mentioned it to my parents, they rolled their eyes or sighed or said ""You were a kid, *of course you exaggerated.* You're so forgetful. It's like you already have Alzheimer's."" I can't tell anymore. Did I change it in my head? I can't remember if I'm right or wrong, and my memory feels so muddled up with different stories. I feel like I'm losing my mind because I can't even remember something as simple as how to iron a shirt.

Yes, I got to therapy. I think my parents should go to a doctor, but even a little mention of that makes me scared shitless. I know they won't go. They both hate even the mention of therapy. My dad thinks mental illness is fake. What do I do? I know I (Rising senior in high school) am too old to get help at this point and even hope for a new home, but I need to make a change. I don't want my brother to think he's a failure. I don't want my brother to have depression, but he's already beginning to act like I did. My Abuelo is here, and I know he would take my brother to their better household. Am I crazy? Am I overreacting? Do I need more therapy? Maybe my parents just need a little therapy? I don't know, I don't have anyone to compare to. It just feels wrong, but I can't tell anymore. I need in-state tuition, so whatever happens, I *must* stay with my parents.

199,"Over the last few years, my little sister C (age 19) has been become an extremely devout Christian, to the point that I am concerned for her well-being. 

Some background: my family is from the southern United States, so typical of most families there we were all raised in church, i.e. we went to church every week, went to Sunday school/youth group, we were all baptized and confirmed etc etc. We were also homeschooled and our group of friends was pretty much entirely other Christian homeschool families. So growing up we all had a very narrow view of the world. 

The thing is, as my siblings and I have grown up and left home, we have all pretty much moved away from this type of lifestyle. Most of us don’t go to church at all, though a few of us still do. For the most part, my siblings have a pretty open minded view of the world (thanks mostly to higher education, as all of us have gone to college outside of our hometown and have gotten to see a much larger picture of the world than our parents presented to us).

That is, everyone except C. She has always been very sincere and eager to please. Growing up, we called her the angel of the family, because she would always be the peacemaker when our siblings would fight and was just generally very sweet and unassuming. She would often fly under the radar because the rest of us have quite big personalities. She did fine in school but was always a bit slower than the rest of my siblings. She was very artsy and was quite talented at painting and drawing and even took private painting lessons. In middle school she was also very into hair and makeup and would watch beauty tutorials online.  

I first noticed a difference in her soon after my parents switched churches (we were raised Lutheran, and they joined a Methodist church right before I left home). 

C was right at the age when you start going to youth group, so this was her first experience with that. I’m not exactly sure how it happened, because I went away to college soon after, but over the next few years my sister became increasingly involved in the church and in religion, way beyond what anyone else in my family has done including my parents. One of the first things I noticed was that she began to dress very conservatively. Before, like I said, she was into hair and makeup and fashion, but as she became more involved at church she started wearing conservative clothes, she grew out her hair long and stopped wearing contacts, and never wore makeup. I’m not sure why she started doing this because the church was not particularly conservative and my parents have never really cared about that, and as far as I know this wasn’t something that was preached by the youth group. She also stopped making her art around this time. 

Then, she began fasting for increasingly long periods of time. Fasting was never something we did growing up, and wasn’t done in any of the churches we went to, so again, I’m not sure where she got the idea from or why she felt she needed to do it. But it was extreme, to the point where my mom had to take her to the doctor because she was so malnourished and underweight. Soon after this, she started going to religious therapy and taking antidepressants for a time, and I think it helped, while she was doing it. (This was encouraged mainly by my sister, A, who is closest in age to her, and was super close to her growing up and also her exact opposite in many ways- an extreme rebel, very contrary, always fighting with my parents and not religious at all)

Well, this past year C started college at a small religious university close to home. The type of school were bible classes and chapel are part of the curriculum. When I’ve asked her about it, she has said that she likes college and has met a lot of people, but I kind of get the impression that she doesn’t have a lot of friends. I know that her roommate moved out after a semester, and my sister doesn’t know why. 

A week ago, A called me and told me that she was super concerned about my sister and kind of freaked out. A and C were both home from college for the summer and A told me that C had gotten even more extreme, to the point where all she would do all day was pray- she has a phone reminder that goes off every 5 minutes with a different person’s name, and she disappears into her room and prays out loud for them for hours. She even sent me an audio clip and it scared the crap out of me, it sounds like something out of a cult (repeating the same phrase over and over again in a monotonous tone). A said that C wouldn’t even talk to her, and whenever A would try C would just stare at her and leave the room and pray. A was especially upset because they used to be so close and now C won’t talk to A because she’s not a Christian. 

I just came home for a visit a couple days ago, and while C has been friendly to me, we haven’t really talked and she has been pretty much shut up in her room the whole time praying. Tonight, she told my mom she wasn’t going to eat dinner because she was fasting. This prompted me to ask her where she was getting this from, because I didn’t think she was still fasting, and she wouldn’t answer me. I tried to talk to my parents about her behavior and how I was concerned but they brushed it off- I think they are a little worried but have always praised her for being so devout and she’s their only child to really keep the religious upbringing so I feel like they don’t want to admit that there is a problem. 

I’m not sure what to do- part of me doesn’t want to say anything, because I know that her beliefs are her choice, but also I am genuinely worried about her and her mental and physical health. I would like to talk with her, but am doubtful she would even be open to a dialogue because I am not religious. I also feel bad because I want her to have a normal life, and I feel like if she continues this way she will never be able to have a close relationship with anyone, especially as she seems to be cutting off even her family. Should I get involved, and if so, how can I approach her without being immediately closed off?",16Jun2019,1

If I try to adopt this advice for paper, then I need to write on a vertical piece of paper and it isn't very practical. Also, it would be impossible in a classroom.

211,"Hi,

Sorry for this drunken rant. My boyfriend and I have been together since October of 2017.  We are in a LDR. Shorting you the disguising details, we are kind of the perfect match; similar hobbies, interests, ideologies, the works, you know?

So, to make things simple, my boyfriend, Mat, is from a broken family. His biomom, Meri, is super overbearing and controlling and manipulative. His half-brother, Gareth,is  from Meri. My boyfriend grew up being the pseudo-dad to because Meri wouldn't ever grow up and raise a child. Mat became a dad at 8-9 years old.

His mom claims to be bipolar and has prescribed both her sons to be such, even though it is questionable. (It is really just naivety and immaturity/being influential). My bf is not bipolar, and his brother, Gareth, suffers from affluenza. He has never heard the word 'no' because the step-dad and biomom are afraid of his reaction). Gareth is now 20 year old.   

Anyway, long history aside... When I was visiting Mat on his birthday (1 1/2 years together) his brother (20M) snuck down and listened to us having relations for half an hour. For upwards of 30 minutes. We checked the room and called out to him twice...after I thought I heard someone... I checked the room and waited..., to no avail. Upon completion, the brother sat up and made his presence known. 

I was naked at the time and mortified. There was no way that that sex wasn't going on and the bro waited until we were at out most exposed to make himself known. Mat was just coming out of the shower and didn't know what to say. We left for the weekend.

Gareth, Mat's brother, decided to tell Meri, Mat's mother, that we were being mean to him and painted a different story. Even after we told her what really happened, she said, ""I have to take his side otherwise it is two on one"". She proceeded to tell us that is what our fault for not getting out of bed and checking the **entire** room for Gareth, even though we did and called out to him twice, wait, *and check the room*. 

This happened in April and Meri, the mom, told Mat, that I should get used to it because I will be a cop.

Tonight, two months later, she came down while we were on skype so I shut down my video and audio (I told Mat that I want to be No contact with his mom and brother). She said, over text, ""so now she doesnt say hi?"" and how she was ""angry about how I was portraying [the brother]"" 

Even though I never said ANYTHING (in the entire HOUR AND A HALF SCREAMING MATCH in person while I could not leave the area) about the brother other than ""Gareth, be the person you want to be around"". 

And how my partner, Mat is, joining 'a different life' and how I, his partner, doesn't 'understand it'. 

I have struggled with telling Mat to go No contact because it is his mom and brother, yet I feel they are super toxic and negative and just... no good for him. I really don't now what to do.

213,"So I never had many friends growing up, and I never really seemed to learn how to develop friendships that weren’t shallow. I’m aware of it, and I tend to end up pushing people away by getting too attached — so I’m already starting on a poor friendship-building foundation. I try and get better at it, but more than anything I’m worried I’m going to make a fool of myself and my social anxiety takes over.

I’m a grad student in a new city, though I’ve been here for a year now. I don’t really have many friends in the area, if any at all. Took a course this summer where we were required to do discussions with people, and the person I was partnered with was someone that I felt we had a good rapport.

We’ve talked about work and networked a bit in that manner, and I reached out to ask them a few questions about what they do for work as it’s something similar to what I want to do, which was a huge step for me because I never do that sort of thing.

I could see myself being friends with them, and I think it would be awesome, but I don’t know how to make that step towards friendship. I’m worried that it’ll make things awkward if we have another course together, and that’s the last thing I want. How would you go about making the transition from acquaintance to friend?",16Jun2019,1
214,"We have 2 bathrooms, one is en suite and both are connected to the same ventilation shaft.  The bathrooms don't have any windows and the air flow is managed by exhaust fans that get turned on when the lights are turned on.  We do not know which but one of our neighbour’s smoke in the bathroom: There is no pattern to it; it can be morning, late night, weekend, weekday, holiday.  We live on the first floor and the ground floor is retail space, there are a total of 31 apartments in this building.  The trouble is, we do not just smell a faint smoke when we go into the bathroom. We sometimes wake up to a strong smoke that is coming from the en suite bathroom.  Our towels and bathrobes smell strongly of smoke sometimes.

   
We live in a developing country where if we were to complain to any authority we would be dismissed.  The apartment maintenance company has sent out e-mails on our request to habitants bu that proved to be ineffective.  My husband is now ordering exhaust fans with shutters hoping that this will keep the smoke out.  We even debated using a stink bomb through the exhaust fan to have the smoker feel our pain but that did not seem very civilized.  But we had it and we do not know what to do about it.

216,"So I’m going to be a junior in highschool and all of my friends are either graduated or going to be seniors. I know that the repercussions of having older friends is watching them leave, but these people are literally all I have. 

My parents split before I was born, in fact they were actually never together. My dad is pretty wealthy and successful, while my mother was an illegal immigrant from Mexico (who is legal now) who works almost 7 days a week to keep us going. Im with each of them half the week. They both are now married. 

Since my mom is working and my stepdad does uber, im home basically 7 hours a day with nothing but time. I live far away from my friends, in a really sketchy and scary part of San Diego. So i cant go outside.  I have almost no freedom at my moms because she is very protective, and it frustrates the shit out of me when i cant go to friends and hang out and they expect me to sit inside all day with nothing to do. My mom and stepdad are struggling in their marriage and it scares me sometimes because all i want is my mom to be happy. 

At my fathers i would say that i had a rough upbringing. I also understand that my father had an even worse upbringing. I didnt see my father for the first five years of my life because he was in los angeles doing stuff to improve his career. He moved down to san diego to see me more often, but i found that whatever i do for him is never enough. I was scared to go to his house and my middle school years were probably the scariest time of my life at his house. I became severely depressed due to emotional and verbal abuse. But things are getting better. I dont see him either that much bc he is traveling, but i dont get a hug home when he comes back, its more yelling and screaming at me about what the fuck im doing with my life. 
Sorry if im rambling i just got a lot on my mind. 

Back to my friends, they are all i can depend on and all i have and i cant believe they are gonna leave. I want to spend the most time i can with them, but its hard when i cant leave my house at my moms, and i have freedom at my fathers but lately things havent worked out with leaving and when i do chill i dont want to come home.

My family and I did move to a new Church eventually but it was better and worse then the last Church. I constantly get memories of these moments even after I moved churches and many years passed from these incident. The church isn't that far away from where I am and honestly I'm scared.

My Mom has been also trying to get me to go to Church more often but I'm too scared of what happen there would happen again here.

224,"So! I'm a 21 year old male, and I met a girl online, 32 years old. We're in a closed polyamorous relationship, including her husband.

I'm also going to her home on the 24th, a one way ticket to stay for an indefinite time, I'll purchase a ticket to come back likely sometime in July. 

I'll admit my social life has been consumed by her, but I'm never obligated to speak with her. I'm never guilted, I'm always encouraged by her to hang out with my family, to go do things, unfortunately I'm unmotivated and genuinely only really enjoy my time at work since I adore the public. 

Anyways, my mom doesn't think it's safe, and she insists that by me doing this I don't love her, or that I'm in the wrong hands, and more. In fact today she took the doorknob off of the door where I usually go to to talk with her (my mom pretty much banished me there, saying she doesn't want to hear her, as did my sister). 

What baffles me most is that, well, she wants to meet my family, but mom always says no, every time I offer it, or she offers it.

226,"(Sorry in advance for the English, not a native speaker) 

I've noticed this a few times, and just recently this happened to me. ""Cold war"" between girls. I can't stop thinking of why it happened, who is in the wrong and what I should do to stop it. 

There are two girls I regularly meet at a class we attend in college. We've had some interactions, but most are indirect and usually involve third parties (other people, tutors, etc). Just for context, they are those pretty, rich girls who by the looks of them you could guess that they're picky of who they're friends with. I got fairly close with the others who go to the same class; we follow each other on social media, always liking each others' posts, commenting, replying and so on. Except for these two. I think they even muted me on some, or purposely went out of their way to not interact with me.

I don't think I have major character flaws that could cause people to dislike me. Interactions with my classmates are fine, there are only about 30 of them &amp; I'm quite close to ALL of them. But of course, except for these two. We'd bump into each other at hallways, but would NEVER say anything. Totally not normal lol. I mean I know I shouldn't think too much about this, but sometimes the cold ""interactions"" get awkward. I'm not too keen on being friends with them, because they're not my type of friends, I'm a more reserved, a little loud but not as... expressive? as they are. And not as rich. Shallow but I hope yall get what I mean lol.

My main problem here is that it makes me think endlessly about why they are acting this way around me. And yes, I care about what people think of me, although I try to keep this emotion as constrained to a rational level as possible. Also, what do I do when I get assigned a group work with either one of them? Does the ignoring/awkward silence go on or will we only be okay then? (context: I've never been assigned a group with them) Appreciate thoughts and insights on this because I believe there are people on here far more experienced than I am that can tell me what they think about this.",16Jun2019,0

228,"

I apologize if this is a jumbled mess. I’m on hour 4 out of 5 the ride home and it’s been a long day. I thought maybe you guys could offer me some advice before I deal with corporate on Monday. To be honest, I’m often not taken seriously because I’m a 23 year old woman and sound very young on the phone so any advice would be appreciated. 

Here’s the situation: I graduated with a Masters today and also moved out of my apartment. We hired a moving company to move my one-bedroom into a storage unit 12 miles away. We were verbally quoted $495 on Monday and they declined to put that in writing (our mistake). Today, they showed us a contract that quoted $495-675 depending on how long it took. However, the entire apartment was boxed up and ready to be moved into the truck so they assured us it would be at the low end. 

The movers were supposed to arrive between 2 and 4. They arrived at 6:18. My brother, mom, and I hauled ass helping them to load and unload their truck, but it didn’t do much good. Because they were so late, we ended up setting off the alarms at my storage facility for being there after 9pm (which I just found out was a thing today) and I may end up with a $100 fine. We called the Chicago PD non emergency number to try to avoid them coming out and responding to the false alarm and hopefully the fine, but it’s unclear right now if that worked. The movers also realized after we had locked up everything and couldn’t get back in that they had left 2 boxes on the truck, so now those are very tightly squeezed in the car as we road trip back home. 

They told is would be be $705. This doesn’t feel right at all to me. Obviously we paid, but we have a call in with corporate and we are furious. On an emotional level (which I know you don’t care about), I left graduation early to meet these movers ON TIME and they weren’t even there. But legally:

1.) they were over 2 hours late which in turn caused their overtime and may caused me to be fined. My Reservation was 2-4. Does that mean anything or nah? 

2.) they totally baited and switched me. It seems to be common in the moving business to quote one thing and then almost double it. How do I combat this? 

3.) Any other advice for dealing with this?

231,"So, I'm in 8th grade and last year a new girl came to our school. She was quiet at first and received a bit of bullying from the cooler kids for being Chinese. She ignored them and they got bored and it eventually stopped. Come 2019 and she's in my class. One of my friends had already been friendly towards her and tried to invite her into our group. NG (New Girl) accepted and started hanging out with us. At first, it was fine. NG would follow us sometimes and add things to our conversation to make us laugh. Then at some point she grew a bit too confident. She now follows me and my friend EVERYWHERE and refuses to leave us alone. She has lost our sense of humor and has absolutely ZERO sense of personal space and will often almost fall out of her seat to practically breathe down our necks looking at what we're doing on the school computers. We asked her a few times to back off a bit but to no avail. It's grown worse, and at this stage she often criticizes and laughs at us. Me and my friends sometimes make insult jokes that are meant to bad and make us laugh. NG on the other hand sees this as an opportunity to join in at every opportunity to agree with the insulter in a very non-joking fashion and adding on to their meant-to-be-bad insults. For example, last week I got a haircut and my friend jokingly said ""Who are you?!"", when I came to school that day. NG then said very loudly ""WOW ANON YOU LOOK WEIRD. YOUR HAIR LOOKS SO! WEIRD IT WAS BETTER BEFORE"". Whether she has some sort of mental disadvantage she's just very socially inept, I don't know. She has actually made other friends with similar interests but always comes back to us. My friends have gotten sick of this and are very harsh on her sometimes yelling at her to go away. I haven't gotten that far but it's driving me insane! We've given NG her chance but nothing we do will work.

- I completely support myself in terms of rent, food, job, and eduction because I was kicked out of home for telling my parents I was feeling depressed and that I was having suicidal ideation (Immigrant parent Logic).

- I’m currently living in a frat house because the rent is cheap $650/Mo , and It’s an absolutely shit experience cause they are coke heads, alcoholics, thieves, and racists.

- I work at a Real Estate Brokerage part-time and make about $1200/Mo, so I can’t afford to live anywhere else as is as real estate is stupid expensive in the city. I have only about $1100 in my bank account.

- I’m starting a Business with my friend to hopefully get me enough cash to move somewhere nicer by the end of summer.

- My Dad tracked me down, came to my frat and threatened to get me kicked out by the landlord, to get me fired from my job, and tried to physically fight me. And is waiting for an apology... from me.

- I was just elected President of a club (to which I did not even show up for elections, because I didn’t know if I wanted the role) on campus but am not sure if I’ll be able to commit to it.

- I’ve isolated myself because I feel like I’ve just outgrown my entire social circle because I have to deal with adult stuff, and I don’t even have a desire to party anymore.

- I really just feel incredibly lonely and stuck in life because I have to work all the time to stay afloat and I find it difficult to relate to anyone these days.

236,"I recently started my first job at a fast food restaurant, and have only worked 2 shifts; my third is tomorrow afternoon. My first shift started off kind of badly but eventually I got the hang of how things needed to be done and it ended well. When we were closing I had a very friendly coworker explain to me everything I needed to do, and I was working up until it was time to go.
My second shift went fairly well, I was still learning but I was starting to feel more comfortable because I was working with a different assistant manager and different coworkers (aside from the one who helped me, my coworkers from the first shift were very rude.) I finished everything I needed to do early and I was trying to figure out what else to do, but couldn’t find anything that clearly needed to be done and my manager and coworkers were all really busy so for a few minutes I was going back and forth from looking for something to do and trying to catch my manager in a brief free moment. But because I did this, my manager got annoyed and sent me home (not “early,” but earlier than everyone else.)
And aside from the friendly coworker, who doesn’t even work there anymore, I feel like there’s a real lack of communication because my managers don’t explain to me how to do things I’ve NEVER DONE BEFORE, and when I approach them and ask questions, they’re rude to me, regardless of if the store is busy or not.
I never wanted to work fast food and I feel like I would do a lot better in retail, even though it can still be very stressful. I have an interview at a retail store on Tuesday, but I don’t even want to go to work tomorrow. I feel like no matter what I say to my manager, she already thinks I’m lazy, even though I had done a really good job the whole day prior to that.
I know I should talk to her if problems arise again tomorrow, but is this a job even worth keeping? Fast food is just inherently bad, I know,  but why am I expected to know things I haven’t been taught yet?",16Jun2019,1
237,"Me (16f) and my friend (17m) are going to a small concert in a city 3 hours away in October but we have no idea what to do when the concert ends. He'll be driving there, the concert starts at 8:30pm and will end at around 10pm, which means if we drive home we will arrive at around 1am. He doesn't want to drive that late at night so we're tryna figure out where to stay for the night that won't result in us getting kidnapped, murdered, or w/e. All hotels require a 21+ ID and we don't know anyone else in the city. He suggested sleeping in his car but that's kinda the last resort. It seems like a problem that doesn't really have a solution but I thought I would double check here just in case anyone had any idea of what we could do lmao",16Jun2019,1
238,"I've posted this before a concern like this before a couples weeks ago.

Summary : I wanted a cat 1-2 years ago, so it's been a while since I've asked for it I thought about the responsibilities and I honestly don’t want anyone to take care of my mess or for me to take care of a mess I don’t want. But my mom and grandmother were already set on getting it but mostly my mom which is now mad because i’m the one who asked for the cat-- I'm a minor so it'll take me awhile to move out 3-5 years.  

Me and my mom currently sleep in the same room (for now) we're currently renting before we officially move I love my mom bundles but the cat is making me want to go places that aren't here. One half of the room is my moms ""office"" where she works whilst the other half is for bedding (we sleep on the floor) the cat in her office area we put up boxes and stuff to block the cat from coming to the other half but she keeps climbing. She hasn't had an injection yet which worries me lots because she's already scratched and almost bitten me many times. The cat's cute and all but I feel like me and my mom will actually not survive a month more with this damn THING. At some points I can't even sleep or relax without being paranoid to the point that it's hard to breath -- I have skin asthma and a sensitive nose so a cat is making it worse. I know I sound ungrateful and all and that's because I am I’m not great full for the damn cat I always end up sitting on my grandmother bed or with my dog on the floor when it truly bugs me but I'll be yet again called my mom to put her back where she originally was. (She - my mom has the only air conditioned room but I'd honestly rather sweat than stay there) my grandmothers room is full so if I were to sleep their it wouldn't have any space. 


Extra: I've even stopped using multiple of my pillows Incase she'd rip them (they're filled with beads and cotton) which has messed up my relaxation. I feel stressed every time I have to deal with him I even had a breakdown with my mood - anger to sad bawling.

239,"I have anxiety that I take medication for, and I think that is what causes the issues I am about to explain. 

My first big one is feeling guilty after I eat anything unhealthy. If I eat something with a lot of complex carbohydrates, sugar, or saturated fat, it ruins my entire day and it is all I think about. I just had a bag of cheez its before bed and I hate myself now. I go to the gym 5 days a week and am obsessed with losing my cellulite and getting muscles. I am 5’5 and 128 pounds. 

I also feel guilty after I spend money. I am a teacher and I spent about $200 this weekend for some things for my classroom and I had a panic attack yesterday because of it. I feel like I should be saving my money. It just makes me feel out of control. 

How can I stop feeling this way? I know I need to enjoy my life but these things make me have severe anxiety all the time. Any help would be great.",16Jun2019,1
240,"I started working for my dad's restaurant on the weekends, he needs extra help and I need money, plus it's the summer so I don't have to worry about school. Well there's this one waiter there who whenever he sees me, and just me, acts like a total jerk to me. He's snarky, rude, doesn't listen to criticism (I told him that he should split the cheques before the customers come to the front to pay in order to save time and not cause a line, but only do it if we're not too busy. He replied with I should learn how to split cheques). I would be fine if he treated everyone like this but it's ONLY ME. The other hostess he's polite and funny to them and seems to love being around them, obviously he's nice to the customers, and he enjoys the other managers. (One being my dad and the other being a relative of mine.) 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a teenager so I don't expect him to respect me, he's known me since I was in diapers, but I at least expect he doesn't come off rude to me. I know it may seem like I'm being entitled since I'm literally his boss's daughter but I just don't understand why he's suddenly gotten such an issue with me. I seat him when it's his turn (he usually gets the bigger parties), acknowledge that I do mistakes and apologize for them, listen to him when he requests not to be seated, put in his tips in an orderly time. I'm not the best hostess but at least I'm trying, I feel he's upset because I won't seat him until it's officially his shift (He's seating area is not open until 9 when the rest of the morning staffers come in. I'm not gonna mess up the order just to seat him when others have been here since 6 am, it doesn't matter if the area is ready to go, I'm not going to fuck up another waiter just so this guy can have a table before it's his time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been thinking I should do something about how he's been acting towards me but I don't know if I should. Like I am the younger person here but I don't believe it's fair how he's acting when I'm the only person out of the hostess/managers he's acting this way towards. I don't want to get my dad involved and be that person but I will if that seems appropriate or is it a conflict of interest? Should I confront him, just try to ignore how he treats me and wait until it stops, or get my dad involved?",16Jun2019,2
241,"So, my grandma taught (she *just* retired) in a town about 45 minutes away from me, so she would stay there during the week and stay at her house here during weekends. Well, about 6 or 7 months ago, a few pipes in her house burst and flooded it, making her unable to live there since there’s no water. She had 5 dogs, all related to one another. Since she’s rarely home, I keep them fed and watered for her instead of paying for rent (she owns my house but I live alone). Three of them were siblings from the same litter, and would now be about 10 years old. Unfortunately, small dogs (they’re chihuahua/yorkie/Pomeranian mixes) don’t live for much longer than that. Their mom, who was my dog, had to be put down in 2015 due to kidney and liver failure and it was one of the hardest experiences I’ve had to go through.

One of her oldest dogs died about 8 months ago due to kidney failure, just like his mom. That being said, she had caught it early enough in the beginning and the vet was treating it, but it was only meant to keep him comfortable and maybe prolong his life just a bit. We knew it wouldn’t save him.

We live in a pretty rural area and no matter what we do, the dogs always find a way to get out of her fenced back yard. It’s never been a huge deal because they generally stay inside the fence anyway, but when the first dog died he just disappeared. Dogs try to isolate themselves when they’re dying, so we imagine that he left so he could die alone.

A few months after he died, his sister disappeared as well. I’m not sure if her kidneys failed too, or if she died of grief.

It’s been a pretty rough time for my grandma because of all this. A week ago I saw the last from the first litter, and he seemed to be doing perfectly fine. However, when I went to feed them two days ago, he was extremely lethargic, seemed to have little to no control of his hips, and his eyes had been so watery they were glued almost completely shut. I tried to get him to eat, but he would only take one bite and then go outside and hide under the house. I haven’t seen him at all since then.

I’m fairly certain he died, or left so he could, but I don’t know how to tell my grandma. I don’t have any experience with this sort of thing, and I don’t want her to experience that heart break for the third time within a year.

How do I go about telling her?",16Jun2019,1

243,"So last week I told my boss that I'm out of school so he can start scheduling me for more hours than before. Now I have worked a total of 38 hours in fast food with a fair going on next to us. I fell physically drained because most of the time I'm working till 10PM or 5-8.5 hours a day with my only day free this week was monday. 

I want to tell my boss that I need more days off or less hours but my managers keep telling me I'm doing a really good job with how many hours I have along with being extra busy because of the fair. I don't want my boss and managers to think I can't handle working 38 hours a week without it ruining my impression of them.

246,"The question in the title is quite broad so allow me to explain: 

I guess I don’t really know how to start this but in the recent months I’ve constantly felt a wave of self-negativity that I can’t run away from. I’ve noticed I can’t keep up with simple goals or habits I set in order to improve my lifestyle and day-by-day I seem to have a lack of motivation to do anything. 

Maybe I see the progress of others and how far they have gone regarding fitness or jobs or different acquired skills. There’s just so much I want to do in life and I can’t seem to find the right motivation to do them, or even get close to. I slack and spend more time on my phone and allow hours to go by where I choose to lay in bed knowing I have much to get done. 

Alongside that, I’m constantly closing myself off from people. I don’t enjoy things as much, I don’t laugh as much, in fact I seem to speak to my family much less.

Any advice would be appreciated as I am very lost and I really don’t know where to go.",16Jun2019,1
247,"I (20F) met my bf(28M of an year on a dating site-I go to college and he works full time.Recently, his female friend(32F)(also coworker since past 2 years) had a bad date(her date left promptly after he pressured her to have sex and she refused) and asked my bf at midnight if he could go to the beach with her. Now, mind you,I would've been totally okay with him supporting his friend under normal circumstances- however, she clearly told him she was drunk when she called him up at midnight.They spent time at the beach and then went back to her place and had noodles. Bf then texted me back very early in the morning telling me about the night.I felt upset, and he reassured me that she's just like a big sister to him.He kept hanging out with her one on one after that night(mostly going on lunches).She asked him to go the beach again a few weeks later during the day.He asked me if he could go, and silly me, trying to not come off as a controlling gf so early in the relationship said yes.The next morning I wouldn't reply to his texts and he profusely apologized, saying he'll stand outside my house waiting for me the entire day if I don't come see him.We quickly made up.

I told him I'm feeling insecure and would like to meet her a few days ago and bf agreed.He said she's only available on the weekends knowing fully well that I can't make it on the weekends.He asked me to send her an fb request and I did.I asked her if she could let me know what happened at the beach to ease some concerns.

She flat out ignored the message for a week and I told my bf I couldn't move on until she replies.He met up with her at work and asked her to reply because things aren't fine between us and said she won't ever have to talk to me again after that.She told him she doesn't want to get involved and that she's scared of my original nationality and 'doesn't want to interact with a Pakistani'

Bf then asked me not to throw away what we have for a stupid b\*\*\*\*.

249,"So here's a little back ground on my situation.

I live in eastern Canada, but I work in Northern Alberta, and I fly in and out every two weeks. I make good money, and I enjoy my job, however, being away from home for 2 weeks at a time, and only being with my girlfriend half the year can definitely be tough. Plus my position is only guaranteed for 3.5 more years. (5 year contract)

&amp;#x200B;

Last time I was home, I was offered a job, and the money is great for the area, about 5-10 dollars more per hour than the average position in my field, but it's still a lot less than I currently make. This wouldn't be a problem, if not for the fact that I've made a few poor financial choices over the past few years. We are working ourselves out of it, and getting back on track.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I can't afford all of my expenses if I was to take this job, even though the pay is great for the area, so my choices are, 

1: Turn down the job, keep saving and paying off debt and hopefully our contract gets renewed or something comes along at home that's decent. 

&amp;#x200B;

2: Take the job at home, but file for a consumer proposal, and ruin my credit for 8 years. If I do this, I would be able to save money and keep my house as well as my truck.

254,"This is my first reddit post, so apologies if I am not doing this right.

My boyfriend and I are embarking on our first vacation together, and we’re pumped. We booked an Airbnb that was well-reviewed, and at a good price. It’s not the nicest place or area, but it seems good enough for what we paid. Everything is confirmed as of this morning, but we have 48-hours to get a 100% refund (including the service fee).

However, tonight I was searching (just for fun), and found a new Airbnb listing that advertises as “newly renovated,” and it has pics of the space in the final stages of its renovation (new bed without sheets, curtain rods on the floor, cling film still on the mirrors, etc.). The description of the property is short, there are no reviews (as it’s a new listing), but the host does have a picture and a contact number. It looks pretty legit, and it definitely looks nicer than the place we currently have booked, but we’re both a little skeptical, only because we haven’t dealt with Airbnb before, and this is a new place that has no reviews. We are thinking of contacting the host to ask questions about the place/her, but we aren’t quite sure what.

So, finally, my question is, what should we do? Take a chance on the new listing with no reviews, or keep our less-nice but well-reviewed current reservation? I’m also open to any question ideas you may have that we can ask to get a better feel for the new property/host. Thank you in advance!!",16Jun2019,1

256,"Borrowing my fiancee's account because I'm not really a big redditor, but also don't want this to be tracked back to me. Also my first ever Reddit post, so please forgive any errors.

**Backstory**: I started working for a Generic Sub Shop franchise over year ago; my manager then was amazing and was a big reason of why I went with this job in the first place. Within about 4 months, I was trained to be a shift leader, along with another co-worker that started around the same time. At that time we were a powerhouse, and each of us could run the store alone, no issue, without any other 'management' aide. Within a few months of my promotion; things crashed and burned. My Wonderful Manager quit, come to find out, because of upper management not communicating or keeping promises, and honestly being all-around awful.

During this time, our district manager took over the store. A man that has been with the company for 12 years, quit after 3 months or so because of the franchise owner being shit, as well. 

**Now**: Queue the new manager arriving.

She transferred from a SMALL store compared to ours, ours makes roughly 3x as much on a normal day in sales. She was the star employee here because as her time as a shift lead; she got the most donations and sales. We were looking forward to having her in the shop because of how the former district manager talked about her.

By this time a lot of our crew has quit, the few remaining are myself, my shift lead-bro (We'll call him Tom), his shift-lead girlfriend, and a couple minor but good crew members. Me and Tom helped to train Manager in how our store ran and the sheer amount of catering orders we have. All was well for a while, but lately she's been pretty off the deep end. 

I will be the first to say that I'm not the **perfect** employee. I have poor health, and my flare-ups can sometimes affect my productivity. Despite this, I've missed only one day since Manager started working here. Naturally, I received a write-up. 

Lately, despite her getting on to others for doing the same thing, she's been bringing her attitude into the store. It changes the entire mood, affects the crew, and reduces productivity. I just want to do my job, make subs, and get paid. I try to be understanding: She's only 20, suddenly getting promoted from a small store to our giant store, plus she has a lot going on in her personal life. It's a lot, that much I totally get.  
I think it might be listing the things that I'm really concerned over where to go and what to do about particular things-- I really need advice, and especially not something that could get me fired, as this is a right to work state.

* She has a bad habit of sending people on 'standby'. Looking up the laws of my state; this time should be paid. Especially in situations like mine, where I spent an entire shift on unpaid standby, and then half of the next day. I couldn't leave, as I knew there would be consequences, but I can't afford to just sit around in the store and not work when I've got classes and a home to care for. I want to be paid for this, especially as I am at a very low pay($9.25/hr), especially for what is classified as a management position by the company. I can guarantee I have at least 12 hours within the last month that I've been at work, but haven't been paid.
* She has a VERY bad habit of playing favourites with employees. Manager likes to choose her buddies outside of work to promote to shift leads or give raises, despite they are even newer than I was when I was training to be promoted (One she is insisting on promoting can't even put chips on a rack correctly despite being shown how to numerous times.) 
* She is insisting on every single crew member watching MANDATORY training videos, hours worth of them, by the 24th of June. She doesn't want anyone on the clock while they're doing this because it would run up labor. I cannot do this in free time I don't have, and I expect if something is mandatory for my job, then I would be paid to do it. She also does this with catering order deliveries, and does not want the driver to be clocked in for the same reasons.
* She will NOT talk out any issues... Several employees have had issues with each other; she lets it drag on and just antagonizes it and threatens write-ups. Any leading experience I've had, says they should be sat down and talk the problem out with the manager there to mediate.
* Poor communication with her crew: This has caused MANY issues in the past and present; as well as the fact that she refuses to admit fault in any situation. She blamed Tom for failing to place an order despite it has NEVER been our responsibility to place any orders.
* Most recently: she has been giving very unnecessary write-ups for things that can very clearly be attributed to her lack of communication with her shift leaders and involved crew members. Many of my crew members have come to me, worried about possibly being on the chopping block for what any sane individual would consider nothing. I feel that way, too, and now so does every other old shift lead. For example; today she threatened Tom's job **just** for texting her asking for clarification of a scheduling error on her day off. No warning, no prior notice not to contact her.

Honestly, this is only my second job ever... I'm fairly young, I don't have the experience or knowledge of how to handle this. Yes, I fully plan on leaving, but I want to do it right; secure a job and give a proper 2 weeks notice to Manager, and give her time to adjust accordingly. Unfortunately, securing a job is the most difficult part, as I am both in school, and have a lot to deal with at home as well, as I'm trying to raise a child in the midst of all this, chaos. 

I want to be able to handle this professionally, I want payment for the time I put into this store, because up until New Manager came along, this place felt like a home-away-from home.... Now it doesn't, and I'm really not ready to go above and beyond for a place that makes me dread going in each day. I have the number of the franchise owner, whom is in regular contact with all managers, and honestly, I have no clue what HR is like or how to get into contact with them... Or if they'll even back me up. 

So I was hoping I could get advice from the good people of reddit and maybe sort this all out in my mind and figure out how to go about this...

Thanks and I do apologize for the stream of consciousness writing-- I'm just beyond frustrated and at my wit's end...",16Jun2019,1

Who’s  father passed away 5 years ago. He had a  family cattle farm (not for profit more of a hobby) that his father passed down to him. This farm means so much to my family as my aunts and uncles have so many memories as do my self and siblings. My brother (22) and myself have been keeping it barely going, but it’s still running. The fences are falling apart which leads the cattle to escape, &amp; I have to drive up 2 hours to try to get them in. My uncle usually gets them in before I get up there which he rips into me and my brother about how we are bums and can’t fix anything. I can’t do this anymore. All I can think of when I’m up there is my father and it’s getting me so depressed, but I love the place at the same time. The obvious thing to do is sell the cows but for some reason I can’t come to grips with selling them. If I sell them I won’t have a reason to go up there anymore and the place wont last as it should. I feel like I’m letting down everything my grandfather, aunts and uncles, and my father worked for. I was named after my grandfather and I feel like I shouldn’t have been, This farm has been a nightmare yet a blessing, but it is getting to much to handle.

As the title suggests my cat just had what I believe to be a seizure. I already called my local animal hospital and they have no clue without her being in front of them but they said possible neurological or cardiac event. She has had no heath concerns before this. To give a rundown on what happened, she was asleep in her usual spot and then suddenly got up and started running into things. At this point I knew something was awry as this has not happened. She then collapsed in our kitchen and started spasming. She had nothing in her airway, but my fiance did decide to feed her some pasta as that is what's normal when we make it. Not a lot just a noodle earlier in the night. So back to the event. During her spasm she let me hold her head and stomach so she would not hurt herself. She started spitting up saliva uncontrollably as well. After the episode around half an hour later she will not allow our other cat to approach her and her tail was puffed for a possible 10 minutes. She is still out of it as far as I can tell but seems to know who I am and where she is. She knows the litter box and her sleeping spot as well. I'm genuinely terrified and thought I was going to lose my first baby I had and now just want some answers. Our plan is to take her to an animal hospital asap but I wanted to check and see if anyone has had anything similar or had any ideas. I'm so happy to still have her here and just want to help her the best I can.

I was advised to keep an eye on her. Breathing, walking, and all around awareness. She is not panting, shes walking slowly, but very sure and steady and she seems to know most of whats happening around her.

So she starts telling me about her boyfriend, and where he worked and all that, and I said “my mother in laws boyfriend works there!” And she immediately asked his name. Well obviously my friend and my mother in law had to have the same man friend, and I saw it it her face the moment I opened my giant mouth. The drama unfolded for months after that. J was telling the guy everything about me and my husband, and he was telling our business to my MIL. My husband told his mom that her boyfriend was cheating and at first she was depressed and emotional but in the end, she blamed me. I was the reason he was a cheater and a liar. My MIL’s hate grew as her and my friend J became enemies over this guy, but of course my friend J, continued to date this guy, as did my MIL and over the next couple of years I watched J go insane. She was drinking herself to death and coming to work acting like an idiot. saying things like “I know he has been in my house when I’m not home.” and “He’s taking my stuff, and messing with me.”. Her dogs would be outside and She would claim her outdoor security lightbulbs were missing and all kinds of noise I ignored. I left that job eventually and quit associating with her. 

Fast forward 3 years: 
Today, my MIL came over we were talking and my FIL got brought up. She was telling us stories about him, and then casually mentioned a piece of jewelry he had gotten her that  had that had gone missing. I didn’t think anything about it, until she continued. She’s missing 3 necklaces. She’s also missing a ring and a few other random household items that she claims shouldn’t have been moved. She said she doesn’t mess with them and they have a spot and she doesn’t mess with them. She’s lived in the same house for a long time so no moving things around. She even asked my husband if we had been over there or brought anyone over there that could have stolen them. She brushed it off as if she was getting Alzheimer’s but then I remembered my friend ‘J’ who had claimed he made copies of her keys and she had found a couple and took them back. At the time, I thought she was just talking and acting crazy because she smelled like alcohol and was clearly ill. Now I’m wondering if he could have made copies of my MIL keys when he was staying over there. My husband said he did have a key for a while. The craziest thing happened tonight. My MIL and MY FRIEND J messaged me on Facebook around the same time. I haven’t spoken to J in a while, and when I saw her name pop up, it freaked me out but it was a dumb ass minion video. 

I know I need to tell her, or let my husband tell her about my friend J’s claims..but what if I’m overthinking things? Or what if it brings up all that crazy drama and she doesn’t believe us and gets mad at me again? I don’t want to start drama, I want to avoid that all together, but this guy is actually one of her employees and he is around her a lot. I don’t want her to be scared of uncomfortable, but he knows her schedule, he knows where she’s going and when she’s going, and if J was serious about everything and level headed during her drunken mishaps, then he has been in her home with her there while she was sleeping. He clearly has issues. I don’t know if he’s capable of physically hurting her, but I think this is gaslighting. She lives there alone and if he has a key, then nobody in the neighborhood would probably think anything of him stopping by. Also, Its possible he hasn’t done this in a long time because she didn’t specify when the items came up missing. I guess I know I have to say something, but how do I even tell her without me seeming crazy?",16Jun2019,1
263,"So I am guy,an introvert.I was the only guy in my department when I joined
I somehow mustered  enough courage to talk to everyone and became good friends
Then there was this girl,we talked endlessly,she knows most of my secrets and all and I know most of hers
We used to chat late though night about really stupid things.This went on for 1 year
2 weeks back she came to me telling about a guy she likes and that he talked back to her,had a small chat and all
I don't know what happened to me,I became paralysed
I don't know when it happened,but I think I fell in love with her,I didn't talk to her the entire day and while leaving home she stopped me and asked why I was acting weird 
I just told her that I thought of her in a wrong way and left but later I texted her that I had feelings for her.A couple of boys had already proposed her and she turned them down,blocked them
But in my case she still talked to me,so I thought I will be friends with her like before.But at least once in 10 mins,she says things about her crush and how they always meet and talk and even though I smile,I still get deeply hurt
So what should I do?
Should I cut her out of my life? But if I do that what if she thinks I faked all the friendship thing to get her?

They have a complete monopoly over my area, and I'm sure they do in other places too. We have no options other than to be disconnected; which frankly just isn't feasible anymore in 2019.

265,"I have my driving licence since 2017. I have made a point of always driving safely and, since I suffer from severe motion sickness, to drive in a way that if I were a passenger I wouldn't get sick. I also frequently drive with my 4 year old daughter in the car and she has motion sickness as well. I just want her to be comfortable and safe. 

Most roads here are single laned. Speed limit is 50km/h in cities and 90km/h on other roads. I drive speed limit, maybe 5-9 over but no more. I realize how this might be inconvenient for some as other drivers cannnot change lanes to pass me, but I keep right as much as I can to offer them as much visibility ahead as possible so they can pass safely is they must. I also do my best to keep up with the traffic flow and match the general speed even if in some cases that means going over speed limit. 

The fines for breaking traffic laws here are heavy. One slip and you get your license suspended for 30 days or more. Getting to where I'm going 5-10 minutes earlier is just not worth the 200$ fine. 

Some family members and friends continuously bash me for my driving, even when I'm driving and it's making me crazy.

I'm going too slow, I should be going 20 over speed limit (NO)
If other drivers are speeding, I should be speeding to!
If the road is straight, speed limits don't exist, apparently.
Passing someone over a continuous white line or worse, over a pedestrian walk will land you a really stingy fine or worse, but I should go for it!

I get continuous criticism for driving safely and legally. I tell them ""I don't care, you should drive like that at your own risk but I won't do it"" but they won't listen. 

In a world where I get constant criticism about my work, about being a mom, a wife, a daughter and failing at all this, seems like, when I'm driving is probably the only time where I feel like I'm in total control of my life, when I'm not falling apart. The only time I know for sure I'm doing things right. 

This is getting ruined for me. We are supposed to leave for vacation in a week, my SO, my dad and myself will be driving but they both feel that we'll ""neeeeeever get there"" if I don't change the way I drive. 

How do I fight this? How do I respond to make them shut up?",16Jun2019,1
266,"This is my first Reddit post so bare with me! 

Three weeks ago I decided to hang out with my friend who is in town because he’d entered a fishing competition. I’ve lived here for nearly 3 years and actually don’t have any friends here. It was great to see him and meet his friends who live here also. He is very lovely but we are just friends. We ended up going back to his friends house. His friend (let’s say Cory) is very attractive and was very friendly/nice to me seeing as though I was quite nervous/shy. So obviously I formed an instant crush on him LOL. Before leaving I asked Cory for his number because I genuinely want to make friends in this town and I was secretly crushing on him. I was a little bit tipsy so when I wrote his number down - it turned out to be 11 digits instead of 10. I’m not sure if it was because he gave me invalid number trying to palm me off or I was just tipsy. Anyway I text Cory that night kind of in a joking way saying ‘can we please go fishing’ and he never replied to which I found out his number was invalid. 

His other flatmate, although lovely, is also kind of creepy. He popped up on Instagram so I added him. I messaged him asking if they would all like to go out fishing but he told me that he’s not interested unless I was willing to put out/blow him. Kind of inappropriate. I politely declined LOL but was kind of devastated because I just want to see Cory, his flat mate again. I found it really weird and inappropriate and stopped talking to him after that. 

Fast forward three weeks. I potted some honey from my beehive and left a note on their porch with the honey saying ‘dear Cory, hope you enjoy my honey. let’s go fishing sometime!! perhaps i’ll give you my number instead haha’ and wrote my number on the paper. It’s been 3 days and nobody has text me which really sucks and I’m kind of hurt because I really put myself out there for once.  

Should I add him on Facebook and message him asking if he received the honey? I’m kind of stuck at the moment and just looking for some advice! 

ALSO: why is it so hard to find friends of the opposite sex?! I’ve found through past experiences that being kind of a tomboy I share a lot of hobbies with mostly men. I will spend time with them and enjoy our shared hobby only to be ghosted or abused because I led them on? And if I decline any advances I’m a bitch and they won’t hang out with me anymore even though moments ago we were friends?

267,"Hi so I’ve always been good at school. I just finished up my BSC. I liked being in university for the most part. I did good and I got into physical therapy school. I start in August and I’ve been having a panic attack each night. I can’t stop dreading going back to school. I worry that I’m going to be super stressed out and that it’ll take a toll on my mental health and my relationship with my boyfriend. I don’t want anything to change. I worry that I won’t about be able to handle the material and that I’ll fail out. This is plausible because I did do well during undergrad but I barely studied. I went to class and took notes. That’s all I had to do. The material was just easy and common sense to me.

268,"So, my girlfriend and I have been together for 11 months now, the last we broke up ( 1 month ago, I made out with another girl when we broke up, and she came back to me, worst mistake I ever made to accept her again). It's better for me this way, she lied to my face, she treated me careless and she wore really short dresses. I can't say I was mad because she wore a short dress, but I was down because she was really disrespectful to me afterwards. Last night I posted 2 instagram stories, not with my face, just 2 instagram stories about a movie. She got mad because of that, and I broke up with her. I still love her, I can't lie, but that was just the best thing that I could've done. Now I need your guys' help, what I am thinking now is to have a period of no contact, it's summer, so we won't see each other at all. If she changes, maybe I'll get together with her, but if she doesn't, I am done with her. What I am asking, am I doing the right choice? And how can I get through a breakup easily?

270,"It feels like everyone has replaced me.  

All of my friends have made new friends.  My best–friends since childhood have made new best–friends too.  And I can also tell that my boyfriend of three years is falling out of love with me.  

Soon enough he will also replace me with someone else, just like the rest of my friends did.  It sucks because I care about these people a lot, try to talk to them and make plans with them, but I can tell they just aren’t interested.  I just feel like a huge burden.  My boyfriend told me he is having doubts too so I know he is going to pull the plug soon, especially since we got in a fight tonight.  I wish that I could tell him what is really going on but I always misplace my emotions and get upset over the wrong things.  He is seriously my only friend left and when we break up I am going to be completely alone.  

I just always care about people so much, love them, and no one ever feels that way about me.  No one will ever feel as strongly about me as I do about them.  I will always care more.  I wish I could know what it feels like to have someone to lean on and trust.  I know I’m not that great or special or anything so I don’t blame my friends and boyfriend for moving on and replacing me.  But I do wish I had at least one person in my corner right now.

What should be my plan from now on so that I become the Prime Minister of India? Or literally what should I do in life now? My passion is to only dedicate my life in serving my country in all fields. Not just security, so joining the Army is not such a great option. But on becoming Prime Minister, I will be able to reform India in every field.

Also, this tript cost me 3 classes at VMC which means 3 chapters have received damage beyond repair. These bastards(family members) have ruined my career. I have now become doubtful of myself of whether I will be able to reach my goal. The goal which is my destiny. The goal for which the likes of Chanakya, Bhagat Singh and Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel worked so hard for. The goal of 'AKHAND BHARAT'. But I don't think I will be able to achieve it, surviving each day is becoming even more difficult. From my childhood, one thing that I regretted the most was that I was not born in an era of great men like Einstein, Martin Luther King or Chanakya and thus I will never be able to meet them but now that I realised I have been born in an era of great men like Narendra Modi, Elon Must etc but now suicide seems the best possible option even though I have a chance to meet them. Oh God! What have you done? Is this the so-called 'blissful life' for which men have killed their own relatives, for which man has waged war against each other, for which the man visits churches, mosques and temples daily? Why don't you come and tell them that you don't exist! Why do you allow a man to live? Only prolonging his suffering. At last, I wanna know only one thing, is it really my destiny to make India the greatest country in the world or am I just another fool who believes he can change the world?

Couple days later we hung out by grabbing some lunch. We sat there and talked for maybe a good hour and a half, and a couple more minutes outside by our cars. 

While this would seem to be a good chain of events, our interactions weren’t the smoothest. There were awkward pauses as the the topic would reach a dead end and we would have those awkward greeting &amp; good byes were we kinda just up left each other really fast. 

After the meal I sent her a message thanking her for grabbing a bite and how I had a good time. she replied by basically saying how she also had a good time but then went into in explanation about how she has a hard time spending time with people she doesn’t know as well and how the more she knows someone the more she can spend time with them. (I don’t really know how to interpret that exactly but I really admire her transparency here). Later I asked if she was available the next week but she was busy with work and plans.

I’m pretty dumb when it comes to girls and I have a hard time interpreting things like this. I don’t know if she is even remotely interested in me or if she was just trying to be nice to me. All I know is that I genuinely am interested in her.

I'm in a very odd situation. Out of nowhere, a former coworker (who I am not and have never been close with) sent me a voicemail letting me know they have cancer.

I am not sure why they wanted to let me know especially when we have almost never conversed and I know we never had a conversation about personal matters in the past.

I sent them a kind, apologetic text and they responded back that they want to talk over the phone. I literally don't know what to do. I don't want to.

If this was a close friend or even a friend who I've had deep conversations with, 100% I would be there to support. I barely have a connection to this person though and it feels incredibly emotionally heavy to put on someone under that circumstance.

Now I normally have no problem talking to the girls in like normal people situations but something about parties and girls being in groups with their friends makes it really intimidating for me to approach them... unless I am not totally sober but seeing as I’m the only one with the car for now I’m going to be the sober one for the forseeable future. I’m always seeing guys making out with random girls and I’m like man what’s stopping me from doing that. I feel like there’s something I’m missing. Any advice?,16Jun2019,1

290,"Hello guys, I'm 16 and from Germany. In school, I got like 3 real friends. One of them lives 300 metres away from me and we were buddies since day one. No problem with him but with my other ""friend"". 

Every time we get a test or anything back he asks me if I did well. OK, but after I told him my score he tells all the other students I did worse than I actually did. Then everyone thinks I am a liar and he is feeling great because his score would be higher which is completely fake. 

For example, one week ago we got our French speaking test back and I got 21 out of 25 points. I was really happy and he got 19 points. I didn't tell anyone.. but he said to every girl in class (we are 6 boys and 18 girls) that I would have gotten a score of 19 and he had a score of 20. Like what the fuck. And I couldn't prove it because our teacher only told us the score.. 

He does this every fucking single time and not just tests he also does this when I tell him something private. (Btw I'm not doing this anymore). I told him that I had a crush on a girl in class and he fucking told her best friend about it. He completely ruined my social life and my reputation at school.. so here's the question: What should I do? I cannot ignore him because he will be doing it anyways. Good day

292,"My 17th birthday is at the end of october, but I am already stressing for it. Last year I decided (under pressure from my parents, i wanted to just do it like i want to this year) to celebrate it small. Just my best friend, my moms parents and her sister for a dinner at our house. I hated it because it was very busy still and I got SO MUCH critique from all the friends and family I did not invite. I did not invite my neighbours, but they were still there in the morning. So my dad had to rush to the supermarket to get cake because we did not expect it.

This year I kind of only want to invite my best friend to a dinner with me and my parents. I know I will enjoy it, I know she will enjoy it (she really sees my parents as her family and I see her family like that too) and I know my parents will enjoy it (they see my friend as a part of the family as well). However I also know the critique of not celebrating any other way will get me a lot of critique. I do plan on going to my grandparents the morning of my birthday so I can control the situation and leave when I want to leave (i love seeing my grandparents regardless but feel its useless to go just because i happened to be born on that day), but i know my friends and other family is going to be very mad again.

I would much rather spoil my parents that day because they went through 9 months of pregnancy and raised me for another 17, but it seems to be such a taboo to not celebrate in traditional ways.

What is the best way to handle the madness of my friends and family?",16Jun2019,1
293,"Hey guys. A brief intro: I graduated from college around 3 years ago. College was an amazing time for me and thinking back, it is mostly probably due to the fact that I made close genuine friendships with others. I graduated with a degree in CS and am now working at a major tech company in SF. Shortly during and after college I was in a relationship with this girl who basically cheated on me and I was heartbroken. I was very jaded for a while and basically committed all my time to getting fit (lost like 40 pounds, got ""fit"", etc).

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to now. I've been working in software engineering at a large tech company in SF for a while now. I cannot tell if it's me just being unfairly jaded, if it's an inevitable part of living in SF, if it's a normal part of growing up, or if I am simply just depressed, but I feel completely bored and jaded about everything. Over this time I slowly grew tired of my friend group (I feel like I started to realize I don't share a lot of their values - a lot of their socializing involves getting very drunk which I no longer enjoy). So over the past year every time my friends would invite me out I would turn down more and more so now they don't invite me to things. On top of that, my closest acquaintances from work have left, and the work itself has become extremely boring. I have contemplated leaving to another company at one point but I'm so bored with it that I don't even know if software engineering is for me anymore. Also recruiting/interview prep is hard when I'm working out every day so I've even considered just quitting for now and living with my parents until I get a new job (but I feel this is a sad way out). It is just so hard to find the time to master CS interview prep when I can only study like an hour a day.

&amp;#x200B;

But I still don't know if this is the solution, like I don't know if it's the job or just me. I feel like I would like to meet more people, but the times I have tried I always end up regretting it because it ends up going nowhere and I ended up wasting my time. Now I just seem to have this pessimistic mindset what I just know I won't click with anyone new so there's no point in making the effort. It doesn't help that SF (to me at least) seems to have this monogamous culture - everyone kinda seems to have the same personality. I don't know. Maybe that's a little judgemental, but it's hard not to think that way when I've met so many of the same people constantly talking about the same techie things, it's hard for me to find the energy to bother.

&amp;#x200B;

All that being said, it sometimes feels like the only thing exciting I have going on in my life is fitness. Recently I got very ill and I couldn't work out that much, and it really made me realize how damned empty my life is. I've realized, over the past 1.5-2 years, the only things I really look forward to, is traveling or going to the gym (best part of my day). Everything else is just kinda gray. Is this normal? I have considered looking into remote work which seems like awesome opportunity. I kind of want to do something extremely daring, maybe move to Thailand with a friend and try to make money as we go ( I have a friend who is actually down to do this with me, very tempting). But at the same time I want the stability of having a place to work out every day and eat clean etc. I guess I can say I kind of miss the environment of college, where you can meet a wide variety of people without hardly trying, but you're still embedded in this routine that is geared towards your goals and development. Is it normal to feel this way? Will changing my environment really help me, or is the problem my mindset? Should I try to remote work, test a different field, or just move to a different city? Is it ok to quit without having another job lined up so I can focus more on interviewing? Anyone have any personal experiences they'd like to share? Open to all advice. Thanks!",16Jun2019,1
294,"I don't really know where to post this but here. I am 17, and my breasts doesn't seem to grow at all. And I don't mean small, I mean almost nothing. 
The reason for this is because a few years back, when I was living with my grandmother, she would refuse to give me enough food. She raised me as though we live in the 90s (everyone back then ate anything they can find, so yeah) and she forced me to eat her raw food, and only bought food enough for three main meals. Most of the times when I was too hungry, I had to eat salt (yes salt) . So I was soooo skinny, live with different diseases, and I poop once a week. Most important, I never had enough nutritiens. 
I don't know what to do anymore, since I'm turning 18 soon and I don't want to hide my flat chest until the rest of my life. I don't think my future boyfriend will like it either.

300,"Alright, I’m sorry if this turns out to be a really long and boring post, but I need to know if I’m doing something wrong here. The following will be descriptions of events which have impacted my friendships over the past few weeks. If anyone in this sub-Reddit can piece together why my friends are excluding me through these descriptions then that’d be great. Advice on what to do next is also appreciated.

Here’s some background information: my friend group consists of six males (incl. myself). All of us are 18 years old. This post only concerns two of my friends from that group; let’s call them John and Steve. John is my best friend of 7 years. We see each other nearly every day. We go snowboarding together every winter for multiple weeks, and we’ve travelled multiple times overseas together. I honestly think of him like a brother. Steve, on the other hand, I’ve known since I was 7 years old. We went to primary school together and were friends but not really that close. We then went to different schools between the ages of 10-13. He then moved to my high school when we were 14 and we have become close friends since then. Back to John, he went out with a girl when he was 17 for ~8 months who was 14/15. Let’s call her Annie. He constantly lied about her age to me and others to save himself the embarrassment of us knowing how young she was. John and Annie broke up about 2-3 months ago because John said she was emotionally abusive, immature and just a bad person. 

Part 1

My friend group has a Messenger group chat in which we talk, send memes, organise going out for drinks etc. In the past few weeks John has been kicking people out of this chat then re-adding them for stupid reasons, for example: making a bad joke, saying something stupid, making fun of him. All of our jokes are in good spirit and are just intended to make everyone laugh, so John constantly kicking people was getting annoying. I happened to be the person who was getting kicked from the chat the most. John was intentionally targeting me, I know this because other people in the chat had only been kicked once or twice while I had been kicked several times. It evolved into John kicking me for not even saying anything ‘kick worthy’. He was intentionally kicking me to annoy me. To make the situation worse, Steve also found humour in John kicking me. The rest of the of people in the chat didn’t care enough about the situation to immediately add me back after I got kicked, so I would have to message one of them to get added back as both John and Steve refused to add me back. It got to the point where I was so annoyed by it that I decided to annoy John back. I did this by having an argument with him in the chat about how terrible the state of the chat was and that I wanted to leave it. The twist was I fought this argument with stupid and ineligible arguments so that John would get frustrated over it, which he did. In the end, John kicked me from the chat and I haven’t been added back since. That was a week and a half ago. 

It’s also worth noting that John and I had been arguing before this about going snowboarding which we were planning to do that weekend, as well as John not attending sport training which we do together. John didn’t want to go snowboarding because he had an essay to write and he believed he wasn’t disciplined enough to finish it while we were up on the mountain. My argument was that he should learn to be more disciplined and organised as we wouldn’t be able to snowboard until September if we didn’t go that weekend (we didn’t end up going). John also hadn’t been attending sport training for the previous few weeks because apparently he had too much homework. John is naturally lazy, unmotivated and unorganised, so I believe it was more down to that as to why he hadn’t been training, and I told him this. John also doesn’t do any exercise outside of this sport training, which was another one of my arguments. So tensions were already a little bit high between us.

The consequences of me not being in the chat was I now wasn’t up to date with plans my friends were making, and they were not making me aware of them. I asked to be added back to the chat a few days later to tell them something, to which they kicked me out of the chat again after I said it. Due to them adding me back to the chat, I was able to see what they had been saying since I was kicked a few days prior. I found that a few of them, namely John and Steve, had been talking shit about me. Over the course of the following week at school everything seemed a little bit off between me and my friends. They were all laughing and talking about stuff that they were putting in the chat, and the general aura I was feeling was that they were all sick of me or didn’t really like me. My hunch was that John and Steve were pitting the others against me. I didn’t end up confronting them about this issue, I just let it be.

Part 2

Recently, John decided to start dating Annie again. None of my friends said anything to John about it, but it was easy to tell that none of us thought it was a good idea for many reasons, me especially as I had seen her behaviour first-hand when she came with John and I to the snow for two weeks. On top of being emotionally abusive, Annie was also a bad influence on John, which he did not notice. Annie is a very similar person to John; they are both lazy, unmotivated and unorganised, and having her around amplified John’s laziness and disorganisation. Also, being only 14/15, her immaturity rubbed off on John, making him displeasing to hang around. Last night I had a conversation about the situation with Steve. I told him outright that I thought it was a mistake that John was dating Annie again. John also happens to be 18 now and Annie is still 15, so by law in my country they shouldn’t be dating at all since John is an adult and Annie is a minor under the age of 16. Steve immediately got pissed off at me and told me to stay out of it and it’s their business. He also said that if he’s happy we should leave him alone and that he can do what he wants. We had an argument for a while about it and Steve ending up saying I was a bad person for talking shit about his girlfriend and thinking John made a mistake, and that I also shouldn’t have an opinion on it because it negatively affects John. After Steve and I stopped talking, I then received a message from John saying, “Why are you talking shit?” I then realised that Steve had crossed me and told John what I had been telling him. He went from saying that we should not worry about it and that we should leave him alone, to sending John what I had been saying to him. I confronted Steve about this, to which Steve responded, “I can’t be fucked with you anymore.” He then tried to explain that John had apparently lied about Annie being emotionally abusive and a bad person, and also said that “if you were in a relationship you would understand.” At this point I got genuinely angry at Steve and sent him a very long message basically stating: of course John can do what he wants, my position on this has nothing to do with me not being in a relationship, I’m trying to protect my friend from being in a bad relationship, you telling John my position on this is making things worse, John is my best friend and I wouldn’t do anything to hurt him, my stance on this situation isn’t going to change unless Annie can prove me otherwise. Steve then got defensive and said his intention was just to make sure no one had a bad impression of Annie so that there wouldn’t be any conflict between our friend group and John. He also stated that he didn’t tell John everything I said, he only told John how our friend group felt about it. I responded by saying that in the future, instead of speaking for everyone, we’ll speak to John individually if we have a problem. I then messaged John and said we need to clear this up before it gets way too out of hand. I told him my position and he seemed to be fine with it. He said that Annie has matured, to which I replied that you should remember that she was emotionally abusive and I’m not going to believe she’s changed until I see it myself. I also warned him that if he noticed any relapses in her behaviour that he should pull her up on it straight away.

Part 3 (this is the last part)

So, after seemingly clearing up everything between John, Steve and I, I asked Steve if we should have a few drinks that night at his house since his parents were away. Steve said it wasn’t possible as his older brother wouldn’t let him have friends over. Fast forward to this morning, John’s mum messages me asking me to contact Steve to tell John to contact her as apparently John stayed at Steve’s place last night. Whenever we stay the night at Steve’s house it’s always to drink, so I knew that John and Steve were having drinks without me. I’m unsure whether anyone else from our friend group went. So why, after clearing everything up between us, are my friends still excluding and lying to me?

Is there anything here that makes me an asshole?

What should I do?

302,"I work at a bar and one day I walked in o the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new (about 2-3 months) who I haven’t talked to stared at me kind of smiling a little as I walked in the doorway as she was sorting glasses and she didn’t look away but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding might have been nothing) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Darren’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Darren’ and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and smiled at me after saying it and then look away to carry on putting her scarf on.

305,"There's a lot to cover here. I'll try to keep it as short as possible, though. I will say, however, don't be surprised if this is disorganized.

The guy in question is a former friend for a reason. He was terrible to his girlfriend. He belittled and verbally bullied everyone in his life. He was a thief and he had a childish sense of humor to the point you had to monitor everything you said so he wouldn't turn it into an innuendo. An all-around unpleasant and selfish person to be around. 

So, I severed all ties with him. No warning, no nothing. I didn't feel like I owed it to him. We'd been friends (although less and less from my end) for about ten years up to that point. He's tried to contact me since then. Occasionally, I'll read whatever he's sent. Part of me isn't convinced he'd ever changed, despite his insistence. Most of me just wanted to move on. Shortly after I stopped speaking to him, he had a son. That made the prospect of speaking to him again even more awkward. 

Then, today he tells me he was at the ER and he was diagnosed with cancer. Now, he's the type of person who I've known to lie about things like this in the past to garner sympathy. But shortly afterward, his mom made a vague post that seems to be alluding to his illness. On top of that, she herself had cancer about ten years ago. 

So, I'm at a loss as to what I should do. He's not a good person. At least, he wasn't. I'm not happy about this in any way, though. Don't mistake me on that. I wanted to move on with my life, and for the most part had. But how am I supposed to ignore the fact he's possibly going to die? I feel like he needs me because I was one of his best friends. But I haven't felt that way about him in a long time. It's a completely fucked situation and I don't know what to do.",16Jun2019,2

The school is Tulsa Welding School and the City is you guessed it Tulsa.

I’m fine with living alone, I know how to clean, cook.

314,"Alright, I’m new to reddit, and this is my first post. Forgive me if my wording is odd/off, I’m not used to this.

Ok, so, some backstory: I recently graduated the seventh grade and I am moving on to eight grade (class of 24). 
The problem is I am in NO WAY prepared for eight, let alone high school. I haven’t really done my homework on time in (probably) over three years. And I’m not turning it in a day, or hell, even a week late, I’m talking full MONTHS. That’s only the tip of the iceberg. I have been bsing my way through fifth-seventh grade by asking friends if I can copy their papers or just straight up copying their work. Don’t get me wrong; I’m not a bad person or an idiot, the problem that led up to this is my shoddy health. 
In fourth grade, I missed almost a month of school, which, wasn’t a big deal, I used to be pretty perseverant and was still getting mostly A/95+ grades. Fifth, over two months. I got more B-‘s and C’s. Sixth, I don’t remember how long, but around as long as fifth grade. Similar grades, almost failed Social Studies. And seventh, missed about the same amount of time; got very low grades. 
Now, this wasn’t a case of me faking sick so I didn’t have to go to school, however, when consulting with doctors, they found nothing. My mother told me that she went through similar stuff when she went through puberty. During the last half of seventh grade, I forced myself to ignore the almost debilitating pain in my lower stomach. But, since I had missed so much homework during those times, I got used to it, and was genuinely forgetting to do it. It’s also important to mention I had bad shit going on at home during those years, which I don’t wish to talk about. Now, I’m completely unprepared. My dream is to get into medical school and be a brain surgeon, but if I don’t shape up, that teeny tiny chance I have of getting into medical school will completely disappear, and I’m freaking out. 
Now, I’m not scared that I’m going to keep forgetting to do my homework; I’m terrified that I won’t know anything. 
Does anyone have any advice for how I can start getting better? Some apps or YouTube channels, or even subreddits that can educate me for the summer? Maybe some kind of program? I’m lowkey freaking out, and any help would be greatly appreciated.

316,"I have been NEET for three years after graduating from college and now, at 25, I am mortified. Mortified does not even describe it. I have had no work experience whatsoever in these past 3 years and I am terrified that I may have ruined my life permanently at this point. What are the steps that I can take now? Would any place hire someone who has been NEET for three years?

For background, I graduated from a good university with a BS in Finance/Economics and a decent GPA (3.2 out of 4.0). But I have had no work experience. I am so scared that no one will ever want to hire someone who has essentially been doing jack shit for the past three years after getting his bachelors. I just need a start. I'll take a godawful salary but I need some guidance as to what I can do. 

The reason I have been unemployed for so long is because I grew up in a way that I now, at 25 years old, do not have any clear passions or fields of interest that I would like to go into. I chose Finance/Economics because I had no idea what to do for college and just thought it sounded like a do-able degree that could probably get me hired in the future. I had no real passion for it. But I'm willing to take any kind of job right now I just hope that it does not have to be a manual labor/retail job. Is a manual labor/retail job the only kind of thing I can get now?

I am just wondering what kind of job I can find at this point and how I can do it. I am INTENSELY regretful and mortified about the past three years but I want to focus on actionable things and where I can go from here. If anyone has any suggestions or advice I would appreciate it deeply. Thank you to everyone who took the time to read and respond to this post.",16Jun2019,9
317,"I'm very worried because I'm falling behind the rest of society. Education, work prospects, social interactions and health have all suffered as a result of mental difficulties. It's my own fault probably but I want to take responsibility and improve my life. Some things have helped, for example, I've kept exercising and managing my finances carefully. 

I can't cope well with stress. It causes me insomnia and bad habits such as poor diet and eating patterns. Also, I noticed that I may be addicted to YouTube as it distracts me from anxiety. 

My motivation is quite low so my studies at university have not been going as well as they could be. On top of this I even doubt if what I am doing is right for me. This is causing me a lot of regret as I could have maybe made better decisions. It's killing me inside. I don't know how to handle it. 

Procrastination and fear have been problems as well. I have difficulty making important decisions, which is paralysing. It's extremely depressing and overwhelming as there could be serious personal/financial consequences. 

Anyways, sorry and thank you.",16Jun2019,1
318,"I work at a bar and one day I walked in o the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new (about 2-3 months) who I haven’t talked to stared at me kind of smiling a little as I walked in the doorway as she was sorting glasses and she didn’t look away but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding might have been nothing) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Darren’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Darren’ and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and smiled at me after saying it and then look away to carry on putting her scarf on.

319,"My wife is pregnant with our second child and her mood is getting really bad lately. Last pregnancy it was all okay but this time...
Everytime we fight, she wants a divorce. And she just screams at me and doesnt want to talk and sends me really awful messages and worse. 
This time we had breakfast and i was a bit mad because i fed our daughter and she was just looking at her smartphone the whole time. 
And then, without anything happening, she told me she will go outside and she wants me to pack my stuff and be gone when she comes back. 
So after she is gone, i dress our daughter and take her with me to look for my wife. 
When i found her at the bank she gave me all my important cards and told me she would scream for help if i kept following her. Then we went back to our apartment and she locked the door in front of me. 
A few minutes later threw out a bag with a few of my clothes. 
And all this time i kept asking 'why' and 'what happened' and 'what did i do' but she kept yelling that she doesn't want to talk to me ever again. She and my daughter are everything i have. I moved to this village for them without finishing school. I don't know anyone here. 

And now i am sitting in front of the house, don't have anywhere to go and lost the only thing, precious to me. At this point i just want to die.

322,"I am second born, 1 year younger than the sister in question. We could never get along with eachother, we would fight over silly things every day, all day and it would drive everyone else in the house absolutely mad. I am a male, and am a lot taller and maybe twice as heavy as she is - meaning I could be in charge over her and be mean to her as much as I want, and she could do nothing about it. Except she could. She has always been our patents favourite, so she gets everything she wants. This really bothers me and our younger sister. It really is weird that she is a favourite considering she is the least responsible, very bitchy, very egoistic and spoiled. She gets bad grades in her third year of highschool, goes out every night and spends mone like crazy and, above all, she hates our parents for very irational reasons. Her lates present she got was a guitar that I was saving for for 2 years (of course I was begging my parents to pay a small portion). I found this absolutely unexceptable because, not only did I saving for it, but also because she doesn't want it and doesn't know how to play it. And, of course, she doesn't let me use it, but it has always been like that with her so I didn't expect her to. I have learned to be reasonable with her, although I can't be reasonable with a bitch 17 year-old so I treat her like a child most of the times. Lately, we have been getting into a lot of fights mainly because she was being offensive to me and our little sister, which I couldn't stand because our sister is the most innocent person I know. She drives me absolutel mad and I just don't know how to deal with it no more. Sometimes I just like to think to myself that she will probably have no life and no job when she grows up, but then I remember that our richass cheapass parents will continue supporting her until they or she dies.

334,"CONTEXT:

So me and my dad were close until my parents separated. I occasionally went round his house but that stopped. I haven’t been in contact with him for about 2 years until he messaged me out of the blue asking me to be a bridesmaid at his wedding. I’ve never met his fiancée or her family, I haven’t spoken to my brother or sister for 5 years. My mum also refuses to go so I’ll be completely on my own with people I don’t know (I also have real bad social anxiety and I had a panic attack thinking about it). 

One thing that’s playing in my mind is the fact that he asks me to be a bridesmaid for someone I don’t know but he can’t even be bothered to send me a card or wish me happy birthday so why should I put the effort in if he doesn’t return it. I also think about how I’ve had to put up with so much shit from him.

I never did. I watched go through several different relationships since we were still friends. it hurt and really affected my mental health. Later down the line senior year we were both single at the time, I asked her to homecoming and she said she needed time to think. She never got back to me and ended up going with her ex. I stayed home and worked on the collection of cuts on my arm. They ended up separating for whatever reason ( we stopped talking after that ) and we ended up having a class together at the end of the semester of senior year. I still had feelings and decided to take a shot and ask her to prom. She said yes and I was very surprised as well as happy, probably happier than I've ever been. She said that prom would be a deciding factor for us getting back together, which stressed me out a bit, but whatever I'll make it a good night. She did not give me the time of day at prom. She hung out with her friends while I, being the lonely and anxious guy I am, spent the night outside of the place we had prom chain smoking cigarettes. She ended up getting back with her ex the same exact night. This shit fucked me up. We never spoke again until recently, 2 years later. She ended up getting a job at the same place that I worked. Keep in mind I never really lost feeling for her and was working on removing her from my mind and thoughts. Long story short she was still with the ex, and also trying to make conversation with me. She told me how she never really didnt have feelings for me, apologized about prom, and ended up breaking up with her ex. We started hanging out alot afterwork and eventually started acting like a couple.

338,"I'm 33 and until a few years ago had crippling social anxiety. Early last year I moved out of my mom's house and in with some friends, but a few weeks ago I moved back in with my mom. Basically what I'm saying is - I've only lived on my own for about 14 months.

With that out of the way - **time to explain my situation!**

I got a really good job offer across the country (~1500 miles away), a once in a lifetime opportunity - the kind you'd hate yourself for refusing. Problem is... I've never left the state as an adult (Last time was as a kid), I've never been more than 20 minutes away from my mom (Living situation wise), and I've never really had a job before (I'm on disability for social anxiety).

**The problem:**

I'm scared because:

* Like I said, I've never left the state as an adult
* I've never driven this far in my life, or even close
* I'm afraid my mom will be upset (I haven't told her yet)
* I'm afraid I'll miss my mom and grandma too much
* I feel guilty for leaving my mom alone - my dad left her last year and she's all alone except for my grandma (Her mom). She also has health problems


I haven't been able to sleep because of this, my anxiety is high, I've been on the verge of tears on and off for the past few days, and I'm depressed and conflicted.

339," 

Hello everyone,

My mother and father have recently discovered this iOS feature where the entire family can share locations and view each others'. I am going away for my freshman year of college this fall and for obvious reasons, I do not want my entire family(specifically parents) knowing and having the power to check on my location the entire time.

I had narrowed down my college list to TWO and the only reason I chose the one I'm going to now is because the other choice was only fifteen minutes away from my house. I wanted to get away from home (not a bad environment but I just want some independence). I was not raised to be a rebel. I do get enough freedom right now as it is as long as I text them where I'm going and where I'm at. Obviously I could just lie and they would believe me; however, I was never the type to say one thing and go to this huge rager party---NEVER.

Their reasoning was that it was for ""emergency purposes"" which I understand, but I'm assuming this would go up throughout my college life, which I'm strongly against. I don't know how to convince them not to go through with this idea, but I don't really have much say as I cannot speak against their decisions as much as I want to. The most I can say is how my privacy would be invaded, but of course safety comes first at all times. I do not have anything to hide, but this is just too much.

Help I guess? Maybe tell me how I can convince them not to carry on with this or maybe tell me how this is actually not that big of a deal? I just want a little bit more freedom in college, that's all.",16Jun2019,2
340,"So I'm in a short contract of 20 hours a week, work Friday to Sunday.
I work 26 to 28 hours in those 3 days, but have to lie in the paperwork that I'm working 8-8-4 instead of 10-10-6.

I probably won't last longer than a month in this job and part of me doesn't care. I need the money because I want to save and move, but having to lie and getting paid a shit amount and being overworked just isn't what I'm keen on. Plus I have other shit in my life and this place has a shitty boss who thinks he's better than everyone, and fucks up things he tells you off for. So, typical hospitality boss.

342,"Gee, I don’t know where to start with this. It’s quite a long story so please stick with. Background on me first: I’m female, 29, born in the US and now living in between London and Paris. I run a successful medical supplies company. 

For the sake of this post, I am going to change names. I met Tim, aged 58 at a work event 4 years ago. He followed me on social media and took an interest in me and my work. I’m usually reserved around new people but we hit it off very quickly. It seemed like we had so much in common and he was interested in my work. We started with occasional dinners and coffees and developed a platonic friendship. At the time, he was unemployed with no qualifications but seemed bright and clued in. So I offered him a job. 

He started to work for my firm and progressed quickly, eventually becoming one of my most senior members of the team, amongst 2-3 others. My friends thought I was crazy and several of them told me they were concerned because we were spending a lot of time together. I was dismissive and told them that age was just a number. 

Outside of work, we continued to spend a lot of sociable time together. He would come on vacation with me and came to a few family events. There was immediate tension between he and my father and quite often I was made to feel trapped in the middle. There were many arguments and I would usually side with Tim, feeling my dad felt threatened. 

I broke up with my fiancé at the time and was stuck temporarily for somewhere to live. Tim had a spare room and willingly said he would host me. At the time it felt like the right idea and after a few weeks, we decided to continue living together. My friends told me once again that I was crazy. 

Over time, I started to feel suffocated. I was living and working with this guy and when I was away in Berlin, I’d come home and my things had moved in my bedroom and he’d done all of my cleaning, chores and washing. I once came home to find my underwear drying in his bedroom. 

This made me feel uncomfortable and I confronted Tim. We have always been purely friends and I have never sensed an attraction from him. I have felt that he sees me more as a daughter as he has never had children or been married. Still, it made me feel creeped out a little. Over the years he has done many things that have made me feel uncomfortable around boundaries and whenever I have told him, he has usually cried and apologised. 

Around 2 years ago, I met my current partner and we recently got engaged and are moving in together. Since I met my SO, Tim has been increasingly unpredictable and emotional. We have had various conversations around him overstepping the line and I have told him how uncomfortable it makes me feel to receive constant text messages from him and to discover that he had befriended most of my friends on Facebook and was inviting them to his social events. 

Aside from me, Tim doesn’t spend time with others and so I have always felt under pressure to include him and to ensure he doesn’t feel displaced around my SO. 

Aside from all of the tension around my SO, I have discovered that Tim had lied and manipulated situations between me and my dad and caused a rift in our relationship (of which is now healed). This caused tension and when I confronted Tim calmly, he was outraged and threatened to turn my investors and colleagues against me and made a physical threat to choke me. I left and stayed with my SO and then told Tim I would be moving out. 

I moved out and things seemed okay at work. We were professional and Tim apologised for the things he said to me. Then I received a concerned call from one of my lead investors. 

To my horror, Tim had hacked into my personal iMessages and emails and had been reading all of my conversations with everybody for weeks, including intimate messages with my SO and sensitive messages with relatives, investors and other close friends. He had downloaded and shared with my investors messages where I was calling him ‘mental’ and ‘insane’ and saying that I needed him out of my life and that I really hated him because of what he had done to me. 

I was forced to apologise to Tim and to acknowledge I should have not been talking about him in such terms, but I feel like my privacy has been violated and am unnerved knowing that he has been reading all of my private conversations with people for weeks, if not months. 

If I remove him from the company, it’s likely he will lash out and create damage to me and my investors. Equally how can I trust him? I am physically and psychologically intimidated and scared by this man. 

Am I being stalked? I feel backed into a corner by this man and have seen a side that I’ve never seen before. My friends were right all along and I’m scared. 

Interested in other perspectives as I don’t know what to do. Thankfully I’m now in Dubai with my SO for the next week so I have some space to figure all of this out.",16Jun2019,4
344,"English is not my native language so bare with me.

I was called by the school principal asking me if she should sign up my name to join the elite stream. 
 
In my  country there are 3 educational streams for high schoolers:
General: less science, more literature. Doesn’t allow you to do science-y stuff in college- university(unless you get like a grade higher than 98 then maybe the my would let you become a nurse)

Advanced: Same literature, more science. Allows you to have science-y stuff in college

Elite: more of everything and more subjects in general. Not sure what you can do in college(better than advanced in all aspects)

I’m currently in the advanced stream and planing to either study STEM or astrophysics in the future.
I’m having a mental block on what I’m supposed to do. I am very lazy and I have really bad commitment problems. You can’t be “bad at school” if you join that stream.

345,"Hey, posting from a throwaway because some of my friends/family know my reddit account and I am finding this difficult to talk about. 

I have been seeing a therapist for a little over half a year. I have had therapy before in my life, but this has felt very different, and I feel more in control of my life and my mind than I have before. I am very grateful to have had this experience.

At this point, knowing that our sessions are drawing to a close quite soon, I have been having to face more frequently the fact that I wish I had met my therapist as a friend, in some other walk of life, so that we might have become friends. I feel a fair amount of distress at the idea of never seeing them again. I am aware that it is extremely unlikely that a therapist would be able to continue a relationship with a patient after finishing a course of therapy even if they wanted to, and feel that this knowledge is the main obstacle preventing me opening up about this, as I fear there isn't anything I can receive from this conversation that won't hurt immensely. But I am also aware that if I say nothing I will continue to experience this pain until our sessions end and then I can't begin to imagine what I might be faced with. 

I have been trying to bring this up for a few weeks, but am having difficulty knowing how to talk about it. Does anyone have any thoughts on how I might be able to identify with this issue differently to be better able to face talking about it in the moment?

My friends who I was with also noticed them and began to talk about them, again I was an idiot as I told them about my interaction with them and one of them suggested going over and talking to them, I declined as I didn't want to bother them and I wasn't entirely certain that either of them were even interested in me.

But one of my friends offered to go and talk to them on my behalf, I hesitantly accepted and was shocked when the same girl got really shy and said that she was also interested in me, my friend then gave her my number and we left shortly after that.

Now, that was two days ago and she hasn't said anything to me, does this mean she's not interested, that she is interested or am I just not waiting long enough, as I said I am fairly new to this so I'm interested in what you guys have to say",16Jun2019,1
350,"Hey Reddit. I've got a bit of a specific scenario.

So yesterday, I was grabbing a coffee with a friend at a place we'd never been to before. While my mate was ordering, I caught another l girl behind the cash register girl staring at me and smiling and would glance away every time I looked over. I didn't think much of it but when we were waiting for a coffees she's hands me mine and makes a pun related to a band shirt I was wearing. I said that was cute and kind of got all flustered. She continued asking things about myself but I was taken aback and couldn't seem to muster responses so my friend was filling in the gaps in my answers. Me and my friend said goodbye and left.

Now don't get me wrong I'm 22 and have had my fair share of flirting. But for some reason she really left an impression on me.

How can I recover from this? I'm mostly concerned is that I didn't show I was interested at all. I'd like to think I can go back and give her my number

PS. I live in a country were tipping isn't a thing and I'm pretty okay at telling the difference between flirting and being nice.",16Jun2019,0

354,"I (26F) chose bachelors in civil engineering over architecture because growing up my peers and parents suggested a creative field may be too competitive. I also got a scholarship for civil engineering (in India) and decided to go ahead with it. When I finished I realised I didn’t know anything. I liked geotechnical engineering but that’s it. I took a break after that as I didn’t get a job anywhere I applied. I really liked art and drawing while growing up and thought maybe I’d done a mistake and should’ve done architecture instead . So I tried to train myself in sketch up and revit but didn’t enjoy working on softwares. A few companies actually suggested I do masters in management and I was really against it and so I researched on design courses. Took an educational loan and went to Australia to do Masters of design. That went down the drain. It was too vast and not even related to interior architecture like it had listed . I’d consulted my counsellors and they all told me to hang on. But I failed and In panic changed to construction management. I’m from a poor to middle class family and it didn’t help that my mother was doing even more poorly health and financial wise. I kept a positive outlook towards things and continued to apply for jobs. So far I’ve had one interview out of a 100 jobs I’ve applied for.
I’m lost. I’m not a bad student or worker...never was. I’ve had internships and although I didn’t immensely enjoy this field , I knew I could manage. It’s been a year since so graduated with a masters but I still feel lost . I don’t know which company will hire me because my passion is fake , I have little to no knowledge and my technical knowledge isn’t still too great.

How do I get out of this situation ? Do I suck it up and do any job until I pay my loans off? I hear my architect friends talk about projects and it kills me yet I know I can’t switch to architecture at this stage . I guess what I’m asking is, how do I proceed?

We've been together for a few months now, almost half a year, a couple months ago she decided to let me take her virginity, she wanted it without protection first but that's not really the problem because she still had her menstrual cycle a couple more times after that (according to her the menstrual cycle is a sign of no fetus being formed in the body or something)

We always enjoyed doing it raw more than using protection though we'd always use a condom when available and I'd always pull out before letting it out.

Her menstrual cycle this month hasn't come yet, it could be an irregular one considering that she had an irregular one last time but it's due this week and she's not showing any of the signs she usually shows

I'd post in r/AskDocs but I'm really not sure how to handle this and what my next move should be, she said if she does have a kid she wouldn't abort but I'm not sure if I'm ready for that yet and I just don't know what best to do anymore, any advice will be appreciated",16Jun2019,0

There are times where he treats us like a dog by putting out his hand and asking us for a paw or dangling a sweet in front of our faces and asking us to do tricks. 
However, he himself also likes to bark at other people. Yes, literally barked like a dog to other people. And has also curled up his fingers to represent a  ""paw"" and prod at us, give us ""puppy eyes"" and make sad sounds like a puppy. 
Some background of him, he studies veterinary science and has interest in studying human medical science so he can be a doctor. But he has also showed signs of being sadistic by laughing at people's injuries. He sometimes has bouts of depression by saying he wants to kill himself and that life has no meaning and no one loves him.

360,"Hi everyone!

I've been sitting on this issue for a while and I just need an outsider's perspective.

I (22F) have cousins from my dad's side that I haven't seen in well over a decade. My cousins were never in my life from my recollection but that changed when I was 8. We were all of a sudden so involved, visiting each other and what not, but then one day we stopped visiting each other, over a particular incident. What happened was that my mum thought she could seek help from my aunt (dad's sister) because my dad was an abusive/manipulative prick and went over to her house. Instead of protecting her and taking the side of the victim, my aunt took my dad's side, yelled and kicked her out. Ever since that moment, we never got to see my cousins ever again. 

So here is my dilemma:

I want to reach out to my cousins but at the same time I don't want/scared to because:

1. I am worried about the backlash from my family
2. They knew who I was yet never reached out but this is an assumption. I should mention, I've only recently discovered their surname, so there is no way that I could have reached out
3. I'm miffed by the probability that they knew about the domestic violence and didn't think about reaching out (again, assumption)
4. I'm scared they'll reject my friend request
5. I don't know what will happen if I do decide to reach out

What does everyone think I should do? How should I go about this? Should I just not bother and leave everything as is, or should I take a risk? 

Thank you",16Jun2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

So yesterday I got into a car accident. A tree was covering a stop sign and I ended up running it. Heard a car speeding from my right and I hit the brakes, but still got T-boned. I think if I didn't or if I went faster, my gf in the passenger side could have gotten hurt. According to the people in the neighborhood, crashes often happen at this intersection since the stop sign is covered and it is only a 2-way stop. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anywho, nobody seems to be hurt but I'm having a tough time with myself at the moment. It's a lot of ""why didn't I do x before coming here"", but most of all I just feel....defeated? When the cops were dealing with the accident, I took a look around the area and I saw a ""stop sign ahead"" sign some way before the stop sign I ran, so I feel like I now have no excuse.  The thought that mostly comes to mind is ""how did I not notice not one, but **TWO** signs??"" because that really is something that I never slipped up on before. Aside from the possible legal issues, I just feel really sh\*tty about the whole thing.

376,"This is gonna be long and I apologize for any grammatical errors. I'm 19 (F). On 8th grade, my female friend had a crush on a guy. All of us are classmates. She was rejected and my friend begged me to learn more about him. She wanted to know what he is like and what his hobbies are etc. She's soooo obsessed with him and can't move on so, me being afraid to lose her as a friend, did it to support her. I'm a shy person so, I just said ""Hi"" to him on facebook. Long story short, we became friends online. I tried to make them both friends but the guy said he didn't like her because she's very clingy and annoying. I told her that so that she'd understand. The guy ignored her and I'm on an awkward position. I can't force him to like her. 

9th grade: This is the start of my toxic friendship with my so called best female friend. The 3 of us are classmates again. I tried to not really get close with the guy because I don't want to make my friend jealous. Also, I don't want to ruin my friendship with the guy. I was confused. I don't really hang out with him at school. We basically talk online almost everyday. I get to know him more and more and I kinda develop a crush on him. He's an online friend. We have a lot of similarities and sense of humor. I didn't admit to anyone that I like him. I also did not let my feeling show. I want it to be platonic. My bestie told me she moved on. Looking back, my best friend was actually jealous of me I see it cause she copies what I do. I draw a lot and she's very competitive. It's like a competition to her while I'm just doing what I like. She gets annoyed if my grades were higher than hers. She tries even harder. She also bought the same dresses I wear. She did not tell me what her feelings to me so I had no clue. I realized this too late. 

10th grade: the downfall. So again, my best friend and I are classmates. I was glad the guy was on other class. And again she keeps saying she moved on blah blah she brings that topic whenever we talk. We had a school group project. Of course we're partners. It's about writing our own romance short novel fiction or non-fiction. We decided to make it a collection of different stories. So yeah mine's fiction and hers is based on her life. When we're done with it I wanted to read hers. She sounded nervous and warned me that I was included on it and I didn't mind. I thought it's about the guy. I brought it home so that I could fix any mistakes. I was shocked and had no idea that she actually hates me. I HAD NO IDEA before. She was jealous af honestly it's like being stabbed in the back. I pretend that I was okay but kept my distance. 

11th grade: Finally we got separated. I was happy. I did not cut her off. We still hang out. It's toxic. Anyways, I thought my dumb ass could clear the toxicity of the friendship by helping her again. She can't move on the guy to the point I got so sick. I asked the guy to not ignore her since she's miserable so he agreed. My not so best friend misunderstood this and thinks he likes her. She got out of the line and invaded his personal space. Now, the guy complained to me and told her to stop. That's the time where I cut her off of my life. Blocked her on every social media. Now I'm not friends with both of them anymore. My friendship with the guy faded away.

12th grade: Again my ex best friend made an account to talk to me. She wanted to be friends again and I could go on and on but she doesn't understand. Seriously I'm done. I explained a lot and hurt her feelings because I had to be honest with her. Now she's gone and I'm free. Also missed the guy. Never confessed my feelings. Wish we could be friends again.

383,"Hey guys, so I've been living in an apartment with one roommate for the last few months but he moves back to turkey at the end of August. The original plan was to find another roommate on Craigslist or find someone who's willing to move in when my roomate moves out. About 2 months ago I got a girlfriend and things have been pretty great so far. About a week into the relationship she proposed the idea of her moving in when he moves out. I was so exited when she asked cause I would want nothing more than that. I mean the alternative for me would have been to find a random on Craigslist. Her mom is a very strict Muslim and told my girlfriend that she would disown her if she moved in with me. In my perspective I think this is kind of a scare tactic and her mom will eventually miss her daughter and start having a relationship with her. This kind of puts me in a hole though. Because most people aren't willing to sign a 2 year lease with a random person and if that doesn't work I'm not sure I'll be able to find an affordable apartment in the same area near my work. I wouldn't be in as this bad of a situation but 2 weeks ago she said she was 100 percent going to be able to move in with me,  I wouldn't have minded if she said she didn't want to back then because then I could start apartment searching sooner.

Over the years I have enjoyed meeting his entire family, children and grandchildren, usually at Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners at his home.

My son who lives out of town recently visited with his wife and 3 grown children and I naively thought that my friend and his wife might enjoy meeting them, if only to present a topic of discussion at our next get together.

For this reason I sent him an email inviting his wife to join us for our usual Wednesday night dinner which this time would include my family. I would be paying.

My beliefs were confirmed at our next get together when I learned that he in fact had left town for a few days but not on the Wednesday of our normally scheduled dinner nor the next day. It was apparent that neither he nor his wife had any interest in meeting my family.

388,"So my ex and I broke up just over 3 weeks ago. It was for the best but I've still found it hard, but definitely getting better. We had a group of friends involving one other girl and a guy (this work friend). I also work with my ex. The group of the 3 of them is still carrying on but I have left the group. I told him that I won't come between their friendship and won't expect him to stop doing things etc.

However during this week he asked me for some coke/acid and I gave him the guys number. I was normally the guy in the group who got all our stuff etc as I had all the connects. He said it was for him and his mates at their uni this weekend. So I was more than happy to oblige. I then noticed that my ex has put a dog walk (at her parents house which is a fair distance away) on Strava with her dog, her female friends dog and the work friend's dog. So it is pretty obvious that he went to my ex's parents with them and did the coke/acid there.

Naturally I'm pretty fucking fuming. I genuinely trusted this guy, and whether or not something is going on between them, it doesn't matter as he blatantly lied to me about what he was doing. I feel used, once again like I was by my ex, for the 2nd time in 3 weeks. I'm going to have a word with him tomorrow but I really don't know what to say without losing my head right now.",16Jun2019,0
389,"I've had two friends that i've known for 3 years now be extremely toxic and a sort of negative force in my life. I never realised how really toxic they were to me until i started hanging out with new people and realising how much better i felt around them. Anytime i hang out with these two friends they always find a way to put me down, be it my appearance the things i enjoy. Anytime i do something they just either brush it aside or still put me down.  Whenever i try to talk about something that i enjoy they shut me up or make fun of me.   
 I still continue to be friends with them since i don't really know if they treat me like shit because they're personally insecure with themselves or something else. I know i should stop hanging out with them but i'm struggling to find a good way to deal with the situation.",16Jun2019,1
390,"I just started my new job a month ago. As of today, I have already made two huge mistakes.

I have posted incorrect data which affected the month's financial impact. What's even worse, I did not do a task which caused the company to incur a penalty charge that cost more than what I am worth.

I have already informed my direct supervisors and requested for waiver as per instructed. Adjustments were also made to the incorrect data.

I am really dreading going to work as I would have to speak to the big boss about these issues. I think I am going to get fired. I am so embarrassed and disappointed in myself.

I have already written my resignation and am thinking of when to submit it if they have not already decided to fire me. I do not think I will be able to let this go as long as I am still in the company. My managers definitely will not too. I should not have taken up this job in the first place.

I know I should be thinking of trying to salvage the situation but there is nothing I can do now but wait for a reply on the waiver.

My credibility at work has definitely gone down the drain and I do not know how to face my colleagues at work. I would really appreciate if you have any advice to overcome how I feel right now :(((",16Jun2019,1
391,"So a bit of background first, about 4 months ago i moved from new york to Florida to live with my dad who i had never met before. I know a took a huge risk but the way i was being treated in school up there was really taking a huge toll on me and it didn't help that even in the summers i was constantly freezing ans the weather was so depressing i just had to get out of there. Now that I've gotten to know my father I've realized that his general mannerisms are just as bad, he's so quick to anger and he's constantly complaining about just everything and when he does this i know its not aimed at me but im a soft person i can't handle aggression or yelling because it makes me cry. A few weeks after i got down here he forced me to end a 3 year relationship because the guy didn't shake his hand good enough when he met him??? But he pressured me so much about it i had to cave in, now my ex knows about what happened and there's no bad blood between us but we don't talk anymore and i think about that a lot. From the short amount of time I've been here my dad knows very little about me because i have very different Political views from him and he loves to shove his views down my throat every single day, I've learned to just shut up and agree with him even when he talks bad about the people i like. He's so close minded about everything to the point where im scared to be on my phone around him or even listen to music because he will just say horrible shit about it and yell at me. I mean for crying out loud he got mad and me and thought i was a whore because i thought a stupid meme on Instagram was funny. Point is i need to get out of here and quickly before he drives me to insanity. My birthday is tuesday and about a month ago my mom had called me and asked if i could drive up there with him so we can celebrate my 18th together, obviously i jumped on this and even tried to come up earlier than today. In the past month I've opened up to my mom and we made a plan, we would drive up there and he would think its only a week long trip then I'd come back down but when i get up there I'll actually be staying instead. That seemed to be the most logical thing to do that way he can't say no and cancel the trip leaving me stranded here. Now here's the problem, i have no clue how to tell him im staying once we get up there. I've tried thinking of several ways to do it but i know in reality I'd crack under pressure and start crying and it would just be messy, plus he's manipulative so he's going to try and guilt trip me into going back. If anyone has dealt with a person like this and knows how to maybe get around the angering and crying i could really use some help on this. If you've read this far, thank you.",16Jun2019,1
392,"Things with my partner haven't been going very well, and I think a breakup is pending. We have three cats. One we adopted together(Cat A), and two that were mine coming into the relationship (Cat B and C). 

Cat A loves me more, but my partner would take it. He was adopted solely under my partner's wishes, I didn't really want him, but have definitely grown to love him. 

Cat B loves us both but would come with me. He is indifferent to both cats. 

Cat C is very timid and stressed. He loves us both but loves me more given I have been there for him since he was 6 months old. Cat A and C have become bonded. 

Which is worse, breaking up a bonded pair of cats, or seperating from its preferred human? Cat C is the one I am most worried about. He has definitely gotten more confident since adopting Cat A, but he has also lived with me for 4ish years. I worry about him regressing and want to make the transition easiest for him.",16Jun2019,1
393,"I have been working at my current job for the last six months. I have been performing well and have been quite happy so far.

A month ago a new person joined our team. He is a foreigner just like me and he just came to the country three months ago. It feels like he is trying to be rude to me. I feel like his behavior is quite strange. I talked to some friends I know in real life and they also agreed with me. They advised me to confront him about it but I think it may make his behavior worse. Or he will just deny it.

I am standing at the bus stop everyday. This guy comes to the bus stop and passes me by like he does not know me. He is standing a couple of feet away from me but never says Hi or anything. Last friday he was walking just behind me to the bus but didnt say anything. 

Only last friday I was sitting in the bus when he was coming in the bus. I looked at him and then he said hi to me But if he does not catch me looking at him then he avoids me.

I get a strange feeling from him in general. I know this will sound stupid but I noticed a couple of times then when I make a joke or something in the meeting then everyone is laughing but he is very serious. This happened a couple of times. If another colleague makes a joke then he laughs. I know it sounds ridiculous but it makes me feel weird.

When he was new I thought maybe he thinks I am rude. He had some empty cardboard boxes under his seat for many days and people were complaining. So I offered to carry the empty cardboard boxes with him to the trash.

Now that is all ok. If he wants to behave like that then that is fine. 
What drives me crazy is that he behaves like that with me and then a couple of times per day he comes to me for help. Last week has been worse because my team lead asks me to work with him so I do all of the work. If he is sitting at my desk then he just watches my screen. On friday I told him we should split up the tasks and what ended up happening was I was fixing all of the problems and he was getting all of the work on his pc using source control.

I have two meetings every month where people from management ask me ""Do you have any problems?"". I want to bring it up but I also want to be careful in my wording because I get emotional and sometimes end up looking like the bad guy.

396,"So I've had this FWB (friend with benefits) for about a year now. She lives like 45 minutes away so we maybe meet up once a month but text pretty often.

There was a time where I talked her down from killing herself through texting, she wanted to OD. And more recently she succeeded in taking that many pills but told me ""she can't even kill herself right"" and wasn't able to kill herself that night.

I have pleaded for her to find some professional help, listen to Alan Watts or Joe Dispenza on YouTube since this is a way to help me when I'm going through depression. But she always pushes back. 

It's starting to affect me and I'm not sure what else I can do. I have avoided meeting up because I'm not sure what to say and I don't want to develop this relationship much further. I don't want to hurt her feelings and she doesn't have a very good support system.

397,"I never told my mom that my friend's house is infested with bed bugs 
It's been like that since last year cause her uncle stayed the night after staying at a nasty hotel. Then blamed it on them and left without helping.

I had never been bitten so I thought it wasn't that bad, plus they had just tried to bomb their house with chemicals to kill all the bugs.
Didn't work obviously

But now today
I have been nibbled like the tastiest fucking snack and I cannot hide it because it's on my face and neck 

My mom is going to find out and she'll be soo mad that I never told her. 
She'll probably even ban me from hanging out with my friend until the bed bugs are gone but that won't happen anytime soon. They don't have enough money to get an exterminator. 

And then my life will SUCK because without my friend I have NOBODY because everyone is always too busy for me. I am genuinely scared I can't stay home all the time, I can't function like that.

I came almost instantly then I went down on her and made her orgasm then she put her hands on my chest and put her pussy into my dick and started riding me. I loved every second of it.

400,"Urgh, OK. So this happened less than two hours ago and I'm still reeling from the entire experience so please bear with me as I'm getting this out.

I live about a mile from the nearest convenience store, which I walk to a couple of times a week. Today I was on my way back and it was just gone midday when this happened. My journey back involves going through a train station. It is pretty small, only one platform and I'm walking towards it as a train pulls in and one person gets off.

I see the person walking towards me, then it starts raining. I should point out, I listen to music when I walk but I'm always aware of my surroundings, being a 5'4"" female, it seems necessary to do so. He reaches me and says something which I can't hear because of the music. I take out one headphone taking a mental note of this person and my surroundings at this point because I'm socially awkward at the best of times, so my brain goes into hyper awareness mode.

This person greets me as if he knows me, talking about the weather and how he's going to see his kids (as it's father's day and all) and blah blah blah. All the time he's getting closer and closer to me and I'm starting to panic. Glancing around to see if there are people nearby (we're next to some houses and a busy road but there's no one around because of the rain).

I'm struggling to remember this person. I'm still 99.9% convinced I don't know him. But he's still acting as if he knows me, when I asked politely how he knew me he simply glossed over the question. He keeps getting closer and I'm running out of space to move backwards at this point. My brain is screaming at me to get away but I'm trying not to do anything that might antagonise this person. 

I make a move towards the station and he says he'll walk back with me, but now he's started to compliment me. ""Oh you always did have such beautiful eyes"" and ""it's so nice to see you again"", ""it's a shame you have to walk back in this weather"" he tells me trying to put his arm around me. I step out of the way just before he does.

We reach the station and he's still talking, and still he's trying to get too close. At several points he's got within centimeters of my face as if he wants to kiss me, and then when I look down or away he backs off slightly. I also want to point out that this person was dressed smartly, not in a suit or anything, but he looked perfectly normal. He didn't smell of alcohol and he didn't seem to be on drugs or anything. Plus it was the middle of the day. 

He kept touching me, nothing too awful, hand on the shoulder, or the back, once to my face. Urgh, I still feel so utterly creeped out thinking about this. But I just know if I didn't look down or away every time he tried to kiss me, he would have done so and that's when I'd have truly freaked out. It makes me shudder to think exactly what was going through his mind. What totally weirded me out though was that he told me that he'd be back there later on today and that we should hang out and stuff. He even told me what time he's going to be there. He seemed excited by the idea that I might go back (obviously this is the last thing in the world I would do, I never want to see him again). 

If I know this person, I don't recognise him, and even if I did know him I would never have let him act like that around me as I mentioned, I'm socially awkward and have issues with physical contact. Only my partner gets that close to me and doesn't make me feel uncomfortable.

So thankfully he finally took the hint when I said I had to go, though he seemed really put out, to the point where he hugged me, again, for what seemed like forever until I physically detached myself from him said bye and basically speed-walked away. As soon as I was out of his eye and ear shot I was on the phone to my partner and he talked to me the whole way back while he walked in my direction. I was constantly looking behind me to make sure I wasn't being followed.

This person didn't actually hurt me, but I don't think his intentions were exactly pure and I believe I dodged a bullet. I feel extremely creeped out that this could happen in broad daylight to anyone. I think ultimately I'm incredibly lucky that it didn't go anywhere near as bad as it could have done. My partner is keen to go back this evening and talk to the guy, and he really means to only talk to him, he isn't violent by any stretch but he could easily floor this guy if it came to that.

So, reddit. What should I do about this creepy encounter? I've ruled out calling the police as he didn't actually hurt me, and I am definitely not going back there alone later. I would just like an answer as to his behaviour and my partner thinks having words with him might put him off ever treating anyone like that again. I'm left feeling totally weirded out, like I want to scrub myself with bleach to get rid of the feeling. This isn't the first time something bizarre like this has happened to me, but it hasn't in a very long time so it has totally thrown me. Any (useful) advice would be much appreciated.

So I've been with my partner for 2 years now and its been really wonderful. We just got a new place and are planning a vacation. I have an ex friend, who I unfriended due to our one way friendship. Anytime they wanted to talk about something bothering them or needed help, would come to me but would never show me the same respect, even when I really needed it. My partner and ex friend were not friends before I ended the friendship. Both my partner and I are friends with the ex friends brother and their brothers gf (its a small friend circle). A few weeks ago, my partner and my ex friend started hanging out. I explained to my partner that I felt like they weren't on my side because they are hanging out with someone who hurt me. And they stated that they needs more friends, wants to expand their friend circle and wasn't overly bothered because the ex friend hasn't treated them poorly.

405,"In my old highschool, our vice-principle was the worst. A former army man's man that treated us like we were little soldiers.

415,"I'm 19 and I live with my parents who don't believe in mental illnesses. I've asked them multiple times to let me talk to a counselor/psychiatrist but they only say that I am not depressed or insane and there's no need to go to one. 

I've always loved reading since I was a kid and have been the star pupil in every school I've attended. But recently, like last few years I've been having problems with my attention span and get extreme headaches (and panic?) when I try to focus on my books, so much so that now it's affecting my studies and I've never been good at spelling but it's been getting much worse. I looked up dyslexia and other common problems, but letters definitely do not fly off the pages, if I had to explain it it would be like that feeling when you see a word but don't understand it  so you have to reread it except it keeps happening. 

I recently found out that my college has a counselor and unlike the one in my school she won't have to talk to my parents if I talk to her. I've been building up courage to go and talk and get help but I don't know how. It's been almost half a year since I found out about it but I don't know how to talk about it or how to explain my situation.

So… Hey people, I’m new here at reddit, been reading since some time ago but never felt the urge to make a post of my own. This is gonna be a large post, so I don’t think many people will read it, but who knows. And I dont know if this is the correct sub.

Let me talk you about my backstory for a bit. I was born in Spain and almost right after I was born I moved to Germany for two years, and then to USA for another six, since my father was in the military we used to travel a lot. My parents got divorced (because of some real shady shit) and had to go back to Spain with my mother. It was a difficult time since I was an immigrant in my own country, didn’t know the language, got bullied and was very depressed (that I believe is already rooted inside of me). So years passed by, 19 to be exactly, in the same city (which has been very tedious), studied hard and got a bachelors on Biotechnology, then a master’s degree on cellular and molecular biology and I’m working in a laboratory, if things go right I’ll do a PhD there about cancer.

I did get some friends but very few, I’ve known them almost since I got here, got to meet a girl was with here for 7 years and since then I’ve been jumping from girl to girl. I do appreciate some of my oldest friends very much, but they are becoming a horrible influence (drugs), so now I’m distancing myself from them a little bit. I don’t know if I even love the girl I’m with, to be honest deep inside myself I think I just want some affection and love.

What refers to the academic and professional part of my life, it has been awfully hard to get my bachelor’s degree, had to pay it bymyself through scholarships and through the money I’ve won on investments on the stock market (not very much), it was difficult to study since the situation at home was fucking horrible and my lost dad never showed no real support (he rather keep his new girlfriends than his son…) and my mother has multiple psychological problems. Always wanted to do a Erasmus program (exchange) to another country like many of my classmates, to improve my CV and to live an great life changing experience, although I hadn’t any money so that was another broken dream.

I was determined to get a PhD in cancer, but to get to this point has been hell. I’ve done 4 unpayed internships, sent hundreds of applications out there even had some interviews at northern Europe but it didn’t came through. Now at the lab im working at they do research in the topic ive always wanted, but it’s low quality research and the wage is so horrible I even cant move out of my mothers house. It’s depressing. Ive always been a hard worker, love to think creatively, love science, and when somebody or something gives me motivation and a dream to achieve, I just feel the urge to give 100% of myself. But this isn’t the case. Nowadays the only thing that matters to get into a nice project is a grade, a grade that doesn’t evaluate how creatively you think as a researcher, that depends many times on who evaluates your exam, its just memoristic part of intelligence… Of couse I know I have a big part to blame but still... It hurts.

19 fucking years I’ve been stuck in here, at the same place. It’s awfully sad, I do believe I had so many potential to live a nice life, to travel, meet new people, find a fulfilling passion, to not only survive but to be happy… Now times just flies by so quickly, I don’t know what I’m doing with my life, seeing how my former classmates are all over the world, with the support of their families, friends and even bosses. Some of them with nice relationships, fascinating hobbies, money, with a big ass smile on their face, creating stories to tell their grandchildren in a future, to make themselves proud of who the are.

And me? I don’t even know what to do. I just need a pull to get out of this tedious life, a possible dream to achieve, anything, and besides of that many times I just dont do stuff cause of the fear, for example going completely alone to another country, I know what it is to be a immigrant, it's one of the hardest things for a human being and I cant just imagine doing that all alone, with bearly any income.

There is much more, but I believe this is enough for now. Anyhow is somebody wants to ask, feel free to do so.",16Jun2019,1

I don't like how much I weight but i'm working on it and I'm cutting pounds. I work at a company that has its pros and cons. Pros are it is close to where I live and we don't work weekends. But the cons - Well it's like I don't fit in at work. Everyone is friends outside of work and it has been causing problems when at work. I feel like I can't even stand up for myself because I'm going to get knocked down and it's happened. I just feel so shut down and weak.

I want to make so many changes,such as switching jobs - But right now I feel like I'm stuck at my job because of bills that need to be paid for.  I have major anxiety and I fear speaking up for myself in any situation. I just shut down and stay quiet and then I come home and I'm so upset with myself. I just don't know how to move forward.

421,"It's currently winter where I'm from and the average high temperature would be something like 15˚C (59˚F). Anyway, as it's almost the holidays and a girl invited me to come over to her house. She said something like 'we don't have much, but we have a hot tub'. I know this event in isolation would really not mean much, but, according to my friends, this girl *may* be interested in me. 

They have a list of other stuff that she's done, with full context, its pretty long, so I won't bore you with it but to put it shortly, in 3 months of knowing her, she has:

Held my hand and danced with me at a club, held my hand with fingers interlocked during a horror film, leant on my shoulder during an annual AGM, asked me to study with her despite being in different courses and complimented me, examples include when she said 'you look cute' when looking at recent photos of me and when she said my eyes are beautiful.",16Jun2019,1

428,"To start off, this man is not my real grandfather. It's just the closest role he fits. He is truly my brother-in-law's father that I have just lived with since I was 2. To him, he says I'm like a daughter just because he was the only male figure in my life. 

Since before I could remember, he has always done pretty normal things like watch porn. It slowly started to turn into watching porn multiple times a day and making comments about my 15 y/o body at the time. The sexual comments weren't frequent enough to bother me to remember, but one I specifically can't forget is when I wore a strapless dress to military ball my sophomore year of high school and he asked me ""when my boobs got that big"". 

It then grew into him falling for porn bots and flirting with numerous females. He asked me how to download Skype and Whatsapp, then after getting used to those, random women would send him nudes for money. He now wakes up around 8 am and stays up until about 11 pm, only on his phone the whole day. He makes and watches TikToks, follows or added thousands of girls across a few different social media accounts, and that's literally everything he has done for the past year. He gets pissy when I ask him to take me to work because he's always trying to get nudes. My boyfriend even caught him buying a $50 Steam card for one of his ""lady friends"" online. 

The little amount of time I'm around him, I always hear at least one perverted comment a day. He also stares at my body quite often. Half of his facebook posts consist of something like ""pussy being a dessert"" and ""girls being delicious"". Every single thing he does has some type of sexual meaning behind it.

A woman (42f) who he has known since she was 10 moved in with us so she could escape an abusive marriage. Her goal was to find peace, his goal was to get laid. He basically jumped from my mom to my aunt and now to this other woman. Hilariously, he's living in a house with three women who rejected him multiple times. The fact that he even tried to get with my mom and aunt, who is also his daughter-in-law's mom and aunt, is even more disgusting. He tags our new roommate in sexual posts on Facebook, he gets jealous over guys commenting on her pictures and reads her mail, follows her around like a puppy, and told my cousins that he's going to marry her, when she has made it clear that she isn't interested. 

Every single woman in this house, especially me and our new roommate, is uncomfortable in some way. My friends don't even like coming inside the house because of him. I shouldn't have to worry about wearing a tank top and shorts in front of him because it's 92°F outside. I shouldn't have to hear sexual comments about me or another woman every single time I'm around him. I shouldn't be sexualized by a man that considers himself to be my father. I literally signed a Father's Day card for him in the midst of typing this. 

Also, even though he has done these things since I was super young, being diagnosed with bladder cancer last year really worsened it 10x. I'm moving out with my boyfriend in a month or two but I'm afraid things might worsen and something bad could happen. I seriously don't know if he would go that far. What does one even do in this situation?",16Jun2019,3
429,"My brother is far too busy. 

He has to work two jobs, which is fair enough as he needs to survive, but he's also a student and does various other things. I think he also plays some gigs for a little extra cash or because he feels obliged sometimes, and goes to classes to practice his language as that's what he studies. 

He needs to work, he needs to study, he needs to spend time with friends (most friends are his work mates, but he's said in the past he often finds it hard to leave them of they want to do something after work), and his housing is not secure so he has that to deal with too. He's also trying to date someone but in past he's struggled as he can't give a girl enough attention. 

He's always tired. He's stretched far too thin. He wants love but can't find it when like this. 

I'm not sure why he feels he has to do so much, he's been this way for years so it's not just that he's busy now, although that is an excuse he keeps givin. I don't know where he could cut down, but I think someone needs to tell him to slow down and I'm not sure how to approach it.",16Jun2019,1

She is also stubborn, hates debates and to be proven wrong, it's one of the reasons I'm reluctant.

Since it's not harmful, is it really useful to try and convince her? Or at least my dad, he's less stubborn... It sounds like I'm just trying to be right and prove my parents wrong, like a rebellious teen ""my parents are so dumb gngngn"". But it's not, it's actually bothering me.",16Jun2019,1

438,"My bff (24M) and I (24F) met when we were 11, and became best friends starting when we were 12. He’s honestly been a total lifesaver, coming into my life at a time where I had literally no friends. We’ve always been there for each other through thick and thin, even in times where we didn’t live in the same city (a cumulative 6yrs of our 12yr friendship). 

I really want to stave off “jealousy” claims before
I get into this. I’ve been in a relationship for 3yrs, we own a home and 4 pets together. He’s pretty much family at this point - he’s even invited to my mom’s 50th this weekend. We’re as platonic as can be, and got over the “is this my best friend or do I “like like” them” moment when we were 14. Noooo thank you. 

Anyways, back to it. Bff is what I would call a “serial monogamist”. He’s so agreeable, that he’ll put up with just about anything in a relationship. His last one lasted 4yrs, and he was happy with it for about half of that time. That one ended in March. The one before that was 3yrs, and ended a month before the last one started. Guy loves to date. This one is different. 

A girl I knew in high school messaged him admitting that she’s always had a crush on him. Despite my best efforts (I knew the girl in high school, I’ve been there for her doing some unsavory stuff), he went out with her, and they apparently instantly fell in love. Now, bff is not an emotional guy *at all*. We were honestly considering whether or not he’s aromantic. But after maybe a week or so, they started exchanging “I love you”s and talking about marrying in a year or two. 

It’s been a month since they’ve known each other/been dating, and it’s definitely taken a toll on our friendship. She lives in the same city as me, so when he’s here, we don’t hang out. When we talk, it’s all about her. Seriously, every single conversation meets its death a few lines in with “oh, that reminds me of a funny thing xxxx said!”. The guy never wanted to get married, and suddenly he wants to marry someone he doesn’t actually know that well. 

Now, I will admit, I’m biased. I briefly ran in the same circle as this girl in high school, and I *do not* like what I saw. I’m talking seeing her give a BJ to a guy in a crowded kitchen at a party. Then, she got married, went suuuper Christian, got a divorce, and then caught a felony for weed. I’m sure she is a really nice person (bff wouldn’t be interested in her otherwise), but I’m really skeptical of someone who can swing one way and back so quickly and often. Coupled with the fact that he’s now blowing me off when he’s never done that? It’s just weird. 

I get that I really need to get over it. I have no say, and if I want to keep the friendship (duh, that’s my best friend), I have to be supportive. But honestly? I think he’s rushing into something because she’s the first “exciting” girl he’s ever been with. The last two were serious glasses of milk. I’m talking “blank sheet of paper” level of interesting. But I’d like some sliver of my best friend back - preferably a portion that wants to talk about something other than this girl, and stays at my house maybe 1/5 of the time he’s in town. Seriously, he rescinded his offer for me to stay at his place after my mom’s birthday party (taking place at a bar less than a mile from his house, and he’s coming) instead of sharing a hotel room with my parents because he’ll be seeing this girl for the first time in like 3 days and can’t keep it together for one night. 

So how do I get past this? Give me things to be mindful of so I can just get through this honeymoon phase and not tell him off. Our relationship is *far* from codependent, so it should be easy for me to get over, but I honestly feel like I’ve just lost my childhood friend to a divorced felon in a literal instant. Maybe it’s because it happened so fast; one day he was single, the literal next he “found his soulmate” and is head over heels. How do I handle this?",16Jun2019,2

I said I wouldn't like to rule it out completely in the future but I don't see it happening in the next few months and for him to move on if he liked and see other women. He replied that he is still in love with me and doesn't want to be with anyone else at the moment. I'm in no way ready for another relationship as one of the reasons I split from him was to work on myself and to be my own person but in the last few days someone I used to date started messaging me and we get along good and obviously I'm attracted to him but he's just a bit full on considering I don't want a relationship and we've only met properly about 3 times (including the dates years ago).

451," My fiance and I have been together for 8 years. He's always played video games day in and day out. He still goes to work, pays his bills, and takes care of himself so he doesn't believe he has a problem and is unwilling to change. When I bring up that I think he has a gaming problem, he flips it on me and turns it into ""well you sleep too much."" 
 Well, I sleep so much because I'm incredibly depressed and don't have anyone to hangout with because he's stuck on his computer with his noise cancelling headphones on. He says he's depressed too and that gaming helps provide an escape.
  I try to tell him I want to spend more time together and he says ""well what do you want to do?"" We don't have a lot of money and he doesn't like to hangout outside. So more often than not, I suggest watching a movie. He says this is boring and he doesn't enjoy it. I love him with all my heart but he's not the same man he was when I first met him. 
 He's in a miserable job that he hates so this causes stress as well. I've even told him he can straight up quit his job and I'll support us till he finds something else just so he can quit being so unhappy.

Touches me, says flirty things, compliments me but then I was looking at my gym's instagram and the tagged section, it liked to a video of him doing deadlifts and saw his profile. Pictures of him and his fiance everywhere.

Obviously, I cut off communication and avoid them. But is there something I do that is inviting these guys? Single guys never seem to approach me. It's such a weird issue I keep having.",16Jun2019,1

I hope you can give an advice on how to approach a guy or how can I impress them. Or how can I let them know I like to do these type of thing, or where to find boys, who likes these things.

458,"A friend of mine went through a breakup a few months ago, and I don’t know how to help him. 

Anytime we talk, a lot of the time it is about his ex and how much he misses her and all that, and it breaks my heart to see him so hurt. 

I really want to help him, but at the same time, I’m feeling emotionally drained with trying to help him or listen to him because it’s the same thing over and over and it seems like he isn’t even trying to help himself and I don’t know what to say to him anymore.

The time went by and it was around 10 pm when I called someone to pick me up and drop W at home. While we waited, me and W went to this house that is gonna be their apartment at the park they work in.

Since we were alone we decided to do some NSFW stuff. A few minutes passed and we hear his mother coming in the house (the entrance is right in front of the bedroom and the door was open). I quickly stand up and cover my half naked body while he pulls his shorts up. Needless to say that even if she didn't see anything, she clearly understood what was going on.

She just said that she needed a blanket for a costumer (now that I think about it, it kinda sounded like she was explaining why she had to interrupt us). Then she went to the closet and left without going to the bedroom. We didn't do anything else, since I couldn't even think clearly, my body was shaking and I just felt like crying.

W tried to comfort me and said that we are not underage anymore and that it is a normal thing, besides we were just basically doing oral and handjobs since we didn't have a condom.

The thing is, she didn't say anything about it, but I know she will and I don't know if I have the courage to face her.  I don't even know what to think anymore, any advice on how to deal with this?",16Jun2019,3
461,"I guys If anyone can give me some suggestions in how I should approach my scenario please drop me a comment!

I've been with my girlfriend now for roughly 2 years. We both in the same workplace, and pretty much lived together for 8 months while we worked in the same place. Throughout this time I was a very depressed person, not by nature per say but from my environment. I would spend most days working in a very toxic, cancerous environment where everyone was talking behind each others backs. Evidently from my sadness and anger I ended up falling out with 80% of the staff who worked there. After work I would come back to the house that I was renting from the organisation, where I lived under the same roof as some of the toxic people. So as you can tell work played a large role in environmentally making me depressed.

While working in the organisation for two years, I was very lonely outside work. All my good friends had moved to uni so there wasn't anyone for me to socialise with, meaning most nights I would spend in my room, on my own playing games. The only person I had was my girlfriend. It is important to note, my GF has a very healthy social life. She regularly sees her friends, goes out on weekends and meets after work. So whatever time she wasn't with there friends, she was with me. Throughout the year she really did help me, taking some of that loneliness away. One negative that did come with it was the jealousy, and the doubt. Seeing her with her friends on social media really upset me. I really did believe she should have left me, to find someone more social and happy. But of course she didn't agree. The cutting point for me was a year into the shit reunite of waking up, going to the toxic work place, coming home to the toxic people I worked with, and staying in my room, either seeing no one or my girlfriend. This really did take a toll on me, most nights I'd find my self crying in bed and towards the end of my contract I did contemplate killing myself. Certainly not a highlight of my life.

At the end of my contract I moved to Uni. I did this because I am a very social person. I love meeting new people and going out but because of the rural place that I live in, there aren't many ways to meet new people, meaning the only time I go out to see other is when my friends are back, and that isn't often at all. Once I was in uni, I found friends I consider friends for life, had great fun and just had the change of living in a city. My GF would come down every so often, and I would go up to see her too. Because I used to rent out the house, I had to move out upon leaving work, meaning I moved in with my Grandparents (no where else to go within reason). My grandparents are the only family members I actually see and communicate to regularly, and even then it's only once a month. So you can get a idea of how close I am to my family and parents (this part is important soon). 

While back from uni on breaks, I would come back to see my partner. We went out, got food, went shopping, much more than what we used to do together when we were working together the past year. This was deffo an improvement to both our relationship and each other. But, this wouldn't last forever. She regularly complained that all I ever spoke about was wanting to go back to uni. I hadn't even noticed, but it does make sense as that was where my life was. When back early this year, I had noticed sex wasn't as frequent, she seemed bored and generally not affectionate towards me. i had let this go for two months until I confronted her one night. She said that she was getting tired as we don't do what couples do. By that she meant that I would never go out with her on nights out like her friends' boyfriends would do. This was difficult as I have nothing In common with both her friends and her friends' boyfriends so this worried me a little. I decided that the best way to deal with this was to just go out, see new places with her, and up until this point It's worked. 

It's now the end of the year and I'm back up in the town where I used to work, living with my grandparents. I'ts five days in and I'm feeling the cabin fever. My partner has been busy with a few social events and her hobbies over the past five days, and if I did travel to see her, I wouldn't get to see her much meaning I'd be on my own anyway. I'm rolling back into this reunite of staying in my room, playing games and doing nothing. to make it worse I did night shifts where I stay up for hours, and it really does ruin my sleeping patterns for weeks to come. this means I'm spending more time in my head, over thinking things and I really do feel like I'm slipping back into this god awful depression. I've tried keeping my self active, going for runs, going to the shop and such but the lack of social contact really does break me. To make it worse I have agreed to go back to work in the place that I previously worked, only doing so because I know I am a much happier person now so It should be easier. I am very much nervous about it, and the fact that it's five days in with no social contact means I'm really worried for the next three months of being here, and how it will effect my relationship once again.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, can anyone suggest how I can deal with the guilt and depression of not being good enough for my girlfriend, and not being what she needs? That is the only thing a care about, as it's the only thing I have.

Sorry about the length, I've pretty much summarised the last two years there.

So to give a little background:
I am a 20 year old (f) community college student in the U.S. living with her parents - very strict, extremely conservative, long story - and I am trying to research ways to go abroad that are;
1) not expensive 
2) don’t require any special skills (besides the fact that I speak both English and Spanish and will graduate with an AA in English as well as me being pretty good at culinary arts since I will be pursuing that in the future)
3) and give me a good reason to leave the house, let alone leave the country.

I am thinking of taking a gap year immediately after graduating from community college (I already took one to work in my hometown and for mental health issues right after high school) and before enrolling into culinary school. 

Are there any other options for going out of country besides being an Au Pair (I’m good with kids) or WOOFing??",16Jun2019,1

I have went to the doctor to get a diagnosis but they did this test on me where they see if I have Acid reflux but nothing, they found nothing. The reason I keep throwing up is because I’m nervous and the only way to not feel nervous is to throw up. 
So my body is accustomed to throwing up each time I get nervous. I don’t know how to stop being nervous. I’ve been to a therapist, I’ve done everything.

471,"Here’s the thing. Being jacked, and good at fighting aren’t things that I desire. Both are preferable to being skinny and weak, and I’d of course choose to have muscles if I could do so with the click of my fingers, but they’re not something I fantasise about having. Going to the gym isn’t a pleasant experience for me, and neither are boxing classes. Where as others actually enjoy working out and fighting, I see them as a means to and ends.

My only toxic motivation for pursing bodybuilding and self defence classes is a sense of sort of duty? A burden on my shoulders, more like. I know that there are many people in this world who could and would hurt me or my girlfriend. I feel actually uncomfortable around big guys, as I know they can, and may well desire to assault or even murder me or the people I love. It’s become an increasing obsession. Sometimes I imagine situations where other men challenge me to fight, and then taunting me for backing down because I’d obviously get my face punched in. Thinking of these situations where I’m powerless give me actual anxiety.

Even if I get bigger and am able to put up a fight, I have this feeling that it will never be good enough, because there will always be this guy who’s built like a tank, where I’d be defenceless against anything he’d throw at me.

I’d like to workout and learn self defence because of a desire to be healthy, able bodied and able to protect people, but this obsession and anxiety is driving me actually insane.",16Jun2019,1

473,"I  [24F] had about 11 years of suspicion of this. It was essentially confirmed a couple weeks ago because my mom told me cops once (11 years ago) came to the house and said my dad picked up and raped an underage girl. She told me because my dad was losing his shit since I was moving out. He never went to jail so I don’t know if she just  covered for him or what. 

I don’t feel comfortable asking my mom for more details and I rarely see her when he’s not around. It’s clear she wasn’t supposed to tell me, so I’m worried he’d hurt her if he knew she told me.

So then, I also can’t tell him I know and that I can’t see him the same way. Which I would like to do but can’t for my moms safety.

I don’t respect my dad. I know he’s cheated on my mom in the past and when my mom told me the news with the cops, she also told me he’s been lying about his military rank as “something happened” and they took him down one. This makes sense because he was a high rank when I was a kid and then he kind of suddenly retired and we moved across the country.

I don’t know how to process this. My therapist is away or busy, idk it’s through a government funded LA county service, and I don’t have an appointment until July. I want to go in for a drop in appointment but idk if they do weekends and I don’t want to call out of my internship since it’s on a strict schedule.

477,"A little backstory: 
I’m a 21 year old college student. I took a semester off for my mental health and got a job. I found a job at a restaurant that I really liked. I walked out of it yesterday though and I feel like I’m back at the bottom all of the sudden. 

I was a hostess, and as soon as I got there it was packed. We went on a wait almost immediately, which is normal for Saturday’s. About two hours in I “pinged” a guest (texted him that his table was ready) and he didn’t come back to my stand. When this happens, we call out the name a couple times then move on. He was still on the list, but I just start seating people behind him to keep the flow going. 

He comes in about 10 minutes after I pinged him. He started aggressively asking when his turn was, I asked for his name, and said “oh you were already notified” after I saw who it was. That set him off. He started talking down to me saying “I didn’t hear you say my name” and I explained to him that I texted him. He started saying “that’s my home phone I DIDNT GET THE TEXT” and was starting to go back and forth with me. 

At that point I kinda just broke. I confronted the guest. I went on an embarrassing rant about how I’m not a dog and told him to go fuck himself and walked out. 

I’m a hard worker, I don’t cause issues where I work. I do my job and am usually really good at keeping my cool with guests. I feel low. I feel embarrassed. I don’t think I did a good thing, I just feel like shit. I need people to be real with me and tell me if I’ve lost it I guess. Am I out of control?",16Jun2019,2

479,"Hi Reddit. Over the last year, I have developed a close friendship with this girl, that quickly got to a level where we went on weekend trips and supported each other through major changes and events. I had been told early on that I was friend-zoned and the relationship has stayed purely platonic. As things progressed, I started to have some reasonable doubts that she may have been developing some interest. I have personally loved the person a great deal but have not had a lot of attraction. I have historically needed a physical and romantic component to my interactions (as well as a feeling that the other party is interested) for that to develop, and I was willing to push things in that direction given the compatibility I was seeing. I think I would have gotten there.

&amp;#x200B;

To set things straight, I asked her if things had changed. She admitted that the needle had moved as a result of circumstances (bad dating life) but that her priority was to preserve the friendship and that she did not want anything more than what we had. Then, a few days later, she wrote that she let me down easy, has zero interest and acted confusingly out of a fear that \*I\* was developing something - and yet a few days later, she cancelled the plans we had for the summer and requested space. I do not know why she had such a strong reaction - she has declined to explain why she needed some distance, and there is no obvious interpretation that can be drawn from the limited information that I have.

&amp;#x200B;

I respected the request and we did not have contact over the last 3-4 weeks, until she sent me especially cold birthday wishes over FB a few days ago. I told her then that I found it difficult to lose daily contact suddenly without having a sense of what went down and that I'd like to get a better understanding of the fallout and of where she sees things going. She told me that she was uncomfortable that I was holding her to expectations for a SO rather than a friend and that needing space is a normal thing - again declining to give me information. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since breaking contact, I find myself obsessing about finding an interpretation that makes sense. I badly want to know what upset her to that level, I want to know if I have acted unreasonably, and I want to know if she still wants to be friends at all. On the rational level, there is no way for me to know any of that if she is unwilling to tell me - she does not owe me any explanation. For my own sake, I need to let go and am unsure why I require immediate clarity. I realize that the month scale may be a bit fresh and that dust needs to settle on both sides. I'm not exactly sitting around and moping, but it's affected my focus in certain activities and I hate that I let it get to me that deeply. I feel so damn immature about it. I'd like to get your advice and hard truths about accepting that I do not get to understand what happened.",16Jun2019,2
480,"After few years of lurking on reddit, I have finally decided on writing a post . I can be very shy, especially on the internet, and I do not enjoy being active on social medias but I believe I need help to move on.

A little of backstory here, I am a Korean American who is now 21 years old. My mother has left us for good when I was in high school and I have been living with my father afterwards. I have been living in South Korea for about 2 years now because I served for South Korean military in order to get dual citizenship. I decided to leave home after I got discharged because my father would not stop being abusive. Now I make my own living in Seoul. I found a decent job and have a place to stay and all but the future is what is worrying me at the moment.

I am supposed to go back to US this August to continue my Chemical Engineering major in an university but I have requested for another gap year since I cannot afford the tuition fee and I was not even sure if this was right for me either. I enjoy studying the course but I just cannot imagine myself as an engineer and I do not think I am good at it as well.

So as I have been living on my own, I started pursuing my old passion which is music and arts. Since I was a child, I have been wanting to study music and arts all the time but my father has always told me to study something that gets me money and I just had to follow, given our financial background and such. He is not wrong but there is just something I can not let go. Up until now I still want to learn more about it. It is the one that makes me happy and feel alive and I really want to study or experience more on these areas professionally since I have no education on the fields whatsoever. But I just don't know where I can start.

Basically, I need some advice on how I should start my life over. I have a lot of options going on my head currently but I do not know what would be the best option for me. These are the main options for now:

1. Go back to my old university and continue studying
2. Find another university where I can study music and art
3. Continue working in Korea and find another way of living

I am currently thinking of studying in Europe or other Asian countries where it would cost less and I could afford my living while studying, but at the same time I am not sure if I can get into those places with no educational background of the fields and I have heard people saying that going to university is not worth it anymore, especially in terms of art and music.

It’s starting to become a messy separation and as she is the main bread winner to the family he’s refusing to sign divorce papers until she promises to pay his 472$ car payment a month. The loan is in her name with him as a consigner. She already pays all the bills and loans in her name taken out for him. She called the dealership and they told her they would only take her name off if they refinanced it in his name which he will refuse to do. What can she do if anything to keep from paying for the car.,16Jun2019,2
492,"This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons. I really, really need advice.

&amp;#x200B;

The title pretty much says it all, but I don't know what to do next and I need some advice. So for context, I'm 20 years old and just about to go into my third year of college. I started seeing a therapist for panic and depression when I was in high school following a traumatic marijuana experience which caused a psychotic reaction: I was having out of body experiences, hallucinating, etc. I always assumed I had gotten a batch that was laced, but my friend who smoked from the same batch says that's impossible. After this, I started experiencing panic attacks, depression and frequent, terrifying episodes of dissociation/depersonalization. These symptoms were never really constant, but always sort of came and went.

&amp;#x200B;

So I went on Prozac for a year and a half, until I went away to college and I pretty much felt like I didn't need them anymore. I weened myself off successfully, and had no problems for a few months. Then my girlfriend of several years left me for another guy, and I was so devastated that I decided to go back to therapy. This time, I started seeing an old school psychoanalyst (neo-Freudian). It absolutely changed my life for the better, not just symptom-wise but overall. I still experienced symptoms of anxiety, depression and some depersonalization, but my psychoanalyst didn't look at them as ""illnesses,"" rather as reactions to things going on in my life. He was very skeptical of psychiatry, and though he acknowledged it was helpful to some people, he preferred to dig deeper and figure out why the symptoms were there and what is happening that would cause my brain to react that way.

&amp;#x200B;

But the sessions were too expensive, so I had to stop seeing him. It broke my heart, as the two of us had grown very close, and he was the first person I had ever opened myself up to so much. He made me feel that the things I was experiencing weren't ""crazy"" or a ""disease,"" but are a rational psychological reaction to a number of things that have happened through my life.

&amp;#x200B;

So this brings me to today. For money reasons, I've been going to my university's clinic where PhD students who need field experience provide one-on-one therapy sessions for a drastically reduced fee ($20 a session). I've been seeing this one PhD student as my therapist for two or three months now, and after describing my symptoms to him (some of which have bubbled up again pretty strongly after being dormant for a while), he told me last session that both him and his supervisor think that I might be in the Prodromal Stage of schizophrenia (Note: all of our sessions are filmed and reviewed by a licensed, fully-certified psychologist who works with the PhD student in order to give him feedback). His supervisor is the one who voiced concern, but I don't know how much of that is based on what he himself said, given that he isn't as experienced as a fully licensed clinician.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the conflict: they ""strongly recommended"" that I go to this First-Episode Psychosis Clinic nearby and get myself evaluated. However, I'm torn between believing my previous psychologist who said that all of my symptoms are a normal reaction to life events and must be analyzed and understood, and believing what the people at the clinic might/might not say. I'm afraid they'll try to push medications on me, and I'm terrified that they'll tell me I have something I might not actually have, and that this will create more problems than I originally had to begin with. 

&amp;#x200B;

I found a psychoanalyst who is close by who accepts my insurance, so I'm torn between leaving the therapist I have now and seeing what he would say. But I'm not sure how long it would take to get an appointment/how long it would take for him to reach a sufficient ""diagnosis."" Additionally, what if my psychoanalyst (who changed my life) was wrong and I really am in danger of developing a psychotic disorder? What if I'm fine and I just need a psychoanalyst to talk to?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm seeing my therapist again on Thursday, where he'll convene with his supervisor and they'll call the clinic with me to give me a referral to make sure I can get a quicker appointment. But I don't know yet if I would go.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Therapist is worried I might be in early stage of schizophrenia. Should I trust my old psychologist who said I was fine but misunderstood, or trust my new psychologist who says I'm at risk and need to be evaluated by a professional.",16Jun2019,1

495,"Backstory: My friend a few months ago came out gay to me and confessed his love for me and I’m straight and tried to let him down as best as I could, but it still hurt to see his heartbreak. I’m in high school and a bit of an asshole, and for some reason I thought it was funny to throw around my sexuality a lot with little snippets of calling other men attractive and saying stereotypical (false) homosexual things. I blame myself for this because later he explained how much hope I gave him, but I was just goofing around. He got really sad after the heart break and moved to drinking(still in high school btw). He talked about his drinking to me and I just thought it was typical high school stuff. He started getting really drunk every night online and all I did was tell him I disapproved, but I didn’t do anything to stop him. One night he got really drunk in-front of are friends online (his drinking was a secret) and I was pissed he was still doing it so I left. Long story short he had a mental break down online and he was going to kill himself and I drove over to stop him and stayed until his parents got home. I was a little shook up by this and it really took a toll on my mental stability.  As time went on he kept drinking and got more unstable and I tried my best to keep him alive at the cost of my sanity. I ended up doing some stuff I wasn’t proud of and sought help and got therapy. He ended up getting anti depressants later and drinks less. Happy ending right? I’m still trying to get past everything but I took a huge hit he got really drunk and he blamed me for why he is depressed and why he can’t have love or happinesses I do feel responsible for this and I should have done something sooner and maybe it wouldn’t have escalated this far. I’ve never cried so much in my life and what made it worse his parents gave him the alcohol(where I live this is legal if parent supplies). He doesn’t remember anything he said and is incredibly sensitive and I didn’t want him to know because I didn’t think he could handle it. However, he hurt a lot of people and me the most. I’ve keep a journal of my thoughts his actions and my atrocities I committed. I decided that I wanted him to know what happens when he drinks and how much people have helped him and how cruel he has been. I made a plan that after graduating I would print out the 12 pages of hell and let him read as much as he wants if it’s too much for him. (I’m in the process of joining the military) then afterwards make sure he still knows that he will forever and always be my brother and leave for the military. I’ve thought about it for awhile and realized how much of a coward I am. I would create a train wreck for my friends to deal with and leave for four years. I realized that he gave me a train wreck and it crippled me along with others. I don’t want other people to get hurt. I really don’t want to tell him. I’ve already hurt his heart enough, but if I don’t say anything he could continue he drunken rage. I tell myself that he deserves to know so he can be a better person, but I don’t want to be the reason why he breaks again. 

Time limit: My friends don’t know about me joining the military and I have no plans to tell them. I’ve only mentioned that I plan on “traveling” but I will say goodbye. So I have less than a year to tell him.

The question: How do you tell a depressed, extremely sensitive, potentially suicidal person that their drinking has hurt too many people around them. I have less than a year (~10 months)to tell him the truth and I’m anxious about the possible repercussions.  

Side note: I appreciate any and all advice, but I’m very skeptical of pretty much anything. I don’t want to fuck this up when he just starting to get better and it could cause him to spiral all the way down and potentially take his life.

My sisters and I have had to work for everything, no help from our family or friends. We also go to school full time and work, we obey the strict rules of the house and try to be as cleanly and respectful as we can. Meanwhile, his daughters are rude, deceiving and spoiled rotten. Whenever we do accomplish something it’s almost brushed aside and his daughter’s accomplishments always trump our own. My stepdad also has an alcohol issue, however he’d never admit it. 

My sister overheard my mother and stepfather talking poorly about us. About how we’re hypocritical, manipulative, rude and so on. My mother always sides with him and rarely sticks up for us.
Last year he was being extremely abusive towards us. He was yelling at my younger sister and she was sobbing and being the older sibling, I need to fight for them. I pointed out how irrational he was being and he threatened to “kick my fucking ass”. My mom was there and heard it, she said nothing and blamed me for being hysterical.
I’ve tried so hard to be civil, as my sisters and I already don’t have a relationship with our biological father. However, the fact that my mother always agrees with him while he badmouths us is so heartbreaking. I don’t know what to do or who to confide in, please help me.

501,"Alright so for some context, I have an office job at a place I have been working at for about 2 months. I haven’t called in sick before but I do have a day off this week that has been booked off and approved from a while. According the the contract, we get 2 unpaid personal leave days per year. The place is pretty stingy with getting time off even if you want it unpaid.

So knowing that I already have a day off this week, it seems unlikely they would accommodate another day off so I can go to the parade. I absolutely have to go to this parade (it’s tomorrow at 10am).

If I say I’m sick, they technically cannot question it unless I’m sick for 5 days in a row so that would be a surefire way of getting the day off. However, they would definitely know I took it off for the parade as they know I’m a huge fan.

If I do tell them the truth, there’s a chance they might still say no or they might say yes and I wouldn’t look like an asshole for lying.

In terms of how long I see myself being here.. maybe 6 months to a year? It’s a good job for sure but this is a once in a lifetime thing and I would regret it so much if I didn’t go.

Hello everyone! My boyfriend and I are in a Long Distance Relationship. English is not my native language and I am having difficulties as of the moment to kind of construct the things I want to say to him in words cause the languages I speak are kind of mixing up in my mind😥

And it kinda sucks because I’m not that good in words. I’m more into “action” when I want to comfort someone...like hug them or take them somewhere fun kind of thing :( Because we’re in an LDR, we rely mostly on texts and such.

505,"Right now, I don't have any relationships outside of my family members, but I think that's a good thing for now. I feel like I need to learn to be happy on my own before bringing others into my life, especially considering my past. Which brings me onto what this post is about.

Whenever I get close with someone, when we have a really good thing going, I start to get this uncomfortable feeling that makes me push them away and/or completely alienate myself from them. Afterwards, I always regret it. Over the years, I've lost touch with so many friends, over the internet and in real life, because of this. My very small contacts list is evidence of this. That was a joke but its also true, lol.

I'm think I even know why I do this. Years ago, a traumatic event (that I'd rather not share) took place and it caused a lot of change, I moved and switched schools a couple of times. First being forced to let go of friends I'd grown up with, then new friends I made, until I started ending the friendships myself.

I'm going to be in a position soon to be making friends again, I've learnt that I'd be interested in, for the first time in my life, being involved in a romantic relationship.

I don't want to self-destruct anymore and ruin what I might have in the future, whatever kind of relationship I might have.

I hope this wasn't too melodramatic, this is just the first time I've opened up about this and I wanna be really blunt and honest so that I can get the right advice.

509," I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls who were there a few hours (only 2 of them are involved here) later in the night near closing it was quiet and the blonde girl skipped up stairs to the toilet kept looking back at me giggling looking back down the stairs at me , a while later I walked around the corner to where they were sitting and that blonde girl was looking at me and I didn’t look away for a few seconds and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say to her brunette friend 'that lad just been staring at me' in an excited whisper way. (They were the only people left in the pub before closing)

another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‘excuse me....excuse me’ and then asked me ‘how do you get a job in here’ and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‘yea we don’t know her that well’ and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ then the brunette said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know...’ and then I juts nodded and she grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you’ quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away.

510,"Ok so I've been feeling kind of bad for a while now, I think it's depression. I'd been feeling like this for a few years in high school. I hoped this would go away after graduating and going to uni.

Firstly I didn't make the selection of the study I originally wanted to do, so I picked another study, that I thought would be a lot of fun as well. After a while of adjusting to this new life, I was kind of feeling better (the bad feeling never fully went away, but it got a bit better). I liked most of my courses and was having a good time. Slowly but steadily I started feeling worse again. I'm now almost at the end of my year, with only a few more weeks to go, and I pretty much haven't felt worse. I don't really enjoy my study anymore, and think of dropping out. I can still get the minimum required amount of points to go to the next year, but I don't know if I have the motivation or energy to study for it anymore. I just feel so lost. 

I have pretty nice friends here, and I don't really want tot 'leave them behind'. I'm generally kind of happy when I'm with them. But at the same time I feel like I'm so expendable in my friend group and they wouldn't care that much if I dropped out.

I've just been feeling so bad lately: I don't have motivation or energy to do anything, I feel empty all the time, I don't really like anything anymore, I can barely get an organized thought through my head, I feel like I'm not alive or 'not here' half the time. I've aldo been pretty much on autopilot for a while now. I think it's depression but I'm too scared to reach out. I just don't know what to do anymore

I've been thinking about just taking a gap year, to work on my mental health, focus on hobbies (even though I pretty much have non atm), get to know myself better and travelling. After this I might go back to uni, or not if something better comes up my path. However, this feels like I'm pretty much starting my life 2 year later than everyone, and maybe it won't change anything. I'm worried that I won't want to go back to uni and have some bad job for the rest of my life and fuck up my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know who I am anymore. I don't know if I ever really did. I don't mean I haven't found my place in life or I feel like I'm not making anything of myself or any of that stuff you hear people say. Not that that's not a real issue for some people. It's just not what I'm talking about.

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel like I'm not a person at all. I feel like I've been pretending for so long that all that's left is this thing that I think people expect me to be. I've been pretending everything is fine. Pretending I'm like everyone else. Pretending I don't care. Pretending that it's not just pretending. I don't want to pretend anymore. I just don't know how to stop. I don't know how to be somebody that's not just a walking mannequin that doesn't feel anything real.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always been obsessed with escapism. I've spent my entire life immersing myself into other worlds and stories. Trying to be somebody else. To be anybody at all. I spent most of my childhood and teenage years in video games or books or movies. Anything I could get my hands on really. I always felt like I could connect more with the people in those stories more than anyone in real life. I still spend a lot of my time escaping. Mostly in movies and video games these days. I spend a lot of time wishing I could be in any of those stories. I think now after writing this out I use stories to avoid being a person on my own. It's easier to put myself in the shoes of someone else for awhile than it is to think about this stuff I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

Most of the time everything is fine. I really don't hate my life. I have great friends. A great, albeit old fashioned, family. A job I don't hate going to every day. Sure there have been bad times but I can't say I've had it any rougher than anyone else. I know I should be grateful for what I have. I know a lot of people have a lot less. And I am grateful. That doesn't stop me from wanting to walk away from everything when I'm laying awake at night though. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to leave. I want to get in the car and start driving. I want to get away from the pretending and the lies I tell everyone all the time. I want to start over. I want to be somebody else. I want to be *somebody*. Anybody. I want something to live for. I want to feel like I'm doing something that matters. I don't know that I can ever find that here. I don't know what I'm looking for either though. I don't even know why I'm so driven to leave at all. I just know that I do want to go.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't go though. I can't go and it's tearing me apart. I love the people in my life. I really, really do. I wouldn't be here without them. I'd die for most of them, but for the past few years all I've been able to think about is wanting to abandon them for some stupid soul searching journey. I don't know how much longer I can keep going like this.

Like I said, this got ramble-y. Told you. I know this is probably hard to follow. I just kind of threw a bunch of words at my keyboard and this is what wound up here. I feel like I haven't really gotten my feelings across right, but I'm hoping you can sift through this and kind of get an idea. I'm sorry If I didn't make much sense. You're probably wondering what I want advice one at this point. To be honest I don't really know. Maybe really I just wanted to get this off my chest and this felt like as good a place as any. I guess I just want to know if anyone else has felt this way and what you did about it. I want to know what I'm supposed to do now.",16Jun2019,3

519,"Hey all, it's been a rough week. 

A bit of backstory. I'm a 22m in Toronto, just finished undergrad and about to start my masters in Aero Eng. Everything I've accomplished (in my opinion) has been a result of hard work and putting my nose to the stone. That isn't to say I've had a hard life but to deal with the people around me and to keep pushing forward, it's taken a toll on me mentally. I've always been a leader to my friends and groups. Seldom do I have to worry about how I feel since I've had a grasp on my thoughts and emotions. 

So last week, my girlfriend of close to 4 years broke up  with me. To be honest, it was sort of meant to end that way. She changed from the time I first met her to now. Her priorities moved and I was no longer one of them. I can't blame her though, I've had a stressful couple of years with school and work. The worst part of the entire breakup was that I had a lot invested in the relationship personally and to lose that part of me was like losing myself. Slowly over the last week I've been able to accept what had happened and move on. I guess this is my first question. I've began to start looking at going to clubs and bars. Two things that I've never done in my life because those venues never interested me. The experience was okay but **am I lying to myself and trying to face what's going on by doing this?** I prefer to stay in to play games or go fishing and hunting but it was always with my SO. I've talked to friends but it's really hard for them to sympathize cause they haven't had a relationship like this. She was a massive part of my life and I've been bad at dealing with emotions like this. 

And now we move to  yesterday. My parents decided to file their divorce papers. Again, it's something that I know would eventually happen. They weren't happy together, the slightest thing said wrong would cause an argument, and it made the house atmosphere so tense. I know that in the future for them to be stress free and not be so high strung, it would be for the best. But it still really hurts to see them sit me down and watch them argue for the last time and have them both ask me what do I feel. I had told them that for them to be happy and healthy, it would be best for them to divorce. I feel like I made a mistake doing this but really, they don't talk to each other, everything becomes a pissing match, and I know deep down, they don't care enough for each other to keep this going. I also know that they stayed together all these years so that my siblings and I can grow in a household with both parents. I'm just kind of in a state of shock now that I won't be able to come home to see both of them. I'll have to visit a parent from time to time.  **Did I make the wrong move to recommend them to divorce?** It seemed like the thought was already on their mind but I feel like I fucked up big time. 

Thanks all for reading. I have a lot of mixed emotions and thoughts from this past week. Life is hard right now and I don't know if I can actually keep pushing myself. It feels like the moment I get myself going again something has to come by with a bat and beat me back down. **What would you do? What should I do to relax my mind?** I'm really lost and afraid of the next day. Everyday has become scary for me to face to a point I don't want to get out of bed anymore (and I used to be a up at 6am guy).

My parents kicked me out of the house about a year ago. I live with my grandmother now.

I didn’t want to tell his parents the whole story. So, I said I was living with my grandmother for the summer (technically not a lie). But now, since he’s coming to stay with me in the fall, I think he deserves to know the whole truth.

522,"There is the back story to that . She ended up blocking me out her life for a few months and in February/March time she unblocked me and started talking . She broke up with her rebound for me and things were going alright . Until recently where I don’t know where I stand with her. One moment she tells me she likes me and we sleep together and do other sexual stuff and the next we are ‘just friends’ 

I’m really confused as what to do . Recently I’ve been treating her different just to ‘experiment’ what she would do and honestly she hasn’t really noticed until I mention it to her .

I’ve also wanted to look out for myself so I’ve been talking to another girl that honestly I’m not into but she is really pretty . This new girl has offered and is willing to have sex with me and do other stuff but without a relationship so it’s basically fronds with benefits.

I’ve got no intention of getting in another relationship and will continue to wait for this one girl but to look out for me should I agree to sleep with another girl ? Personally I’m 50/50 on it , i wouldn’t mind trying out with other people to see if this one girl (the main one , let’s call her Jessica) is the right one for me but then the other half thinks I would be cheating on her and if feel really bad.

We were best friends for 7 years before we started dating and everything was great. We argued here and there but we worked out all the kinks in our relationship as we grew together and we were in a steady boat. Last night my boyfriend confided in me and told me he had been thinking bi-curiously. We’ve talked about this before and his family used to tease him about being gay his whole life for the way he looked and what he liked so it’s been an on going mental battle for him. I’m not mad and for being his first girlfriend,,, i don’t blame him really for thinking. However he also told me after a party we had a few days before graduation- he had cheated on me with a mutual guy friend. This is the first time he’s ever shown true interest in a guy and the first time he was physical with one.. i love him with all my heart i really do. We planned on moving to the same city-diff schools- and starting off our adult lives together. I understand it’s very naive of me to think that at such an age and just beginning but we were best friends. Basically i need advice working through this. I’ve been through a lot in my past also so it makes this extremely tough to overcome, I’ve been cheated on and used in a past relationship, i lost my father and i currently don’t have a real immediate family.

526,"I had an idea to isolate myself from friends, school and family for 6 months. I wanted to know myself, to explore my inner world. But it was not all sunshine and happy things. It started off well, but 4 months in and I experience horrible things, I sank deep into existensial nihilism, despair and anguish. 

I felt hopeless for the future of my life, of humanity, I experienced harsh emotions that I repressed for years. I had extremely hateful towards my existence and humanity and animalistic primal  thoughts, that I am ashamed of. I always thought I was a good person but now I feel like I cannot shake those thoughts off, the nihilism... the destructive energy, the hate towards myself and others. I lost my faith in god, I was agnostic but after examination of my life and all my loved ones I lost. 

My aunt for example raised me, she was a perfect Christian, she suffered for 5 years of terminal cancer, she was in so much pain, I could not bare visit her the last year of her life, she died and I did not visit her. How can a god allow this... what is thr point of our short time alive if there is no god... no afterlife to reunite with our mother, father, sister....

I feel like we have no control of ourselves, let alone our lives. I felt it, I felt the programming of our body. How we are wired to do things that we cannot control conciously. I keep digging and digging, I cannot find out who I am, I had a mental breakdown and it left me with permanent tinnitus.

After those 6 months I began to sink deeper and deeper, I could not bare myself,  I wanted to find out who I was and what my goal in life should be. Instead of that I found the opposite. 

Any advice on ""knowning thyself"", did I do something wrong? I lost interest in school, lifting and   ignored my gf, now she is gone... my heart feels empty, my head too full.... I feel like a nobody, like 1 of billions and billions of insects and at the same time I feel like I carry the pain of all humanity on my shoulders... today I went to the store and saw a 90 years old man struggling to walk, I started tearing... decaying body and the mind has normalized it.

528,"So. 

I think I royally fucked up. 

I'm going to try to tldr this but uh, here it goes 

I was working at one very small pizzaria as a waitress for about a year, but I wasn't making very much money. They were prepping for a new location opening and kept cutting my hours to train new girls and from November- May I waited for more hours and it was really hurting my financial security. 

The owner's knew how I felt but kept promising that when the new location opened I'd be making a lot more money and I just needed to wait it out. 

In November, it was promised to be open by the first of the tear... The location still isn't open and won't be for a few months. 

Anyways, after being asked to not get a second job for months and getting hired and then pressured to not show up because of promised future hours repetitively, my bosses at the time and I descided to cut ties after I got another job at a different pizzeria in town part time and refused to quit it&amp; at the time I also had a part time delivery company job so I wasn't too worried. 

By week 3, my new pizzaria job is hellish and the delivery company I worked for shut down for good. 

So I'm three weeks I went from 3 jobs to one job and the work place is pretty toxic. 

Head owner is on vacation. His very angry Italian mother who insists everyone calls her Momma threw a pen at me on my third day because my trainer and I didn't read back the order to a customer and they complained about their pizza ( our bad, but appropriate reactions dude ) . Trainer quit after my first week and told me no one should have to work at such a toxic place. 

Things get worse. 

So I went another pizzeria and was just like ' listen, I'll work full time here tommorow if you'll let me '

I got hired Wednesday, and they had be scheduled 11-2 on Thursday &amp;Friday. 

Thursday went well, I was scheduled 4-8 at the toxic place after so I went there and hung out planning on giving them notice in the next few days. Thursday night went to shit. 

One of the head cooks came in hung over from the night before wearing his dirty uniform he hadn't changed out of. He wasn't scheduled, instead he stayed around and continued to drink untill he was absolutely wasted and started harassing the other girl who was working on counter with me. 

She played everything off really well, and tried to act like it was funny but I could tell she was upset and it was getting close to the time I was supposed to leave, she was there until 10pm.  At this point he is regularly grabbing onto her, pressing her body into the counter with his, kissing her neck while shes on the phone with customers, ect. 

&amp; Everyone is acting like it's halarious! 

I could tell she was getting upset and I told her she could leave at 8 of she wanted and she looked at me and just said ' thank you, can I please just go cry in the bathroom?'


She leaves at 8 with tears in her eyes and everyone else started making up lies. Saying she was cheating on her husband, that she probably left early to sleep with the cook, ect, 

I'm pissed. 

At pretty much the exact moment my coworker left the owner comes back from vacation and kind of came into a shitshow. 

I went home at 10 and knew it was time to quit. Went to my 11-2 at the new pizzaria the next day and then went to the other place an hour early for my shift wearing buisness casual instead of my work uniform. The core owners weren't there but I explained everything to two available mini managers and even offered to work my shift but ultimately left thinking that was that.

Untill, I got a call from the owner's mom, 
She started by being sugar sweet saying that they were going to fix the issues in the restaurant and that they needed me and I was one of the few people she trusted etc etc and then I told her I already got another job and I wasn't willing to work with her as my only job at the time so if they were willing to do a split schedule then maybe but otherwise I had no interest based on what I'd seen. 

She told me there was no way they hire me if I was working somewhere else so I told her unfortunately wasn't going to work out and as I told the other managers I wasn't interested in working there anymore but I wish them the best and she told me to go fuck myself and that I fucked them over like everyone else. 

30 minutes pass and then the actual owner of the restaurant calls me. 

He is absolutely sweet as sugar and just asking me to explain what happened then gives me a bunch of compliments and is just really laying it on thick. he asked me to come back at least a couple days a week so that he can prove himself and his company to me (???) Also said that most of his employees are trash and he feels terrible he gave such a bad impression to someone so sweet and good at their job. (???) 

( I've never had a company beg me to work for them before and I'll admit, I got a lil flustered) 

So I agreed to work there two or three days a week and continue to give them a chance but say that like very frankly that their company has a really bad issue with morale and that I've never seen such a toxic workplace in my life. Which he agrees with. 





Now here comes the actual core of the thing that I'm dealing with now;




I have a meeting with the guy that I talked to from the toxic pizzeria tonight at 6:00 p.m., however from what I can tell when talking to the other pizzeria guy he's pretty put off that I'm not completely cutting ties with the original pizzeria I said I would quit from. 


How can I do damage control here? 

what if the toxic pizzeria decides they don't really want me to work there but just want to make sure I don't sue them or something

what's going on right now what's the best course of action I'm stressed guys please help.

I'm pretty sure I'm about to go from two jobs to no jobs.



Tldr; quit my job at a pretty toxic pizzeria to try to work full time at a new place that I have no experience with, toxic pizzeria owner begged me to stay and for a second chance and I'm pretty sure I ruined my chance with the other place by humoring toxic pizzeria plea for me to not quit.

My mother meanwhile doesn't know anything yet and there are two main reasons why.

1- My parents are 'realistic' or 'cynical' about this kind of stuff. They've warned me in the past before about moving in with a significant other, other than a friend. They think moving in with a boyfriend could be unstable

2- They think he's gay. I mean he's definitely bisexual; his most recent relationship was with a guy and he's been in the gay community and stuff before, but he's also dated another girl and hooked up with girls too (including me over the past few years), but even our other LGBT friends seem to ignore this fact cause idk, I think it's just this dumb stigma that if a guy doesn't exclusively get with girls, he's gay, and if a girl doesn't exclusively get with girls, then she's straight.

536,"Hi Reddit. Over the last year, I have developed a close friendship with this girl, that quickly got to a level where we went on weekend trips and supported each other through major changes and events. I had been told early on (out of the blue, didn't have an intent to make a move) that I was friend-zoned and the relationship has stayed purely platonic. As things progressed, I started to have some reasonable doubts that she may have been developing some interest, including being spontaneously told that she'd sleep with me but would be scared of developing feelings. I have personally loved the person a great deal but have not had a lot of attraction. I have historically needed a physical and romantic component to my interactions (as well as a feeling that the other party is interested) for that to develop, and I was willing to push things in that direction given the compatibility I was seeing. I think I would have gotten there.

To set things straight, I asked her if things had changed. She admitted that the needle had moved as a result of circumstances (bad dating life) but that her priority was to preserve the friendship and that she did not want anything more than what we had. Then, a few days later, she wrote that she let me down easy, has zero interest and acted confusingly out of a fear that \*I\* was developing something - and yet a few days later, she cancelled the plans we had for the summer and requested space. I do not know why she had such a strong reaction - she has declined to explain why she needed some distance, and there is no obvious interpretation that can be drawn from the limited information that I have.

I respected the request and we did not have contact over the last 3-4 weeks, until she sent me especially cold birthday wishes over FB a few days ago. I told her then that I found it difficult to lose daily contact suddenly without having a sense of what went down and that I'd like to get a better understanding of the fallout and of where she sees things going. She told me that she was uncomfortable that I was holding her to expectations for a SO rather than a friend and that needing space is a normal thing - again declining to give me information.

Since breaking contact, I find myself obsessing about finding an interpretation that makes sense. I badly want to know what upset her to that level, I want to know if I have acted unreasonably, and I want to know if she still wants to be friends at all. On the rational level, there is no way for me to know any of that if she is unwilling to tell me - she does not owe me any explanation. For my own sake, I need to let go and am unsure why I require immediate clarity - I realize that the month scale may be a bit fresh and that dust needs to settle on both sides.

I'm not exactly sitting around and moping, but it's affected my focus in certain activities and I hate that I let it get to me that deeply. I feel so damn immature about it. I'd like to get your advice and hard truths about getting to a stage of acceptance that I do not get to understand what happened.",16Jun2019,1

538,"A little back story regarding this. My sister and her husband are going through a very rough divorce, my niece (16) and her brother (3) have been caught in the middle since day 1. 

She's been acting differently for a while now. I've tried speaking with her alone, and as long as it's not something absurdly stupid, I wouldn't share it with her mom so she trusts me. 

She doesn't like speaking about her emotions with her parents. Disagrees with everything they say, and no longer ""respects"" their opinions. 

Her grandparents live with them, and since the start of this, they've turned into the most controlling people I've ever seen. Not letting her go out, checking her phone constantly. 

To alleviate some of this bs, I take her out whenever I have free time. And usually take responsibility for her going out! It reached a point where I had to ask permission for her to go hangout with her friends (because if she did it was usually a no)

I understand why she's acting out. I kinda understand why she started smoking. I just want a way to talk to her about this in the best way possible. So she understands I only have her best interests in mind. She's in a very fragile place, I don't want to accidentally say the wrong thing and do the opposite.

539,"I don't know what it is, but in the last year mostly everything stopped making me happy. I stopped caring about so many things. I've been so tired physically/mentally and I just want to be left alone for a while. My grandpa's 85th birthday was yesterday and a ton of family traveled to get together and I told my parents I was too tired to go, and ""why should we celebrate if it's just another day that was literally the same as yesterday. It's just another day floating on a rock."" That might seemed like I'm depressed but I don't think I am? Am I selfish for not wanting to go to that dinner, and pushing people away like that? I'm in my room like the entire day because my whole family annoys me. I haven't actually talked or done anything with my younger sister for probably 2 years, and my brother and me are okay most of the time. Me and my dad never really get along, he always bugs me and I've told him that's the reason I don't talk to him is because he always annoys the shit out of me. Me and my mom are good. Today, they went to my other grandparents and my mom came back with a letter for me. Inside was $500, for graduating high school (I'm 18). It didn't make me happy at all. I just stared at it for a few seconds and I'm like ""cool."" Go back two years, I would be like ""omg I can buy so many designer clothes!"" I stopped caring about clothes as much as I used to for some reason. I used to want to buy these awesome Supreme or Off White shirts, but now I just don't care. I also have needed new shorts for like months, and I keep saying ""I'm going to go shopping soon."" I've been saying that for like 4 months. Why don't I care about those things that used to make me happy? In most of my free time I like to play piano, and it would be awesome to do something with that in the future but should I wake up from this dream world and realize that it's unlikely? I don't have a job because I feel like if I get one I'll have 0 free time to work on my hobbies. Should I even enjoy my job? I don't want to serve people food.. I want to start a business and do something I actually enjoy. Is it part of life to just get a job that I don't want at all? Am I a loser? I'm entitled as fuck. It's a terrible thing. I eat fast food at least once a day.. even though it's not always unhealthy it's still a disgusting spending habit. I haven't worked out consistently for like 3 months, and I feel kind of disgusting. I've always wanted this amazing body.. never got close. I fucking suck at everything honestly. I always thought ""wow.. people who just hang out with friends all day and take pictures are losers and have no substance to their life."" That's why I always work on something like piano because I don't like to party all the time. But I'm just meh at it. I'm meh at everything in life. I can't seem to get it together.

541,"Hello Reddit,

On top of lots of other personal shit going on in my life, my family and I have to move. We have almost zero time and our house is just full of stuff not like a hoarders house, just stuff from living here for over twenty years. I'm in my mid twenties and have two younger siblings and we live with our mom.

Due to divorce and shit we have to sell the house ASAP. But idk where to even begin. We haven't gotten anywhere in getting the house ready. Part of me wants to pack my shit and get my own spot, but I'd be screwing over my mom and family. I'm just at the point where I don't know what to do.

Do I just go ahead and get a dumpster for my driveway and rent a storage unit? We needed to have it ready like two weeks ago and still nothing. No one seems to be doing anything about it. My mom doesn't want to do anything and says she's ok with being contempt of court, because my dad is for other reasons? This is what I'm dealing with. I help out financially here because my mom doesn't work, and my dad doesn't pay her alimony or child support (or whatever it actually is) on time or at all. Me moving out would screw her and my younger brother over big time because I don't think she'd be able to afford it.

Is there anything I can do? Should I start selling some of my stuff I was going to junk to get some extra money? 

I already have a lot on my plate and adulting is hard. Hopefully other people out there have similar experiences and can share some insight or advice. Thanks in advance!",16Jun2019,1

543,"I haven’t kissed a whole lot. I‘ve read and watched videos about it. My first kiss was when I was little as probably a peck which I don’t remember. I kissed my date recently on the 2nd date about 4/5 times quick kisses only but I had some trouble. I’ve heard you should turn right to kiss but I realized that when we said goodbye he was leaning his head to his left / my right which threw me off. I know he’s left handed. After one of those kisses he said: that was weak, another. I just need some pointers about what I should know to help with kissing and improve. He likes kissing a lot and has hinted he wants to make-out. I just don’t want my inexperience to show nor do I want to be bad it. 

So getting into the kiss is what I’m kind of struggling with but I’ve done it and just keeping the kiss going instead of breaking it quick. At first there was someone there and it was the first time we kissed so I could kind of pretend like it was just because someone was there.

Also best place to put hands. I rested mines above his shoulder since we had hug before.

Do you wear lipstick when kissing or just lip balms. His lips felt smooth so maybe he prepped. I thought my lips were okay but I wasn’t wearing anything since we ate.

544,"I'm a 16 year old girl, dropped out of school in year 9 (last year) and then started TAFE (school alternative) this year, and dropped out of that aswell and I am currently looking for a part-time job. I really didn't fit well into school and schooling alternatives, I copped a bit of bullying and I am dealing with anxiety and depression, so I've decided to start working early because it's what I want to do with my life and part of it is to have some money saved up for when I have a baby. 

My situation sounds irresponsible and silly enough as it is, and I am quite shy about being honest about it, but for quite a while I've been incredibly badly yearning for a baby, infact it's been my ultimate life goal since I was a very young girl, and all I've ever wanted to be is a mum, I'm constantly reading birth/pregnancy stories, planning out what I would have to do to prepare for a baby and all I think about is wanting to have a child. My partner (18M) who I've been with for quite a while now shares my dream and wants to ideally start trying for a baby late this year or next year and we are both confident that we could handle having a baby financially. 

My main worries about having a baby at such a young age is my parents and families reactions and how pregnancy/giving birth would physically impact me, I'm quite petite, and although I do have a high pain threshold, I tend to go through all of and the worst side affects from medications, sicknesses and physical health problems. And also, I don't want my parents to feel like they've failed me and think I'm just an irresponsible, reckless teen and I'd never want to hurt them, but if I told them I was having a baby at 16 or 17, they would be incredibly disappointed (which I definitely understand and see why that's entirely fair) and I would hate it if my relationship with them was permanently negatively impacted from it. 

I assume that the advice I would get is to wait, but I really have thought this out for a long time and rationally, so my question is, if this is what for a long time I have been truly wanting and dreaming of, should I wait longer than I want? 

TLDR: I have always wanted a baby and now I want one more than ever at 16, but I'm worried it's just an irresponsible idea and how my parents will react",16Jun2019,1

I'm 31 Male and I've been in the same relationship for 8 years. I recently found out that my middle child (out of 3) isn't biologically mine and that my wife cheated on me again about 3 weeks ago. I've cut her out of my life as much as possible even though I love her and my day to day are pretty good, I hang out with friends, going on dates, whatever, but the kids are with me and I'm at my parents house so they help a lot. But every morning I wake up hot and sweaty and shaking and I can't stop myself from crying. 

Prior to this devastating news I used to smoke pot a lot. I did it as an escape because my wife was distant, I'd given up my social life to make her happy, so the only thing I do for myself is get high and play random games when I get off of work (which is 4am), but with my graveyard shift and 3 kids it's not a lot of free time.

I'm currently 21 and It seems I'm destined to be single. Granted, I'm not the most attractive person around but I love to talk to people and I go for every chance I get.

It's very likely I'm doing something wrong but I usually just try to talk and get to know people. Never really get past that point. Everyone's either taken or blatantly not interested.
Wouldn't say I have particularly high standards either, would love to just be with someone that seems pretty cool makes me happy.

Understand the whole ""she's out there somewhere"", ""just not your time"", ""gotta have hope"" stuff but I've scraped up so much hope to the point where I'm only getting splinters from the hope barrel.

Practically accepted the fact that it's my destiny to be single but I have such a hard time enjoying myself. I enjoy doing stuff with my friends but it's always hard to get over the underlying loneliness.

557,"I started law school back in August 2018. It's in a new city so I know no one and have no family here. on the first day of orientation I arrived at the lounge area it was supposed to take place in about thirty minutes before it started and sat at an unoccupied table. I'm really introverted and very shy, but also on that particular day I wanted to be alone for a bit to soothe my anxiety. I also have anxiety that I take meds for. not more than 2 minutes passed before I was approached by a fellow student (25f) and invited to sit at her basically full table. I was a little annoyed about that but I obliged. 

the table had eight people including myself, evenly split with men and women, and ages ranging from 22 to 32. one student suggested that we go around and introduce ourselves which eventually led to further conversation, and ended with everyone joining a group chat intended for future study groups. 

fast forward maybe a week later to the first day of classes. I arrived maybe ten minutes before the class was to start and was greeted by three students I had met from that table during orientation: Sandra (25f, who had approached me that day), Liam (22m), and Alex (31m). Sandra and Liam were sitting next to each other then there was an open seat, then Alex. I greeted them with a smile and sat in that open seat. I thought, ""I'll probably be hanging with these guys from now on, cool"". I thought wrong. 

So here are some situations highlighting why I suspect I'm not highly favored at this school:

maybe two or three weeks into classes I reached out to that aforementioned group chat asking if anyone was ready to start that study group. I was met with silence except for two who messaged me outside of the group chat. their replies were fruitless, however, after initially giving me hope, as nothing ever came of them. 

fast forward again to a q&amp;a session one of my professors was holding after class in which he'd asked how many of us were in study groups. I looked around to see quite a few members of the group chat raise there hands. that definitely got me in my feelings but I pushed on.

I barely got through that first semester earning two Cs and a B- in my three classes. I dropped down to two classes the next semester, hoping to better my efforts and I'd also planned to befriend at least one person. an opportunity showed itself early that semester. a fellow student's (f)  hairstyle had caught my eye and I'd decided to go up to her and compliment it during the next break. I did so. I went up to her and another student (f) and explained to her how my best friend also wanted a similar hairstyle and whether she had advice/tips/whatever. she told me how she achieved the style, but then as I attempted to continue a conversation she turned back to the other student and, I guess, continued whatever conversation they'd had before I'd shown up. no transition, nothing. I was dismissed. so I walked away in awe. 

later that semester I thought maybe things were looking up when I was approached not once, but twice by fellow students inviting me to after-school pastimes: laser tag and a house party. I gave both students my number so that they may contact me with further details, but I never heard from them. one of those students (f) now averts her eyes whenever we're in near proximity...

towards the end of that semester I decided to attend a BLSA (black law students association) meeting as a last effort to find someone to study for finals with. the meeting caught my eye as the topic was undergrad experiences in HBCUs (historically black college/University) and PWI (predominantly white institution). I thought the likelihood of bonding with someone over this would be high. again I thought wrong. I arrived at the room maybe ten minutes before the meeting was to start. I took a seat in the back of the room expecting someone to come and greet me and maybe invite me to sit with the others. I had this expectation because I was clearly the only non-regular and the attendance was so little leading me to believe they would be keen to attract more and please potential new members. apparently this was too big an assumption because neither happened. I left the meeting knowing I'd never go to another. 

that second semester I got two C-s, putting me on academic probation, which brings me to this semester: in my two classes I will either need to get an A and a D or two Bs to get out of academic probation and not be kicked out of the school. I'm high key terrified.

some additional info that may help:
-I'm black and greatly identify with my Nigerian heritage
-I've had little issue making friends in my other school settings
-i do gravitate towards other black people, but this situation has made me desperate and I'm now way more welcoming to all other races
-until now I was sure I had the exact opposite of resting bitch face as I always used to be the subject of unsolicited approaches for conversation
-I'm very accommodating (or two faced as I like to think) and often sacrifice my comfort for others
-Alex had been a very strong contender as a buddy (he was one of the two people who had messaged me back after I asked about the study group) but he became distant and I suspect it's because of what I've observed to be a romantic relationship with another classmate and maybe that's all the female attention he's willing to give
-my BLSA expectations came from undergrad where I was an officer in a similar organization
-the group chat grew from the original eight members to about twenty, but is now inactive
-i understand that some of this may be a pride issue...

I tried to be as detailed as possible but obviously feel free to ask for clarifications because I want to give as much context as possible. this is so weird (and now detrimental) to me and I gotta know why.

558,"So the hottest recent post in AITA confirms that people in an event who sit in the corner with their phones look like assholes, while in reality they might be there browsing r/suicidewatch or whatnot.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, that's me. That's the only way I can not seem depressed. If I put down my phone people keep asking why I look sad and it just makes my day that much worse. It reminds me that I'm depressed. It reminds me that I want to die.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to sit in an army vehicle browsing my phone while everyone else was socializing. Looking at r/Incels r/Inceltears r/redpill r/SuicideWatch r/depression r/selfimprovment and many other subreddits with many of them being about suicide or simply toxic people that are in pain that I can somehow understand where they're coming from due to this slowly reducing sanity that happens due to mental illnesses.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to think the world is black and white. 

I used to think I would lose my anxiety when I was 8, I am yet to lose it at 22. I then thought how I might lose my ""silence"" a bit later than my father, he started talking to people at 16, I'm yet to do so at 22. 

Then, I got aware of my IBS and the constant pain one person might have for no reason, I stopped believing in black and white, some things just aren't fair.

 I then started feeling I'd rather die than feel pain. I first thought people would miss me, I then lost that feeling because I realized it's unfair to let me stay like this. 

I used to despise all redpillers and incels alike, but then I realized how fucking lonely I am and how suicidal my mutism has made me, so what's to stop others from turning into an incel? Sounds like the same route only they strayed a bit to the side. 

I then realized getting shot in the head might just do it. At first only the barrel in my mouth. A couple months later the magazine. a couple more months I almost chambered it. Got released shortly after the army found out, but not before they attempted a short treatment with CBT and escitalopram. Now I wish I was back to finish the job. 

My sister was found to be depressed as well, asked me how I talked to my parents about getting treatment. I never got the treatment I needed because they believed therapy is a scam. Didn't have the heart to tell her.

Found out my grandmother is depressed as well, doctor's seem to think it's hereditary. My parents never treated their mental health because Russians saw it as weakness and their parents refused to let them get treatment.

My sister talked to my parents and my parents started to take mental treatment seriously. Got back to my apartment and slammed my phone on the floor because I realized my sister might still get the chance I never got at an early age. I guess my suicide attempt at the army convinced my parents to try something else, well, that, and that my silence is still there at 22.

Got back on escitalopram for 2-3 months. NO effects whatsoever, positive or negative. Switching to SNRI soon. I'm in my sixth session of therapy, 4 or 5 of which were wasted on complete silence, money well spent.

559,"Hi there! My name is FrightFace, and I am a 17 year old girl. Long time lurker, but this is my first post. I'm looking for some help, and any advice would be appreciated!

**Background (Summarized):**

When I was in 8th grade, I developed an eating disorder. I was a small, flat chested girl and I wanted to have a toned, flat stomach and large breasts and butt. I tried EVERYTHING, from waist training, counting calories and working out for 3-4 hours everyday until I'd hurt myself. I wanted to be perfect. I went from a healthy 117 pounds to 86 in 3 months. I started my Freshman year of high school sickly and depressed. I was in a relationship at the time, and I was so  sure I'd become perfect for him someday if I kept it up. One day during Algebra class, I had an immense pain and felt like I couldn't breathe. I was carried by two teachers to the office and called my mother. Both my parents were working, so they couldn't come in a short amount of time (I had to wait until they got out). I felt awful. I couldn't move. I couldn't breathe. I felt like I was going to die. After I threw up, my mom was called again and was told of my worsening condition. She freaked out and got a pass from her boss to leave early for the day. She came and took me home. I stayed home the next day due to how sick I felt. We went the ER the next day and after x-rays came in, I was diagnosed with gallstones. I had to be sent to surgery as soon as possible, but because I was a minor, I had to be sent to a special ER in another state. My heart sank. I was petrified. I didn't know what to do. Soon, I was in a hospital bed and prepping for surgery. They removed my gallbladder, and ever since then, I've had problems...

&amp;#x200B;

**Issues Today:**

About two years ago, I was diagnosed with IBS-C  after not being able to eat. I was nauseous, consistently vomiting daily, and had an impacted colon. I currently suffer from so much worse.

* I have serve reflux, even before eating anything . I throw up due to it and I don't want to eat
* Extreme bloating and gas. I've tried every pill, drink, and supplement I can think of. If you have recommendations, I can see if I've taken it before. I keep all my bottles. My stomach becomes hard and I look 9 months pregnant after my first meal, despite my meals being small, healthy, and me reducing or cutting out ""trigger foods""
* Headaches and depression. My depression has gotten so much worse. My condition makes me want to sleep in and never wake up. I feel disgusting.
* Constant constipation, currently on medication and have been for years. Alternating diarrhea at times (usually when I'm sick)
* Unable to absorb all nutrients from food

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently on Amitiza and taking Enzymes+Probiotics, Magnesium, and occasional fiber supplements when needed. I feel so revolting. I did this to myself and I don't know how to turn back. Many days leave me feeling like I wished I was dead. I can't stand the pain and embarrassment. I just want to feel better.

after some advice I got from good reddit users, I wiped the dust over my shoulder, man'd up and stood myself for one last chance before suicide.
I made my research over google maps, marked some suitable countries that I can travel to with my third-world passport, made further research about viable options in these countries, until I found a country called Kazakhstan, Astana to be specific. 
I heard about a company there where a manager is very helpful who can really help in my case, I worked for few months, borrowed money from every relative/friend I know. bought myself a ticket and traveled over 5000 miles to reach there. a country that I know no one in, with barely 300 dollars in my pocket, without speaking their language.
I got myself a job there, after I explained to that manager my situation. I dropped tears when he offered me the job, while I was taking a shower. I dropped enough tears that I couldn't tell if it was the falling water or my tears.
it was the only 1 good day I lived for my whole 29 years life.
next day, I come to my second day at work, they tell me I can't change my visa from here so I need to leave the country so they can send me visa invitation from there. so I left. 2 months ago .... and no one responded until now, however I tried to call or Email.

565,"Problem: I'm tired on a daily basis, tired as in worn out, not sleepy as in needing sleep. I talk to friends or play games with them or play games alone and every few hours I need to lie down in bed for a few minutes to 3 hours before I feel like I can continue my task. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 25 year old disabled man so what's on my computer is my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I've been taking 2 10 minute walks daily for the last 4 months. I've been working out every week for the last 6 months and been increasing the weights every 2-3 months. I've years of experience working out, but I had a 5 year break due to my muscles not rebuilding and my body being stuck in starvation mode. Actually my body is still having those issues, but now I'm working out at a level where my muscles repair faster than they are used up. Exercise doesn't seem to affect my exhaustion at all.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

How sugar/eating affects it:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If I have snickers icecream bars and grab 1 or 2 from the freezer every 1-3 hours I can keep going all day, perhaps with just 1 or 2 short breaks throughout the day. I've even experienced being able to forego the breaks entirely when I've had a few packs of these in the freezer. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

On days where I just eat normal food, 3 meals a day I'm tired as usual. I take breaks every few hours like I mentioned above. Mealtime doesn't affect when I get tired. I may get tired right after eating or 2 hours after, there's no consistency. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If I consume a bag of potato chips or a bar of chocolate in a few minutes there's also no change. I'll get tired some time soon. I can also divide that snack over a bit of a longer period like over the course of a 2 hour movie and I'll probably have to pause the movie halfway through to rest in bed a little bit. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If you wonder about my brain, blood or sleep I've had it all tested and everything comes out perfect. I don't know if some humans just are this way or if I'm different. I can definitely say that some months are better or worse than others though. What I've described in this post is the worst case scenario, and I've been experiencing it for the past month or so.

568,"I don’t know where else to post this, so let me know of any other subs that might be beneficial please!

Me and my boyfriend (both aged 19 years old currently, would be 20 by the time we purchased a home) are looking to buy a house sometime within the next year. We both have well paying jobs (he works as a machinist and I work as an in-home nanny) making $11-$15 per hour (minimum wage here is $9.45), solid credit scores (his is 694 and mine is 728) and a joint savings for a home that we are continuously saving for.

We are looking into getting a fixer upper (which in my area averages at about $30K-$65K since the average cost of a semi decent home here is $115K and upwards of that amount) and thankfully have friends and family who work in various fields that would be beneficial in fixing up a home and are willing to help us. So the cost of home repairs would be significantly lowered for us since we can put in most of the work ourselves.

My primary worry is that as of right now, I am transitioning between jobs so I don’t have stable work history (I just quit my job of 18 months to start a new one) and he just quit his job of 20 months to start a new one as well. So, we don’t have as stable of a work history and we are young, so it feels like the odds may be against us.

We’ve been looking into buying a home for about six months now (I’ve been wanting to buy a home for a very long time) and are seriously weighing our options now. Renting here is insanely expensive since we’re located near the business district and some of the most prestigious universities in the state, so unless we move hours away, we’ll pay up the ass for rent on an apartment because of its location to good schools, college campuses, city life, etc. which I just don’t feel is necessary or right for us right now.

Anyway; do you think that it is a good idea for us to buy a home? What requirements would we need in order to buy a home that we don’t already have or might not be able to achieve at this age? Have any of you purchased a home at a young age?

*Side notes too: I know that I haven’t covered everything necessary for buying a home because that’s a lot and this is already long. But we’re in a long term relationship so we feel comfortable purchasing a home together, however the home will more than likely only be in one of our names in case we do end up separating in the future. We don’t want to create any legal trouble or extra costs for ourselves in the future.*",16Jun2019,1

575,"Hello, I’ve had this issue for probably half a year now where I gag at the thought of protein powder. So, my question is, how do I stop associating drinking protein shakes as disgusting?

The backstory is that, a few years ago in like 2013, I made the decision to start going to the gym with my dad and attempt to gain weight since I’m a skinnier guy. 

After our work out, he would have me drink some protein shake with protein powder he bought from the GNC store. The taste was absolutely disgusting. My dad told me it is beneficial to drink the protein shake so I forced myself to drink it every time. I basically gagged when I drank it so I did my best to drink all of it in one go. I can’t remember what exactly it was but regardless, I switched to another protein powder that tastes much much better. 

The previous protein shake made me so unmotivated to go to the gym so I dreaded it every time I went. I was not looking forward to coming back home to drink the shake. Eventually, I stopped going to the gym. 

Sometime 2018 of last year, I had some friends that invited me to work out with them and let me try the protein they were using. I was completely surprised that it didn’t taste horrible. It helped me make a switch to something different. It also helped me get back into working out and I finally am coming close to my goal weight. 

My problem is that, even though I am using this new protein powder, I still gag at the thought of drinking it. I don’t gag when I drink it, but while making it, I just start gagging and tearing up. I really hate it and it just sucks.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, let's get into this. I'm in maths class. There's this cute popular girl I sit on the same row as that I talk to sometimes. Let's call her T. There's also this other annoying kid I'll call A that sits between us. T and A are fucking around and being annoying. A has the idea to try rub T's carmex (some sort of lip balm) on me and in all my 4 brain cells I let this happen because she has some type of carmex where she puts it straight on her lips and I thought if she put it on me I'd technically be kissing her, right?. Anyway, back to the point, she'd been acting really shy around me today so I just blow it off and let her have her fun because I'm beta and awkward. 10 minutes later, we're doing some worksheet and I turn around to smart boy behind me we'll call K. Me and K do the work for a bit and A come to fuck with us. When eventually, A fucks off and T comes and talks to me. She (I think accidentally) rubs my leg on mine but she keeps it there. I think it's a hint and I keep my leg there and she keeps her leg there too. We just kinda look in each others eyes for a bit and she goes back to her desk and puts her head on the desk. I decide to talk some of my friends on K's row. A few minutes later she comes back and talks with my group. 2 minutes in, she moves next to me and shows me her phone which has some Instagram ad for clothes and she asked me which one I like and says which one she likes. These are some really skimpy dresses like basically sports bra and booty shorts. She's almost leaning on me while we talk. I give some stupid answer because I think this is a hint but I don't know and I don't wanna sound weird. But the thing is I really don't know.

Does she like me? We're both in highschool and she's quite popular and I'm one of those ""back of the class"" kids that just fuck around and drift through school. I'm not that popular, I'm just some lil awkward ass kid so I really don't know. Sorry for the long read I just need to get the details in. Can y'all give me some advice on what to do and think?

TL:DR popular girl starts acting shy around me. In class she starting rubbing my leg with her's and asks me about skimpy dresses she shows me on her phone while leaning on me. I know this might not be much but I've read too much into this and I can't stop thinking of this.",16Jun2019,1

584,"Over the past 3 years, I've been experiencing more and more things that are just unexplainable and I don't know how to deal with them.

One really common experience I'll have is this yelling. I'll just be walking outside when I hear this horrifying screaming from a distance. It can be very loud, and last for minutes on end. I could describe it vividly but I'd rather not.

I always panic about what to do whenever it shows up. It's always behind something, like trees or houses, and it's not like I can just storm into someone's backyard. Even if I could, as a 158cm, 50-ish kilogram girl who cuts herself grating cheese, I'm just a sitting duck.

I would call the police, but there are a few things stopping me. 

Other people don't respond to it? The screaming will start and everyone seems to mind their own business. I once asked my mother about the screaming, and she looked at me like I was crazy. Also, why is there screaming wherever I go? It sounds like it's always the same woman. It makes me feel like I'm being watched, and I'm next.

Another example would be this breathing of what I assume is a grown up man, and it always appears behind my right ear or inside my closet.

The scariest kinds of experiences are the kind I see. The first one I ever experienced was from this big stuffed dog in my room, and I saw it move in broad daylight. I attacked it to make sure no one was hiding inside it, and now I can't keep it in my room.

The most vivid one is this girl in my shower. Surprisingly, during this experience I am not scared, as long as I follow what she tells me to do, which is mostly about about facing her or looking away, or giving her enough space. After the shower is a whole other story though. I'm taking a really big risk writing this because I think she might hurt me if I talk about her.

I hope these examples give a better picture with what I'm dealing with. I have zero idea what to do, and they're only getting worse. I don't even know if they're real, but I'd rather not take the chance. I'm really worried about sounding like I'm crazy.

The older sister was very well spoken and she had a good understanding of how human relationships worked judging from our conversations. She was actively trying to set me and her sister up by making room for us to sit together and she even offered to have me over for dinner (I just moved to the area too so this would be cool) . The younger sister and I were the youngest at this event. 

All was well and I was super excited to potentially get to know the younger girl....until I found she was 15.

We were splashing around in the water laughing and i was about to make a move but stopped myself.

591,"Hi,

I never thought I would be writing these words, but I know I want to change.

I recently got out of a long term relationship with my first girlfriend, we were together for several years and I feel like I became a really shitty person without realising. I even thought I was compassionate and caring.

I had a couple of mental health issues and ended up turning to drink and porn to numb everything. I quit the alcohol before that went too far but porn has been an ever present thing in my life since I was 13.

I had only ever been with my partner and along the way I began pressuring her to do anal or dirty talk about various fetishes. I felt like that was what happened in an established relationship. It felt like the only way to have sex without me having intrusive insecure thoughts. I now know that the way I behaved was absolutely fucked.

Outside of that, I ended up isolating myself in my depression and became pretty critical of everything and everyone. I wasn't good to come home to.

My partner left me, saying we needed to work through our issues and weren't good for each other.

Having realised now how shitty I behaved, I sent her an apology and told her how ashamed I was for hurting her. She responded that the apology was unnecessary but appreciated, that we became different people who needed help and she hopes I don't feel guilty and can move on.

However, I also see posts on her social media about toxic relationships, etc, so I feel like she is still hurting.

I've told my new partner, my parents, and my friends. I am getting therapy. 

I know I will never be that way again. I'm reaching out for treatment. I'm just utterly consumed with guilt for the hurt I caused and don't know how to move forward.

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding might have been nothing) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Darren’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Darren’ and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and smiled at me after saying it and then look away to carry on putting her scarf on.

Should i talk to her about it? Im just really confused and would like some advice/reassurance/straight talking.

I was initially scared of them because they were talking about how he was cutthroat and bad at debate and cheated and was a bad person, all of that turning out to be fake.

I talked to him and his team deeply at a national qualifier and found out he was one of the sweetest, most funny people I know. I got his phone number after talking to him and we texted a little.

During practice for nationals he told me to text him again and we started texting for hours upon hours at a time, and I’d get nervous when he didn’t reply because I thought it’d meant he get me.

I gave him a slap bracelet that I won to immortalize our friendship while we were both practicing and started to text even more. Today, I saw him at the expo at NSDA nationals and we hung out and I even bought him lollipops and gave him jellybeans that I stole from a stand while we hung out.

We used to hang out literally everyday and now it’s completely different. It was a gradual thing over the past month but lately she almost NEVER hits me up first. If I didn’t ask her to hang out I’m positive we wouldn’t because she never texts or calls first. On top of that most of the time when I do text her and ask her to hang out she says she is busy. I understand that because she has a lot more friends than me and also she is very close to her family and actually hangs out with them (I can’t relate to that). But for example the other day I asked her if she was free and she said she was hanging out with her dad that day. I was like “okay that’s cool” like I had no problem at all with that but then a couple hours later I see on Snapchat maps that she is at the lake and then I check her story and she is hanging out with her other friends on a boat. Not a single dad in sight. And that is not the first time at all that she said she was hanging out with family and ended up actually hanging out with her other friends.  I’m so upset and I can’t help but feel like she wants to end our friendship. I mean I guess I understand if she wants to, I’m not as popular or interesting as her other friends. I have anxiety and I don’t do drugs so I’m not exactly into the wild party life like she is. That doesn’t mean I wouldn’t want to be invited tho, you know? Can someone please give some advice.

They apologize and I say “it’s okay.” They respond with “you are so nice, if someone was late I would be mad.” To my understanding, if you feel that way, you would learn to never do it again right?

616,"So, I've always had this weird disconnect with my parents. 

They are immigrants and have worked hard to provide me with what I have, but I often feel that because of their work, they missed my childhood and my growth during my adolescence and teenage years. They are not fluent in English, so from a young age any communication with the outside world was through me. I dealt with all my educational forms, healthcare papers, insurance forms, etc etc from a young age and grew up faster than I would have liked. I know that it was out of necessity that they had to work and depend on me, but I still can't help but feel some resentment. It's an emotion I know is not necessarily rational or logical but is something that I still feel (to a lessor extent than my younger years). 

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I'm older, I've realized that my parents expect me to feel an emotional connection towards them because they've helped me a lot financially and they care and worry about me. But to be honest, I don't feel any sort of love for them. What I feel is an obligation to repay them financially, but my feelings for my parents end at that. I don't know if love for someone, even one's parents, is an innate thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Growing up, I never confided in my parents because of the language barrier and because they don't understand American culture so I never felt comfortable talking to them in a casual manner about my life. I don't know much about them and neither I nor my parents really tried to know one another when I was growing up. They provided for me financially, gave me a roof over my head, made sure I was never hungry, gave me things that I wanted, but they never supported me emotionally. I think that's maybe why I don't feel anything for them. 

&amp;#x200B;

My parents want me to love and care for them, but I just don't feel that way towards them. I wish I did because things would be so much easier between us and they wouldn't be such a huge stressor in my life, but I simply don't.

I have absolutely no clue how I managed to pass all my classes because I barely attended them, or did any work. I also have no clue what I wanna major in or do with my life. 

The thing is, I have no fucking clue what I would even do if I took a year off. I'd have to live at home, which means a lot less freedom than having my own place at uni. I would probably find some min wage job and work through the year. I'm scared that I'll end up doing nothing with the time and feeling even more horribly depressed &amp; isolated than I would have at school. I would like to travel but I dont know if my parents would let me (18f, and I think they see me as pretty naive lol) run off on my own. or what I'd even do if they let me. 

not sure if I should give uni another go and attempt to actually put effort into this year, and then reevaluate my situation at the end of the year, or if I should take some time off and attempt some self discovery...?

It was just text, but to my girlfriend who later found out, truly felt that I cheated on her. To give you a little insight my girlfriend really did absolutely everything for me, always drove to me, truly care for me, was absolutely stunning, someone that I probably should not have been dating from the first place but happened because she saw something in me. When I say gorgeous I really seriously mean she was model gorgeous. She truly cared more than anyone I think ever has about me. She was someone that I wanted to spend the rest my life with. My family loved her too. I know for a fact that I’ll always regret cheating on her because I lost her. She was the one I think.

I’m stuck in a rut. 

Well, I have been in one for nearly 2 years now.. Because of certain circumstances with mental health, I stopped working my 2 year job in November 2017 and have had a few random jobs in between that didn’t do me any well and I ended up trying to make money at home through numerous ways.

My references from my 2 year job have gone- the business shut down and there’s no way for me to get in contact with any of the 5 people who worked there with me.

I tend to get along better with people slightly older than me so my fiend group ranges from around my age to eighteen (normal shit). Anyway, a few months ago i was introduced to a new guy named Jake. Jake was funny and kind but was not in our friend group. I got to know him a bit better and he was very respectful when talking about anyone else. He gave me tips on the gym and was an overall nice dude. During a small party we had with the friend group for somebody's birthday, Jake got with (kissed) a good friend of mine, Sophie. After this event a small relationship started which I encouraged. The relationship ended within at most three weeks. I didn't think much of it since Sophie refused to talk to most people about it. Around 2 months pass and I am talking to three friends from the circle. One of them mentions that Jake is part of some internet group that hate women, think the three sins of the earth are first/second/third wave feminism and that the only women that can love men are mothers to their sons.

I feel pretty overwhelmed and i'd like to ask for your opinions. 
I'm a pretty anxious person in general and i changed schools in October and ever since, i was hanging out with two girls from my class (R and L), plus 2 other girls above our class. (A and G) In October i was very depressed and anxious, and i only hang out with those 2 of my class mates for months, but for 1-1,5 months now i started feeling a LOT better and i started talking with other classmates more. I like them a lot and i've been spending more and more time with them. One of them has been my crush for a long time, and it's great that i'm finally closer friends with them. I have a lot of fun with these people, and i kind of forgot about R and L. I either dumped them for the girls above our class (G is my childhood best friend) or my crush's group. They're just pretty introverted, R and L, and i realized i have a lot more fun with my crush's group. I'm closest with one of the girls and we have more personal talks, and she told me they love when i'm around and they're here to support me and help me through my difficult times as i suffer from mental health problems. 
I just had a chat with L and she said that she understands if i hang out with others and that it's my choice but she loves me, and that it hurt her when i started ignoring her- for example when my crush was around. Obviously i didn't ignore anyone on purpose and i feel guilty about it because it's not the first time something like this happens. Anyways, she also told me how A is two-faced and is nice with everyone while talks shit about them. Including me. Which really hurts because she's become one of my best friends, i mean, from time to time people thought we were dating- that's how close we were. I just feel like i'm stuck in the middle, i don't know what i should do. I still feel kind of like i'm sticking out of my crush's group but they're really cool people. Plus my crush is there.

The 2nd friend (sarah) is kinda weird but i like her, she gets me, the only problem is she is really boring and gets really annoying in stressfull situations ( she starts yelling and acting like a b*tch ) the 3rd friend (april) is the most intense person i know, she thinks she knows everything and can't accept it when she is wrong. She also only cares about herself and is on her phone ALL the time. Those are the main friends, then comes alex who is in our group but not as close, now she is really fun and interesting but she cares only about herself, even though i really like her one of the things i value the most in friendship is being a good friend and she is not.
Then there is the other friend (emma) who was my best friend when we were younger but now we kind of drifted apart and we have no converstion topic, she also is very fake and doesn't hang out with us as often.

The thing is that lily loves sarah really much, i'd say that she consideres us both her best friends. Lily also loves april and i'd say april considers lily her best friends. Basically Lily ties the whole group togethe. no lily, no group.

There are some days that i can't stand them but i have no one else to hang out with. They can be really sh***y friends and i would love to have other friends but they are really clingy and closed.

637,"I've always obsessed over things, first obsession was Pokémon when I was a kid (still secretly am obsessed). It always went beyond just enjoying the games or anime, I was always more into it than my friends. I was way too invested, all my daydreams were occupied by Pokémon, my happiness was dependent on how good the episode was that night, as if *I* was living the characters' life.

My mum called this just ""an obsessive personality"". I thought I would grow out of it, but I never have. I'm looking at my life now and it's just consumed by media, following twitter accounts that talk about my favourite tv shows, becoming obsessed with characters.  If I were to one day just decide to not care about any of it, I'd realise: I have no life. And that's awful.

I almost become possessive of media too, like, if I see people on facebook casually bringing up my favourite TV show, it almost makes me stressed? It's so weird, it's like, I can't understand how something that I'm so involved in can be just light disposable entertainment for others. 

For example, if I'm a fan of a tv show, I don't just watch it and think ""that was good"" and carry on with my day. I research the cast, I read the source material it was based on, I re-watch it 3 times, I watch other series that the actors have been involved in, I follow twitter accounts dedicated to said tv show, or whatever form of media I'm into in that moment. I analyse it extensively. 

I think tv shows, films and literature, are fantastic in many ways. They teach us things, analyzing and discussing is probably good for the brain. But I want this emotional investment, the dependency of it, to stop. 

There are certain films/books/tv shows, eg. Stranger Things that I just enjoy; I don't get possessive of them, I like it when other people are into them, and I watch it once and I'm done. I want everything I watch/read to be like that.

I just want my own life to be exciting enough that I'm not obsessing over characters and stories, but the thought of just not caring anymore is almost scary.",16Jun2019,1

643,"I graduated high school a couple of weeks ago and I’m 18F. 

I don’t know if I want to actually go to college or not. I had an idea of wanting to apply to a community college nearby but it’s too late for that and I couldn’t file for FASFA, since it requires information from my parents and I’m not in a good relationship with them to require that.

I have no money to go to college on. I’m not exaggerating on this. I barely have enough money to buy a pack of gum. I don’t want to go to college and be in serious debt at 21 or 22. 

I enjoy writing and art, I enjoy painting but I’m not that good at it to pursue an art career. I also enjoy reading a lot but that probably won’t help much here. 

I also have no interest in any trade school jobs, and I don’t have an interest in the military. 

I feel like I’m way behind on this stuff and it stresses me out so much. Everyone I went to school with had their colleges picked out and ready to go during our senior year and all of my friends are going to college in the fall. 

It also stresses me out about how if I don’t go to college, I won’t be successful in life and I probably wouldn’t be able to afford to support a future family. At least that’s what everyone I know tells me. I grew up extremely poor and I don’t want to raise kids in the same condition I did. 

I wanted to take a year off but everyone I know tells me not to because it’ll make things worse for me financially. 

They say that college isn’t for everyone but nowadays you have to go to college for a successful job and a steady income. 

I’m very stressed out about everything about college to the point where I’m starting to get depressed about it. 

Any advice would be great.",16Jun2019,1

The 2nd friend (sarah) is kinda weird but i like her, she gets me, the only problem is she is really boring and gets really annoying in stressfull situations ( she starts yelling and acting like a b*tch ) the 3rd friend (april) is the most intense person i know, she thinks she knows everything and can't accept it when she is wrong. She also only cares about herself and is on her phone ALL the time. Those are the main friends, then comes alex who is in our group but not as close, now she is really fun and interesting but she cares only about herself, even though i really like her one of the things i value the most in friendship is being a good friend and she is not.
Then there is the other friend (emma) who was my best friend when we were younger but now we kind of drifted apart and we have no converstion topic, she also is very fake and doesn't hang out with us as often.

The thing is that lily loves sarah really much, i'd say that she consideres us both her best friends. Lily also loves april and i'd say april considers lily her best friends. Basically Lily ties the whole group togethe. no lily, no group.

There are some days that i can't stand them but i have no one else to hang out with. They can be really sh***y friends and i would love to have other friends but they are really clingy and closed.

We've been friends and do help each other at times. I've helped his company he works at and also for free with things. Heavy lifting etc. Also business reports and coordinating which I can Excel at I think. 

I've taught him about stocks. Helped him understand how the stock market works etc and I help him a lot. 
He also tries to box with me for exercise but likes to start hitting me when I say no especially in front of his family. Sometimes just because he kept doing it I put the gloves on and did it and had to for fun or even defend myself. Because of him I've cut my head open before and also been punched In the face. When I choose to finally defend myself he realizes I'm trained in mma etc but I choose not to really use it. I injured my thumb for 8 weeks because of him and he can just be toxic.

His excuse is apparently that he has bad signal in his house (yet he still talks to my grandad once a week).

657,"TL:DR

I have a 2.43 cumulative GPA in Computer Science and a 3.8 minor GPA in Graphic Design

Want to get into grad school for Interior Design or Architecture.

Need advice on how to get into a good graduate program. 

Is it smart to work for a few years? 

Take an extra year to boost GPA?

Do a service like Peacecorps or Americorps?

&amp;#x200B;

A little more background on my scenario:

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a current college Senior (21 M)  studying Software Engineering with a minor in Graphic Design. I have found through these three years that software engineering is not the route I want to take my life. I enjoy it enough to not resent my decision to study it, but I don't have the passion for it to put in the work that it requires to be an exceptional programmer. My GPA has suffered from my own lack of effort/enjoyment in the program, and now going into my senior year I have a 2.43 overall GPA, and a measly 2.1 in the computer science department. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, I am thriving in the Graphic Design department. I have taken 12 credits toward my minor and sit at a 3.8 GPA. My switch during my Junior year was the first time I felt I was at the top of a few of my classes. My professors praise my work and urge me to stick with design, and I even won our University's Art Gallery Poster Design Competition my first semester in the department. On top of this I have a graphic design internship with a well respected family beverage distributor in the area, and have designed and created a website for a rapidly growing business in our city.

  

I'm confident in my design abilities and I have a lot of drive when it comes to this work, but I'm not sure I am content doing the work I can see in this field forever. A large part of me wants to strive harder and get my masters in Interior Design, or even Architecture. 

&amp;#x200B;

My plan of now is to finish this coming year. I will likely graduate with a cumulative GPA around 2.75 with a Minor GPA in the 3.8+ range. My family cannot afford to help me pay for grad school, and scholarship opportunities seem challenging with a low GPA. I am considering working for 2-5 years before pursuing grad school.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do to get into a decent/ above average grad school with a below average GPA? I am confident in my portfolio and have had some great work opportunities thus far. Is it smart for me to work for a few years after college before pursuing grad school? Should I take another year on my undergrad to boost my GPA? Should I volunteer for the Peacecorps or Americorps to gain life experience?

I slept over at her house alot in the last months and we had some good fun with her horses. But then I kinda fucked up. I started touching her a bit more aside from normal hugs.
I have since then touched her naked butt and also took of her shirt and bra and also touched her boobs.

662,"I was at a festival and some people beside me were doing drugs I presume. They were sniffing a tube of something. Like putting it into their nose and sniffing it. Then they started blowing into this tube and into the face of each other and I could smell something really intense and sharp to the nose. Didn't think much of it, but then sometime soon after I felt really fucked up. I only had 1 beer and smoked some weed, so I was relatively sober before it happened. I started to feel really out of it and nearly blacked out I think. The scariest part was that I pretty much went blind for a few minutes. Everything went dark, I could only see a few dim dots of lights which were the light-posts nearby. My vision slowly came back, but very dark and blurry as it did. Was I drugged? Should I see a doctor? Or is this some other health concern?

* Living with friends improving social life

I was spoken to last night by to voices. I am in no way religious . but this dream and voices said things i remember after i awoke. I went to bed late and the past year has been stressful. Its started with a hello from two voices that where indestictable. Not anything that would sound pleaseing to hear. One was scary the other calming. I was given advie and strength by one the other was like i was feeding it or it was feeding of off me. I was told things about my life that i didnt know and the reasons i did them. 

I was told by the good voice to push thru the evil and accept my downfall of what ive done and who ive hurt in my life that i need to overcome and overpower the darkness in my heart to become a better person. I was told details about my life that i havent understood for years and now it is clear to me that my life is important. I was told by this voice i needed to speak to a ""forsighter"" to truly believe. I was told to trust and help and be truthful of who i am to the one i love for there is little time left to fix anything and that i need to forgive all whove done me wrong for the good that they seen to do what they did and that i shouldnt  hold a grudge. As well as he said in 18 days i will learn or lose somthing dear to me. That would be on my birthday. 

The bad voice told me how much of a mess up i was in life and told me the wrong i have done and how i should end it all to atone for what ive done. It seemed to be feeding from my sadness and laughed at my pain. It put me down. Like it wanted me sad. Sadly enough this voice was familiar in many other dreams i remember as a child. Nobody ive ever met in my life just a voice i only herd in a dream.  This voice continued with rants and seem more powerful of me like it had more of a say in what was said. I was told i would never be able to love or feel feeling the way other do Because i lack what is needed to do so.

Him: I think my gf and I’s relationship is coming to an end. I hope you're doing well. I want to talk soon but I'm also going through a difficult transition and don't feel super comfortable till that transition is complete. Probs two weeks at most. I hope you understand. Thanks. 

Me: I understand, no rush. Thanks for communicating with me. Hope everything turns out well. 

*a week later*

Me: Sorry to be wishy washy but I don’t think we should talk. I don’t want Anna to find out we talked and be upset and go to anyone and get me in legal trouble because I acted absolutely insane in the past towards her. 

Him: I understand and I agree. I don’t want to talk when it’s not appropriate. 

Me: Yeah. I don’t want to put my entire livelihood at risk. I just assumed it was going to be appropriate if you were willing to talk but wanted to err on the side of caution 

Him: Well I don’t want that either and whenever I reach out that’s when it would be appropriate

Me: Ok lol sorry it’s confusing cause you reached out a few weeks ago 

Him: I know and I’ve been going through a rough patch and need space and time. So I appreciate your understanding.

Me: I do. I wanna talk but I ruined everything by being a bitch last year. Hope everything is well-ish

Him: Tbh I’m dealing with some mental health issues, I’m kinda at a low and I don’t think I can deal with added stress right now. Please be mindful and helpful by not stressing me more than I can handle at one time. I’ll let you know when I’m in a better place. 

Me: That’s totally fine. I just was apologizing and expressing that I wasn’t upset because I still would enjoy talking to you eventually when you’re ready. I know you don’t wanna talk to me about these issues but if you do you can reach out

Him: I very much appreciate you understanding, thank you

676,"Over the years, I went from not having much direction to really getting my stuff together and doing very well. But I’ve noticed, the more successful I’ve become, the more my family (immediate and relatives) have pulled away. I don’t brag, and most of my family does pretty well for themselves anyway, so there’s not a huge disparity there. But they seemed to be far more interested in me and embraced me much more when I was struggling.

So there's this kid I know who's really nice. He always does his best to help whomever may need it.

Cast: NK: Nice Kid BK: Bad Kid Me: Me. FNK: Friend of nice kid

So friend of nice kid send nice kid his lab report for our final physics project for whatever reason a few days ago. BK did not finish his lab, and sent a few fake suicide threat messages. He used these to get FNK's lab from NK. He now claims that these are not true threats and was just him playing around on a bored day.

Cut to me.

I know the NK pretty well, so when I found out, I was basically screaming through text at BK. I wrote one thing that comes up in here ""BK I hope you die on the streets."" So anyways, I emailed BK's physics teacher, because in all honesty, NK of all people didn't deserve it. No response, but it's been 2 days since. BK is meeting with the teacher for unrelated reasons tomorrow.

So back to the ""BK I hope you die on the streets."" BK tried to blackmail me saying that I sent a death threat after he discovered I sent the email. That's not a death threat, so idk what to do about that.

BK wants me to write an email saying these screenshots were fabricated, but idk what to do if I'm asked about pulling up the texts. What do I do? Do I send the false email like they asked, email the vice principal about this whole situation? What do I do about the so called ""death threat"" which isn't a threat that he's using to blackmail me saying ""oh yeah colleges will love this.""

For example, I’ve been going to the same barber for years and I still get insanely nervous and have to sit in the car for awhile before going inside. Well I’ve met my girlfriends immediately family but I’m supposed to be going to a barbecue at her house in about an hour... I’ve had diarrhea 9 times today And threw up twice. My nerves are going crazy. I know more of her relatives are there that I’ve never met and I’m just... I don’t know how to calm down. My stomach won’t stop hurting, I can’t eat. The craziest thing is, once I actually get there and get settled, all the nerves go away, and I feel perfectly fine. Including the barber, as soon as I sit down and tell him what I want my nerves disappear.

They’ve been broken up for 6 months now but due to me respecting Bret’s wishes and not talking to jasmine we’ve grown distant and aren’t really friends anymore.

685,"So me (21 f) and my friend (23 f) have been friends for 7 years now. We met through football, and we still share that hobby. We had a great relationship, and we always had so much fun. However, things began to change. She started putting me down, and make fun of me in front of other friends. I got really insecure, because she would always make mean and nasty comments. It came to a point where I was afraid to say certain things to her, because she might get angry. Then some things happened, which I won't describe due to personal reasons, that really fucked me up. She really hurted me and crossed the line, and still I forgave her. Now I know I did that because I knew I was her only friend, and I knew she'd be really upset if she lost me as a friend. So I decided to tell her what was bothering me, and she said she would work on it. I was sceptical, because she told me that loads of times before. But this time she did work on it, and she was finally able to socialise in a way that hurted nobody. She even made some new friends. But then I noticed she still treated me like dirt, even tough I helped her through all the shit she has been through. But when she was with her new friends, she behaved like an entirely different person. She was so nice and understanding. It really hurted me to see that she could be supportive and loving, but that she just chose not to be like that with me.

 Now I finally see how toxic she is, and how she drains my energy. I know she doesn't do it on purpose, and that she probably doesn't want to hurt me, but I'm done with this friendship, and I just don't want us to be as close as we were, since she really really fucked it up.

I did try to talk to her, but she always misses the point and never listens to me, waving it off as me being dramatic and egoistic.

Lately I've been really sad about all this, and I'm scared of hurting her. I just want us to seperate in the least painful way for the both of us. Mainly because it's a bit bittersweet, since I did have some of the best moments ever with her. I just want to close this chapter and move on with my life. 

So how can I make it clear to her that I am no longer putting up with her shit and that I'm just done overall?",16Jun2019,1
686,"Background info: 
Okay so my cousin (moms nephew, 30) and his wife and baby have been staying with us the past week or so while they find a apartment. 
My culture is really family oriented so I treat and address him like an older brother. 
My family on my mother’s side is (the only word that comes to mind) problematic. They had a super abusive father and I’m guessing that was passed down to everybody. 
I’ve known that my cousin is already a huge douche bag and is sexist and just a weirdly entitled big boot navy guy. 
He refused to marry my sister in law (his now wife) unless she was at a certain weight and told her her cheeks were to fat to marry. (Arranged marriage)
Also he apparently made her parents so uncomfortable that they had to leave. 
My sister in law is very soft spoken and sweet, so she doesn’t call out anything making her uncomfortable. 

Okay so I’ve been noticing that he not only verbally abuses my sister in law at any opportunity  (like dropping a spoon when she’s feeding the kid or calling her incompetent when she makes the slightest mistake). Today the kid was eating a cracker and started to choke on it. Me and my sister in law were trying to pat the kids back and get the cracker out of his mouth and my cousin came over and hit her on the shoulder and yelled at her for not being able to feed the kid right. She didn’t say anything but I could feel her embarrassment. 

All this is leaving a really bad taste in my mouth and I don’t know what to do.

Not because I don’t like what he is doing but because he will have such a hard time going forward. His best friend didn’t approve and he is telling my uncle tomorrow. 

My own dad which I have so many memories with is more or less gone forever. All those memories I’ve shared with him will haunt me. I haven’t cried in ages but this shit really hit me hard. I’ll always accept him for who he is, but he has changed his name and everything. My dad is gone, I can’t think of anything else. I have always supported trans people but when it is someone you are close to it’s totally different. Because you knew who they were before they changed and you’ll always miss them. I don’t really have the words for how I’m feeling. I’m scared.

689,"A little background on me. Im a 23 year old guy and I have a degree in automotive technology. I had the intention of going back to school to study diesel technology, but in January, I was hired on by my current employer as a truck technician under the impression that they were going to train me. I told the manager multiple times before he even scheduled my interview that I had zero experience with the heavy duty industry. 

Fast forward to now, 6 months later, I feel as though I have not recieved the training that I was told I would be given. I have only shadowed a more experienced technician 3 times in 6 months. Instead of having someone more experienced show me the ropes, they have taken the ""thrown to the wolves"" approach, where I have been given work that I have never done before. So whenever I inevitably mess something up, the manager gets upset. I have been written up twice so far for messing something up even though I had no prior training or experience. 

Ive talked to the manager about this and expressed my concerns. His response was ""Someone else cant show you every nut and bolt"" after I reminded him that he brought me on completely green. 

I feel as though Ive been cheated, and I feel as though giving me this level of work is dangerous. When everything on a truck weighs more than 50 pounds, I dont feel as though a sink or swim approach should be taken on a green hire. That can get someone hurt. 

So Ive put in applications at a couple of places I know would give me the training I require, Ive gotten a matched offer from one and Im waiting to hear back from the other. Im just curious as to how I should approach resigning. On Friday (Jun 14) I was sent home early in the day for messing something up. Again a repair that I had little experience with. Im fed up with getting yelled at, Im fed up with being deceived, Im fed up with the company altogether.

I know it isn't professional to leave effective immediately, but I can read the writing on the wall and I'd rather not be fired for something I have little control over.

I have a friend who works at one of the places I applied to, and the more I talk to him and compare our places of employment, the more I realize how backwards and utterly unsafe our shop is, and I really want no part of it anymore. 

Any and all advice is welcome and appreciated. Thank you.",16Jun2019,2

They went through a collegue's phone to look at a convo she had with my brother and saw him call one of my bosses 'a litte bitchy' and told me I'm on thin ice and just yelled at me, they then called me agressive for saying I didn't write it and they should back off.

I’ve never really been any good at talking about girl issues and stuff and I usually turn to the bible for sexual advice (I have raised her Catholic as I am ) and have basically taught her about sex and relationships from this.

I was watching tv today and I heard noises coming form her bedroom so I went to see if she was okay. I opened her bedroom door and I caught her masterbating. She screamed and has locked herself in her room. She was crying a lot and doesn’t want to speak to me about it.

I have taught her that this kind of behaviour is wrong and sinful, she knows this but I don’t know how to make sure she doesn’t do this again.

She is a practicing catholic and comes to church and mass with me and has read the bible .

I have organised a meeting with our priest to help her to overcome these urges, the thing is I don’t think it will do any good. I can’t be sure that she will stop.

701,"

Background: i just moved to a new state and into my newly renovated appartment( nicest place i have ever lived in my entire life) it is a half ground level apartment of a 3 story building. I started a new job and just love everything about my new town, job, and apartment except the upstairs neighbors. The unit i have is on the backside of the building and near the fear exit. If you live 8 of the 10 units (all 2nd or 3rd level ) you use the front side entrance and have an easy access to the parking lot. The other 2 units are half submerged and located in the rear of the building.  In order to get to the front side from my unit you have to go through a maze of hallways that lead through the utulatie rooms for all the other units. This is important because i only see the family when they take the kids to play in the back yard and no other contact. 

The problem begins when i first move in. There is a van parked in my assigned spot ( most of the units are not occupied due to renovations so no big deal) . As i move in early in the day i hear lots of normal foot traffic above men doors and cabbnets opening/closing, toilets flush all normal. Then around noon every day a herd of elephants run from one end back and forth stomping, sliding chairs(the screeching sound) and high pitch screeching. I start my night shift rotation in a few weeks and this will be a problem my bedroom under the master bedroom of the above unit yet i still hear constant stomping of little feet. This is not a normal amount of noise ( i have lived in other complexes with families) . 

I has talked to my other ground floor neighbor about the noise and they told me other issues they have had with this family. They constantly use their ethnicity to stonewall any requests from neighbors. I'm not asking for complete silence but running all day long and dragging chairs all day is just to much when i pay for reasonable peace and quiet in my own home. The noise often goes past 1am. The kids are both under 10 but older than 5. 

Monday i going to call my landlord and see what they say. I don't want to stir things up but the constant stomping is ridiculous. I don't want to cause any issues with me being new but what is acceptable levels of noise. 

Additional info: i have only been here for 1.5 weeks and this is a daily occurence. It goes at least till midnight and  starts at 8am. I hear kid screeching, chair dragging barking like dogs, and the constant running and jumping. I had a friend come to visit and help unpack and she made comments about the noise without any prompting. 

I would go talk to them in person but i have been warned by a neighbor about their back lashing and retaliation. I have no interaction with any of them apart from seeing them in the backyard.

Again I'm not complaining about normal noises tv, doors/cabinets, walking  ect. But this track and field event they seem to be having is to much.

Tldr;  i work night shift and upstairs neighbors have kids that run and jump constantly from 8am to midnight. The family uses their ethnicity to ignore and retaliate against other neighbors requests. I'm calling the landlord directly rather than talking to them.

&amp;#x200B;

He has made it very clear he has no care for what anybody but my mother thinks of him.

He has no regard for how I feel, and what his actions cause others to feel

His conversations are always the same, he makes any tiny little interaction take 30 mins or more, and if he runs out of things to say he just goes on a loop.

Even when I make him aware of this repeat, he acts like I never even said anything, and then keeps droning on.

He despises when I am doing anything but working and cleaning, even if I have earned it, and will continously both me no matter what I say when I am relaxing.

He hardly speaks to me unless it is for me to come help him with something or he wants to rant to me about things that either have nothing to do with me or things that I find no interest in (which is extremely obvious).

He constantly asks why I never spend time with him, and after explaining why, (He never stops talking and he never lets me speak) he acts like he'll change, doesn't do that, and then wonders why I never spend time with him.

He doesn't have dementia or short term memory

Refuses to go to any mental health professional

And he makes my life a living hell.

&amp;#x200B;

There are many more traits that make him unbearable but I just needed to know if he is normal and how I should essentially cut him out of my life because I'm 17 and I'm so close to being able to leave and never return.

&amp;#x200B;

And before you comment, I have given him every chance to amend for how he has treated me, I opened up to him and really showed him who I really am (I'm pretty stone cold) and after I finished he started fking laughing. I have trusted him and he let me down, and now after my brother betrayed him, he treats him fine and refuses to trust me.

&amp;#x200B;

Today was the first time where I simply told him ""No Dad, I'm not doing this, I'm not going to talk to you for 30 minutes about the problem that we already resolved, I'm just not doing this today"" (Literally all I did was ask if I could grab some candy while at CVS to get some meds for my Sister and when told no I said ""Ouch, ok no candy"" and left it at that! he was going to try to trap me in a ""lesson"" on how I shouldn't expect to be given everything, which no sh\*t I shouldn't expect that.) Well that escalated to him saying that I can either take back what I said IE ""Dad I'm just done with this, and I'm done with you."" or I can pack my bags and leave the house and family because, and I fking quote he ""Is the family"". Yeah. Btw I have a Mother and 2 siblings.

707,"I plan on buying a jeep renegade in the near future and will probably have to purchase one-way tickets to like North Carolina or something like that. the cost of this vehicle will be around $18,500

My dad keeps saying that I'm being dumb and wasting my money by trying to fly out there for one-way tickets and says that driving the car back will put too many miles on it (it has 0, will be around an 800-mile ride home) and that it will cost more than local at the end of the day

708,"So, to begin, I'm 26 and I live with my parents but I have a job and I make my own income, just not enough to currently support myself, therefore we are around each other every day and recently, I've started to change my sense of style. I am an overweight woman and I'm also adopted- my mom is very petite as is my sister. This will come into play later.  
So, recently, I've bought a few crop tops and kind of short shorts since it's extremely hot here in the summer and my job is an outside gig. Usually, I wear t shirts and yoga/exercise pants. I wear crop tops when I want to feel particularly cute and confident and when I walk out of my room or when my mom notices I'm wearing one, she'll say some indirect shit like ""You're shirt's a little short"" in this teasing tone and i'll be like ""Yeah.. it's a crop top."" And when I wear shorts or pants or whatever, I always pull them over my belly and have them high waisted bc it's cute and I hate the feeling of my belly hanging out and whenever I try on new clothes my mom always, always asks ""does it fit over your belly?"" as if it's some requirement for me. Like, even if I didn't like wearing my pants over my stomach, it's none of her business, right?   
Also, when I wear my shorts my mom plays off her dislike for me wearing them as worry for my thighs rubbing together...I have some medical cream for literally that and it works wonders and I've shown it to her so now whenever I come out of my room or wherever wearing my shorts, she just sighs like over and over again almost like a soft scoff-sigh.  
My sister wears tiny tops and shorts and little dresses whenever she visits and my mom doesn't say shit to her and believe me, I pay attention. The kicker: I've found that she tried to keep our housekeeper from washing my shorts in the laundry, putting them in the other basket and when I moved them to the main basket, they were moved back again. I put them again in the main basket on the day our housekeeper came and later that day, they were the only things left, unwashed, in the dirty laundry basket. I almost confronted her but I knew she would come up with some bullshit again so I just threw them in the wash and did it myself.   
What can I do? How can I tell her I feel like she's body shaming me indirectly? How can I tell her that it's my body and my choice what to put on it? It's gotten kind of bad lately.",16Jun2019,0

715,"Basically I have this friend. Let's call him Jon.
Jon is really important to me. We've been friends for awhile and I genuinely consider him one of my best friends.

The problem is, Jon has feelings for me. I've known this for a couple months now.
Everyone's telling me I should have feelings for him too.
If I didn't value our friendship so much, I'd probably be dating him. I'm also just not in the right place right now for a relationship.

The real problem came up when a friend of mine accused me of leading Jon on. I was confused. 
They mentioned how Jon and I facetime all the time, late at night, where I'm dressed 'provocatively'. By provocatively she means my pyjamas, which consists of a t-shirt and underwear. 
I also apparently compliment him too much, touch him too much, and overall lead him on.

I obviously don't want to be leading him on. The last thing I want to do is hurt him somehow, but I just don't know what to do. Jon's my best friend and I don't wanna cut off all contact because he has feelings for me. What do I do?",16Jun2019,1

 I finished my degree in commerce last year and searched for a job for almost 6 months until I found a job in a warehouse for a bigger local company in my area. I don't dislike the job, but it is not what I want to do. I know if I work hard I can work my way up the ladder, however, I am unsure of when I would see a promotion. The current position is in a warehouse, but I could eventually work my way into the office and make a better salary. I really want to pay off my student loans and move out of my parents house. I recently was offered a job with a family friend in a salesman position at a new company he started, I would be making more money than my current job. I also would be his only other employee (save for a few warehouse positions.) I don't know how well the company will do, I also don't know if there would be any room for growth or a pay raise.

722,"This is a short version of the story. 

I met a girl on Reddit and we clicked instantly (because I met her on reddit, I am using a alt account). We talked on the phone for hours for a few days and hung out once irl as friends, not a date. We were out for hours talking and exploring our city. I caught feelings for her HARD.

A few days later after hanging out that one time, she broke up with her partner and then texted me, asking if I could see her. We met at midnight, hung out and talked for hours, walking around the city a bit aimlessly. She suggested we get a hotel, but platonically. She made it clear she's not coming on to me. She just wanted to keep talking and hanging out but not walk around aimlessly late at night/early morning anymore and she didn't want to go home/

We ended up back at my place after we tried to find a room that wouldn't be so expensive but failed. We hung out on my bed, talked for hours, shared a drink, and she admitted that she did have a crush on me when we first met and started talking (but it was implied it was past-tense, as if she didn't have a crush anymore) and I admitted to her that I liked her. Then we fell asleep spooning. Woke up, talked some more. I got a drink for myself and she asked me for one too. She drank it (it was a hard cider can, 12oz, 5%) and got a little fucked. Not blackout, but definitely very tipsy. I'm buzzed and warm but not as bad as her.

She laid on my chest and I began petting her head and caressing her face. She told me she was really horny. I told her I wanted to but it wasn't a good idea. She kept telling me she wanted to. I gave in to my own weakness. My fingers brushed past her lips and she began sucking it. We began kissing, I groped, I gave oral, we had some PIV before I snapped to my senses and stopped. She wanted me to keep going but I made her get dressed.

She laid for a bit, went to the bathroom, came back and I could tell she had come to her senses too. We talked a little bit. She thinks she ruined a friendship. I blame myself. She left. We texted a bit, we both agreed that we don't want to lose a friendship and I said I would give her space to think. That was yesterday and we haven't spoken yet as of rn.

So here's my current dilemma. At first I thought, ""this is wrong. I shouldn't be doing this"" which is why I stopped in the middle of having sex with her. And she told me she really wish it hadn't happened and it was unfortunate. 

But after talking to some people, I'm wondering if I just overreacted and she was just matching my reaction. If I pull out during the middle of it and just tell her to get dressed, it would make sense she would just want to go home. I don't want her to think I was disgusted. I enjoyed it when it was happening. I wanted to do it. But I just felt guilty considering the circumstances. And I wasn't sure it she would have wanted to if she had zero drinks in her system.

So now I'm thinking, sex is just sex. It shouldn't ruin our whole friendship. I feel like I can be how we were before. And I don't want to give her the idea that I just want her for sex. I want her for the friendship. And if it happens again, maybe that's ok? And if not, that's also ok.


Any advice about my situation would be very appreciated. Also, should I message her first or let her message me? And should I basically say what I said here? I don't want to give her the wrong idea, that I just want sex. I would be friends with her even if it meant never having that again. That's not what drew me to her.",16Jun2019,1
723,"Without going into too much detail, a couple years ago I lived somewhere else and made some good friends there. I moved away about a year ago and since then I’ve had almost no contact with most of them, mostly because I suck at keeping in touch with people that I don’t have direct consistent contact with.

I have some free time now and I’ve thought a lot about reaching out and even maybe visiting the area to hang out with them, but I have some crazy anxiety and I can’t seem to bring myself to send a message to anyone. 

I know that my fears are mostly irrational but I’ll list some so you can have an idea of what’s causing my mental block. I worry that enough time has passed that they don’t really care about me, or that they have new friends and don’t need me. Also there was some drama with an ex gf that was also friends with them, and even though there’s no evidence of this, I worry that they’ve heard stuff from her and “took her side” so to speak.

726,"My parents recently grounded me and blamed everything on my computer and phone, I was watching a video for sailing and my mom asked me to show her a knot, I did the knot correctly but my mom said I didn’t, I proved to her I did and she got mad. Later she asked me another question (sorry I forgot) but I answered incorrectly and said I was stupid and that I probably forgot because I was only thinking that I wanted to play on my computer and that all I think about was my computer. 

So here’s some backstory. I am a kid who likes painting and going outside to nature, I also like playing on my computer every now and then and going on a bike. I play table tennis and do tournaments and have an entire book case full of books that I’ve read and still reread quite a lot, and have A’s in my classes. I am an immigrant from Russia and my parents constantly put pressure on me to do well in my classes and always study, they get angry whenever I don’t get a perfect grade on a test and constantly call me brain dead and stupid whenever I forget things. This started ever since I was in 2nd grade and I remember every single time whenever I didn’t understand something how they would yell at me and say how I will never understand anything, now this has cooled down a lot but still happens every now and then.  They were never satisfied with me and made me sign up for sports and things I didn’t want to do. Every day I have to do work for them, read Russian, read English, read Korean, practice violin, go exercise, study math, and then miscellaneous. I’d usually finish all of these things in one day but then they will try their best to make sure I have something else to do. And whenever I have my free time I go on my computer to talk and play with my friends, I have a 1-2 hour limit on my computer very day. 3 years ago I used to have a 20 minute limit and could only play during weekends. Now after working my living soul off for them and still not getting and compliments or satisfaction from them they loosen up a little but get angrier and blame my computer more and more even though my grades are constantly good and I always work hard. They think I only think about my computer and whenever I say something back to them such as how rude and how they’re thinking for me and they don’t know me the way they think they do they call me disrespectful and annoying. I used to love to do science and math but over time of them calling me stupid and brain dead I’ve been slowly wanting to just give up. I always ask my friends for help but all I get from them was some half hearted response like I know how you feel or same or oof. They always say I’m always on my phone even though I’ve used it for only 1 hour in one day and whenever I even turn it on in front of them they start to get really angry and threaten to ground me if I don’t put it away, I’m not allowed to use my phone most of the day and they’re thinking about completely cutting the WiFi and taking my phone away. I’m really tired of doing everything the best I can just for them to blame my phone or computer for whenever I accidentally mess up. It’s been really tough on my mental health and I had some therapy for it but only to have my mom make fun of me for needing someone to talk to and how I’m pathetic to need someone to cry to. I’m so exhausted of this and to think I have at least 3 years left of this makes me very very sick.",16Jun2019,1

My finance \[30M\] (we've been together 3 years) has just gotten an incredible opportunity to move to Barbados for minimum 6 months a year. His employer has given him a great deal, with an raise, car and an apartment paid for.  We expect he would have to work there for 2-3 years for a minimum of 6 months per year in the country. 

I \[24F\] just graduated and was going to start my masters in September. I can only stay in Barbados for a maximum of 6 months. Good to note that we will keep our place back home. I don't know the kind of flexibility I'll have with my studies. I just emailed my future supervisor to ask. 

 I am not sure what to think about this whole thing.

I worry about putting myself behind in life if I can't figure out the masters with some time spent abroad. We don't really want to spent months apart.  I am worried about my independence and happiness if I just tag along. Am I overthinking? Will I like it there? Should I just go and say eff it to the masters?

740,"Okay, so at the beginning of the year, I moved away to a huge school. I had no friends, and being the socially awkward trash I am, I was not going to talk to someone first. Thankfully, two people became really good friends with me in my math class. They then introduced me to someone who I will always regret talking to. Let’s call him J. He obviously didn’t know how to talk to girls, so I gave him a shot. He was one of those quiet kids in the back who liked anime and stuff, but there’s nothing wrong with that. He was also sort of socially awkward, so I could relate to him more. It was kind of annoying on how he would constantly stare at me and try to get my attention, but I told myself it was fine. I finally had friends there. Skip to a month later, and I find out from one of the friends (let’s call her M) who introduced me to J that J had asked them to talk to me first. Enter the other friend who introduced me to J. Let’s call him L. L had also asked them to talk to me first, but L eventually gave up and went up and talked to me. M had told me that L liked me, and J overheard. Later that week, he distanced himself from L. I was like okay, that sucks, I guess. Then L told me he liked me himself and I told him I would like to stay friends (and we still are). That’s when all hell broke loose. J found out about the confession and then he started to text me anytime he could and wanted me to stay up late talking to him. He make me really uncomfortable (saying things about my body, flirting, telling inappropriate jokes, etc) over the texts and eventually I told him I wouldn’t stay up talking to him. He then started to get physical. He would come up behind me and hug me, try to get our hands to touch, try to play footsies under tables, etc. I told him I wasn’t comfortable with the hugging, but he just saw this as me telling him that he should continue the hugging. Over winter break, we started to talk less, thank god, but then on Valentine’s Day, this kid thinks it’s a good idea to confess to me in front of the class. He whips out a huge box of chocolates (which I am allergic to) and says “Wanna go on a date with me?” I friend zoned the kid and told him I was allergic to the chocolates. He got defensive and said it was a friendly gesture.

...excuse me, what the fuck? A friendly gesture, yeah, okay. Anyways, he got a new phone after spring break and proceeded to corner me and put my number into his phone. He then invites himself to my lunch table, which was already crowded enough, causing some of my friends to get kicked out. Enter R. R is one of my amazing friends who absolutely DESPISES J. She decides to take my phone and text him a bunch of crap. Thinking it was me, he starts with the flirting and inappropriate jokes. R deletes his number, thank god.

About 2 months later, I find out that my other friend (let’s call her K) also has been dealing with this guy. Apparently, there‘s some sort of  hate club that’s full of girls that he hit on. K doesn’t try to act nice to him, but I do because I don’t like confrontation. Anyways, it’s summer now and he constantly tries to contact me.

He  was part of an informal camera club who I learned of through word-of-mouth.  I didn’t sign a release form. 

How he behaved when I complied: he was fine; nothing inappropriate. I wasn’t really offended by his request; I suppose he had a right to see what he was paying for.

743,"Hey y’all, I have been married for a year now and my husband’s sister in law (his brother’s wife) has been acting weird since the start. First of, right after we got engaged she created a ‘Family Group’ on WhatsApp and added all his siblings and their significant others but me. I took this as something petty at first and as I was busy with the wedding I didn’t give it much thought. But she doesn’t add me to the group even after the wedding and every time my husband and I are together, for example our honeymoon she keeps engaging him on conversation in the group.

Recently on his phone I see a lot of conversation going back and forth her and my husband. And all the conversation in the WhatsApp group is only directed towards my husband, never me. So again I was like your sister in law is weird and my husband gets very defensive and angry. He was like never trash talk anybody. You need to stop talking ill of others and things like that.

When I picked up I said “happy Father’s Day” and all he said was “it’s almost 3:00 I’ve been waiting for your call, are you still there?” And when I said yes he said “whatever, have a good day.” And hung up on me. My biological father had visitations with me every weekend so he could take me to do things like get food or go to the park. He kept on it when I was very young, but as I got older he stopped coming around and he would skip out on visits leaving me sitting and wasting a whole day waiting for him. This has caused me to sort of lose my love for him that I once had. I know I should feel bad because he feels he’s been replaced my my stepfather, but he really has.

750,"Hello, I keep getting these anxious thoughts and obsessive thoughts. They keep circulating my head, they don’t go away. I try to rationalize with them but even when I make a fair point, minutes a lot of the time seconds later they come back.

I feel hopeless I need help, I can’t afford a therapist or anything like that. I would really like to hear what you guys do when you experience these thoughts? How do you control them? Any activities I can pick up that’ll stop them? How about mindful tricks? Is there anything I can do when these thoughts or feelings arise, to make them drift away without having to obsess over them and rationalize with them? Rationalizing with them seems to calm me down but it just comes back seconds later and I can’t constantly keep rationalizing(that’s what I’ve been doing), because it sycks all my energy out


For example a very prominent thought that circles my head is how I’ll always be socially anxious, or how I’m a looser or pathetic. Just negative stuff, I tell myself that When I work out, meditate, do NoFap, take cold showers, eat healthy, and spend time outside, my life will improve. But none the less seconds later I’m thinking the same thing, sometimes it not even a thought but a feeling of despair and dread, and I obsessively tell my self how I’ll do all those things, but in the end that just takes out so much of my energy having to rationalize and reassure myself.",16Jun2019,1
751,"I got a D grade in both semesters of Math Honors III (precalculus) because, well, it's a difficult class with a difficult, pedantic teacher.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I'm stuck at a crossroads. I'm unsure whether or not I should retake the class entirely, or if I should go do online summer school at The Virtual high School because my school doesn't offer a summer course for the class.

&amp;#x200B;

The teacher and I really didn't see eye to eye. She loved to stress students out purposefully with tests day after day, and, whenever I asked for help, she would tell me to ""look in the book"" repeatedly, even when I came back and still couldn't find an answer. Regardless of that, I still fought and fought and fought to have a C, until the final completely blew back all my efforts in my face.

&amp;#x200B;

If at all possible, I want to avoid taking her class again.

&amp;#x200B;

My goal for college is a UC school, and this class is the only class that seems to stand in the way of my almost blemishless transcript. 

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do? This has stressed me out since the end of the school year.

753,"I've had this friend for ten years, we've been best friends for pretty much half of my life. The last couple of years however, she's gotten a new gang of friends (+ a boyfriend). Now don't get me wrong, im genuinely happy for her! I have a new friendgroup as well so I understand why our relationship might have been pushed back a bit.

However, it's come to the point where I feel like I don't know her anymore. We only talk in a groupchat with mutual friends, and hang out in real life every other month. I know it's partly because she's had some mental health problems, but I cant help but feel she doesnt treat her other friends like this.

She doesn't seem interested in my life, and barely invites me to anything she likes, so I barely know any of her interests anymore. She even became religious without telling me, and it honestly REALLY hurt. Wouldn't you tell your best friend about something so major immediately? It feels like she's just keeping me around out of obligation, and not because she actually likes me anymore.

Am I being unfair to her? I know I can be a bit dranatic sometimes, but every time I talk to her I get the same nagging feeling she doesn't actually care. But then she goes and calls me her best friend, and claims she's missed me when we do meet up. Then its like I dont exist again for another few months, while I see her meeting up with mutual friends on the side.

Am I justified in being upset with her over all of this? Or am I overreacting and should work on getting over these feelings on my own?",16Jun2019,1
755,"I was hired after graduating college three years ago by a small company, that later got acquired by a much larger company. The larger company was nice enough to keep staff that was already here, but many people left. 

I was trained under the smaller company that required me to learn a TON of additional tasks outside of my degrees field of study. I'm still expected to use those skills working for the bigger company, but new hires in my field are not asked to cross train in some of those areas. 

There were some rumors that on top of that, that the bigger company is hiring new grads at about 5-7 dollars more per hour than I started at. Most of the brand new hires still make several dollars more per hour than me even despite the fact I've gotten raises each of the three years. 

Those rumors are just rumors anymore. I know for a fact they make quite a bit more, to do less work. And I'm not cool with it but I don't really know what to do...

757,"Normally, I don’t talk about this stuff, but since it’s a bunch of strangers, why not?

There’s this guy who was in my first period. He’s one of the loud, popular kids who everyone knows and loves. According to my friend, he’s one of the heartthrobs of the school. I had a mini crush on this guy. Anyways, he didn’t really notice me in the first semester (since I literally had no friends at the time), but in the second semester I got more comfortable and started talking and gaining more friends. He started to look at me a lot, but whenever I would catch him, he would snap his head away and avoid eye contact whenever I faced his direction. I thought it was because of the eczema on my face because I’m fucking hideous when I get flare ups. My crush on this guy sort of developed more over time, and my friend says we would just look at each other and look away. Maybe she’s just saying that cause she knows I like him? What if he’s just looking at my face because of my eczema? I don’t know. Anyways, later on, he and his friends started making fun of me for the smallest things. This made me think that he was just looking at me because of my eczema to make fun of it.

Skip to the last day of school. My friend tells me to wait where I am and then runs over to him and his friends. She tells him something and then she runs back. She tells me that she told him about my crush on him and I start panicking. I’m kinda mad at her since she literally told the guy I like that I like him out of nowhere but that’s fine, my anxiety isn’t that bad (sarcasm, if you couldn’t tell). She tells me him and his friends are coming my way and I look back and see his friends laughing and stuff and him slowly walking over to me. My friends prances away and I think I’m dead at this point. Then thank the goddamn lord, one of my other friends calls me over to hangout with her and like the coward I am, I escape my problems. Now it’s summer and I have no idea what was gonna happen if I would’ve stayed, but I think he would’ve told me he didn’t like me.

I joke around with her, we have banter and all the great friend stuff.

However recently she opened up about her troublesome life. I wont get into details but she has troubles at home.
This situation is taking its toll on her school performance, and it worries me.
There are others who know about her situation and she doesn't seem to mind sharing her problems.

Others know about her problems too, not too many but they do. Yet when she wants to talk about it, she goes to me more often then others.
Even when she goes to do something fun to get her mind off things, she invites me.

Of course since I am a young guy, I am taking this as signs of her liking me. 

And that worries me.

I know she comes to me for distraction, not for love.
But my young desperate mind constantly views it as romantic attraction. And if this keeps up I believe I will view her differently. And that I will come to hang out with her for the wrong reasons.

My worst fear is that I'll become too agressive if I continue with this mindset. I am scared of this because of her past.

How do I keep myself from attaching myself to her for the wrong reason?
How do I shake this constant feeling of her loving me?

761,"I work in a large hotel/bar/restaurant and over the last few months of working there have made friends with some of the people I work with. One of the girls I'm friends with was sat at the bar with me tonight after we finished early. I'm the closest female friend she has there. She saw me glance at one of the creepy chefs further down the bar (knowing I particularly don't like him and another creepy chef). She told me that he wasn't allowed to speak to us anymore, he's creepy so I said thank god, although he does speak to me whilst on shift. They don't have shifts together anymore. A few weeks ago she told me she hated him but dodged why. They seemed friendly when I started (she started just before me) and I remember a particular evening right before she started hating him that's always stuck in my mind. That was the night he raped her. I remember some things about that morning too that stuck in my mind and I keep replaying things in my head about what I should have done, I should have known, I could have helped even accidentally etc. Tonight she said she'd tell me why he isn't allowed to speak to us anymore, but then it seemed like she would get distracted/apprehensive and definitely couldn't say it out loud. She told some of the guys we're friends with that we were whispering about girl stuff and they lost interest, so she wrote it down on her phone in a note and showed it to me after making me promise I wouldn't say anything. Her hands were shaking as she showed me so I almost felt like I hadn't read her screen right when I got to the bit actually saying that he raped her. She's been really emotionally shut down and there's so many things that add up now. But I then asked, writing it on my phone, did he attempt or did he, and she said he did. I didn't have a chance to ask more and I didn't want to grill her about it. She said she talked to the manager about it and they wont do anything except keep him away from her unless she goes to the police. It's been a few months since it happened and at first they definitely didn't do enough from what I can piece together but they've done more recently stopping him speaking to her but apparently also the other young women etc. It was hard to even go to the bar for work related reasons with the older creepy men drinking there after their shifts, limiting their alcohol didn't seem to work at first so they're pretty much not welcome anymore at risk of losing their jobs.

Except why haven't they lost their jobs. Why hasn't he lost his job. Why is he still working there? My partner thought perhaps they just don't fully believe her, because why else would they not do more!? Except, bias aside, statistics aside, everything about that night stuck in my head and the thought that he had done something already crossed my mind briefly at the time but I dismissed it, before she told me. He is very creepy. Skin crawl creepy. Most of them are and honestly it comes straight from the top, that is why they can get away with it.

Tonight after I read that of course I had to act normal. Later I asked her if her best friend who works there got this new job he wanted (A really nice normal guy, the kind who can't do enough for his friends and is very trustworthy), would she leave too. She said not unless she finds something better because (she didn't have to say but I already pieced it together that she works completely different times of day to this man since the time it happened, and the few times she hasn't has been when he isn't there) and because the pay is good for the work we do and she has a good group of friends there and she enjoys the work. There really isn't much opportunity around, let alone a job that pays above minimum and we get tips.

I don't know how to express to her that not only do I believe her I will support her and fight for her. I don't want to force her into some heart to heart that she clearly isn't ready for, I just want her to feel that I am fucking there for her. I deleted the man on Facebook as soon as I got home and I cried. I felt hysterical by the time I got home after holding it all in and smiling and laughing, I can't imagine what this has been like for her. Now I want to leave or work different shifts to this man. I felt hysterical and physically like I wanted to vomit as soon as I got in the car but Idk how I can find another job. I doubt they could manage to prevent me from ever having to work with him because of how complicated that would start to get with shifts and it's not like he's done anything to me to warrant that effort on their part. I also don't just want to leave over what happened to her and leave her there. I don't even know how I could leave because it's in an extremely remote location meaning that they struggle to get employees, whereas everywhere else in the area there's about 50-100 applicants to every job and I just could not get a job. I was offered a job with less hours  just before I started at this place but I need the hours. My partner is in full time study so my wage pays for everything we have. We don't have much so I really do feel trapped at this place of work until my partner graduates. Except he does not want me to work there anymore now and I understand that. The harassment nature of the older men comes from the very top. It's shown me how decent young men really are. Even though most of the young women are of legal age, most of the younger men call the older men out/call them paedos etc because they're old and creepy. I can no longer tolerate it knowing that there's a rapist, of my friend, working in the kitchen.

How do I best help her? Do I speak to management about this? If I could find a new job do I go or stay? What do I do moving forward? I don't even know how to act. I feel sick that I can't see how this has been taken seriously enough. My manager literally told me last night (probably thinking I already knew) that she's only a year older than me and she doesn't feel like she has the life experience to handle being a manager.

I talked to my dad about this and he said if he was the owner, he'd force the rapist to resign any means necessary. The thing is, the owner takes in these stray men with no friends, no family, no history, alcoholics etc. The exact kind of men that are the way they are in the place in their life they're at at the age they are FOR A REASON. They're hiding and they've lost everything. He seems invested in getting them back on their feet. They live in apartments at the hotel or staff accommodation and the owner pities them and gives them chance after chance - more than anyone else gets. The owner is quite creepy himself, not that I'm accusing him of anything at all, he has a wife and adult children, but he's completely inappropriate with some of us. One of the men who work there called him a dirty old git after overhearing how he speaks to me and I just said I just act like I don't know he's being inappropriate. I don't think I can do that now. I'm so angry at the owner and management for not doing more. I cannot work with the man who raped my friend let alone a rapist in general. I have no idea who else knows or how she is coping, she's been completely emotionally shut down and since she told me tonight it makes so much sense.

I started throwing up from drinking and i got placed into a bunk bed and the person who’s house it was, was in the bed under me, also very drunk. Long story short, he and i had sex, and his friends walked in on us. When i left, my uber account wouldn’t let me order a ride, so the 3 friends who walked in on us all walked to ihop. They kept on asking me questions, and i, in my drunken state, told them everything. Now the issue is i told people when i was drunk, what happened, but he doesn’t want anyone to know ( i go to a small school, word gets around fast). I wanted to avoid a situation like this one arising, and C was supposed to stay with me, but she left with her other friend. Is there anything i can do to stop this information from spreading?

764,"My mom had an affair with my dad's nephew. (Starting off with a bang.....no pun intended.) That was about 3 years ago now. My mom was always a stay at home mom. Got everything she wanted (make up, clothes, cars, etc). Once all the kids grew up she started to have, what seems to be, a never ending midlife crisis. Starting talking to the nephew and had a full on affair for about 15 months. My dad found out and things were rough, obviously. They tried to make it work, but ultimately ended up getting a divorce last October. (The nephew decided to work things out with his wife....shocking.)

My mom works at a grocery store now. Her first job in nearly 30 years. She ended up somehow getting $500 a month paid to her from my dad for alimony. He has to pay this for the next 7 years. 

She choose to move closer to her sister, and further away from her kids. Her sister was always on her side and she thought we shouldn't have been upset about everything because it's ""not our business."" She moved into a luxury apartment. Her apartment was less than 1,000 sqft and she paid over a 1,000 a month for it with the help of my dad. She bought a used 2016 Kia forte in cash for like 13,000. Money she got from her parent's death. (She doesn't have that money anymore. Spent it within a year). She bought A LOT of new things for her apartment. Like a painting of a cat drinking wine that was over $100. Bottom line....the lady can spend money. 

Now she lives in a very nice condo that she bought. She pays over 1100 a month for it. She moved in that place because that is where her sister lives also. They are in walking distance apart from each other. The only reason she can afford it, is because my dad money pays for nearly half of her mortgage.

In the divorce agreement, she gave my dad a year to refinance the house they own in his name or they will have to sell it and split the profit, if there is any. My dad has been working under the table for quite some time now. She profited off of that fact for a while too. As of the beginning of this year he is working on the books. But it doesn't seem like he will be able to refinance the house in his name. Because of this, he asked her if he and my younger brother, who lives with him, could stay there and pay the mortgage off until he dies and then the house will be solely hers to do with what she pleases. She said no. She wants to sell it and get money now. 

My sister contacted her to ask her why she won't work with our dad and why she is being so cold and greedy. That turned into a nasty argument and they are not speaking. Long time coming really. My mom never makes time for any of us or our kids, but it seems to upset my sister and her kids a lot more than anyone else. 

My mom called my dad a bunch of names and said a lot of mean and untrue stuff to my sister and about her. She said the only reason she wants to sell the house is because she ""deserves to have money in her savings."" Which she could have had if she didn't live so lavishly. 

So, now I'm not sure what I should do. Technically, I was not involved in any of this. I am trying to work with my dad now on finding a way for us to keep the house. He only has 10 years left to pay it off and its our family home. I feel like it would be wrong to see it go, just so she can have even more money. I am very close with my sister, dad, and brother now and a big part of me feels like I should cut her off in support of them and because I agree that she is being very greedy and selfish. But I'm not sure if i should even get involved. 

I don't feel like I really have a mom anymore anyways. She wants to act like a 25 year old....she doesn't want to act like a mom or grandma. My daughter asks about her though. 

So, should I tell her to fuck off with her money? Or still go to her occasional dinners, listen to her talk about herself, spoil my daughter too much, just so i can say i have somewhat of a relationship with my mother?",16Jun2019,7

775,"I'll try to explain the situation as concisely as I can, but I'm having a bit of trouble rallying my thoughts at the moment so if I get a bit rambly, please bear with me.


Ok, so this weekend I (male) agreed to help my friend (female) with getting to and from work, and with getting to her friends birthday party. My friend injured her hand in a car accident and can't drive for several weeks, and since she lives in the countryside I've been trying to help her out when I can. Since I was helping out I got invited to stay at the party despite not really knowing anyone there, which I would have rather avoided, but it saved me a good few miles driving in the morning so I accepted the invite.


Since I was driving in the morning I cut my own night short about midnight after a few beers, and headed back to the house we were staying at on my own.  We were sleeping on a mattress on the floor in the living, while the birthday girls dad was sleeping on the sofa. I managed to get a few hours sleep, before the rest of the party got home, all absolutely wasted.  After about half an hour of drunkenly stumbling around, everyone went to bed.

So I'm lying in bed struggling to get back to sleep after all the commotion, when I start to hear some heavy breathing and the mattress I'm on shaking.  At first I'm just trying to ignore it as best I can, like most people would in an embarrassing situation like that, but then I realise the breathing has a destictly male sound to it which makes me look over. I can see the birthday girls dad has come off the sofa and onto the mattress and is all over my friend. At first I roll back over, embarrassed that I saw both of them together, him being a married man and much older than her, but then it dawns on me, in my slightly drunk half-asleep state, that my friend is totally passed out from the drink or who knows what else at this point. I hear him fumbling with his belt and at that point I stumble out of the bed and switch the light on, by the time I turn back around my friends awake and the would be rapist has composed himself enough to were my friend doesn't seem to notice anything amiss. After getting yelled at for waking her up I tell her I needed to go for a piss, and by the time I've come out of the bathroom a queues formed to get in so I just head back to bed.

Next back to bed is my friend, followed by this fucking scumbag who again tries to get back into bed next to her before being firmly told to fuck off back to the sofa by her. After lying on the sofa awhile he tries coming back down when he thinks she's sleeping, but luckily she's not nearly as deeply asleep and she wakes up. He makes an excuse that he can't stretch out on the sofa so she agrees to swap places with him. Again, as soon as he thinks she's asleep his hands start wandering again, so she gets off the sofa and comes to sleep next to me, with myself between the two of them, which finally gets him to give up.


After talking to her today, she's too drunk to remember much of the night, but she does remember the last couple of attempts he made. She was creeped out/embarrassed by it, but him and his whole family are really close friends to her, and she sort of excused the behaviour due to drunkenness. I just didn't have the heart to tell her what I'd seen earlier in the night right then.


This is really fucking me up guys, I have no idea what I should do at this point. I keep going over the memory and thinking about how I should have acted more decisively, called him out on the spot instead of letting him try to play it off when I caught him the first time. I keep thinking about reporting it as a crime, but with the only evidence being one half asleep, half drunk eyewitness in a dark room, I can't see it going anywhere. Should I just tell my friend, but if so how do you break it to someone that one of their closest family friends attempted to rape them? Would anyone even believe me anyway? I'm the outsider in this situation, I'm a single guy who's very quiet, and who left the party early while trying to stay more sober than anyone else, I feel like ever one would be far more likely to believe that I was the perpetrator here rather than the happily married older man. Doing nothing seems equally fucked, i doubt this was his first time attempting something like this, and has a daughter, and she has friends, and they all often stay at his house. My friend stays at theirs a lot as well, what if this has just boosted his confidence, he'd have no shortage of opportunities to spike drinks etc.


Honestly at this point any advice is welcome, as I said I'm a quiet guy and not too good at communication, I have no idea how I'd go about discussing a subject as fucked as this with any of my irl friends just yet. 

Tl;dr stopped a drunk guy from raping my friend but have no idea wtf to do now",16Jun2019,8
777,"So basically I have an issue, which stems from a larger issue. I’ve been single for a bit now, and my last relationship was a doozy, and a long one so I’ve been out of the dating scene for a while. I don’t typically meet new people often so I’ve taken a bit to online dating, issue is I’m more of an in person type of person, talking to a stranger online gets, for lack of a better word, tedious. I’m asking if you guys have used online dating techniques if it worked out for you, and how did you guys keep the conversation going? How did you guys get it to not go stale after like a day?",16Jun2019,1

779,"Disclaimer; I’m not asking anyone to hold my hand through this, I’m just looking for a place to start. I understand that most of the burden of this is on me, please be gentle - I know reddit feels *very strongly* about entitled 20 somethings. For more context, I’m a white female, idk I feel like most people assume redditors are dudes and it might be slightly relevant.

TLDR: I grew up spoiled and depressed and without a sense of self, and now I’m an alcoholic 21 year old who’s lazy as hell, unmotivated, angry, and directionless in life. I’m almost at rock bottom and my options are either to run off into the woods or build my life back up, I need help achieving the latter. 

I don’t know what to say without writing a novel about my life (I won’t). I had a great childhood except my parents supported me in every way except my mental health and my mom was also just ridiculous (objectively, not just from my spoiled POV, I’ve asked friends/family/etc). She was anxious and overbearing and I was never allowed to take matters into my own hands so I never learned to make mistakes and mend them. I was constantly yelled at for my depression and anxiety and eating disorder. Now I’m just constantly making mistakes and they’re piling up and I feel like I’m drowning. All my soccer trophies and track medals and straight A report cards don’t mean shit as an adult and I’m trying to navigate being on my own, finding friends and my sense of self, and passing my university classes all while balancing basic things like laundry and taxes and making nutritious meals for myself. I’m imploding and I’m turning to alcohol and addy and coke to cope while also failing my classes. 

My main issue is that my course work is rough. I’m in a hard major at a school that has 10 week terms year round. No breaks except a week between classes, insanely fast paced. I handled it okay but now I’m burning out. I need to finish my last year, transferring isn’t an option. I need a degree. I could just get it done if I didn’t also have to, ya know, take care of myself outside of classes. I’m so overwhelmed that I can’t do ANYTHING now: I don’t do classwork or housework or basic self care. I spend all my money at the bar and all my time sleeping or making friends with sketchy people that I can sleep with to get money or uppers or both. I’m empty inside and I want to turn my life around before I waste my youth (and safety and all my money). Where do I start? How do I break out of this cycle?! 

I definitely have mental health issues and self esteem problems I need to work through, but I can’t afford therapy. Can’t go to free therapy at school bc they said I need outside help, don’t qualify for community groups (I’m considered privileged in my city so help goes to the under privileged first), can’t afford the rates of local therapists, can’t tell my parents I need therapy, can’t get my own insurance. Trust me I’ve gone through EVERY option. Intense therapy is in my future but not right now. I have a job but I don’t get benefits as it’s part time and even if I did save my money I’d need to go sober cold turkey for a while and I just can’t handle that right now. I think I’d jump off a bridge if I had to do that for even a month until I could start paying for the cheapest therapist in my city. 

I sound so desperate and gross but I’ve gotten great help from reddit before. I know I’ll get some tough love probably but I appreciate any responses. Thanks in advanced",16Jun2019,1
780,"A few months ago, I got in a small car crash that I was the passenger. Nobody was injured, and before that I'd never been in a car crash ever, so it was pretty worrying for me. Since that day, no matter who's driving, or how slow we're going, I get very scared everytime we drive that we won't be able to slow down quick enough or someone will crash into us or the car will flip etc. I cannot under any circumstance afford therapy/counselling so is there anything else I can do to move past this?",16Jun2019,1
781,"My parents divorced when I was just entering middle school, and since then me and my siblings and I have been switching houses back and forth every week. One week with my mom, one week with my dad. However, I just turned 18 and am sick and tired of moving houses, and I don’t know what to do.

I have a little brother who, by the divorce decree and because he’s underage, has to keep switching houses.  I want to stay with my little brother, to provide that sibling support before I go off to school, but I don’t want to switch houses anymore. My older brother lives with my mom, but we don’t particularly get along. My dad and stepmom just got a new puppy and said that my dog could no longer come over to his house with us, and I don’t want to give her up every other week because it breaks my heart to give her up.

I’m in a huge predicament because I want to be there for my little brother, and I don’t want to pick a “favorite parent” per se, I don’t want to leave my dog, but I’m so done switching houses....and I don’t know what to do.",16Jun2019,2
782,"A little back story first. My parents have been divorced for over 10 years. Before and after the divorce he used my mom's identity to take out loans, credit, rentals, etc, thus destroyed my mom's credit score. My mom wasn't able to be present since she had to leave the country to make money for us since he doesn't pay child support. She also didn't press charges because she didn't know what to do. He was not a great father either but he does care about me and my sister. I don't believe that he would do anything to hurt us.... at least this is what I want to believe.

He went back to our home country about 6 years ago after he lost his job. I only saw him twice when I visited and he occasionally calls to ask if we are ok but it's a very one sided conversation. I have gone to therapy and went through a lot of self care to work on personal and family trauma. I  tried to move on and not think about him. As of this year, he suddenly stated that he is visiting and will move back to Canada in about 2 years.

I was terrified because I didn't know what he wants. He still talks to us like we are 15 even though we are both over 20. When we saw him, he said he was making a will for us and needs our information. He has my ID from my home country and said he needed my sisters. He needed something that does not expire. Somehow he convinced us that he needs a copy of my sisters passport and social security. I felt something was off but I wanted to believe he wouldn't do anything to hurt us. He also kept saying to not tell our mother. After she gave it to him, I started realizing this may be dangerous. Talking to my mom did not help since she just verified that he does shady things.

I am extremely worried now. I should have listened to my gut and stopped it. I thought that since they were different ages, sex, and last names, he can't do much with my sisters SS. I also found out after that you do not need this info for a will. 

My anxiety is not helping me atm. I don't know what to do or how to prepare for what may or may not happen. What can he do with all this information and how can we protect ourselves? Is there anything we can do to protect ourselves before anything happens?",16Jun2019,1

For the last couple of months I have basically been browsing reddit and discord, watching youtube, and playing overwatch and minecraft.

I am getting kinda sick of only doing that.

I was thinking of going to the gym, but it is expensive, and I don't really know much about it.

I am also going on holiday in 10 days, and basically i won't really be at home until the 13th August.

I did used to go to a running club, but I started going less, and even at my peak I was the slowest because I was new, and I don't wanna go back there until I am fitter

I don't really just wanna run or bike around the city not doing anything coz it just feels awkward.

I want to be doing something more interesting, and also be less of a fat fuck.

Yeah I just want ideas on activities I can do or whatever.

785,"I have an art teacher who seems to be really invested in me. She constantly gives me art supplies and tries to check on my personal life. She contacts my mom sometimes and I’ve even been to her house to help with her wedding gifts. The problem is I don’t really like her. She pretty neurotic and seems exasperated when talking about anything. She kind of exhausting to be around.

788,"So I’m about to be a senior in high school in the fall (17F), and around 4 years ago this guy and I started talking. At the time I was 13, and he was 16, and he followed me on Instagram first. I was confused as to who he was, but a lot of my friends followed him so I accepted. I had my Snapchat username in my bio, and he added me, which I didn’t really think much of since I put it up there and I rather found him quite attractive. We talked for almost a whole year, about almost anything and everything. I had developed a trust for him that I hadn’t even developed with my best friend. He was always there for me, and he made me feel special. Eventually one night, he asked me to send him nudes. I was hesitant at first, but I felt like I owed him due to him being there for me for that whole year. I sent him some that night, and he continued to be sweet, however I told him it made me feel uncomfortable. He said he understood, but the next week he asked again. I said no, but he threatened to send to other people. I sent some again, and he continued to bother me for more. I blocked him, as I could feel myself getting scared and upset over this. He still followed me on Instagram however, and kept dming me so I blocked on that too. About a month passed and he made fake accounts on both Snapchat and Instagram to get ahold of me. Sometimes on the accounts he’d post my nudes, or make the username my real name followed by the word nudes. I reported multiple accounts, thankfully getting them deleted, until i answered one on snap. He threatened me again and unfortunately i ended up sending more. I was around 14 by then, and kept sending every time he asked. The day before my 15th birthday I remember him asking on snap, and I decided to ignore him. I would just leave him on delivered and eventually this kept working. Almost a year passed and he hadn’t hit me up again. Occasionally he still keeps messaging me, and it keeps getting worse. If I block, he’ll know I’m active, and he might actually end up sending them. Every time I see his name show up I get really scared and it’s really messing with both my school work and my health. I just wanted to know what you guys think I should do. I know a lot of it’s my fault and I’d appreciate if you wouldn’t judge me :)",16Jun2019,5

I'm a relatively broke college student, saving up money to visit my boyfriend for a short window of time. Basically my most cost-effective option is flying from Texas to Taos, New Mexico. Idk how my dad's done it in the past but finding flights is SO FRUSTRATING, because I have a few airports I can go from, and a few I can land in.

Big websites like Expedia keep putting my arrival in Albequerqe (which is 4 hours away from where I'd like to be :')). How do you adults do it? Also, I have looked into Greyhound/buses (takes more than 24 hours, and I only have three days to see him), driving (more in gas than a round-trip ticket would cost (also unreliable old car)), and Amtrak (expensive and too long (I'm literally trying to find any way to see him that won't involve me being kidnapped, losing money, or time with him).
