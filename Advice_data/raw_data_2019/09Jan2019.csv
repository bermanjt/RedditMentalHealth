0,"So I am currently in Grade 12, and I am incredibly lazy in school. I tend to do extremely well on tests in all subjects (except for english because creative writing is not my forte) and do absolutely no studying or homework (unless it is a project) at all as I can usually listen to lectures and know what I am doing. Now I know this sounds like a r/iamverysmart thing to say but I am genuinely concerned because school has never challenged me enough to care about doing work outside of it. 

Now I’ve always kept a job because living the broke life is not fun in school, and am always punctual and doing my job well. But these are usually easy minimum wage dead end jobs that will not last in the future. So my worry is that when challenging work comes my way, I won’t be able to deal with it properly. 

This all sounds kind of ridiculous I know and just sounds like a spoiled kid looking for attention, but I’m actually quite scared of what my mindset is gonna be like after school. 

Also after school I am planning on doing trades work as desk work has been my achilles heel for my entire life. 

So the question is how can I prepare myself for the incoming reality check after school? Should I seek to go to University instead as it will challenge me more mentally? (This is what my teachers and parents say to me as they think I’m a massive underachiever and am wasting my talents in hard labour) Or should I pursue trades in hopes that I will be able to adjust to a hard working life? 

Any input at all is appreciated.",09Jan2019,1

13,"Hello all.
I lived out of home for a while. And me and a long time friend decided to take things to the next level. We were really close and had been through alot together. 

Unfortunately I had to move home (to the same town she lived in) as the business I worked for shut down. And she decided we would have to slow down and be more friends than anything which was fine we were friends before and I wanted to be friends still. 

When I got back something was different. She was very short with me, didnt speak to me that much, and didnt hang out all to often. But I had booked a romantic cabin away while we were together and she still wanted to go. 2 weeks before the cabin we kissed and talked like nothing had changed. Cut to 2 weeks later at the cabin and the moment we arrived she wanted nothing to do with me. Didnt really talk to me just texted other people and read her book. On the last night she really didnt want anything to do with me, I peaked over her shoulder as she was texting someone else (I know I shouldn't have) and she was texting an ex boyfriend who she broke up with on bad terms, and they were talking about how he'll be home soon and how he missed her so much ending the sentence with an xx. The next morning I told her how I felt like she'd been ignoring me and she said she'd been a minute or she would loose her shit with me. 
We didnt talk much after that.

But we already also booked a comedy show and were still willing to go together. After she rudely asked if we still were on my birthday (didnt even say happy birthday). Also asked me to destroy the pictures she gave me to remember her when i left the city when we were together (which I have).

Even on the trip to the comedy show she didnt really talk apart from her talking about her old boyfriend. And on the way back she just slept in the car facing away.

We havnt really talked since. Even when I saw her at a get together with friends we didnt say a word to each other. 

We were friends for 3 years and now I just feel discarded. 

I dont know what to do in this situation. Any advice would be highly appreciated. 

Thank you.",09Jan2019,1
14,"Does this mean that i’m not very attractive myself? 

when i judge myself, i’d say i’m not bad looking. On Avg. I’ve dated a lot of good looking people, on avg. 

i’d say i’m a 6 on avg, 7 on good days and maybe an 8 if i put myself together nice. 
personality wise, i’m ok, am well traversed with interesting topics and can usually capture people of different levels of intelligence with ease. 

when i try to pick up people on the street i have a pretty high success rate, varying with their level of attractiveness. on a good day, i can come up with the magic words that land me a good conversation with an attractive person and hook em later for dating or whatever is appropriate.

On dating apps however, 
the only people swiping right on me. seem to be 5s and 4s. occasional 6s. once every 100 swipes a 7. but that’s it. is dating apps catered to the highly attractive people? because at first glance i’m probably not very glamours looking.

I'm working with a company who recently got merged with another company from another state. I work with this company for 4 years. I got this job since I graduated from college. The pay is at minimum wage, all PTO are accrual, my new supervisor is located on the other side of the continent, and management keeps changing procedures and we can't keep up. I am actively looking for over 2 years, only had 4 interviews, the rest are all automated rejection emails from the ATS softwares. I'm at the point where I am very depressed because many of my friends tried to help me by networking, but they ended up landing their own dream jobs. Which left me with nothing.

I have reached out to numerous employment agencies but somehow they are not helping me either. Many are using automated machines or software, and there's no human interactions from any of the companies. Only one reached out to me on the phone, interviewed me on what kind of job I am looking for, then they went radio silent.


Right now, my current expenses are rent, food, health insurance (company offers it, but it is overpriced so I got scammed and no way to un-enroll from it), internet and electricity. If I quit my job without a job line up, the most I can do with my savings is 2 months.

24,"So, I'm kind of in a tricky situation right now and I would like to get some advice/opinions on it. :)

Hope I can describe the situation and my thought process clear enough, I will use letters for the persons involved.

&amp;#x200B;

Friends of mine (Y and Z) have expressed towards me their opinion on another dear friend (X), more specifically their resentment on some specific behaviors of X. They know that I like X a lot and that we are pretty close and they didn't explicitly ask me to keep quiet about it or anything. Also, they didn't openly tell X what they dislike up until now, although there was/is some fighting going on already, which they attribute in parts to this specific behavior of X.

But: I'm still unsure if I should tell X what Y and Z really think about them/certain behaviors. To make things easier, I tried to think of the pros and cons:

&amp;#x200B;

Pro: - I know X as a person that is very open to criticism and always interested to learn and improve. The specific behavior that has been criticised is something that is very important to them and they want to get better at it, so I feel like they would be very appreciative towards this feedback and try their best to put it to good use. I think that's the main reason I want to tell X: I'm sure that they would rather know it. 

\- X already knows/suspects that Y and Z don't really like them, however, X (and me, until recently) attributed Y and Z's dislike to completely other factors. Therefore X can't change his behavior to contribute to a better relationship with Y and Z at the moment, although I feel like X would very much like to do that. I sympathize with X a lot in that regard, because I know the feeling of really trying to make things better but not understanding what to do and the frustration that comes from the other party not telling you where you are going wrong even if you ask them directly.

&amp;#x200B;

Con: - I'm not sure if Y and Z would appreciate me telling X about their opinion on them, since they didn't do so on their own. (I have to admit that I don't care too much about this point, though. I think X's feelings and my own situation are more important to me right now.)

\- Their conflict and opinions on eachother are not really my business and I don't know if I want to get myself into it at all, to be honest.

\- I think that X will be very sad about it, because as stated before, the criticised behavior is something that they identify strongly with and want to build on and as far as I can tell their actions are based on the best intentions, so Y and Z not seeing that could be very hurtful. 

&amp;#x200B;

For this reason I'm unsure if I really want to be the one to have this conversation with X. I guess it's mostly a struggle between: ""I would like to know if I was in X's position and I'm pretty sure they would too."" vs

""Eh, I really don't want to get myself into this, since I don't have an issue with X's behavior and I don't want to make them sad.""",09Jan2019,1

27,"My roommate is one of the most naive people I have ever met in my life. She is very suggestible and tries hard to get everyone to like her. It's very obvious, and so many predatory people know straight away that they can take advantage of her. There are a number of awkward mannerisms that she has that contributes to her coming across as a perfect victim.

She recently moved to a larger city from a small town and has been frequenting strip clubs. She's a lesbian. For weeks now she has been coming home, talking about the ""stripper friend"" she made, and how the stripper has gone on to tell her all these sweet things about her. I push back, saying that strippers tend to just manipulate people into thinking they care about them, but that they're just interested in getting money and gifts from people. She'll respond with something like, ""I never thought about that."" Really?

Anyway, I have been pushing back more and more. Recently she told me that she spent like $300 one night buying drinks for other people and things of that nature, and that she was shocked to come away with that large of a bill. Now she wants me to go to the strip club with her, which isn't really my thing. She wants me to ""meet her stripper friend"" so I can use my ""good intuition"" to determine if she's just taking advantage of her. She asked me if I met many strippers in my life. I told her that I don't really need to know strippers because it's something just baked into their job description.

So I may go ahead and do this tonight. I'm a guy, but I don't really like strip clubs that much. And I don't want to be embarrassed by my roommate just by association, to be honest. And then it feels like I will be put in this tremendously awkward social position where my roommate is oblivious to what's going on around her, and I am stuck having to pretend like everything is normal when it's not.

Her ""friend"" asked her to buy her cigarettes before she comes. Of course.

Any advice you can give as to how to get this person to realize how she comes across, how people are taking advantage of her, how she needs to learn how to say no, things of that nature, would be helpful.

28,"Hi reddit,
 This is my first post ever and it's quite serious. Please settle in as this requires some backstory.

My mom recently took a trip to Peru to take a drug called ayahuasca which is a powerful hallucinogenic. Upon returning she quickly decided to leave my stepfather, begin the process of selling her house, and letting her job know she'd be quitting in a few months to return to Peru and live with the shamans for an unspecified amount of time. These decisions alone cause alarm. 

My mom has always been someone interested in spirituality and it's never been my thing but I've always done my best to support her while she pursued something that made her happy. However, this all feels wrong. I would be okay with her leaving my stepfather or any of these other drastic decisions if I felt they were made with a clear mind. My stepfather said she was a different person when she came back from Peru. My normally warm, loving, empathetic to a fault mother was now cold and distant. All she cared about was ayahuasca and it was all she could talk about. She speaks of ayahuasca as if it's her deity or spiritual mentor. I am concerned.

When my mother made the decision to leave my stepfather she did so abruptly. She wouldn't give me a clear reason why but that it had been something on the table for awhile. He told me it was never discussed prior and that after telling him she disappeared from their house for days. I am inclined to believe him. Prior to the Peru trip they were planning 2 vacations and were still very close. 

She has also disguised the nature of the divorce to the rest of our family. She's been telling everyone else it was mutual and they are still friends. She had asked the family not to tall about the divorce at all and I was the only person who got to see him before he returned to his home state. This man married into my family in roughly 2013 right before my grandmother fell ill with cancer and passed in 2014, my uncle fell ill with cancer and passed in 2016, and my grandfather who passed of natural causes in 2017. He took care of all these people and we all loved him like he was my birth father. The fact that she worked to prevent this man getting a proper goodbye from the family hes cared for makes me furious. 

That brings us to today. I finally reached out to her a week after I met with my father and said my goodbyes(we are remaining in contact but he is moving to take care of his mom). I asked her if I could come over and speak to her. Discuss my concerns for her. I have no interest in judging her beliefs right up until the point where they've pushed her into a series of hasty and, in my opinion, destructive actions. When I asked her if I could come and speak she invited me to lunch. I said due to the nature of the conversation that was a bad idea. She then told me that one of her friends from the Peru trip were in town staying with her and that we could meet at my house if it needed to be private. 

In two days shell be coming by to speak with me and I aim to express my concern for her mental state in as calm and understanding way as I possibly can. We have both had our struggles. She's fought with bipolar disorder and depression. I've fought with depression and anxiety. We've always picked each other up when we were falling apart. My grandmother was a schyzophrenic which leads me to believe our family history of mental illness may be playing a part. I don't know thought. I'm desperate for help, advice, ideas on what I could say or do to put all of this in perspective. I feel I am losing her to some foreign force and I am powerless. 

I'm all ears reddit. Thank you.

Tldr; cant do this one justice. Sorry guys. Sorry if it's a mess but my minds racing.

29,"Hey, so my girlfriend and I have been together for about a year and she’s going to finish her associates degree this May and transfer to a university in the fall. Me on the other hand, won’t be done with mine until May of 2020. We had planned to move into an apartment together near the school she’s transferring to come this summer and she would go to the university and I would finish my associates degree; online, or at the nearest community college, which would be a 30 minute drive from the university. Then after that, I would get my associates and transfer in the fall of 2020 to her university. Lately, I’ve been thinking if the plan is the right way to go about it just because it makes things more difficult on me, but I would get to be with her. The university is only 2 hours away from where I live, so I could stay where I’m at and finish up and visit her on weekends until I could transfer. The only thing is that I’ve never been in a long distance relationship before and I don’t know if things would work out. We’ve been seeing each other 3-4 days of every week for a whole year and to only be able to see her on occasion drives me crazy. Plus she’d be so far away and a lot can happen in a year set apart. I keep having thoughts like “What if she meets someone,” or “What if the distance is too much.” So, I feel like I should go with her just for the sake of our relationship, but we’ve talked about it and she doesn’t want me to do that. I don’t know if it would be better to go with her regardless or stay back for a year and finish at home and then transfer. If anyone has any experience with something like this or just has some thoughtful advice I would really appreciate your help. Thank you! ",09Jan2019,1
30,"This is a long story but please, bear with me.

I used to work in a supermarket for nearly 6 months with my 2 best friends (let's call them Karine and Maggie) but I recently quit because I couldn't handle work and school at the same time.

There was this guy, let's call him Michael, and he and I didn't talk for the first 1 or 2 months because, seriously, my goal was not to make friends and I didn't necessarily wanted to talk to him, he seemed nice but that's it. 

Michael approached Karine and they started talking but after a while, Michael seemed to really like her and confessed his interest in seeing what could come out of their relationship. 

The problem is, Karine already had a boyfriend. They were together for almost 3 years and nothing could break them up, literally.

She told him that it wasn't possible because she already had someone that she deeply loved and respected. He seemed to understand and she came to see us, me and Maggie, to explain what happened with Michael.

The next weeks were really weird. Karine knows that people like her but she doesn't use it in a bad way, she isn't like showing it off or anything. And she has a flirty personality. Knowing that she was still talking to Michael like nothing happened did not surprise me at all and i didn't find it weird or inappropriate because it happens all the time. Half of her boy friends had a crush on her from the beginning but they've learned to accept that they could never have her and they became friends since. Or at least, they pretend to understand.

Yes, it may seem weird but she always shares all of this with her man. Nothing is a secret between them, like nothing at all. Nothing. He knows who likes her, who approached her and they really trust each other so i had no doubt in all of this Michael situation. She felt like they could be great friends, nothing more.

One day, they were talking over the phone and Michael asked Karine about when they could see each other. She asked him if he meant like just the 2 alone or with people. He told her that he wanted people around because he was afraid of wanting to have sex with her. She didn't know what to say and she just changed the subject.

So, me and Maggie started talking to this Michael  because we wanted to know him more and we eventually all became ""friends"". 

After a while, he started saying that he didn't have feelings for Karine anymore but me and Maggie did not believe him. Karine stayed flirty with him but she's always like that, it was no different. 

Michael and I were sharing our love for certain TV shows but it never got personnal. He trusted Karine so much that he started to talk to her about his father who abandoned him and some other personnal stuff that are not important but he really didn't even trust his own friends who he had known for years. 

Recently, he seemed really attached to me in some way.

I decided to quit and when i told him, he really insisted for me to stay. He said that i couldn't be there when he was working, he was going to miss me and when i told him that he still had Karine (because Maggie got fired at the time), he said ""no but you won't be here"". I just assumed that he was going to maybe miss me, but that's it.

Some days after, Karine got mad at him because when she was calling him in our group chat, he came to text me to say that he didn't have the energy to answer the call. He came to DM me personally when he could've texted it to the whole group and she was just over it. He was texting her over and over again before i told him i was leaving but, suddently, he came to me when he couldn't answer the call.

She wanted to stop talking to him because she thought that he was really insistent and found the occasion to block him everywhere.

On my last shift, he came to hug me, which he never did, and he said hello. Before the end of his shift, he bought me some chocolate and he wrote a word in a piece of paper that he pinned to it. He hugged me again, saying that he really was going to miss me, and i was touched by his gesture (I'm not gonna lie, that was really sweet of him).

What you don't know is that we (me, michael, karine and maggie) sometimes have plans together and that we can see each other out of the work place. We did an escape room that was so fun, we went out to a restaurant (I laughed so much i wanted to piss myself the whole evening), we went shopping. I mean, there was no reason for him to ""miss"" me so much because we were going to stay in contact.

Again, the whole chocolate and hugging thing was still pretty weird to me even though it was really sweet. 

I received a text the same evening, he wanted to go to the cinema. I assumed that it was with Maggie since Karine wasn't talking to him anymore. When i asked him if he wanted me to ask Maggie, he just said ""yes why not"" like it was a new possibility. 

Maggie couldn't come, and when i told him he just went ""well i guess it's just us"". I still went to see the movie with him and he started to talk about his childhood, which, again, he never did with me. When i had to leave, he hugged me and thanked me for the evening (??????) and since, he still sends me texts everyday. 

Karine and Maggie are teasing me and saying that for him, it was a date but I really don't know. Also, I might have some feelings for him but I don't know if it's the best thing for both of us. Karine always saw us together and when she told him that we would make a great couple, he just said that he didn't have time for that. But that was before he started coming in my direction.

Im wondering, is he doing all of this to come back at Karine since she is not talking to him? Does he want to show her that he can find someone else or is he really sincere with me. Also, does he have maybe some feelings for me?

I might never know. But whatever happens, i really hope that it's honest.

The story was messy and tell me if some things are not clear. English is my third language and i usually speak french, excuse my errors. 

Can I have some of your opinions? I really want to know!!

32,"It’s my last semester in college and I’m finishing up my associates degree in the arts.
I put a lot of math and science classes under my belt, organic chemistry, anatomy, trigonometry, psychology, and all the gen eds that any university might need to get started for a bachelors degree.

I was a terrible student in highschool but I had great Test scores and I managed to get a scholarship for a school in my city.

After a lot of soul searching I decided to buckledown and give it my absolute best every semester. I worked two jobs and worked for the school while going full-time in college to pay for it all. I managed to scrap mostly A’s from every semester I’ve gotten, barely ever missed a single day of class, I’ve been giving it everything I’ve got.

I sacrificed a lot of time and worked so hard to get this, I nearly have my associates degree and I’ll be walking in the summer. But now my parents have been pushing me to be a nurse or an X-ray tech and go off into this school downtown for two years.

I care about my family. I talked seriously about their suggestions and took them to heart, thinking that “Hey! It’s a great start for someone in their 20’s! Might as well, right?”

Well... I don’t know. I went from wanting to be a graphic designer, an engineer, a police officer, a doctor, or just join the airforce and see where it takes me.
All of them take a lot of commitment in some way, the same way that going to be a nurse or an xray tech does.

But I don’t feel like it’s my choice anymore! I don’t even know enough about what’s out there or what’s right for me to even begin to make a choice!

It’s been tearing me up inside, I’m very young and my life practically just started. I have absolutely no clue what else is out there I would like besides the medical field because my whole family works in the hospital.

I want to make my own choices and be my own person, but I feel like if I just give in to what my parents want me to do it just sets a precedent for me to never want to be better or move up or actually find something that I like.

I’ve met so many people from school wanting to be engineers, vets, biology majors, and they all seem so sure of themselves... I do my research on the different jobs out there but I don’t have a crystal ball, I want to be happy but I don’t want to be trapped into something that I might not like and be practically in debt until I’m 40 just for making that decision.

I’d pretty much be going to this school monday through friday, 8 o’clock til 5 o’clock in the evening, studying for this job that I don’t really know to much about besides shadowing once at a hospital.

I feel like I can do so many things, but to corner myself into one place just because my parents want me to makes me feel like I’ve been going to school and busting my but for absolutely nothing.

But at the end of the day, I just want to find something that pays the bills but makes me happy.
I don’t want to do something just to make somebody else happy. I don’t want to live my life for other people, I want to know what I want to do and just need to where to begin.

If anyone finds this I could really use some advice from somebody other than my family. It could really be life changing for me if I can just find a way to figure out what I want to do.

34,"I can't tell my friends so I'm turning to reddit once again. 

So this time last year one of my male friends initiated a game of truth or dare with me and my friend (who was his girlfriend at the time.) Some people might say ""well if you were playing truth or dare with him you should have expected it"" which is true but we played all the time and it was always pg like, ""whats your favourite colour"" or ""send this msg to someone"". This time he dared me to ""take off a layer of clothing"" and I was obviously like no of course im not doing that whats wrong with you? I'm pretty sure I continued playing anyway, I don't remember well though. He apologised later I think, either that or he did when I confronted him about it. I'm pretty sure his reasoning was ""I wasnt thinking straight"".  

So I didn't play truth or dare with anyone after that for almost a year, but eventually I trusted him enough to start again, this is one of my closest friends btw, and for weeks we played almost every night and it was always completely mild. Then a few weeks ago when we were playing he ""jokingly"" asked what colour underwear I was wearing. he said jk afterwards, we were in a phonecall at the time. It seemed like he was actually joking and I trusted him. We ended up just texting instead and he was thinking of a truth for me, and he kept saying the only thing he could think of was the underwear thing and i found it weird but gave him the benefit of the doubt and assumed he was joking. I asked if a dare would be easier and he dared me to send a picture of my bra. I ignored the message for ages and then hes like oh sorry my internet died and i assumed that was why he didnt put ""jk"" so i sent lol and then hes like so? and i said so what? and he said are you gonna do it? and im like no of course not are you hacked? and he said no we just talked, its just a bra its no big deal, then im like im going to assume somethings wrong and you have a good excuse for this. then hes like no im serious, either this or the underwear thing its all i can think of and im like or we could just not play truth or dare anymore and hes like ""cmon"" and i asked if he was okay, and he said ""I think 30 shots of vodka was too much"" and im not sure if i believe that, i dont know much about alcohol but that seems like a lot. I decided to just be nice about it and deal with it the next day so i told him to have some food and water and try to sleep and went offline.

The next day he texted me that he was so sorry and such an idiot and i said yeah you are an idiot. its okay though im not angry, i understand that you were drunk, even though i was angry and hurt. idek why i said that, I guess im just tired of conflict. he said sorry again and we never spoke of it again. He asked me not to tell anyone and I haven't.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to talk to him about it, but I feel like it's just causing a fight considering there's nothing I want out of it. I guess I want him to know that he hurt me and broke my trust. I've been speaking to him less and not having proper conversations with him. I don't know if I'll even be able to talk to him in person when we go back to school, he's the only one I know that's in most of my classes though so I kind of have to. 

Do you think he was being honest about the alcohol? Do you think I should tell him I'm upset? Should I try to forgive him? Is it as big of a deal as it seems or am I just being overdramatic? Should I tell my best friend? Ugh I just need advice because I really don't know how to deal with this situation.

38,"Sorry its so long but I feel there are alot of details that need to be mentioned to fully understand my situation. 
A little backstory:
My parents have been married 25yrs (anniversary was last week). Their relationship has had very many dramatic ups and downs. My mother has an addiction issue that she struggles with (currently clean, I think) and that along with my dads tongue (calls mom every name in the book, mocks her ect.) and how jealous the both of them are really puts together their toxic relationship. Facebook has been a huge issue especially with my mom because my dad is very active on their and often has women (whom my mother doesn't know) liking and commenting on his post which drives her up the wall. At the beginning of 2018 things got really rough and my mom moved out around May. It was somthing I begged her to do because at this point things had started to become mutually physical between them and I was getting woken up in the morning regularly by them screaming and would have to pull them off eachother (always just pushing and holding on to eachother never any punches or marks left) The events started to really take a toll on me and my younger brother (20) who also lives at our house. In October my mother was arrested for DUI and my dad only bailed her out for me he says because I was at work and couldn't do it myself. In Novemeber my mother moved back in with us due to issues with her living and work situations. Things have been working out pretty well between them they haven't really been fighting much and so I'm trying to give their relationship another shot in my mind because it was so hard for me to come to terms with them separating to being with and in my mind, I had just have gotten over them not being together. 
Fast forward to NYE:
My parents introduced my brother and I to their friend Lauren who would be going out with them to celebrate the new year. We were told she works with my dad, which in its self is weird because with my mother being so jealous women who work with my dad are usually ""whores"". The only assumption I could make at the time was that my mom met her at my dad company christmas party and made friends. Lauren came again a few days later and after visiting for a bit, my parents said the 3 of them would be watching a movie (in their bedroom that only has a bed) and closed and locked their door and the lights were out. (There room is LITTERALLY 4 feet from my bedroom) I started to be suspicious, if not sure at that point, that something weird was up, I was really in denial. I then spoke with my brother and he told me that one night that I was gone, Lauren stayed the night in the room with my parents. At this point I was sure and angry. I was angry that my parents brought this women into our home and tried to play it off to me as if she was a friend of theirs. I came home from work a few days ago early expecting to go shopping with my dad as we had plans to do so already. When I pulled up Laurens car was in the driveway and for some reason it sent me into a rage. I came inside the house and there was lauren and my parents AT LEAST THEY WERE IN THE LIVING ROOM. I went to my room for a bit and I felt the rage swell inside of me. I was confused about my anger but I felt as if I was being cheated on and the other female knows about it. I feel like my parents tried to deceive me or hide the truth from me when I am an adult and can handle adult conversations. (I say) So with all the rage built up I stormed into the living room and demanded answers. I asked the 3 of them what was going on. My mother looked at me confused and told me nothing was going on, she was gas lighting me making me feel like I had made this weird scenario up in my mind. Once I started getting angrier her stance changed from ""nothing"" to ""it's none of your business"" which if that was the case then why was I introduced to this woman? Everything happened really quickly so my details are shit, but I snapped. They continued to say things like its none of your buisness and so I started knocking all the family photos off the wall in the hallway because I felt it might get them to be real with me for fear of their stuff getting destroyed. I was escorted to my room by my father who started yelling at me and I could hear my mother apologizing to Lauren which made me so mad I charged past my dad into the living room at Lauren, I don't know why or what I planned to do but I think I was going to try and punch her in the face but I was grabbed by my father and in attempts to reach for Lauren I screamed in her face ""you're not welcome here bitch"" and I spat in her face. All while she sat their with facing the ground. My mother was horrifyed and was yelling things like ""wow""and ""omg"" in a shocking voice that was only fueling my anger. My dad escorted me back to my room where I told him to get Lauren out of the house immediately, he said he would comply and asked me to cool down for a few minutes in my room. After a few mins Lauren left and my mom went to work and my father and I sat down to talk. And he finally admitted that him and my mother were in fact sleeping with Lauren. My dad said things like everything was his fault because he didn't think that we would be upset, he also explained how the 3 of them hit it off at the party and things ""just kinda happened"" it was a hard conversation to have with my dad but after I felt so much better. But the rage and urge to do and say mean things to Lauren is still raging in me. I know that its probably obvious I should look into getting some help for my rage but am I so wrong for being so upset? I feel like this will do nothing but blow up in their faces. I feel like maybe if my parents would have sat us down talked to us and then introduced us to Lauren, that I wouldn't have reacted the way I did in the moment. I'd like to think that if they were straight forward with me that I would have been able to digest the information and deal with it in my own way without attacking poor Lauren who, even though I dont approve of her, really didnt deserve to be spit on. And I understand my parents are struggling and that maybe this was helping things for them I just feel like they went about this the wrong way completely which made me react in the completely wrong way. So if youre still reading, please tell me, am I being a baby and need to understand my parents are people and have needs and mind my own buisness even though they're having 3 somes 4 feet away from me when I am home? Or am I reacting to this wild situation as normal as anyone else could (minus spitting on her, which again I know is assault and unacceptable) Also if anyone has dealt with situations like this are there any tips you can give me to get over this whole thing? (besides move out because I am currently saving to do so)

Tl;dr: My parents tried to act like they weren't  sleeping with their ""friend"" that they have been bringing around and the gaslighting sent me into a rage in which I spat on the girlfriend.(which was not okay) Help! Am I being insane for feeling so upset or are my parents in the wrong?",09Jan2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

I (22 F) am a broke college student from a small country currently studying abroad on a scholarship in a bigger, more developed country. Hence, I am struggling quite a bit to afford my living expenses here. 

Recently, a friend told me about a good job offer that pays a bit better than the average salary here. It's at a bar, and my job is to make drinks and entertain customers. This is where it gets a little confusing. This type of bar doesn't really exist in other countries. Here, you don't come to the bar for drinks, actually, most of the drinks we offer are very basic. Actually, it's mostly for entertainment with the girls. I know it sounds like borderline prostitution, but that depends on the bar owner, and more often than not the entertainment is not physical.

The bar I was invited to work at is owned by a really kind lady. She does not push me to do anything I am not comfortable with. All physical contact between the girls and the customers are forbidden. Specifically, my job mostly consists of sitting with the customers at their tables, pretend to listen to them, laugh for no reason, empty their ashtrays regularly, refill their drinks and snacks, and mostly just look pretty.  

Most of our customers are men. While I said that physical contact is forbidden, because there's alcohol involved, sometimes they would still do inappropriate things. I've gotten my butt groped a few times, and once a drunk guy suddenly grabbed my legs and tried to force them open as a ""joke"". When that happens, the bar owner and other girls step in to stop the guy immediately, as well as his own friends who would apologize and blame the alcohol before pulling him home. But even then, what's done is done, and it really makes me feel dirty. Also, even though physical contact is forbidden, we still have to sit with the customers, and being called to sit next to a guy for money, even though I'm not doing anything inappropriate with him, makes me feel really wrong.

Even though technically the things I have to do at my job are very tame, I feel really icky every time I'm on my way to work, like I'm doing something against my conscience. I wonder if that's because of some prejudice I subconsciously have against working in bars and clubs. I just feel incredibly guilty every time. I'm also terrified of what other people would think of me if they knew I was working there. Would I be judged and looked down upon? But at the same time, it's easy work and I can finally afford rent and textbooks with my own money now. I've tried to quit a few times, but the bar owner keeps saying I bring in a lot of customers because I'm young and she has no one to replace me. Also, not gonna lie, I'm such a sellout, the money makes it hard to pass. Would I be wasting a perfectly good opportunity just because I'm overthinking everything?  Am I overthinking it? Is my guilt just due to my conservative upbringing and some unjustified prejudices? Anyways, should I quit? How would you guys view girls who do this type of work? I really want to know how others would judge or view girls who work in this line of work. I don't tell anyone I'm working there just from embarrassment. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if the questions I'm asking are clear enough to qualify for this sub. I'm very sorry if it's too confusing and long. Thank you for taking the time to read.

Tl;dr: I'm working at a bar where I have to entertain male guests by sitting with them and offer drinks and conversation, nothing physical.

I have absolutely no clue about what to do with my future, none of the majors really interest me, ive gone back and forth for months about what i want to do. I love playing video games, and watching anime. I would love to become a full time streamer, i realize that is quite a task to do. Ive contemplated with putting off college for a year and seeing where streaming would take me, as video games is one of the only things i truely enjoy.

She said she still loves me but at the same time needs “emotional independence” right now. She wants to remain friends with me and says that she still sees us sharing many things in the future but is not sure we would do that as partners.

50,"I'm currently 15, just finished my first high school year and I feel like there is no way to ever reach my dreams.

 

I live in a very shitty country to work on the field I am passionate about (programming/software engineering). Actually, this place is very shitty for many, many things... so the solution I had and deposited all my hopes for the future in, is going to college in a more developed and better place, so I can eventually get a job and live there.

&amp;#x200B;

But I've been doing some research about the topic and found out it's way too hard, and way out of my reach to get in one of those universities. I don't come from a rich family, so I could never afford those unbelievably expensive annual fees, and the international scholarships demand something I recently discovered called a GPA to be high, and mine will never be as high as the requirements. I study at a very hard school, so even though I have the second higher average in relation to the other students in my school year, it's still an 80% average (3.0 GPA for this year, I believe), thus no chance of ever getting a scholarship for me. I understand I could've got better grades, but I never really bothered, since I didn't know they were that important until now.

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's possible to have a decent education here where I live, but it'll never be enough to get out of this place or to work on something big and important, and if it's possible, it's so distant in a far away future. And honestly, I was very excited to study somewhere where I'd have so many opportunities and everything would be new, where I could get away from everything and be truly me.

This is probably a very stupid thing to be bothered about since this dream was way bigger than me in the first place, and other people have way more serious problems, but I'm feeling so powerless and hopeless. I'm stuck in this horrible place where people are so closed minded and full of hate... the idea of living here until I die is almost unbearable. What can I do to feel better about my failures and live on my life after this?

I can't tell my friends so I'm turning to reddit once again.

So  this time last year one of my male friends initiated a game of truth or  dare with me and my friend (who was his girlfriend at the time.) Some  people might say ""well if you were playing truth or dare with him you  should have expected it"" which is true but we played all the time and it  was always pg like, ""whats your favourite colour"" or ""send this msg to  someone"". This time he dared me to ""take off a layer of clothing"" and I  was obviously like no of course im not doing that whats wrong with you?  I'm pretty sure I continued playing anyway, I don't remember well  though. He apologised later I think, either that or he did when I  confronted him about it. I'm pretty sure his reasoning was ""I wasnt  thinking straight"".

So I didn't play  truth or dare with anyone after that for almost a year, but eventually I  trusted him enough to start again, this is one of my closest friends  btw, and for weeks we played almost every night and it was always  completely mild. Then a few weeks ago when we were playing he ""jokingly""  asked what colour underwear I was wearing. he said jk afterwards, we  were in a phonecall at the time. It seemed like he was actually joking  and I trusted him. We ended up just texting instead and he was thinking  of a truth for me, and he kept saying the only thing he could think of  was the underwear thing and i found it weird but gave him the benefit of  the doubt and assumed he was joking. I asked if a dare would be easier  and he dared me to send a picture of my bra. I ignored the message for  ages and then hes like oh sorry my internet died and i assumed that was  why he didnt put ""jk"" so i sent lol and then hes like so? and i said so  what? and he said are you gonna do it? and im like no of course not are  you hacked? and he said no we just talked, its just a bra its no big  deal, then im like im going to assume somethings wrong and you have a  good excuse for this. then hes like no im serious, either this or the  underwear thing its all i can think of and im like or we could just not  play truth or dare anymore and hes like ""cmon"" and i asked if he was  okay, and he said ""I think 30 shots of vodka was too much"" and im not  sure if i believe that, i dont know much about alcohol but that seems  like a lot. I decided to just be nice about it and deal with it the next  day so i told him to have some food and water and try to sleep and went  offline.

The next day he texted me that  he was so sorry and such an idiot and i said yeah you are an idiot. its  okay though im not angry, i understand that you were drunk, even though  i was angry and hurt. idek why i said that, I guess im just tired of  conflict. he said sorry again and we never spoke of it again. He asked  me not to tell anyone and I haven't.

I  want to talk to him about it, but I feel like it's just causing a fight  considering there's nothing I want out of it. I guess I want him to  know that he hurt me and broke my trust. I've been speaking to him less  and not having proper conversations with him. I don't know if I'll even  be able to talk to him in person when we go back to school, he's the  only one I know that's in most of my classes though so I kind of have  to.

Do you think he was being honest  about the alcohol? Do you think I should tell him I'm upset? Should I  try to forgive him? Is it as big of a deal as it seems or am I just  being overdramatic? Should I tell my best friend? Ugh I just need advice  because I really don't know how to deal with this situation.

&amp;#x200B;

A friend and I got into a fight at school today. Would rather not get into the background for personal reasons, but we metaphorically both had each other by the balls, and could f\*\*\* the other person over but would f\*\*\* ourselves as a result. We were good enough friends where (I thought) neither of us would do this.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, we had something we were going to sell (as we both technically owned a piece of it) and split the profits. It was my job to sell said item. The ""rules"" of our agreement were as follows""

1. Friend gets the item
2. I sell the item
3. We both have to agree on the price before I sell it

I want to stress that the item wasn't anything illegal, not anything bad, stolen, etc. Just would rather not say for personal reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

Back to the story - he did his part, and once he got the item he gave it to me earlier today in school. We went on with our day as normal, and at the end of the day he arbitrarily decided that I had to give him his half of the money by February 1st. I told him that I was not willing to agree to that, even though I knew I could almost definitely sell it before then. I told him that we never agreed on that, and that he can't change the rules as we go.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, after school but before sports today, he came over to my locker. He said he wanted to see my racket to compare it to his, so that he could see if his strings were loose. I had a hunch that he wanted to take the item back for himself, as he said that if I didn't sell it before Feb. 1st, he would just physically take it back. But I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt and let him see my racket. As I expected, as soon as I opened my locker, he ran over, shoved my aside, grabbed my bag and tried to take the item back. I grabbed the bag back, and we got into a wrestling match. He is bigger and stronger than I am, so I eventually lost the fight and he got the item from me. I told him I'd give him 10 seconds to put it back in my bag and my locker, or I'd just go to the school and rat us both out, f\*\*\*ing us both over. He said, ""Don't be a b\*\*\*\*,"" along with other excuses, and after 10 seconds when he didn't give it back to me I told him to ""Go f\*\*\* \[him\]self"", and walked out of the locker room. Within 2 minutes he texted me apologizing, saying he had a rough day, that he made a mistake, didn't know what he was thinking, etc. I told him that I have bad days too, but don't get into fights over them. The conversation ended with me saying ""Go f\*\*\* yourself you fake a\*\* friend"", and blocking him as I really wanted him out of my life at this point. (Note - I should mention we haven't been friends that long, we really just grew closer this year). So I guess what I'm getting at here is, should I forgive him? I was pissed off at him in the moment (and still am), but I don't want to loose a friend over this. I'm just afraid that if he had done this once, why would he not do it again?

""Just what in the actual fuck am I doing with my life?"" 

I acknowledge the fact i have an advantage over my peers, but i do not understand what i should do with my time. I want to learn. LEARN. I want to stay at the top. Get good grades. Make friends. Along with the test when i was young, it suggested a serious case of ADHD. I take medications daily to help me focus, and have tried various ones. I am currently using adderal in 25mg capsules everyday. I am afraid to miss my medication because i have been taking this drug for over a year and the withdraw is hell. I try to talk to my parents that I'm older now and i can manage myself and i would not like the withdraw risk and long tern health effects, but they do not believe me. They ignore me.

87,"This may be a long one, but I really don't know what to do.
My first love was an amazing woman... beautiful, smart, witty, my family and friends loves her... everything I thought I never deserved.  After a few months, we realized that we wanted to get married (she was the one to bring up the topic). She was a freshman in college and her parents were very big on her finishing, as was I, so we decided to keep that discussion from her family, but we made it known to everyone else that we were engaged and would marry after she was done with college.  The next 2 1/2 years were nothing short of blissful. After a year and a half together we picked out a $1100 engagement ring (a lot of money for a 20 year old to pay, but payment arrangements were made and we would make it official when it was paid off one year hence). She lived with her family about 45 minutes away, so I would drive to see her once or twice week. After my tax return I paid the ring off early and was going to ask her on Thanksgiving,  and I was only a month from moving to her town spend more time with her.
At the 2 year mark, she was spending some time with friends whom I only knew by her talking about them (mixed  company) over the summer, but I thought nothing of it as she was not doing this on our normal days most of the time. I once suggested I hang out with them once and she quickly dismisses it as not my scene (fair enough as it was a country dance bar and I am not really a big country fan) *this is when in hindsight red flags started flying, but I ignored them*. We once had a whimsical discussion of where we would be I'd we had not met and she immediately said that she would be dating ""person a"" *ignored flag 2*. She canceled our normal date once because 'person b"" was going back to California the next day.
At the end of that summer, I called her from the pay phone at my work (as I did every day on my break) and she told me she had fooled around with ""person a"" a couple months ago and had sex with ""person b"" (these two were  cousins,  for the record). I was FLOORED.
We met the next day and we talked for about 6 months after (me trying desperately to make it right... her... no idea). Then my disturbingly good memory licked in and I realized she had been dating person b and was trying to get me to break up with her since the summer started. I haven't talked to her since, later moved cross  country and other than making jokes about my ""manipulative, gaslighting tramp ex fiance"", hadn't put much thought into it.
I met my wife in Seattle and her son from a previous relationship is my son... I love e them both to no end and  wouldn't trade them for the world. As painful as the experience with the tramp was, other than my biological family,  literally no one I love in my life would have even been introduced to me.
We recently moved back to the area I grew up in and I did have an unpleasant trip down memory lane and given that my ex lives literally across the street from my sister (to whom I fortunately am not currently speaking) and it is a small town, I knew it was a matter of time until we ran across each other. Well, that was just the other day and as much as I had planned it our, when the time came, I saw her, she saw me, and I pulled a 180. I feel like a coward.
I hate that I am still so angry at her after 20 years... I hate that she still has this effect on me.
My wife is my rock in this and has been as understanding as she can be (I was her first love), and I feel like a jerk.

They were all out to rob her, kidnap and rape me, burn our house down, etc. she doesn’t cook. She doesn’t allow anyone else to inside the house. We have to go to the backyard and set up a table with a portable stove. We have to unplug every electrical device when not in use. She’s come to yell at me for not doing so without checking. If she buys food, and I tell her I’m not hungry and I’ll eat later, she’ll tell me to never come to her again for anything. I do admit that I lose my patience a lot and start yelling back.

89,"I'm not sure how I can sum up a decade of friendship, but I try my best to describe what's going on.

I have a close friend, let's call him Bob. Bob is a few years younger than me, and I've had a older brother relationship with him feeling like I needed to take care of him because he's not the sharpest tool in the shed. Bob had always looked up to me for advice about life. Over the years he's just never grown up, he's now in his late 20s but still hangs out with college students partying and drinking all the time. He's always talking about getting rich but never wants to work more than he has to (he works in construction in his dad's business and his own dad wouldn't let him take over because of his immaturity). He's incredibly flaky and has left people in the dust when they need his help. What drew the line for me was when I was in the hospital. Bob knew I was there and he didn't visit, call, or hell even text to see how I was doing.

Sounds like an easy friendship to break right? I stopped talking to Bob after the hospital incident, which was almost two years ago now. He's dense in that he never knew I broke it off. He never is the one calling/texting so it took him months to realize what was going on. We have mutual friends and go to the same gym (but at different times) so every once in a while we might see each other but I just ignore him.

So here comes the problem. I've always been a forgiving guy, but I think this friendship is not worth my time or effort with a guy like him that doesn't do his part in it. However, I know in the back of mind I feel like I want to patch things up, I even have dreams where we are hanging out like normal. Part of me thinks it's because there was no closure, that I didn't tell him off. I don't think telling him off will accomplish anything though, as I feel Bob will just roll it off his sleeve. At one point I told him off about his immaturity and he brushed it off saying I'm ""being such a chick and starting drama.""

I've talked to a few close friends about it over the months and they're basically all split on the issue. I honestly don't know if I just can't get over the ten years we were close friends, if I need to just tell him off, or if I subconsciously still want to be friends. Should I continue my path ignoring him, or should I try talking to him again?",09Jan2019,1

92,"Hey guys. I need some advice to getting out of this pit of despair i'm in. I'm sorry if this post is a bit long, alot of shit has gone wrong and I want to help you understand and I need to vent. I'll do my best to summarize.

&amp;#x200B;

My problems began when I started applying for jobs in my final semester of undergraduate. The vast majority of the companies didn't reply to my applications, but I did get several interviews, but I always got knocked out in the final round. I wasn't able to find a job before graduating and had to move back in with my father. My first day back I was forced to join my father's business because I had to, ""earn my keep"" in order to live in his house. The business is in the medical field, which I don't care for because it does't interest me and I don't like seeing just how fragile we all really are. Unfortunately that is where all my professional experience is save for a few internships in the financial field during the summers of college. I worked there for several years making near minimum wage and continuing to apply for jobs but getting very few interviews and no offers. During this time I also got an MBA to help me get a job.

The problem I had with living with in my father's house after college was  his wife, my step mother. She started seeing my father right before I went off to college. Over the infrequent visits, she would wildly swing between being a loving mother figure and emotionally/verbally abusive (telling me i'm not a man, yelling and screaming over, calling me the other woman's son, etc). One day she got violent and hit me. Against my better judgment I did not call the cops  at my father's request. Unfortunately my father lets her walk all over him because his last divorce with my biomom took a hug toll emotionally and financially on him. Moving back in with her, she became increasingly abusive until she started raising her hand as if to hit me again. She is the head of HR at my father's business and this lead to a whole host of problems including illegally not paying me for approved overtime and writing me up for coming in late when her car blocked mine from leaving in the driveway in the morning.

At that point, I had enough and moved in with my best friend (he and his girlfriend offered). I blocked my stepmother on every platform and have only seen her once for my grandfathers funeral (where she mocked me). To do this though I had to move across the state which meant I had to quit my job. Personal Finance is a passion of mine and I'm very frugal, so I had an emergency fund for a years worth of expenses. During my stay at my friend's place I continued to apply for jobs but non of the interviews turned into offers. He and his girlfriend had offered to let me stay for 3 months, but one month in his girlfriend wanted the room back for her family to visit during the holidays and gave me 3 weeks to find a new place. It was unfortunate, but I respected her wishes. The only place I could find that had that availability at a good price was staying at a house my biomom was selling.  So I moved in there.

One week to moving into the new place I developed a medical condition that I still have to this day, my penis went almost completely numb. As a young guy I was devastated. It still works, but I only feel about 10% of the sex/orgasm. I've seen a few doctors for it, they aren't sure what is causing it and every few months order new tests. I still remember how it used to feel and I'd trade almost anything to get it back.

 At this point I felt absolutely helpless and depressed. I stopped applying for jobs, stopped reaching out to my friends, stopped enjoying things I used to enjoy. I did pretty much nothing but play video games to pass the time. This went on for about a YEAR. When funds were starting to run low my father said he help me (he feels guilty for what his wife did to me). Unfortunately when my emergency fund hit 0 he said his business was struggling and I had to go into credit card debt.

When the house I was living in got sold I had to leave on a few weeks notice. This time I wasn't able to find anything due to running out of money. My grandparents offered to let me sleep in a spare room. Being faced with hopelessness I of course accepted. To this day I sleep in a sleeping bag in a spare room.

A few months ago I accepted that the depression wasn't going to go away on its own and I couldn't ignore my problems forever, so I got a therapist. The therapist was great for awhile, we found medication that takes the edge off of my feelings of helplessness, depression, and anxiety. The wall we've hit is I have brief periods of motivation where I apply to jobs, but the deafening silence of the job market brings me right back to feeling worthless.

I feel like I've tried everything. I've used up my network of friends and peers for interviews. I've got over a years gap in my employment. My father has suggested I lie on my resume that I continued to work in his business until the present. The issue I have with this is my father has downsized his business to only him and his wife and she's far more likely to answer the phone or fax if a potential employer reaches out. She has access to his email account and phone.

My grandparents now want me to move out (understandable). I've lowered my standards from a ""real"" job to just about anything, but even the walmarts of the world aren't answering my applications. I should note that I've done practice interviews and had hiring managers review my resume. After some minor modifications they think there's nothing wrong with the way I present myself or my resume. The reason the firms give me for selecting another candidate is almost always we've found someone with more experience. I don't feel like I can emotionally handle tempwork.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know what to do, being depressed and helpless has now become my default mode and it's harder and harder to keep at trying at life. I've lost my relationship father, my job, feeling in my penis, thousands in credit card debt and student loans, I've become a hermit because all that anyone ever wants to talk to me about is my job search. What do I do to get myself out of this mess? Should I lie on my resume? What do I do about hitting the wall with my therapist/meds? How do I motivate myself to do anything but wait for the day to end? 

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you for your time.",09Jan2019,1
93,"I have no clue what I want to do after college. All that I would say that I’m passionate about is the idea of creating and problem solving.  I don’t want a typical job but I would also like some security and upward mobility. Ive considered Sociology, Environmental Studies, Math, Theater, Art, Writing, Journalism, Computer Science, Philosophy, PoliSci. I don’t want to take a gap year, and I only have the money for 4 years of undergrad. I enjoy pushing myself and want to take challenging courses, but intense degrees like STEM make it so I can’t take electives in my other interests.

96,"Here’s my ramblings because currently I can’t afford a therapist (I’m in college currently) I hate being an adult (more like I hate young adults and teenagers) so weird I just got kind of (in a very nice way) kicked out of my own living room by my roommate. She prefers I get out and go do something else than be at our apartment working on my homework assignment. ( I understand why she was having her boyfriend over but I don’t know I just wish I had money to get my own place instead of having to share with other people) i feel out of place all the time like i never grew out of a certain state of mind but still feel like the more mature one in my age group. I also don’t understand “fun” I have no sense of understanding about how others can have fun when drinking and smoking and listening to loud music . I tried but I always end up in the corner playing sudoku on my phone waiting for the people that i drove with to “parties” . This is my first time being on my own, I also hate the city and the rude people that reside in it. It’s so depressing and everyday I feel more and more tired literally not figuratively. It’s like as people suck out my energy. I kind of miss my old house where I could go out and smell fresh open air and drink freshly brewed coffee in the morning outside and I would just see greenery. As opposed to the apartments I live in now, no one says hi and all you hear is complaining from the neighbors. I unfortunately chose a career where it’s best you live in the city and do. And I’m having doubts but not because I’m not interested in the career I dreamed of as a kid. But because I’m probably going to have to live in a place like I am currently situated in now. I just started a new class where we learn Animation and I always wanted to do concept Art instead but I didn’t really put 2 and 2 together that I really love the art of Animation and wow do I suck at socializing with people and you kind of need to mingle with a lot of people to prosper in this field and I think I’ve already done a bad first impression on my classmates. Also my roommate is so loud I really hate living with this person. She always invites people and these people always try to make awkward conversation with me. Also ever since she met her new boyfriend (which I really don’t like he’s a walking stereotype he’s into those expensive clothes with the red rectangle on them and only talks about [mota](https://youtu.be/igtLqhX4BCA) and has really bad taste in music and his sense of humor is wack (what kind of person dislikes KickAss and Team America World Police???) has she’s kind of changed in a bad way maybe? She kind of always high and does some questionable things. She’s nice but kind of disregards that she lives with another person too? This thing is only for a year and a half so hopefully I make it out alive and don’t Robin Williams myself (joking) also my fun is listening to podcasts, reading and drinking coffee, watching stand-up, and theme parks. I also enjoy knitting and embroidery and  playing instruments like the violin and guitar.",09Jan2019,1
98,"Before, I've known what really liking a girl feels like (hard L word (love) with a girl that left me hanging because she went to a different school) and now this newer girl is really cute to me (been knowing her for 1.5 years now). Issue is, I doubt she's into me due to leaving my messages opened, but in real life she sits next to me in calculus and is super cool with me.

99,"So dad's a real douchebag. Currently I'm 18, he used to passive-aggressively bully me up until 12 maybe (when my parents got divorced); calling me names, mocking me about my short height and yelling at me for simple things like not walking fast enough when he asked me to get him something, standing in his way when he didn't even ask me to move, and basically stuff among those lines.   
He's a really delusional person, after I'd cry when he'd insult me he'd tell me ""he didn't mean it that way"".  
To top it all off, he's racist, anti-non-believers and generally hates everyone who thinks differently than him. Just a bad person. The whole racist, anti-non-believers is a big reason to the bad relationship.

  
Like I said, my parents are divorced. I used to see him often but have stopped cause I couldn't put up with his shit anymore after doing it for such a long time, when he just always made me feel so bad and be constantly full of anger.  
Lately he's coming to pick up my little brother and I talk to him for a bit, nothing special, just manners.   
He wants me to come every time but I say no and don't go and occasionally he says ""Why are you acting like that?"" or ""Do I just have one son?"" or ""What have I done to you?"". Those things break me down.  
Now, please respect me and don't judge what I'm saying up next.  
Me, I'm a person who finds it really hard loving and caring for people (only 2 people I've ever love(d) are my ex and my little brother). As harsh as I assume it sounds, my grandparents could die the next day and I 100% wouldn't feel sad at all. Pretty sure that the same goes for my mother, and there are no problems with her or them, but that's who I am. If my best friend die I'd probably be bummed for a week tops, but would be fine the next one.  
Yet, as much as I hate him and despise the person that he is, and as much as I should feel the same if I feel like that for people who were kind to me my entire life, I actually feel like I crumble when he says those things to me. Generally, it's such a sensitive topic in my mind for some reason. If he'd die I'd probably get into an existential crisis thinking about the father-son connection I was missing.  
Today my mom came into my room trying to make me peace it with him and I could barely hold back the tears.   
A little later I went to make me a coffee and he just arrived to pick up my brother, so he again wanted me to come and when I said no he said those things he says truly from his heart, and in one second I snapped and started crying. Because I was making my coffee I was with my back facing him so I just kept tearing and tearing. When I went into my room I just burst out crying again.   
I have no idea why I feel like this specifically towards such a horrible person that I hate so much, and the problem is - I could never actually sit and talk to him about this, also because he would disagree with what I have to say about hima dn also because I've never felt near enough comfortable talking with my parents even about something minor in my life. I avoid bringing people home, girls or guys. Don't even wanna tell anybody in the family about anything related to my social life. Just an extreme un-comfortableness mixed with the fact I know they both won't understand my way of looking at things and would just see me as a ""confused young person"".  


He really loves me, and he always has, but he lacks any awareness to the way he acts and if he sometimes doesn't - then he thinks his behavior is okay. I'm really lost in this whole situation and I have no idea what to do with such a relationship. I don't want to hang with him and I can't sit with him for 5 minutes without him remembering me why I hate him in the first place, but on the other hand, crying a river when I need to confront our relationship isn't something that should just get ignored.  
I'd appreciate some advice on what could I do.  


Thanks for reading, and sorry if it's too long, it's probably the inner me wanting to spill it all out. I'm too poor to afford a psychologist myself and if I can't talk about basic stuff with my parents, god forbid asking for one. ",09Jan2019,1
100,"(Some context) I have a girlfriend for about a year now and she is super religious. She is from the evangelical church (I don’t remember the specific branch), reads the bible everyday and is very close minded about anything that is not religious. I was raised in a catholic home, did the first communion by much of my mother and grandma pressure but was never much religious to begin with. Today I consider myself as a agnostic but I’m
Not a fan of labels. I just don’t believe in a god the way the Christian faith puts it.

So a lot of the thing I like (video games, movies, music) my girlfriend have a problem with. My favourite band is iron maiden and she hates it saying that I’m “surrounded by bad things”. I have an Diablo Pop from the video game Diablo in my room and she hates it. I tried talking to her, to explain that it is not bad in any way but she refuses to hear me.

So I’m lost here, how can I show her that these things are good an not the “doing of Satan himself”?

101,"So I guess I'll start with that happened this morning. 

I was called into my boss's office after I walked in the door this morning. He called me in to tell me that I'm consistently late (which is partially true) and that it's unacceptable. I have no need to defend myself on this aspect. My time management is poor when it comes to getting to work on time. This is not the issue I need advice for.

The next thing my boss brought up was that my pace is slower than that of my coworkers. To paraphrase, the gist of what my boss said was ""It seems like you come in for 8 hours and put in minimal effort compared to the rest of your coworkers."" What I haven't told anyone in my workplace is I have been on and off depressed since last summer (August 2018) and I haven't told my boss that I have been suffering from irregular insomnia (most days of the past weeks not getting more than 3 or 4 hours of sleep in a night) since about the end of November 2018, which led to a deeper depression than what I had been going through previously. I have not been diagnosed with depression or an anxiety disorder, but I'm definitely not at my norm. I feel burnt out and depressed, but I'm too embarrassed to say anything about it (not big on sharing feelings and personal things, I'm a very closed off person).

105,"I should’ve recognized the red flags. Before I moved in, I had someone staying in my house while it was being remodeled. A neighbor of mine would ring the doorbell a couple times a week asking to bum cigarettes. A couple weeks after I moved in, she frantically asked me for a ride to the grocery store as if it was urgent. I thought I would be a nice neighbor and give her a ride. Mind you, the grocery store is less than a half mile. I can see it from our street. This was the beginning of something that has plagued my life for the past two years now. Since then, she asks me to drive her somewhere at LEAST once a week. Particularly, she has me driving her and her kids to school. She has me take them to doctors appointments for her kids and herself constantly. She asks to store food in my fridge. She asks to cook in my kitchen because it’s remodeled. She asks for my WiFi passwords because hers doesn’t work all the time &amp; she claims it’s for her kids school. She drops her rude 5th grade daughter off at my house to use my laptop to do school projects, putting pressure on me to basically do the project for her to get her out of my house sooner. She has offered up my couch to (supposedly) recovered addicts that come to visit her. She has asked to borrow money after complaining that she’s already pawned off her wedding ring. I struggle with depression and had a particularly bad day. I explained this to her &amp; it was obvious I had been crying &amp; she still had the gall to see if I would drive her somewhere. 

If i ignore her texts and calls she rings my doorbell. She is a smoker so she is always outside on her porch and impossible to avoid. When she catches me face to face she always has a sob story. She &amp; her husband are recovered addicts with a disabled son, so she always uses those factors to pull on my heart strings. I am a 23 year old single full time student &amp; I am so stressed out trying to avoid this woman &amp; think of excuses every single day. As of this week I am taking her kids to school every morning &amp; she’s also asked me to take her somewhere else later this week. She recently made a remark about how her heater wasn’t been working &amp; how she was going to have her family sleep in my 900 sq ft condo, but i was out of town. ARE YOU KIDDING ME

I really struggle with saying no. I have been living this life of being her personal driver for two years now and I’m in so deep I’m afraid it will always be like this. She calls me her “adopted daughter”, probably as a way to guilt trip me. Can anyone help me break this cycle? I don’t think I have what it takes to confront her. I do my best to hesitate, make excuses &amp; be visibly uncomfortable with everything she asks of me but she is a professional user. I am really wanting to move away to get away from her, but that isn’t a possibility this year. What can i do?? I need advice for a non confrontational person.

111,"Issue arose yesterday after I returned from break.

For context my two roommates and I are early 20’s female. Living in a three bedroom apartment with a shared kitchen, living room, and laundry closet. I have lived with roommate A and B for a year and a half. Our relationships with each other haven’t been bad. However.

Roommate A has a history of being unclean and leaving dishes and trash to be taken out by myself or Roommate B.  Roommate B has lived with Roommate A for three years and have been “friends” prior. Roommate B is as clean as I am but recently less so because she’s tired of always cleaning. Roommate B as been gone for a month and plans on returning in a few days.

Yesterday morning I returned to the apartment only to find it largely disgusting in the common room areas. (Piled up dishes, trash overflowing, sticky floors + countertops, exposed fridge leftovers, mold on some,  plus food sitting in the microwave. Additionally whatever belongings A had strewn across the table tops.)

I admit I was angry because I found it disgusting to come into. (Especially when I cleaned before I left) However I brought in my belongings from the car and stayed in my bedroom for several hours. Once I came back to the kitchen it was only slightly better than before. Not clean. I then spent the nexts several hours taking down Christmas decorations, separating my dishes (because they were half cleaned), organizing Tupperware, placing her belongings onto a chair so that I could clean countertops, moving a puzzle on a table to eat at, and throwing out the months old recycling pile stacking up. This was all necessary for the sake of deep cleaning. 

The worst thing I did was go through leftovers to dispose of gross food, and put things in Tupperware that were exposed. (She has a problem with placing an entire crockpot or oven tray straight into the fridge rather than moving it to plastic.) Plus I had zero room to put anything of mine in. Roommate A walks in while I was doing this and starts getting irritated, but doesn’t say much aside from when I asked how old was some of the food. (I asked to maybe get some help cleaning up) She only says she will do it later. I had also moved over her three stacks of clothes blocking the laundry room. But finished her load of laundry sitting in the washer. So that I could then use it.

This is when the shit show starts.

I get a text from her saying don’t touch my clothes, puzzle, and you threw away my bf’s food. ( The text was much more passive aggressive than that but it made zero sense to me because I was  doing things that roommate B would of done in my position.) My response was “I’ll be aware in the future. All I ask is that you keep the common areas clean.” 

This pissed her off even more as she sends another text saying the kitchen was cleaned and mopped and that it wasn’t always going to be spotless. That she’d rather I not move her belongings because they are in specific places and there “for a reason”. That and I shouldn’t of thrown all of the Christmas decor into the corner. If I was going to do so then I had better put it all the way up. Ending the text with “If you’d don’t like it find somewhere else to live not with me”.

I left roommate A’s text without a response so that it wouldn’t escalate further. I ended up texting roommate B a heads up that we weren’t on good terms right now and that to hopefully help me with keeping roommate A accountable and clean.  Her response wasn’t anything bad, but was hopeful that we would come to an understanding.

Today was a continuation of the issue because I finished mopping the entire kitchen, pantry, bathroom, and wiping countertops. (All dirty af) While also putting away the Christmas decorations that she had said I should of put up if I was going to take it down. All this morning I cleaned by myself and only briefly walked by her to leave the apartment. Mid afternoon I get a text asking where her two small puzzles had gone. I responded “I wasn’t sure if it was going to go with the Christmas stuff but I placed them in a box under a tv.”  I then get an accusing text that she can’t tell which pieces are what, she wanted them to frame, and another don’t touch my stuff in all caps. 
(In my defense they were two easy large thirty piece puzzles that were sitting for over a month)

I defended myself saying they were Christmas stuff and that I was sorry but there was no way for me to know she wanted to keep them to frame. 

Her text back was “I needed to check with her when it comes to puzzles. Thank u. Bye.”


I really wish I could move out. However I can’t get out of my lease, and our complex has a history of bad roommates. What advice can be given to me to make this shit show easier to mange? Ideally something I can say to establish that this isn’t just her apartment and that we have to share space, (but not escalate the problem further.)   (((As another point she also breaks her lease by bringing her bf’s dog over who has consistently peed on the floor and a month ago ran out of her bedroom and almost fought my dog. I don’t trust her dog and would rather it not be over at all. I also pay to keep my dog.)))

117,"I apologize ahead of time for a long post but it’s just a lot that’s been accumulating over the past 20 something years and I honestly don’t know what to do or how to deal with it.

I grew up sleeping in the same room as my parents all the way to middle school. All I remember were lots of yelling and crying. My dad has always accused my mom of cheating on him and flirting with other men behind his back. This is the mother of 5 children, working over 40 hours a week at a dangerous factory, managing to take the kids to school, and keeping the household clean and organized. She had to take herself to the hospital with my second sister because my dad was no where to be found. When he drinks, he becomes a raging lunatic and expresses his hate for everyone (even his family) because he truly believes everyone is out to get him and is betraying him some way. He’s the type of man who has a complaint about every little thing or someone and his rants are absurd and will go on and on. It’s the same as today, minus the more apparent yelling at my mom. However, I am still home with them. And I would hear their conversations.    His tone towards her never changed: accusative, rude, and aggressive. My mom over the past years just learn to be quiet. In my eyes, they are already a divorced couple but just don’t want to go through the paper work. That plus my dad is unemployed. This is where i get more irked.

From as long as I remember, my dad would usually go back to his hometown in Malaysia for pretty much more than half the year. He explained to me it’s because he needs to run his business and take care of his mom. Guess what? Turns out all that were shit lies. All his travel and stat expenses came from my mom. He has no business and is unemployed and lives his dual life based on my mom’s tiny house income. My grandma is there too but guess what? His brother is the one living with her and taking care of her. My dad barely visits and when he does, it’s so he can be treated to a lunch or dinner. He is angry with the world because he is not rich yet. He thinks money is easy and being rich is easy and his wife and kids should be giving him money for “all he did and provided to us”. He is currently now a grandpa of 4 grandkids and he still has the same mentality about money. He tends to be back around Father’s Day or his birthday. Because of course, he is expecting money as his rightful gift. 

He is a very self righteous, disgusting piece of shit, thinking he deserves all the nicest things in the world. He thinks that he does “so much” for the family and my mom is just too disrespectful to him and gives him unnecessary attitude.

The most that he provided whenever he is back home is cook. My mom is a wonderful cook but he would twist it around as if he is the savior. “Your mom is so busy, I can just cook for you all.” He is a smoker so all his cooking is extra sodium. And he would make it very obvious that it’s extremely hard work. “I cooked for so long, go eat more. Why aren’t you eating more? Go eat more. Do you have any idea how long that took to prepare?” And the oh so famous repetitive lines of self compliment: “wow this is so good. Isn’t this good? It’s so good right ? Wow. Amazing”. This is repeated on pretty much every dish on the table. And to my mom: “go eat that. Go eat this. I made it. Why aren’t you eating it?” And then the famous guilt trips: “I made this for YOU. Aren’t I thoughtful? Go eat it.” - more than 80% of the time, it’s not even something I or my mom like to eat. The disgusting part is his lack of hygiene. Even when he is sick, he tastes everything. Dinner has multiple dishes and he would use his chopsticks, lick them, and poke at all the food. It’s not even a section of the dish. He poked all around it with his chopsticks, regardless if he is sick or not. He also does not like to flush the toilet and does not always wash his hands. This is purely disgusting. I actually develop stomach cramps and discomfort every time he is back home.

There is actually so much behind all this “daddy issues”. I am just so sick of it, sick of him, and tired of his shit. Every little thing he does or say, ticks me off. The most I can do are the formalities. “Good morning” “thank you”. I know I will most likely regret it one day when it’s too late and he is gone. I know I should be a respectful, understanding daughter and believe at the end of the day, he is just one very sad man and he is still my dad. And also, once upon a time, he did really care and love for me and my sisters. But it’s been 20 something years and my goodness. My inner ball of rage and disgust just seems to get bigger and bigger. I don’t know what to do. I know whenever I am upset about him, it is really damaging my own mental and emotional health. I can get so angry that I get myself stomach pains. I don’t know what I can do so I won’t be so easily impacted with him, his actions, and his words. I don’t know how to let all this go, especially when it is evident he is aging a lot and getting weaker. I am  semi-torn because 97% of me just really hates him to the core. The remaining 3% is my empathetic self grown up with strong values about family and respecting my elders. I honestly don’t know what to do to stop feeling this way. Please help.

118,My ex broke up with me 2 months ago. I was really hurt and devastated for an entire month. But about a month ago I met someone amazing and soon after the guy I had a crush on asked me out. I have been dating both guys for a month now. At first ( I know this sounds horrible) I dated them both because of the attention they gave me. They made me feel wanted and pretty. I didn’t think this was going to last  but I now have feelings for all three guys (I still love my ex). I hate that I am doing this because this is not who I am.

I spent the past like 2 hours deleting them one by one lol. She hasn't talked to me in like 5 hrs and we usually talk every day around this time. I'm pretty sure she's seen everything at this point. What do I do? ",09Jan2019,1
120,"This is my first post.  I was driving earlier today and a metro bus began to pull out from its stop right as I was going by.  I was about halfway past the bus when it began to pull out.  I drove my car into the center turn lane (the road I was on had a right lane, left lane, and then a center turn lane) to avoid the bus running into me.  I then finished passing it.

&amp;#x200B;

As I finished passing, the bus driver laid on his horn and then as we both stopped at a red light, the bus got very close to the back of my car.  I was upset and a little frazzled from the bus almost running me out of the lane, and I rolled my window down and flipped the bus off.  I let myself get upset and I'm not proud of acting like that but I did.  

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, at some point I saw a flash which I imagine was the driver taking a picture of my car.  The bus honked again.  The light then changed and as the car in front of me went forward I started to go but moved slower than probably would have normally.  Again, I was being a jerk at this point and I regret acting this way.  Up ahead, the next traffic light turned yellow and I stopped for it.  I probably could have gone through but I didn't.  The bus driver laid on his horn again, I'm sure angry at this point that I caused potentially both of us to not be able to get through the light.  

&amp;#x200B;

I then turned my turn signal on and start to move to the right to take a right at the light.  As I'm doing this the bus also moves to the right.  I few seconds later a hear yelling and I see that the bus driver is outside my window yelling at me.  I rolled down my window and he is yelling that he is has me on camera and that he is going to report me.  I yelled back that he was trying to run me off the road.  He yelled again that he is going to report me and then stormed away.  The light was still red but the coast was now clear so I made my ""free right"" turn and then drove away.  

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I just wanted to get advice from whoever wanted to give it.  I tried to be as unbiased as possible in my recounting of this but I know I am seeing it from my side which is automatically biased.  I don't know what legal ramifications can or will come from this and I am worried and embarrassed.  I did not get the bus number or anything.  I clearly overreacted by flipping off the driver and then accelerating a little slowly.  It could also be that by simply passing the bus I was in the wrong from the beginning regardless of how far past it I was when it started pulling out.  

&amp;#x200B;

If I could replay this I would apologize to the driver for being an asshole.  I could have done a better job defusing the situation when he approached my car and started yelling.  

&amp;#x200B;

I tend to stress about things and I am probably going to be thinking about this for awhile.  I have some questions, so if anyone out there has any advice, good or bad, I would be happy to hear it.

&amp;#x200B;

\-How much trouble am I in? 

\-Is this a traffic citation type situation?

\-Could I go to jail for this?

\-Am I a total asshole for this situation or just kind of an asshole?

\-How should I handle this going forward?

&amp;#x200B;

I will probably watch my mail for a citation or court summons or something for the next few weeks.  I don't plan to contact the city metro or report anything.  I do think that the driver of the bus didn't have to pull out when he did and was at least partially responsible.  I don't know what the law is regarding busses.  I'm pretty sure that busses have the right of way.  I am usually a safe driver and I try to avoid things like this but this happened so fast and unfortunately I handled it poorly.  Sorry for such a long story about a fairly short interaction.  Thank you for in advance for any advice.

124,"Hello guys

&amp;#x200B;

This will be one of those stories you come around once in a while. I PROMISE you that!

&amp;#x200B;

THE SETUP:

As a kid I was always always overly optimistic about how good life was going to be after I was an adult. I was raised by a single mother who was raised as a princess in a rich household but lived a poor and bad life once she was married. The person she married was the opposite of a ideal husband, inflicting everything from verbal, emotional and physical abuse.... the dish was garnished with him being absent and deadbeat. 

Furthermore, when the husband left her she moved to her parents house but her life was even harder as her brother's wives were ""not so nice"" and they inflicted their own fair share of verbal and emotional abuse. By this point my mother was 90% broken. Her brother's wives disliked me because my mother was poor and did not had a husband. But I was oblivious to all the hate around me because I had a cocoon of love spun around me by my maternal grandmother. She always told me stories of what it meant to be a good person and that a person should never commit immoral acts. She fed me with love and ate the abuse her sons gave her because she was helping her single daughter raise her child....but wouldn't raise her son's children so that they could go on vacations. She was my only source of comfort as a child....and STILL is.

&amp;#x200B;

THE DROPOUT:

When I was around 13 my deadbeat father came back and wanted to take us with him to a new country. Claiming that he was a changed man and that he realized that he had made a mistake. My mom had refused to  go with him but I dropped out of middle school because while other parents went to school to advocate for their children, my mother always went and complaint to school teachers that I was a shit son . The principal scolded me in front of her in the office but being scolded by teachers and other authoritative figures was a REGULAR thing as my mother was often present in school complaining about one thing or another. The complains could be about anything from not doing homework to incomplete school work because I was always lost. However, one specific incident is WELDED in my mind ..I still remember one time my mother went to the school PRINCIPAL and told her that I did not like bathing. She scolded me for an hour. Then the principal told the class teacher and the teacher said in front of the whole class ..""You don't take bath at home?"". The whole class laughed so hard but I had hit the deepest part of my school career. I drank that poison and never brought it up again. After that my life changed, I was bullied regularly. Kids would do UNSPEAKABLE things such as tear books and blame it on me as if they were seeking revenge for something I had done to them. I WAS THE OUTCAST FROM THAT DAY IN SCHOOL .....AS WELL AS AT HOME. I hated my life ... but never realized because of the love my grandma was showering me with. 

If the teacher asked me to stand up and read.. I would start sweating and LITERALLY SHAKING. I never understood why that was..but now I do. I had developed extreme anxiety. I would not talk to strangers. I would just be with my own self..doing my own thing...in my own world ...where everything was going to be perfect one day. My personal utopia. I would always hate my mother for this but never realize this until years later.

&amp;#x200B;

THE MOVE:

After we moved to a different country ..nothing had changed between my parents. He was using her so he could get into a new country easily and get all the government benefits but I had found myself some good friends in school. People I could talk to. They always thought that I was always trying hard to chill with them and I did not know why I wanted to hangout with friends while they wanted to go home to their family. It was because staying in school was better than coming home. There would be constant fights and screaming. It was too much to take. I would wake up with my parents screaming to the top of their lungs and just hating every bit fo each other's existence. I spent 6 years there but found some pleasure as I felt that life that rewarded me for the hard times.

&amp;#x200B;

THE MOVE 2:

We decided to move again...this time to a different country. My parents were back home and I was completing my final year of high school before joining university. I stayed alone for that year...it was lonely. Yet it was one of the most peaceful times of my life. I would go to school, come back and just do my own thing. It was perfect for me. I tried making friends and tried asking them if they wanted to go hangout but they thought I was weird and so I was not successful in making friends. I was still using the ""Do you want to be my friend ? "" type trick that was taught to me by my mother when I was 6 or 7. Needless to say... that trick does not work with north-american kids lol. However, I was at peace... not necessarily happy but at peace. Something that I had wanted so bad as a young kid.

Then my university started and my mom decided that it was my responsibility to do things for her all the time and it was my RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that she gets her medical license. But I wanted to hangout in university and enjoy my 4 years that I would never get again. But she would want my schedule and start calling me to come home as soon as my classes ended. She did not go out and started seeking me as her sole source of pleasure and communication. I did not like that OR WANT THAT. I flat out told her that I want to spend my time in school and that I would not be coming home right after my classes, and she accepted that due to a lack of choice. 

&amp;#x200B;

THE MISTAKE:

Then I made the mistake of smoking weed. I was always high in school. No tension...no challenges. I had attained my nirvana. I did that for 2 years of my university career and 3 years of my life. But I did it HEAVY. I was a POTHEAD. I did not have any patience to deal with my mother. I started to see her as a hurdle in my way as she would always rely on me for everything. She would not get her driving license...not go out...not make friends...NOT DO ANYTHING. She would go on to spend 4 years of her life playing candycrush. I FUCKING HATE CANDYCRUSH. I stopped helping her or a matter of fact stopped liking her even. She would force me into things and I would say NO! . We would fight all the time and one day I straight up told her how she scarred me as a kid. Her response was "" See if you can raise a better child living the life I did"", which I accept. I accept the hardships she went through. I accept that she had a very rough time raising me. I also accept that I did not help her achieve anything in this country as I did not want to and wanted her to do things by herself. We resented each other...and still do. I do not like her and she thinks I am the worst thing that there is. Someone who doesn't respect their parents and doesn't abide by their sayings. But that is only because I do not love her....I would support her financially but I am NOT her loving son..and I am sorry for that.

&amp;#x200B;

THE AFTERMATH:

I met a girl in university and it was nice. She was not accepted by my mother as my mother did not like the fact that I was giving her time to someone else. On top of that my POTHEAD nature would cause the girl a lot of sadness because of the anxiety induced fights I would have with her. The girl sticked by my side though and helped me through the rough times..... and I will always owe her that. My mom is shattered, my girlfriend and my mom hate each other,  and I am trying to glue my broken pieces together. I tell my girlfriend I love her...but I more or less accept her as she is the best this world has to offer in my opinion. And I accept that.

Oh btw I also have a cat and she is my best friend. She is the second person I love after my grandma. Maybe the only person I ever will too.!

I like writing. I write in my journal from time to time. I am going to put up a website and start publishing my writings for anyone interested to read.

At this point in my life.. all I want to do is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. That is what I do not know. I want to take my cat and move to a new country. Just me and my little bud..doing our own thing. Me working on myself while she hunts mice. 

I also dont know why I am writing this here. I think I just wanted to tell you that.... or maybe I want you guys to tell me that I am right for wanting to move a different place. Or maybe its because I want you guys to tell me to stay with my mom for her mental sanity. I do not know..but I am sharing.

TLDR: my gf scheduled a vacation and turns out I have 3 exams that week. And i feel like shit about it what do I do?

So I dont really know what I'm asking for, but I dont really know what to do in my situation.

So my girlfriend loves Disney and wants to take me to Disney world to experience it. Her whole family is going but she knows I'm not like super into it because of the huge crowds so shes paying for a significant part of my share. The only problem is that her whole family planned to take this trip for a week mid-February and I am in college.

I knew from the start that this would most likely interfere with an exam. But after making my concerns known, and after realizing that she is going on this trip with kris without me (the plans were already underway) I agreed to go and just get the exam moved. So her parents bought my plane ticket.

Now she told me this at the start of my fall semester of 2018. So I had no way of knowing when my exams for spring 2019 would be. Well I just found out yesturday I will be missing 2 exams and a lab. (I will have to take an additional exam online while on vacation) Also the make-up exams are significantly harder, to persuade people away from asking for one. Also they are only for use of extreme cases like death or bedridden illness. So I might not even get one.

I already emailed all my professors and all that, but I know my girlfriend feels so guilty. I know that her thinking about my exams will probably ruin her vacation and I feel horrible about it. I feel horrible that I'm mad that she told me about the trip so late in the planning stage, I just feel horrible. 

I'm thinking about just dropping out this semester before the refund date and taking a semester off. Like idk what to do, its caused me so much stress in the last to days it's almost brought me to tears. What do I do about this? How can I justify this trip to myself? Do I just back out and pay her parents for my plane ticket? Wth am I supposed to do?

I met a man at the gym and we hit it off. Simply put, he makes me laugh more than anybody I’ve ever come across. He makes me feel a spark in me I haven’t felt in a long time and he’s comforting, while putting me in my place when I need to be. 

Thing is, he’s married. 
They have a little boy. He’s 5. The wife has admitted to him that she is no longer is attracted to him. She told him to do whatever he wants as long as it’s not brought to her attention or their son’s. But they have no intent of divorcing any time soon for the sake of their son.

139,"I know it has been said on here many times, but I have some confusing feelings. I am a 19M living in Georgia, and she lives in NYC. We have been friends since 2014, but have had off and on communication, first being a separation due to her parents not trusting her, then because we were both in separate long term relationships. We had feelings, but never acted on them, as we felt distance would hurt like it did the first time. Now, I have been single for 8 months from my 3 year relationship. She and her BF broke up a few days before New Years. We had been talking off and on again since 2017, but really picked back up 4 months ago. I had met someone new, but they were a bit dodgy with communication, and as much as I liked them, it couldn't work. 

Now, the girl in NYC and I have plans to meet, but I am kinda nervous. I have feelings for her, and I think she may for me too. I have personal things that keep me here in GA, but I really want to see her. She is one of my best and closest friends now, but I am afraid to spoil it if I tell her I still have feelings. Maybe if I do though, she will feel the same. Trouble is, what then? We would be so far from eachother, and with my personal situations, I could rarely see her.",09Jan2019,1

I just wanted to ask anyone here, does anyone have any good advice on how I would go about learning to animate so I could let this dream come to fruition? I’ve had it for so long and it’s something I feel like I owe to myself since I feel like it’s the last true piece of my imagination I’ve got growing in me.

154,"Trigger Warning: Might detail sexual assault.

I am not sure what to do. I surely thought I would never talk about this and would, hopefully, forget about it. I was recently told by a friend that they were sexually assaulted as a child, which is what brought up memories of my own. 

I came from an abusive home where the simplest things would set my father, who has anger issues, off. I endured this verbal abuse for most of my life. 

When I was young, around the age of 6ish, my cousins lived across the street from me. I was best friends with my female cousin, who was only a couple months younger than me. I am not sure when it started, but when we would play with barbies, we both (I do not remember who started it) started using them in sexual scenarios. Over time, the scenarios changed. 

We began experimenting with each other, around age 6-7. We would lightly kiss one another, wondering what it felt like. That turned into deeper kissing. Then it turned into touching each other, though we never went underneath clothing. I do not remember if I was the one leading these experiments or whether she was. This happened for a while, then it stopped. It occurred once again when we were both around age 12-13. 

I have this huge uneasy feeling weighing on me. It was so long ago that I do not remember whether I forced her or she forced me or whether it was a mutual understanding. I was so young. I am scared of what I did or what was done to me.

I no longer talk to her because of a family issue that came years later. 

I am terrified. Did I take advantage of her? Did I assault her? I can't remember who led what, so, was I assaulted and taken advantage of? What do I make of this situation? ",09Jan2019,1
155," I haven't really told anyone about this, first time. So this girl, let's call her Jane. Me &amp; her met on Omegle around 2015 well Summer holidays going into year 10 I think. So we end up talking for around a month or so, jokes and stuff. I end up telling her how I feel depressed &amp; stuff , she use to comfort me, I was very attached to her, like I use to talk to her everyday 3,4,5am. It wasn't love but I needed her in my life for my mental health. 

We had a few arguments which resulted in me getting blocked on snapchat. I eventually somehow convinced her to unblock me.  One time she got rude to me , I ended up finding her no make up pics and threatened to send to a guy she liked. She then apologised. 

After some time, she started to reply once a week  I questioned her how comes she said "" I don't use my phone that often"". Gullible me believed that. 

Then eventually she stopped talking to me altogether. Still don't know whether she was in a relationship or not. From there, I went completely mental; absolutely psycho mode. 

I called her several times, messaged her so many times. The thing that broke me was that when she said she didn't care, when I said "" it started again"". Meaning me being depressed and suicidal.  I was sending her ugly pics to her instagram, she changed her insta name to stop me messaging her. I took that name &amp; made an account. Swore at her so many times, swore called her a fucking terrorist etc.  I told her to say sorry, she didn't.  eventually I got into her snapchat account, found so many people blocked. Saw the registered number linked to it &amp; e-mail. logged into her e-mail, found her address. 

Then I found her on Facebook , the start of this year I think. Messaged her, she was being bitchy. I threatened that I have her snap account. She said "" babe, I haven't used that account in 3 years"". I told her I had her address she said "" what are you going to send me a postcard?"". 

I then eventually found that the house was sold in 2015-16. 

I requested her data from snapchat from her old account, found her new account from there. Start messaging her. Saw her story etc, called her Muslim bitch. She blocked me.  But I know what Uni she attends from her Facebook info. One of her accounts says she's married. but idk.  

I kept messaging her on Facebook. I  said ""Oi"". She replies "" suck your dad"" ( insult in the country i live in) . I tell her to say sorry.

She asks why should she apologise. I say I forgot, she says then why should I say it. Then eventually she says sorry. Then I add some more cussing her parents.   And say "" my dad's a dickhead, my mum should of  swallowed me"". She retaliated &amp; says something about my parents but way worse. 

You see when she said sorry, I felt so empty and didn't know what to do. That she never understood what wrong she did. I didn't want to tell her to as she would probably laugh at me. Or comfort me then in a more polite way to fuck off and never message again. Which I wouldn't be able to cope with. 

I feel so empty and weird. Don't know. I messaged and swore at her on insta a couple days ago. Like did she really not care?

I did get an online tarot card reading done. Which I really don't believe in. But this time the person said "" But eventually you encountered depression and sadness, to which you resorted to a female maternal figure like mother who provided you with the emotional and mental support to give you mental strength. However you still hold past thoughts""  

So that made me think, or was that generic bullshit. 

So yeah.

158,"i’ll try to make this as short and to the point as possible, as i am really hoping for any kind of useful advice pertaining to my current situation 

graduating high school at 18, i thought i was going to go into the Air Force active duty and get help for my college funding that way.
life happened, and i have decided the military is not for me as i battle anxiety greatly (i also got into a car accident at 20 yrs old and have a titanium rod in my femur bone).
i’ve worked so many dead end, useless jobs it’s not even funny anymore and i am starting to panic that i will never get my shit together.

the problem is several things. 1- i am really indecisive, 2- money (i live with my 27 yr old boyfriend of 4 years now, and he is the breadwinner for us with a crappy but well paying factory job. my parents do not have money to pay for my school, but the government thinks they do as i do not qualify for much financial aid AT ALL. i do not have children and am not married and i am not yet 24 so you know..), and 3- every time i think i have figured out what i finally want to go back to school for, it seems as if the degrees i have any interest in are not worth the debt.

all of that being said, i turn 23 in feb and i have decided that regardless, i need to get my degree in something ASAP. i do not even have an associates yet. i am really behind compared to my classmates, and it’s not a matter of intelligence. I graduated high school with an academic honors diploma, and a 3.8 GPA.

so i was wondering if anyone can give me some input on the degrees i am currently looking into

Degrees that i feel would fit me include as follows

Sociology, Criminal Justice, Psychology 

I’m really interested in Majoring in Sociology, and Minoring in Environmental Sciences because ideally, my dream is to be a DNR/Game Warden/Conservation Officer 

Being inside working on a computer all day would bore me right to death, and blood/germs are an absolute no for me so that’s why Nursing or any medical degree is out of my interest. I’m also not super great at math. I love english/writing/reading and history, and just philosophy and thinking deep. I love being outside, nature, and genuinely helping people. 

I know nobody can make a decision for me, but before i put myself into debt for school, I need some solid advice as to why or why not to go into that field/degree.
When i exhibit my concerns towards my family, friends, and even my boyfriend, nobody knows what to say me to me anymore at this point because I just truly have no idea what to do with my life. ",09Jan2019,1

This has happened since I can remember. Recently though, it’s started happening even when I’m with people. I love my boyfriend and that’s been proven to me over and over again, but I just haven’t been able to feel any sort of romantic, passionate, exiting emotions. He still makes me laugh and I love hanging out with him and I really care about him, but nothing beyond that is eliciting any emotion. It’s not just him either. Its the same thing with work too. I really don’t like my job, and I usually complain about it and I don’t have fun when I’m there, but these past few days, I just feel nothing towards going to/being at work. Which I suppose it’s a step up from loathing it but it’s still concerning. Days like this have happened before but have gone away after 2-3 days and my emotions come back but this time, it doesnt seem to be going away.

162,"It’s 4:25AM where I live, and I have to wake up for school at 6:30 so that’s what’s currently happening. I also had to lean half a book for a test tomorrow which I had whole fucking 12 days to do. That’s only one subject by the way. I have four more to learn. 40 pages from each of them at best. 

I’ve actually been a good student, up to this point, but I guess that’s the least of my problems. 

Let’s start with the fact that I gave a blowjob to a guy I never even met before (it happened when I was drunk because I would never in my right mind do that) and he is also 14 years older than me, so that’s also there. 

[long story short, I got mixed in with a bad crowd, I didn’t know who they were at the time though, but still.. It’s a shit situation with a shitty outcome] 

That happened this summer, in July I think, and before that I was actually pretty normal for my age I guess. The shitstorm began when I befriended a girl that I never even liked and because of that I ended up where I am right now. 

All of my friends, acquaintances actually, think of me like the average girl that’s, let’s say an easy girl, but I’m not? I’ve never had a relationship that was longer than three months and I was with two guys in total. And a few others but it was a one time thing, okay fuck, I fucking admit it. I slightly behave like a hoe (don’t wanna say whore, because I’m definitely not that, even though that’s almost the same thing, but this sounds less harsh I guess) It’s important to know that I feel like s h i t after, and if it doesn’t mean anything, the thought comforts me a little bit so I like to think that’s a good thing. 

I don’t know where I’m going with this, but I just want to say, I’m in a pretty bad spot now. 

I spent my new year with some of my friends thinking it’ll be alright but NOPE, fuck that, I got drunk and ended up with some guy who’s literally trying to win me over for two years.

I’m trying so hard to change, it’s really not the problem in the occasional hookups, but in me and my overreacting over every single thing, although I don’t know if I’m actually overreacting or not. Fuck. 

I’ve retreated from instagram, actually I deleted the old one with a large number of followers because it made me depressed somehow, and I made a new one with maybe 200 followers (just my close friends), even though I don’t post anything, it makes me feel more secure and in control, I guess. 

I’ve never had a mental disorder, and I don’t think I have one now. i just make shitty decision and feel like shit after making them for a long, long, very long time. 

I also didn’t get into the school I wanted, so now I have to wait until June to transfer. And I have to be excellent in this school in order to do that, which I’m definitely not. 

I’m also really bad sometimes to my parents, even though we have a great relationship. We literally have zero family issues and they are the best. I guess I’d just say I’m just a really difficult person to keep up with and I’m just a piece of shit?

I run from my problems by staying home 24/7 and reading books, watching movies, and, playing that one fucking game I played for the larger part of my life, and getting depressed and tired over everything. 

Any advice on how not to be a piece of shit anymore (if you actually understood this, even though I myself didn’t get what I typed down)?

TL ; DR - if you don’t like reading late night brainstorming from total strangers, just skip this one, thanks.

[I don’t swear usually, it’s just that it’s 5AM, and I’m really damn sad, and this is anonymous so why not?]

Just one more thing, English is not my first language, so I apologize if there were any mistakes, feel free to correct me. If you’ve taken the time to read my shitstorming, thank you so much, I hope it didn’t sound too complicated. ",09Jan2019,1

165,"I live in a small rural-ish city on the east coast of the U.S., which I've always hated. No lie. There is nothing to do except hunt, fish, hike (which all require, at least, a good 30-45 minute drive), or if you're really wanting to go out of your way for other activities it'll probably be at least a hour and a half drive.

I know most of the people in the area, the same people I went to High School with (we all even knew a lot of people from the other surrounding high schools), the same people I partied with as a young, driven, and intelligent guy (not boasting). They still talk about high school even though its been almost 10 years since graduation. The ""star"" athletes from our tiny schools are still being put up on pedestals for their HS sports achievements even though they're barely scraping by in life now. These very old friends, now acquaintances of mine, still think of me as the same person that they knew before I went to college even though I matured a lot and of course changed over the years. I guess this is weird to them because they're just doing the same things with the same people trying to keep everyone happy and not really experiencing other areas or new things (I, unfortunately, ended up coming back to town after graduation). I've had bad experiences with half of them now because of the disconnect college put between us, even though I never forgot about them or anything of that sort. I came back home and was kind, to only have people use back-handed comments and other passive-aggressive behavior against me. It took me a while to accept it and see what was going on. I was honestly shocked at the lack of respect and how close-minded everyone was. I honestly think it's the area. I hate to say this, but I always thought of a lot of people in the area as underachievers who cared more about their town reputation than doing what's right and enjoying life by trying new things and not caring how stupid you look doing it as long as you are enjoying your life. I thought they'd outgrow it. People thought I was an asshole/tool (like wtf?) for thinking that way and I allowed it to finally get in my head when I moved back. I was always driven and ambitious and they would try to put me down. I still see a bunch of them to this day, I'm polite to avoid anymore drama, but all of this crap has really worn on me. I'm not the same and am in need of a change. I need to get my interesting, creative, and adventurous way of life back.

Many people in college respected me for my work ethic, kindness, open-mindedness, willingness to try all sorts of new things, and good moral behavior. We were all striving for something and the people I conversed with were bright, open-minded, and free-spirited, like myself. Then I started running with the wrong group in college because I was too kind, one person was from my hometown who I knew was not that serious about his studies and just frankly kind of an idiot, and was ""giving them the benefit of a doubt."" This was essentially the dumbest thing I could have ever decided to do. Now, I feel compromised, less intelligent, definitely less driven and less of a stand-up guy. I think the stupidity that I allowed into my life by staying in my hometown with these people, and hanging with some of those guys sometimes in college because I'm too kind and caring of others who ultimately don't care and are taking me for granted, who don't strive for much and it has gradually torn me down and it's all my fault for allowing it to happen.

Recently, I have been trying to face the facts that I am not compatible with most of the people in the area and due to the bad experiences I've had with a lot of them, along with the disconnect, that I don't feel like even giving any of them the time of day. I went through a very rough time trying to comprehend all of this stuff only to have more people walk all over me when I was weak. I don't trust half of the people because of these bad experiences and for good reason. For example, I went to a bar to grab a beer the other night and ran into eight people from high school who were all still acting the same. IDK why I've tortured myself for so long by staying here, but I'm currently planning to work two jobs over the course of the next six or so months and move out to California, a city that is about 10 minutes from the beach. I have always been a chill and laid back, understanding, open-minded, polite, friendly, and intelligent dude and all of this BS I'm surrounded by is just killing me. These people assume like no other. They talk behind your back like no other. For no logical reason. I think it's because they literally have nothing better to do, taking into account the area and how I feel like everyone is still stuck in freakin' HS and still hanging out with the same people, everyone knows everyone's business (except for me, I stay out of that, it's not my place), which they hold against people for forever. It's just ridiculous and I'm nothing like that. Frankly, Idgaf about other peoples affairs and just hope they're healthy and happy - none of their personal matters concern me - and I'm definitely not going to judge anyone. Not my place. So, yeah. Also, there are not many job opportunities here for my degree and I am sick of feeling trapped. Idk if I'm depressed, or what, but something keeps telling me to just get the hell out of dodge and do my own thing. I'm not trying to run away from the people or anything, I just feel like I don't belong, can't relate, and want NOTHING to do with these fake/backstabbing/passive-aggressive people who will treat me like dirt and silently judge. And I thought these people were my friends. Then you walk away from them and they take it extremely personal and talk even more crap behind your back. Jesus. I've already cut ties with them all now, after the most recent and most eye-opening bad experiences (deleted them from my phone and everything else) and when I move I definitely will not be thinking back on any of them. I feel like the whole town is talking behind me back and they never let anything go. Not cool.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I hate my small city bc of the lack of jobs for my degree, the people who still live in HS 10 years later, I know everyone in the area and they are still doing the same things (kinda settling, trust me), bad experiences, and nothing to do. Don't know if I'm depressed, but all of this has definitely worn on me, big time. Seriously planning to move to Cali, close to the beach bc I'm normally super chill, and do my own thing instead of wasting away here where I don't feel respected or compatible with anyone due to people assuming things out of thin air and one misunderstanding after another. Must be something in the water. Have any of you ever felt this way in your small city/town and know what I'm talking about? Did you move? How much happier or miserable are you now?

169,"This is a well-layered situation, so I'll try to put it in simplest terms.

&amp;#x200B;

About two years ago, my boyfriend and I were just starting our relationship. He was a member of this club at his college, and through this club I was introduced to a girl named Trinity. My boyfriend, Dean, had known Trinity in the past and didn't advise being friends with her. But I noticed that the entirety of the club, my boyfriend included, would constantly make fun of her. You could tell that there was something mentally off about Trinity, because she has a tendency to ramble on about unrelated things and say nonsensical statements very often. However she was very nice and seemed to wanna be friends with me. She had never done anything to upset me, so I saw no problem with befriending her. I asked Dean to lay off the verbal abuse, and to not encourage any shit-talk about her. I got to know Trinity pretty well, and we had a good relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

Dean never liked Trinity. He thought she was legitimately stupid, and more trouble than she was worth. The whole club disliked her for similar reasons, so I thought that was Dean's only reason to dislike her; he's a guy that likes to go with the flow.

&amp;#x200B;

In the middle of 2018, my brother and I were forced to get an apartment/house because my parents sold their house and we needed to get out. My brother and I mooched off of Dean for a month or so until we all decided to rent a house together. Employment was tricky at this time, and we were all very close to being homeless. Luckily, Trinity pulls some strings and she finds us a low-rent, convenient, historic home for rent. We snatch it up, and even move in one month before our first rent check was due. We figured that since Trinity was nice enough to find us the house, she could use it whenever she wanted to, rent free. So we set her up a room to herself; she had little privacy, but she had a bed, a room, and a heater. She was all set.

&amp;#x200B;

A month comes and goes, and Trinity offers to wash the dishes as a form of ""rent"". We were all fine with that, of course. She never washed the dishes though; she would run a sinkful of water, a drop of soap, soak the dishes, then rinse them. Two days a week. The dishes were never really clean, but I was so grateful to have a roof over my head that I didn't care. I kept my mouth shut.

&amp;#x200B;

Then Trinity starts shit-talking my boyfriend, about how he doesn't do too many household chores. She would start fights between my boyfriend and me because of this. I never knew at the time, because I was still wanting to see Trinity as a friend. Dean was pissed at her because he knew she was the root cause of the arguments. If Trinity wasn't shit-talking, we wouldn't have argued.

&amp;#x200B;

Countless times, we would come into the house to find Trinity snooping on our computers, and even helping herself to... medications that didn't belong to her, in copious amounts at that. She started taking change out of my change jar, and she would hog the washer and dryer all to herself. Her belongings were never put away, which cluttered the house up impressively. Her messes were all over the house, but she would leave sticky notes around messes that Dean and I would leave. She was making ""rules"" for the house that she had absolutely no right to make, enforcing them passive-aggressively, and not doing any chores herself. She would use my brother's room to get high ALL DAY LONG. Even on the days when she worked: she would smoke RIGHT BEFORE going to work. My brother encouraged this, too. He was more than willing to do things for Trinity, and look past her potential snooping/stealing problem. (He still doesn't believe us when we say she was snooping/stealing.)

&amp;#x200B;

Through all of this, I was STILL on her side because I felt like she had been treated so badly by that club. I still considered myself her close friend. I noticed all these things, but I looked past it for the sake of friendship.

&amp;#x200B;

Shit hit the fan soon after, however. After asking her if it was okay to rearrange her (extremely cluttered, hopeless, dingy, god-awfully designed) bedroom, she was all for the idea. We come up with a good layout together, and then agree to make it happen ASAP. She leaves for work right after, and I go ahead and rearrange the room for her, leaving her personal belongings where I found them. When she comes home from having a bad day at work, she completely chews me out for rearranging without her. She accuses me of not listening to her, though she never told me to wait to rearrange.

&amp;#x200B;

This made me so upset, I was shaking with rage. I fix up her room to look nice (moving MY bed, and MY tables), and she yells at me for it. After three days of contemplating how to deal with the situation, Dean and I decide to ask her to leave the house permanently. We kicked her out. She was still allowed to come over to the house, because she was and still is best friends with my brother Rory. In fact, Rory has since developed a feeling of love for Trinity and was very willing to take her side of this situation. He was upset that we decided to kick her out, but there was nothing he could do about it. Two against one.

&amp;#x200B;

Trinity packs her shit, and leaves her house key on the bed she was using. Very bitterly. 

&amp;#x200B;

Only, that evidently wasn't the only key she possessed. A month later, she enters the front door using her key at 9am to see if Rory wanted to smoke and hang out (Rory was in the back of the house, not in view of the front door). After telling Rory about this, he denies that she has a spare key. Trinity even lies to him directly, stating that she doesn't have one. But there was no possible way she could have entered the front door without a key because we had JUST locked it, not twenty seconds prior. So after being kicked out of the house, she still feels it's acceptable to come and go as she pleases. Rory sees NO problem with this, and doesn't even believe me or Dean when we tell him that she DEFINITELY has another key. He says it's up to Dean and I to prove that she's lying.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do. My own brother won't listen to my concerns, and even takes her side in every situation. I've talked to my parents, our landlord, everybody to try and gather advice on what to do. The only solution I have for now is changing the locks. But I'm fearful that Trinity has something else up her sleeve; she's actively lying to my brother about the key that she MUST have, which tells me she's hiding something. And I don't know what that something is.

So, im an 18 year old male (straight (for any of those who are curious)) and im in college. All my life ive been practically dwarfed by my lack of self confidence. Never once have I been in a relationship. Im still virgin, Ive never been in a relationship before, Ive never kissed a girl, never hugged a girl.. ive never even held hands with a girl before. I am too desperate to experience these things. I see people kissing and holding hands all over my campus and every time i look I just envy it more and more. 

Now, im not mad at women or anything, im mad at myself. I could be doing SO much better if I had some sort of confidence, but i don't. I can't forget about the things that I keep failing at, and the second I see the slightest sign that a girl could possibly be interested in me, I act like an annoying prick. 

I know what my problem is, I just dont know how to fix my problem. People tell me to forget about it, but I cant.. its impossible. It's seriously making me more and more depressed when I think about it. ALL of my friends, almost everyone I know in group of people that i have met from highschool and college have been somewhere with someone before. Everytime I remind myself of that it just hurts me deep down. It proves to show I have no confidence in this kind of stuff.

176,"I'm a girl, early 20s, have been using the Tinder app for about three weeks. Just got banned today.

Anyway, me and my new FWB met irl once, did the thing, and we had plans to see e/o again in about two days. I'm wondering if I should go try and meet up with him in person to let him know what happened and that I didn't block/unmatch him? I know where he lives and it just seems like the right thing to do since I don't want him to get the impression that he got used.

But the reason I'm still conflicted about doing this is because I'm not sure if it's THAT serious of a situation. I know he's got other FWBs he could easily call up and I've only seen him once so I don't actually know him as a person.

I’m a 36 year old male and having a semi crisis. 
It feels like first world problems but I don’t know how to move on. 

I am married, have two kids and a decent job in medical information technology for a huge hospital. A nice house, cars, beautiful wife. No degree but I’m smart and my skill and persona has afforded me a good salary. I pull down over 120k myself 
But I’ve always wanted to work in video games. 

Recently landed a series of phone screens with a major gaming company in California. 

They like me enough to fly me out for one face to face interview. Normally I talk to a company and get shot down for asking for too much money, but this time they didn’t blink.  I ask for enough to support my family and the older I’ve gotten I feel like that ship has sailed. But this time it may be possible. 


The last few years have been hard. The second child, our son, has taken a toll on us in our relationship. No sleep, no sex, some arguing. So I’m now worried that I’m being selfish in possibly moving the family across the country to make  video games. 
That’s something a 20 something does right?

Should I fly out to meet them next weekend or just pass and resign myself to being a company man?

I’m worried this may take more of a toll on the marriage. I love me wife and do not want to leave or jeopardize anything but I also think that this may be the once in a lifetime chance to be truly happy at work and not just making money to pay for day care and house note. But I know I’m lucky. I lucked out in this maybe I should stay put and stick it out.  

It’s fly out and try my shot at the dream job or stay and work the  safer gig until I morph into an old conservative somehow, yelling at kids on video games because I’m on the wrong side of the screen and never took my chance.

However, I want to continue working the old job a couple hours a week (like, a Tuesday night) to help out the already short-staffed crew, and because I love my old coworkers— but I hate my job, so I don’t wanna be working there more than once a week. 

But, if I want to completely move my time to the new job, I have to guarantee that I’m going to be getting hours— and as of being hired two weeks ago, I’ve only worked four short (4-5 hour) shifts.

I’m hesitant to ask for more hours so soon after being hired because I don’t know the managers, my coworkers, the new job that well, so I’m not totally sure *how* to ask that question without sounding, oh, greedy or ungrateful? (Not sure if that word choice makes sense).

187,"Hi, throwaway here for obvious reasons. This might be be a long one, so buckle up! TLDR at bottom. For clarification, I’m a 19 year old female in college. 



So freshman year of college (fall of 2017), I was enjoying my new freedom, so naturally, I went a little crazy. I unleashed the crazy by sleeping around (safely, of course). Pretty typical college experience for girls, right? Then one day, I met up with this guy, “Joey” from my university on tinder. We hit it off. A few days later, we slept together. Before I knew it, an one night stand turned into my first serious relationship. We fell in love. 

Joey and I broke up at the beginning of this fall semester (fall of 2018), because he went back home to attend community college for a year and we didn’t want to do long distance given our age and distance. (He recently told me he plans to return to my university fall 2019) It was hard, heart-wrenching, and devastating. I know some people might say that I’m too young to know what “real love” is like, but I’m telling you, this was it. True love. We still love each other, even now. We agreed that when he comes back, after we settle in for the fall and if we were both still single, we’d go on a date and see what happened from there. But this post isn’t all about him.

So after we broke up, I went back to sleeping around, although I wasn’t the same person as I was a year ago. This time around, I used sex as a distraction. *I know, I know.* Not the world’s healthiest coping mechanism, but I didn’t grow up in a family who talked about emotions or anything like that. Oh well. So anyways, I was sleeping around occasionally, having a bit of fun, until one day, I matched with one of my best friends on Tinder. Let’s call him Trevor. He’s also one of my ex’s fraternity brothers. My friend group is pretty tight knit, but Joey was never really that close with Trevor, I was. Our friendship was always pretty solid, and we’re both very dirty minded people with flirty personalities, so we would jokingly flirt once in a while. Looking back, it wasn’t all jokingly.

It’s an unspoken rule in my friend group that if we see each other on Tinder or whatever, we swipe right. Because it’s funny. So Trevor and I swiped right and started this whole mess. I started the conversation, and we basically pretended to not know each other and acted as if we were just now meeting. It was funny, sweet, flirty, and by the end of the conversation, we had somehow set up a date for that following Friday. 

Cut to the next day. He came over to hang out and watch a movie, which was a pretty normal thing for us to do. But this time was different. We both knew that the previous night’s conversation was part joking and part real, but we didn’t actually mention it. Instead, it was like: 

Me: “So, got any plans this weekend?”

T: “Not much. I’ve got a hot date on Friday night, though”

Me: “Oh really? Where you taking her?”

T: “I don’t know yet, maybe (place) or (my favorite place)”

Me: “Hmm. Tough choice, but if it’s a first date, take her to (my favorite place). It’s got a more romantic vibe” 

T: “Good point. Maybe I’ll take her there.”

Me: “Maybe. Let me know how it goes ;)”

He laughed, and there was this moment where we just kind of shared a knowing look. Then we just...jumped at each other. I’d never been kissed like that before. It just kind of shocked me to my core. Then he left, and we didn’t hang out until he picked me up for our date. 

So I’ll sum up what happened after that date. It went well. Surprisingly well. We didn’t go on any more dates because it was too soon after the break-up for me, and I wasn’t looking for a relationship, just sex. Then we started messing around and became FWBs. It was really fun. Towards the end, there was some drama because Trevor found out I kissed someone we both know at a party when I was drunk as fuck, and got upset. I was angry because he didn’t have the right to be upset, right? 

Fast forward to a bit later. Trevor came over and we were making out when he suddenly stopped and stood up looking upset. I asked him what was wrong, and he just gave me this look like he was in the worst possible pain. Yup. You guessed it. He told me he was in love with me, and had been since April 2018.  I honestly had no idea (I’m pretty oblivious about stuff like that), and since I didn’t have feelings for him, I panicked and broke off the FWB/physical aspect of our relationship. We agreed to remain friends, but I elected to give him space for several weeks. Then we started hanging out regularly again. 

And right before winter break, we were in my room hanging out the day after he and his girlfriend of a month broke up. (He got a girlfriend a week after confessing his love for me, a little weird but ok?) and we had been chatting when we ran out of things to say. And he had this weird look on his face so I asked him if he was alright, and he was like “aw, fuck it”, and before I knew it, he was on top of me, and we were making out. Then we stopped and I said “uhhh” and he said, “I know”. We didn’t talk about it after that. 

And now I’m slowly realizing that I have feelings for Trevor. I know I‘m still in love with Joey, and I’m not entirely sure Trevor still has feelings for me, so I can’t just tell him. Plus I’m incredibly worried about Joey finding out, because me going behind his back to hook up with his frat brother regularly would definitely crush him. And if Joey and I do even get back together, it’d hurt Trevor. I keep thinking about Joey, while also thinking about kissing Trevor again. The strange part is that even though I went behind Joey’s back, I don’t feel guilty at all. I feel like I should feel guilty. I guess I feel guilty because I don’t feel guilty. The thing is I know Joey wouldn’t be angry if Trevor was some random dude I met and started having feelings for. But Joey would be upset because Trevor is Joey’s *brother*. 

I’m just feeling very conflicted, confused, and worried. I wish I could just put all my feelings/thoughts of Trevor in a little box, lock it, pour concrete on said box, and sink it in the Pacific. But obviously, I can’t do that.


There’s so much more to the story of Joey and I, Trevor and I, that I couldn’t post it all. But here’s some extra info: my friend group is Joey, Trevor, a few of their brothers, me, and a few girls who are all sweethearts in the same fraternity. If you don’t know, a sweetheart is basically a cheerleader for the fraternity. We help plan/set up for parties, help recruit, basically be the hot girls at the parties to boost recruitment. And nobody, and I mean NOBODY else knows about Trevor and I. It was all super secret.



So....what the hell do I do? I need advice so badly. Thank you for reading this if you made it all the way through my rambling!



TLDR: My ex and I (whom I still love and still loves me) broke up due to circumstances outside our relationship, and I think I have feelings for my best friend who also happens to be my ex’s former frat brother and also confessed his love for me but drama went down so I’m not sure how he feels about me anymore.",09Jan2019,1

189,"Okay, so the overview:

As a teenager I had money-signs in my eyes when it came to majors and jobs. Half kidding, but the truth is I am a practical person and wanted a practical major so I could have a practical life. I chose computer science, graduated, and immediately afterwards started an internship that eventually turned into a full time analyst role. 

Don’t get me wrong, there’s pros:
* I like my job and it’s flexibility. My paychecks are $2500. Usually I don’t have to look at the price of my Starbucks 
* I can go into and leave work whenever and have an option to work at home here and there
* medical care 
* my boss is someone that believed in me even when I told him i didn’t know really how to use Excel (lmao I slipped through the cracks on this during school) and still hired me and built me into what I am.
* my boss and team and literally a dream. Just honestly fantastic people. I love them 

But everyday I feel these...
The cons:
* I feel old. I’m 21 and I work with people 33+. I don’t get a ton of free time because my current commute is long, and when I do move closer to work for six months soon it’ll be in a city I don’t SUPER care for that is far from family and friends 
* I don’t feel like the job is as computer sciencey as I hoped. Like, it is. It’s a tech job. But it’s such a specific job that it’s hard to use the skill set for other jobs (if that makes sense)
* I feel the money is great.... but honestly, it doesn’t make up for feeling like I’m missing out on something more in life. I would feel happier in life if I had this when I was 30.
* I got divorced this year. At 21. And I feel with my job and things like that in my past like I’m 45. And I wanna feel young.

**THE PLAN**
In September I will be at this company a year. I am quitting and moving to LA. I still plan to get a tech job down there, but I’m moving whether I have a job or not prior. I don’t know what I want to do in life so I am preparing for software engineering interviews. I will have at least $10K saved by the time I move.

I will be leaving my job, my family, my friends, and selling everything I have an likely be taking a pay cut if I do move. But quite honestly I just want to let my hair down and sit on the beach and let looser.

So, Reddit: am I making a mistake? I feel like my family is going to be supportive but also like WTF. I feel like a lot of people in my life are going to ask why the hell is this successful girl throwing it away. I wonder if I’m going to wish I didn’t leave my friends and the new relationships I formed. But I feel like I gotta go and be young and distance myself from some of the memories here. Have you done this? Did you regret it?

Side note: for those that know the tech industry in LA- I’m not expecting a job right away because of the job market (thinking Venice/Santa Monica) and I am shit at technical interviews (get nervous while coding) so that’s why I know I’ll likely move with literally nothing lined up.",09Jan2019,1

194,"I’ve been with my boyfriend almost two years now and are moving across the country together in May. I love him very much. When we met it was an instant connection. He’s been there for me and supported me when I needed it most (and I the same for him). Yet lately, the last few months or so, I’ve been really struggling with our relationship. The love and passion are still there but I find myself more often than not wanting to start a new when I move. (Moving for my job he’s moving for me). I wonder if I am in love with the man he could be but not the man he is. Our maturity levels don’t match and I worry our life goals aren’t in sync. I walked out one time and it was immature of me but he was screaming (so loud you could hear him across the street from our house) about his laptop not working and I was scared. 

His anger, while never directed at me, has been a frequent cause for concern as he refuses to seek help or counseling for anger management. I’m a person where a problem arises and I look at all the possible ways to fix something and he often can’t stand that. 

Yet the scariest part of leaving him is hurting his family who I just met and are so nice. And embarrassing my parents who have treated him like a son and gone above and beyond. 

I’m very torn on what to do. And while it seems like all I’ve done is complain, he is a great guy and I am the best version of me around him. I just don’t know if I can handle the lack of motivation and maturity sometimes.

Current job:

\- I'm established, have responsibilities, and am known as the 'go-to' person in some key areas. I expect to be promoted in a year (per my manager). I like my team and work culture. My manager and I get along great and I truly think she has my back. There are lots of chances to learn new things. It's what I'm used to and I'm comfortable there.

\-I'm way overworked, we're understaffed. The stress is considerable and there hasn't been a night where I'm not working at home in months. The company leadership is often volatile - high acquisition mode or high lay-off mode. This hasn't really changed and the pattern is evident to me after this time. My growth has been stunted frequently in this environment. 

&amp;#x200B;

New Job:

\-New beginnings with a more established, larger company. A chance to really own a role instead of jumping between projects. Something to shake up my routine. Not the same level of stress. Seems to have a great culture, benefits, and the location is perfect. I will also learn new things.

\-Starting from the bottom after a few years of being a respected long-time employee. Promotion probably won't happen within a year. Description has been pretty vague so far. Maybe not as many chances to grow? Also it's hard to leave my current team, especially as we're near the end of a huge project's deadline (but there are always huge deadlines).

202,"I will include a TL;DR but I’d prefer if people only answer if they read the whole post, please. Also this is a throwaway account because my boyfriend (21M) follows my main account. 

My boyfriend and I have been together for a year. We’ve known each other for quite a long time; he has seen me go through other relationships as a friend, and knew when we started dating that I have troubles with monogamy. 

This lead to us having an open relationship for a few months. I enjoyed it a lot; I felt free and had a lot of fun seeing other people. He, however, didn’t like it at all. He had no desire to see or sleep with anyone else, he is very reserved about sex and only followed through on the open relationship because he knew it was what I wanted. 

So, sensing his discomfort with the relationship, I closed it. This meant, regretfully, that I had to put an end to several (meaningless but still fun) flings that I had going on. However I felt that my love for him outweighed my need for hook ups, so I made that sacrifice for him. 

I figured that was the end of my worries about feeling tied down. Now, we live together, we share a phone plan and a car insurance plan, and we have plans to get engaged this year or early next year. 

And I love him. So much more than I can fathom, I love him. He has helped me through a lot, and I know in my heart he is the man I want to marry. 

But that nagging feeling has come back. That feeling of “I am young, I am in my sexual prime, what am I missing out on by promising my life away so early?” I worry that if I push this down and don’t finish out my experimentation (I have only had 2 sexual partners, both men, and I’m bisexual so I would like to have more experiences with women) that years down the line I will regret it. I don’t want it to lead to an unhappy marriage or a divorce, and I don’t want to resent him for it. 

I have no idea how to talk to him about it. I know he doesn’t want an open relationship, and I would rather die than lose him, but I’m afraid that if I don’t do something before he proposes then it will have lasting effects.

205,"Throwaway account because the world is small. I'm not a frequent Redditor so I'm not sure if I'm posting to the right Subreddit. I'll try to write in bullets to keep it easy to read; happy to add more detail if folks are interested.

TLDR - I'm 30M and a 30M friend became my best friend (in every single way) over 5+ years, then everything crashed and burned and we haven't spoken for 6 months. Need advice if/how to salvage the friendship, and what Reddit thinks our friendship meant.

* Met my friend (let's call him Jack), in college. I was single. He had a girlfriend but it was long distance.
* We became inseparable and really close friends. Best buds. Bros. We'd do everything together. When showing up to group events, we'd always show up together. We were on each other's side. Everything was platonic.
* I moved away (not too far, just a 2 hour drive) for work after graduating. He came to visit me a few weeks later, and after some beers, we started talking about ""who's dick is longer"". Eventually it led to Jack asking ""what, wanna just drop our pants and compare?"" jokingly. We bailed and nothing happened.
* A few months later, Jack and his girlfriend ""separate"". He was still looking for a job, so I asked if he wanted to come crash with me for a few months. He agrees. One day I noticed a giant jizz stain on the comforter I lent him, and called him out on it (half serious - grossed out but dunno, seemed kind of funny). He admitted to it, and we laughed it off. It did lead to us watching porn together (casually). A few times. Sometimes Jack seemed super uncomfortable, other times, he was focused.
* Over the next few years, Jack and I became even closer, while living 2 hours apart. There were also rough spots, of course, but things generally went pretty well.
   * We'd visit each other really often. We spent weekends with just each other mostly (sometimes with other friends). It started off as every 1-2 months, and over the years became every 2 weeks. Sometimes it was just to hang out at his place, maybe watch Netflix, go for food/drinks, etc,.
   * We knew each other's phone passcodes. We never asked for it, but because situations came up where one of us would respond to texts on the person driving's behalf, it became useful. Over time, we both set more complex passwords, so we lost this ""thing"", for better or for worse. Neither of us have ever stalked each other's phones etc,.
   * We added each other to ""Find My Friends"". I think Jack has other folks on there, but he was the only person I had on Find My Friends. We knew where the other was if we wanted to. Neither of us are that comfortable with other people knowing where we are, so this was kind of cool. Kind of a cool bond we had between us.
   * We started sleeping together on his bed at his place, and share a bed elsewhere. At first I would sleep on the couch or the floor. After a few months, it was 'expected' for us to share a bed. If we traveled we'd deliberately get a hotel with 1 bed. Eventually, on trips with 6-8 other friends, we'd volunteer to share a bed / bunk up.
   * We started spooning each other. At first it was kind of a joke, and we'd have a cushion between dick and butt, but gradually we'd do it just with clothes on or with our boxers on, depending on weather. I was 95% of the time big spoon. I'm sure he felt my dick get hard some of the time, but he never said anything about it.
   * We started having our arms around each other's waist in bed. OK, most of the time it was my arm around his waist. Jack would put his hand on top of mine 20% of the time, no response 60% of the time, and move my hand away 20% of the time.
   * When it was just Jack and I in the car, we started 'holding hands' and resting 'the free hand' on each other's legs. Admittedly 90% of the time I initiated this, but Jack never pushed back. Sometimes if I put my hand on Jack's lap, he'd put his hand on top of that.
   * We started 'hot tubing' together - I can't remember how this started, but each time we were at a place with a big enough tub (sometimes every month or so), we'd get in the bathtub together, with just swimming shorts on. We sat opposite each other mostly, but we'd hold each other's legs, maybe give it a warm rub, and zone out and talk about life. One time, I dared Jack to do this naked, and he agreed, so we both jumped in naked.
   * I could never get Jack to share a shower with me - either to rinse off the bubbles from the bathtub, or just in general.
   * We started taking turns showering in the morning while the other person jerked off. This also became something we both looked forward to. It was a strange 'bonding' feeling knowing the other person was enjoying themselves. Jack had no issue that I was doing this in his bed as he was in the shower.
   * I also brought up the idea of 'racing' with Jack in bed, and even putting up a barrier between us, but he never took me up on that.
   * I've always had a fantasy of having a threesome with Jack and a girl. Or even a foursome with Jack and two girls. Depending on the day, Jack might build on that fantasy or he might dismiss the fantasy saying it's not realistic / it won't be fun.
   * On a more serious and non-sexual note, I'd always wanted Jack and I to be back to living in the same city. Long distance relationships barely work among my friends, so I was doubtful a long distance friendship would survive. In my mind (and sharing with Jack), I had the picture in my mind of us finding girlfriends together, and buying houses down the street from each other. Our kids would get to know each other as childhood friends and beyond. Happy ever after kind of story. At first, Jack was interested in moving to my city, but over time, Jack was more frequently allergic to the idea than supportive, calling it ""my idea"" and not ""our idea"".
* Besides the hesitation and boundaries above, of course, not everything was roses - there were definitely thorns in our friendship, even at this point
   * I've been mad at him publicly for stupid things in the past. I never mean to, and I tell him afterwards, but I guess that's just one of my flaws.
   * I learned over the years that Jack really disliked being led to feel guilt. Sometimes, Jack would try to sympathize / be the good guy / make it right, but usually any explicit/accidental attempt to guilt Jack about something would make him made / defensive / argumentative.
   * One long distance trip we had with other friends, the group of us were getting drinks at a bar, and Jack ends up going home with a girl who came to our table. I was definitely jealous (it didn't help that they had started making out very publicly among everyone watching), but also a bit worried because he'd left without telling any of us, if he was going to be OK. We found out from one of the girl's friends who was still there that they had left. I was pretty mad at him the next morning, somewhat jealous, somewhat worried, but also thinking (stupidly?) that the 3 of us were going to stick together since we traveled that far.
* Back to being close. The turning point for our closeness was one where things escalated pretty quickly about 2 years into our friendship - it was just the two of us on a weekend excursion to a new town we'd never been to:
   * On our way back to the hotel after a night of drinking, we were waltzing down the side of the road, and I was saying how thankful I was for him being in my life, how much he meant to me etc,. I don't think this is the first time I've said those things to him.
   * At the hotel, we were both lying in bed and about to pass out. As usual we shared a bed. I didn't want the night to end, so I was going to put my arm around his waist (not unusual anymore)
   * Our ""1st time"": Instead of landing on his waist, my hand lands right on his dick. I froze for a bit, and tried to check if that's what really happened, without looking or moving my hand. It wasn't that easy to tell since there was a comforter in between my hand and his dick. A few seconds later, I felt his dick get hard, so I jokingly said something like ""oooh!"" He pushes my hand away.
   * I don't know what gets into me, but I put my hand back. I give it a bit of a rub to try and make it harder. He doesn't push my hand away, and it seemed like he was enjoying it. So I whisper in his ear to do the same back to me. He reaches over and does the same. The expected happens as we get rid of the blanket, reach into each other's boxers, and start stroking each other. We do this for a bit, and take turns putting each other's dicks into our mouths, but then between feeling nervous, and awkward, we agreed to finish on our own. We both took trips to clean up afterwards.
   * The next morning, on the drive back, it was definitely a bit awkward, but it wasn't that bad. We even held hands for quite a bit of the drive back. Between 'holding' hands and me having my hand on top of his.
* The next time we hung out, we were lounging around in his bed during the day as usual. However, one thing led to another and I started rubbing his crotch through his jeans and he was obviously hard. I take his dick out and started stroking it. He seemed to enjoy it for a good 3 or 4 minutes, but then told me to stop and told me to leave. Over the next few weeks, we managed to make amends, at least this time. Things slowly made us closer once again.
* We've had a few more encounters that brought us closer (each one making us ""closer"" than the previous):
   * Our ""2nd time"": My birthday, Jack and I were barhopping. Eventually our friends all left, and it was just us. We drank a bit more, then went for a walk. The entire walk, Jack and I held hands. I was actually a bit embarrassed to be holding another dude's hand in public, but he proclaimed ""there was nothing to be ashamed of"" and wouldn't let go. We went back to my place. We got in bed, and I put my hand around his waist. He moved closer and the night became the 2nd time we were stroking each other and giving each other blowjobs. We even kissed for the first time - not just a peck, but actually making out. It caught me off guard. He even joked about how he much lousier of a kisser as he was. We were pretty drunk, so we passed out. The next morning, all sobered up, we messed around some more, picking up where we left off. With some help from me, he got me off (first time either of us came), but it became a bit awkward for me having finished, so I got up and let him finish himself off (I shouldn't have done that!). It was a good weekend for both of us, and sexual activity didn't drive us apart anymore. Or so it seemed.
   * Our ""3rd time"": One time, Jack invited a bunch of his old friends from out of town to stay at his place, and I was also invited. The usual touristy activities and drinking shenanigans. One night, after a bit of heavy drinking, I was complaining to him privately about how he told me to meet them at his place at a certain time, but they went out and didn't come back until a bit later. Once again we were bunked up in the same bed (his friends took the other room and the couch). Jack seemed upset but also apologetic, but we made up on the spot. Still a bit drunk, I murmured something seemingly to apologize in advance (knowing we've always said we see each other as ""bros"", how we had a bromantic relationship but not a romantic relationship) then kissed him. We proceeded to make out - super passionnately, with lips, tongue and all that. I was pretty nervous since his buddy was just next door, but Jack kept saying ""don't worry, if they find out, they find out, fuck them"". We started stroking each other (once again), but this time, Josh offered to go down on me. I think this was the first and one of the only times he initiated something. It felt freaking great. I was nervous but also felt bad we were doing this while drunk, with all of the ups and downs we've seen between each other, so I held back a bit. I told him let's save it for my next birthday. He insisted he was going to get me off, and I told him no. After some more tugging and making out, we passed out for the night. On my actual birthday, Jack didn't want to do anything sexual, so we ended up lying in bed where I jerked myself off and he ""listened"" with his eyes closed.
   * We'd continue most of the stuff above that really showed our closeness (to me at least), mostly initiated by me (and Jack would be along for the ride), but once in a while initiated by him. I think we had one more night where things led to us tugging each other, but as soon as I went to kiss him, things got awkward and we stopped. This was just as he was exploring a relationship with another girl (see below).
* We also had a few rough spots in our friendship, between each time we recovered, but the last of which was when things fell to the ground completely:
   * The first was the long distance trip (I mentioned above) where Jack left my friends and I at a bar without telling us. Jack is pretty good looking, but was never really promiscuous. I really liked that he had that balance - he wasn't too much of a hermit, and he wasn't too outgoing. Like me (I'd like to think, but I'm definitely not that lucky with girls). So him just ditching us like that really got to me. In hindsight, I think I milked his guilt too much the next morning and I was an ass to him the rest of the trip. I think it was because I was jealous, but more so because I was sad we didn't stick together. We had just started calling each other 'bros' and our friendship a 'broship' and I was upset he didn't bring me along, introduce me to the girl's friends who were also at the bar, etc,.
   * The second was when Jack's old friends were trying to set him up with this girl from his hometown. The first time they met, Jack insisted that I came along. He made it sound like it was just a casual hang out, but it became more and more like I was just the ""third wheel"", so I got mad at him. I now know it wasn't my place to judge, but I was also scared at the possibility that Jack would be going into a long distance relationship which may end up making him move even further away. Ultimately, they went on a date together which went into the night, and Jack spent the night at her place. It was enough for me to want to phone him and for us to talk on the phone at 5am about what happened. Recovering from this took several months, though maybe we never recovered and this directly led to the third rough spot below.
   * The third was the final straw that broke the camel's back - it started about 6 months after ""the second"" rough spot, when Jack started joining a local hobby group/club which met on weekends. One day, he mentioned he liked this girl at the club, and I thought it was cool, though a little bummed we weren't finding girlfriends together. I didn't mind or think much of it when it started, but eventually it led to a few times where Jack left me at his place with not much to do while he was at his club meeting Sunday mornings. Once, despite us saying we'd go for lunch together, he didn't make it back until 3pm and didn't text saying he was going to be late until he was making his way back. I got pretty upset, not because he was probably spending time with this girl, but because he just left me hanging. One day, Jack said he was going to tell her how he felt. Having been through the two earlier rough spots, I knew this meant them getting together. Eventually they get together as Jack and I became pretty argumentative with each other - I couldn't tell if Jack was trying to iterate from our previous arguments and rough patches, or if he was just showing off his new relationship, but he was oversharing everything. One time, he insisted that I join him and his new girlfriend for dinner so I could meet her - she was nice, but super super hyper and loud, whereas Jack was the quiet and slower / laid back type. Things didn't last long and a month later, Jack told me they had broken up. It turns out Jack had told her about us (me and him), and about the things we've done together, and she ""didn't think Jack was actually 'single' because of all the strings with me"". At least that's what Jack told me. I was shocked, because up until this point, yes I thought that we were super super close, but as time went by I always thought I had become ""just another friend"" to him. Did her and Jack feel the same way? Or did she see something Jack did not see?
* That was the day our friendship crashed onto the ground. He deleted me from most social media. Strangely enough, he stayed in this one Facebook group with me and our group of friends. We've only talked to each other twice since then:
   * 3 months later, our group of friends was organizing a trip. Jack texted the group he was in. To my surprise, Jack texted me and said he noticed I hadn't posted to our big Facebook group; first time we talked in 3 months. He told me that if I wanted to join the group activities that I shouldn't not go because of him, that even though things will never be the same between us, that we should still be able to act like adults and spend time with the group and with each other. I really couldn't work up the courage to say yes, so I didn't join that group activity.
   * I felt bad about that, so one day I texted him asking if I could buy him a drink. He agreed, and we met up. Things seem to go well, but it felt timebox'ed (we used to spend an entire day or weekend together, but despite not having seen each other for months, we met for exactly 1 beer, which Jack didn't let me pay for, and Jack made sure he was busy immediately before and immediately after). I texted him after thanking him for spending time with me, and he replied positively, but he made it clear that it was all the friendship he could offer me.
* Fast forward, and here we are today, with me wondering what I did wrong and what I should even do. Jack's been mad at me before for not asking questions about his life (Jack: ""why didn't you ask where I was?""), and he's also been mad at me for asking questions about his life (Me: ""how long are you going to be doing these Sunday club meetings for?"" Jack: ""forever""), so I don't know what to do.

So what happened? (Yes, that was a long post, sorry, but hopefully the detail paints a thorough picture of me and of Jack)

* Am I in denial about who Jack is to me? About something else?
* Is Jack in denial about his sexuality, and not having a girlfriend pushes him beyond his insecurities?
* Did I read Jack wrong in the 5+ years we've been friends?
* Did I push boundaries too hard?
* Are we just naive, young and stupid, or is Jack right in saying that things will never work out / be back to normal between us?
* Have we just had too many rough patches that we've tired each other out?

I don't know why I cared so much about Jack and I building our lives out together. Those feelings are still around today for me, but based on what Jack has told me, I don't think Jack feels the same way anymore. I swear it's not because I wanted us to be a gay couple, as fun as the messing around was. I just really wanted us to build our lives together, meet women together, live on the same street, and grow old together. He seemed into it but slowly the music stopped, I suppose.

I know this has been a long story, but even after 6 months, Jack means the world to me, and I'd love to once again be in his life (in whatever capacity, though obviously ""best friends"" would be great!). I'm sure there are details I've missed. I'll try to add them, but this post is already the longest thing I've written in a while!

What should I do? What would you all do?

207,"I'm a 24 year old guy (aspiring to be a video creator of some sort) living in my mom's second house.

 I go to her house Mon-Thurs to do general housework and provide care for my grandmother. This is technically my job, but I feel weird about it and I always have. 

She pays all of my bills and gives me $100 a week. Usually I'll spend this on gas and equipment to aid my content creation. 

Problem is, I've had discipline struggles since middle school. I just don't wanna do shit. Idk what it is. I obviously hate my situation, yet I don't grind my ass off and do what needs to be done.

Whenever I do end up grinding and doing what I need to do, my content starts getting noticed. I've had two viral videos so far, and both times I went on multiple month hiatus for no fucking reason. I've heard people get ""afraid of success"" but that's not what it is for me at all...that's literally ALL I WANT IN LIFE. 

If I could be self-sufficient, all of my problems would be solved. Any kind of negative vibes in my mind or life in general stem from the self consciousness of still relying on my mom. Despite the fact that she's ""technically"" my employer and I'm ""technically"" not just some bum who does nothing with his life, it feels that way. 

I split with my girlfriend of five years about six months ago, (which was a great decision, btw) and her absence is potent. Despite our problems, we were still there for each other supporting our endeavors and offering advice. And just having somebody to talk to all day is such a great thing. 

Creating videos is still my passion and I would still love to do that for the rest of my life, but I am so damn lonely and it is affecting me greatly. 

I want to go out and meet people, but I feel like I should wait until I'm self-sufficient first. I'm not saying, ""I have no value to add to another person's life"", I'm saying I think I will be so heavily judged by women (especially considering a romantic relationship) because of my situation. 

The obvious answer here is, ""Just grind your ass off making videos. You have proven that you can do it, so do it, and make a living out of it so you don't have to keep feeling this way."" 

And yeah, I know all that. I'm extremely self aware about my shortcomings and what I can do to fix them. I really don't want to call it depression, but that's the closest word I can come up with to describe why I haven't done it yet. 

It's not like I'm not fun to be around. When I'm with company I enjoy, I feel soooo refreshed, but it doesn't happen often. I go to 3 different friends' houses and only feel completely comfortable at one. 

I used to have a lot of girlfriends (I like girls way better than guys), but my ex was very jealous and wanted me to check in with her every time I spoke with them. I felt like it wasn't even worth it to keep up with that shit so I lost all of them. 

At this point, I'm just spewing all sorts of somewhat relevant information in random order. 

I guess the point of telling you all of this is so that you know exactly how I feel and where I am in life at the moment. I don't know where to go right now. 

TL;DR - I want to meet girls, even just as friends, so that I can have them over and chill with them and don't feel as fuckin' lonely all the time. However, I think they would judge me for my current situation in life: living in my mom's house at 24 years old, working for her to bring in $100 a week, while having a flaky YouTube channel with not THAT many views. What should I focus on right now?",09Jan2019,1
208,"I really don't know what to do. I haven't told most people any specifics of whats been going on the past few weeks. I found out my girlfriend had been cheating on me a few times throughout our relationship. I've already been cheated on twice upto this relationship and it happening again with the girl who I thought was gonna be my future destoryed me.

The first and the only person I turned to was my ex. We were on and off, and always had a very deep passion. A passion that lead to some serious fights, and problems that led to us breaking up after five months. We've been talking since and getting into a swing.

Last week I decided to try again with my girlfriend. She seemed very sorry, she fucked up, and a bunch of other things. Whole thing is a mess, but I still love her, and I havent told my ex we were getting back together. We've been getting really flirty and I think she just broke up with her boyfriend to be with me.

I really am stuck in my own grave that I dug for no reason. Ex broke up with boyfriend of a few months, and current girlfriend is back into the picture. I can't tell if I'm being just too much of a pussy to just break it off. I just need someone to toss me advice. I don't talk to family or friends about this kind of stuff because everyones so damn dramatic including myself now it seems....

209,"I was given 20 dollars extra change but I was rushing because I had to catch a flight and did not count it, I noticed it at the airport, but it will not be another week before I get back, Should I still return it?",09Jan2019,1
210,"Not really sure how to phrase this, but I’m gonna try my best. 

Basically, I have had many “best” friends over the course of my (relatively short — I’m a senior in high school) life. I am writing this now because, for the fourth time, a person I considered my best friend has left me in the dust. It does not seem like they even think about me now, after only a week or so, and it hurts.

I really don’t understand why this keeps happening to me. The pattern is that I will befriend someone who is lonely/depressed/hates himself or herself, build them up and become very close with them, and then they will find new friends with their newfound confidence. I either gradually fade into the background in their life, or they flat-out ignore me suddenly. I understand that change is a constant of life, and that it is unreasonable to assume that I will always be super close with people. However, I can’t seem to grasp why they never seem to care about losing me when I care so much about losing them. 

I grieve over the friendships I’ve lost. For each, I tried to keep it going to the best of my ability. But it’s nearly impossible to save a friendship when only one person cares about it.

This event that keeps reoccurring in my life has continually shattered me. Is there something wrong with me, that makes people want to get away and not even think to look back? Or am I just too invested in friendships that the other people really don’t value as much? Should I be putting less stock in my relationships, like them? Am I just the odd one out, and continuing to care so much is just going to keep hurting me? Even when I think my bonds with others are strong, I’ve always been let down. I miss everyone that I’ve been friends with who have done this to me. When I think about the fact that they don’t miss me back, it feels like a stab in the heart.

This is making me really worried about college next year. What’s the point of being excited about new friends if they’re all going to leave me eventually?",09Jan2019,1
211,"So I’m 19, about to be 20. My relationship with my dad has always been walking on eggshells at best. Ever since I can remember I have never been good enough for him. I was never a terrible student in the beginning of my schooling, Bs for the most part in the 7th grade. My dad was saying why didn’t you get straight As. I got straight As in 8th grade but one A- one quarter and the one thing I remember is my dad saying, why didn’t you get an A in this class. My eighth grade chorus concert, the main takeaway I remember was my dad saying it was a waste of time after watching because I didn’t get a solo so I shouldn’t have wasted my time in the chorus. I had a lot of mental health issues in high school prolly do to a lot of factors and was hospitalized a couple of times. After that my dad started saying he’ll call the police and they’ll lock me up again because I’m “mentally deranged” every time I wanted to do something he didn’t want me to do. For example one day I was having an awful day and didn’t want to go to work so I just said “I’m gonna call out” my dad then proceeded to drag me out of bed by my leg and when I told him to stop and tried to push him off me he called the police on me for “being violent and mentally ill”. This was all in high school. I keep wishing he’d change but he won’t. Fast forward now I’m in between college and work (money problems) and my dad still acts the way he does. He criticizes me over everything in really demeaning ways. And I’m trying to save up enough money to move out since I won’t be living on a college campus anymore, but my dad takes a lot of my money and says I owe it to him for the medical bills of me being hospitalized. I wanted to go to party the other night and my dad said he’d call the police on the entire party if I went since I’m 19 and “there’s probably gonna be alcohol there.” He calls me lazy and entitled when I sleep in once in a while but he drinks 1-2 cheap wine bottles a night and sleeps until 2. I can’t take this anymore, but I can’t afford to leave and my dads making it as hard as possible. He’ll also switch up and be nice in front of everyone else. Sometimes he’ll be nice to me and say he’s proud of me, loves me but only so he can say that he said that he truly loves me when we have a future conflict. What do I do?

216,"I am in junior high school and everything for me has been falling apart for me since the beginning of the school year. I had a shaky start in terms of grades, but then it all collapsed when I was bullied in multiple classes to the point where it was pain to be around them.

My grades completely slipped out of control, at least to my standards, and I've been catching up on work then letting it go again ever since Halloween or so. In the meantime, I'm struggling with mental health, mainly acceptance, and started to see a therapist late October-early November. I also started seeing the school counselor once a week. Skip to after the Thanksgiving break, the start of Trimester 2, and P.E, the class where I'm mainly bullied in, has gotten no better. Then the counselor invites me in one day and tells me that my mom had a conversation with the principal, and we reached a conclusion that I could drop P.E. if I wanted to. Naturally, I jumped at the offer.

My dad is NOT happy. He is peeved that the decision was not involving him at all, and has never let me go since it happened. Just recently, I want to say a month ago, my parents get an email from my Algebra teacher saying how I missed a major assignment, and have a current F in the class. We meet up with the teacher one day, and make a plan that will help me catch up on missing assignments. I catch up within a few weeks, then fall back again to a current steady C. I also have dropped a Social Studies grade recently, a C+, because therapy is interfering with my class time which makes me fall back. My self esteem is lower than it's ever been and I just need to find a way out of this hole I've dug myself.

Now ,I can hold my own in a verbal altercation , one time I replied with "" ive got as many white skin cells as you've got fathers that stuck around"" and other witty lines.

219,"Ever since I elementary school, I was excluded from playing with the other kids by them and I was bullied by both kids at school and my cousins(they eventually apologized to me once we got older). This ruined my self confidence and made me scared to talk to others because I felt I wasn’t good enough.

Later in Middle school I tried building that confidence by going my School’s student body but I was often undermined by the other members and often told the teacher I’m a bother and that I should leave(teacher gave them shit about how they treat me but the others kept it up)

Later in high school, even though I joined sports and became a varsity runner in Cross and Track, which boosted my confidence, most of my teammates didn’t want to talk to me, excluded me from hanging out with them, and when we lost the championships that they had for a long time, they blamed me for it because I wasn’t fast enough to beat the other team’s fastest guy.

This ruined my confidence and with me having a hard time to talk to my classmates, brought my confidence back to 0, and being slow in the sense that I have a  hard time trying to keep up with studies, led to me being criticized by most of my teachers and classmates, my confidence wasn’t getting better.

Now in College, most of the times I feel like I’m not good enough to talk to other people because I’m not interesting enough and school is getting really tough for me. And I’m questioning if I’ll be able to keep up or if I should just stop trying to make friends, close myself off and just focus on studies.

(Also I do have some amazing friends and a loving family but I want to make more friends where I’m at right now so I don’t have to feel lonely)

TLDR: I feel like I’m a sack of shit that has little value and this makes me doubt myself a lot which stops me from socializing.

220,"I’m torn on how to spend my annual bonus this year. Typically i get around $8000 per year in bonus and I spend about $5000 on a splurge that is usually a trip. 

This year I was thinking that I would rather spend that money on new living room furniture, as the $5000 would then bring me happiness for years instead of for one week. My current furniture is not that bad, mostly just dated. My cat has scratched up the couch quite a bit and I’ve sewn some patches to cover it up. The fact that my cat scratches the furniture is actually a reason pushing me towards going with the trip as I know the cat will just scratch up the new couch too.

The other piece pushing me towards the trip is that my daughter is 15 now and I’m not sure for how many more years we will be taking trips together.I feel like while she is young I should focus more on providing experiences for her rather than an updated living room.  I really do cherish our quality time together and as she delves deeper into the teenage years that time is getting shorter :(.

There may be some of you who say that I can do both, but I’ve picked out the furniture I want and I can only do one or the other.

So: buy the furniture and enjoy the purchase for a long time, or go on the trip and spend that quality time, knowing that $5000 will be gone in a week?

I have already thought of the scenario where I just separately save for the couch rather than allotting bonus money to it, but I’m also saving for other important things, so it’s either use my annual splurge money or wait a few more years.

230,"So, to start off with background, this is not severe bullying in any way but rather an asshole treating me like shit. I have never been severely bullied in my life and have only had to deal with shit like this up until now. Right now, I am a sophomore boy in high school. Anyway back to background, I went to middle school with this kid who has now become the annoyance that I have to deal with. I'll call him Arnold. We were super close freshman year. Like best friends close. We would go out on weekends together and such, and would generally have a good time. Towards the beginning of sophomore year, Arnold found a new friend group of about 6 people. I didn't really care that much but was a little sad to see my best friend go. As fate decided, I have many classes with the other people in this friend group, so naturally, I got closer with the group, eventually becoming a part of it.

As it happens, one of the kids in this group is extremely popular, however, he is not the one I am closest with in the group. I will call him Jack. Everything was good and happy until eventually Arnold starting treating me like shit. He would start doing things like turning his backpack towards me to push me back out of a circle while people were talking, physically ostracizing me from the group.

I am a very small and scrawny kid (which I am working on btw but have recently not had the time to hit the gym) whereas Arnold is above average height and weight. Because the world is unfair, Arnold is objectively extremely attractive, therefore giving him more room for error in the social hell that is high school. Basically, Arnold is a horrible person and I wish everyone else would see that and it pains me to remember being so close with him last year. Now, he is riding Jack super hard, kissing his ass wherever he goes. Arnold does this with the goal of becoming more popular, as Jack is, and laughs at all of his jokes even if they aren't funny. Jack is completely unaware Arnold is riding him. Everybody in the group likes me except for Arnold, and I would really like to stay friends with them.

So here's my dilemma: I have no idea how to deal with this. I have considered confrontation, but I am fearful of losing my friends. Without a doubt, Arnold would respect me more for having the balls to walk me skinny ass up to him and tell him to knock it off. The problem, however, is that everybody in the group also likes Arnold just as much (if not more if I am being honest) so if I vocalize my qualms with him they might judge me, for obvious reasons. As it stands, I have not stood up to him. How do I get Arnold to stop being a dick without losing my friends who I love dearly?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Old friend turned bully is now pissing me off but I can't confront him because everybody else in the friend group who likes me would no longer accept me.

232,"There’s a lot of stupid backstory to this, but it’s not that relevant. 

Ok, so I’ve got a pretty ruthless enemy. I’ll name her X. Now X is pretty much the Queen of our grade. She’s easily the best known kid, she has very good relations with the teachers, and most importantly of all, most kids are afraid of her. 


They’re afraid because of what she can do to you. She can spread rumors and feed bad information to teachers and school directors. She can make you a school laughingstock in a day. 


X hates me with a burning passion. And that’s because I’m smarter than her. As a little bit of context, our school is VERY grade-oriented. And before I came, X was the smartest kid in school, and became this monarch. And now she feels it is her duty to destroy me. 


The first year of this, I just submitted. I let her do whatever she wanted, without knowing anything she did. 


But the second year, I ran for a student leadership organization officer. And my opponent was X. This was when X just absolutely unleashed her rage. She sent kids to beat me up. Rumors spread about me. And I lost many of my friends. She won the election, but this was when I found out about people who absolutely hated her, and there were a few of them. They said that they wanted to support me, and hated her too.


Now I’m in my third year at this school, and I’ve found out the many things she’s done to others. I want to expose her, and turn the tables on her. I’ve already tried contacting school administrators and such. But of course , they don’t listen to me.

I’m not sure where else to ask this, so i figured this was the best place to start. i don’t expect anyone to perfectly diagnose what is going on, mostly just hoping/wondering if someone experiences/has experienced something different 

so for as long as i can remember, there will be times when i will full on jump on of bed, from what seemed like a deep sleep. i usually don’t realize what has happened until i am out of bed standing up usually with my light on, or even sometimes i’ll get up and sprint upstairs or out of my room but its almost like i’m still asleep until i am out of my bed. there are times i’ll find myself answering questions that i assume were asked in a dream i assume i was having, but every time this happens i do not remember mu dream at all. once i actually wake up, i can usually go back to sleep and not have it happen again, however there are times when it happens multiple times a night.

TL;DR: i have this night terror like instances where i will jump out of bed, or run upstairs seemingly in my sleep and i won’t realize what i’ve done until i am out of my bed or my room, and sometimes i’ll be talking like i’m still dreaming, although i never remember my dream",09Jan2019,1

Mid September I hit a wall, I burnt out badly but kept at it all as I hate disappointing my parents. 

Around mid October I was only getting 2-3 hours sleep per night and I became very depressed. It hit hard and fast and was the worst depression I have ever felt and thought about suicide all the time but I knew it was almost over and I'd see my dog again soon which was basically the only thing that made me happy around that time. 

In the end I got all of my assignments in with the assumption that of I failed any, the tutor would hand it back to me and I'd get 1 resub per paper and I'd be able to sort any fuck ups there. 

I started working and got over the depression a wee bit and then one week before I got to visit my dog, he was put down which threw me into depression again. I went down there anyway as we were having Xmas back home and my Godfather (one of my best friends) was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer on Xmas eve and given 12 months to live so I'm in a worse place than earlier in the year. 

Just got my marks back and I failed a couple of assignments and will not be given an opportunity to resubmit anything so I'm basically fucked. I have never felt shitter and I don't know how to tell my parents.

How do I tell them this? Once I tell them I failed they're going to want an explanation and I don't know how to explain any of this. All I want to do is make them proud but Ive been nothing but a failure.

239,"I am conflicted on a pretty big life decision that I need to make fairly soon. I will be graduating with my Masters in a STEM field this May. I am going back and forth on what my next step should be. One part of me wants to get a PhD while another part of me is getting burnt out and wants to be done with school already. 

I thought I had decided I was ready to be done with school and get a real job and settle down. I really enjoy research but I fear I may not be able to have a job in the field I want with just a masters.

If I do my PhD I think I want to stay with my current adviser, which would mean at least three more years in a location neither of us love.

249,"Ok so here’s the breakdown. I’m a 22yo college student from NJ and I’m currently saving up to hopefully buy a 1977 Camaro Z28 which is my ultimate dream car.  The current one that I am looking at would cost me about $2000 to buy with possible towing factored in.  There is only one problem.  My parents tell me that they do not want another car in the driveway for a myriad of (imo)silly reasons that I just cannot agree to. One is that they would not be able to get the lawnmower to the front lawn as the car would be in the back part of the driveway and there wouldn’t be enough room to get it past. I told them all they would have to do would be to wheel the mower around the other side of the house and around to the front which is an easy task. They tell me no. Another reason was that apparently it would be an eyesore. An eyesore?! It’s a 77’ camaro for Christ sake and if people were really bothered by how it looked (its has some spots of primer paint) then simply put a car tarp over it. I was planning on doing that anyway to protect from weather. They say no again.  Their third reason was that the car would block the entrance from the rear driveway to the back yard/patio during parties, which doesn’t make sense cause there is a second gate leading from the back deck to the patio which the car would be nowhere near.  My parents also only have maybe one party a year at the house if that so there isn’t a constant need to accommodate for many people moving around the backyard, and like I said there is a second gate which is easily accessible.   Their forth reason is that it would make raking leaves and taking bags full of leaves out to the front curb difficult during the fall season.  All one has to do is simply go around the side of the house which doesn’t take much time.  There is also no need to be transporting leaves to the front curb outside of the fall season which I tried to explain to them but still they remained stubborn.  I even offered to mow the lawn and bag the leaves for them that way they won’t be under any extra physical stress. All they would need to do is let me know generally when they want these things done so that I can pick the closest day and time that works with my schedule.  I tried to explain to them how each of these suposed “issues” could be fixed just by altering things a little bit but they still will not budge.  I don’t know why they are being so stubborn as I plan to purchase and work on the car solely with my own money and I would not expect them to spend a dime on this project.  I would appreciate any advice as I don’t think I will be able to afford to pay for a storage space located elsewhere for the vehicle and I want to make sure I have a quiet, safe place to store it while I work on repairing it with my own money. As of right now my only affordable option is to store it in our driveway and my parents are the last thing holding me back from achieving a goal that I have been striving toward for a long time. Please offer any advice you can wether it be how to convince them, possible “free” locations where the car could be parked while I work on it or anything else thank u.",09Jan2019,1

Throwaway because I don't want one of my friends to find this on my main. This is going to be a long one, so sorry in advance.


I'm a fourteen, soon to be fifteen, year-old girl, and lately, I've been feeling like a complete and utter failure to my friends, to my family, and to myself. Like I'm not doing enough for them. I feel like I'm being shitty to them (friends and family), and it sucks because I love them a lot. I feel as though my personality has been disgusting and stupid. My behavior is coming from three major factors: my dad, my self hatred, and my social life in general.


I was really close to my dad. We were essentially two peas in a pod. Jamming out to songs on the radio in his truck was the highlight of my day. However, he passed away about a year ago in July 2017. It was really sudden, and I didn't have any time to process it. My mourning process consisted of staying by his side and doing nothing, like not eating or sleeping, during the two days he was in the hospital to crying for a couple of days. I don't like to bring it up because it makes me too emotional. I probably buried it because I didn't want to feel sad.


With my dad gone, the only other adult in the house is my mom. I wasn't as close to her as I with my dad. In my opinion, we can be quite different sometimes with our opinions. She has tried to be my best friend since my dad passed, and it bugs me. I get what she is trying to do, and I want to connect with her. However, I've been independent since I was young, and she has never gotten this up in my business before. This has created some conflict in my house, especially since my brother is completely opposite to me.


When I was in the 7th grade (2 years ago) around New Years time, I started to not like the way I look. For some context, I'm overweight and was around 130lbs at the time. Everyone else was a lot skinnier than me, so I thought that there was something wrong with how I was. I slightly cut down on the food I was eating and did some in-home workouts. I thought this would help and I would get skinnier. I was wrong.


This turned into me bringing only an apple to lunch and barely eating at home. I had also started to hate my face and thought I was ugly. My mom told me that barely eating wasn't healthy and I should stop, so I did. For a while. After my dad passed away, I gained significantly more weight (30lbs) by the time school had started. I was fat and ugly. So, for the most of the eighth grade, I only had a carton of milk and an apple for lunch. This started a cycle. There was barely eating, and then binge eating, and then a moment of regular eating. It was awful, and my friends, teachers, and mom noticed. I didn't really stop however, and the cycle kind of continues to this day.


Also in the 8th grade, I had started joking that I wanted to die and how I wished I was dead. I didn't mean anything by it when I started. It was a harmless joke to make my friends laugh. But these jokes started to make me think more and more. Suddenly, I started to say them just to fill a void and had even thought up ways to kill myself. I had actually started wanting to die, but it wasn't very serious.


Near the end of 8th grade, my mom took me to a therapist for my eating habits. Long story short, I hated the therapist and it only lasted 1.25 sessions or two weeks. However, I had to fill out a form which I was suppose to give to my mom. She promised me that she wouldn't read it, but she did. She thought that it wasn't a big deal since I gave it to her. But she didn't tell me this after the last session. My mom started yelling at me because I had checked a box for suicidal thoughts. After this, I wanted to never tell her my feelings again.


This topic was brought up again as my mother accused me of wanting to commit after the school year ended. I told her no, and that was true that I didn't have plans in the immediate future to do so. I didn't know why she had thought this until she said a certain phrase, a phrase I only used with my close friends. I had called my best friend, who is ""A"" and knows some of my mental shit, the next morning, and it turns out that he was worried for me and told his mom who told my mom. I was upset and basically cut contact from him for a month. I felt fucking upset and a bad person. I eventually talk again with him, and we did make up and I hope that we are still best friends.


My mental state, at this point, was getting worse. I would have some mood swings, I still severely hated myself, I slapped and hit myself usually in the face, and I was still thinking about suicide, just more seriously this time. I told my mom I was willing to try another therapist, even though I don't like them.


My new therapist ""K"" was nice, but I didn't feel as though we clicked. I mostly wanted a friend through this process. As the sessions went on, I started to hate her even more, which was an asshole move on my part since she was just doing my job. It felt like my mom and K ganged up on me sometimes.


Then I started the new school year with a new school. I had managed to get into my top choice of high school. Also most of my classmates, who were kind of bitchy and mean to each other, weren't going to this high school, so that was a plus. I had found a new group of friends from a summer rowing 2-week camp, and they were really nice and fun to be around. I could be weird all I want because they were the same way. Sometimes, I would feel awkward, stupid, or annoying at times because I was acting too weird, but they said that it was fine and funny.


These little things about myself finally got to me, and I wanted to die more than ever. I had started taking a nice and gently gliding it across my wrist and tried to cut myself on my thighs. And then one day, I decided just to do it. I knew what was going to happen. I was going to swallow a whole bottle of painkillers and maybe cut my thighs if I wasn't too much of a wimp to do so. I told all my friends, including A, that I loved them and cared for them while leaving them totally in the dark.


I took the bus and train home as usual until I got into the car and my mom started screaming at me. A showed his mom the texts and then drove to my house. I didn't feel any hate at all towards A or my mom, only to myself. In that moment, I realized that I didn't want to live nor did I want to die. Somewhere in the middle. We drove to the hospital, and I met some friendly people who gave me some sheets and paperwork. Thankfully, they didn't keep me over night.


Two days later, I told only a couple of my friends what I had planned to do. Most of them comforted me and some even talked about their experience with suicidal thoughts. What bugged me though was that one of my closest friends from my old school, ""C"", had reacted indifferently. She said ""okay"" and then started talking to another person. It really hurt because we both trusted each other a lot and I thought we cared for each other.


Later that night, I got a text from C. Basically, earlier in the day, I called her a bitch jokingly and told her to check her phone. She reacted badly, telling me she didn't like being called that and that she cared for me but I needed some help. I replied that I was sorry and was joking, but C didn't really care. Even though I do swear a lot, she knows that I would never call one of my friends a name seriously and that I love my friends a lot. She has used that type of language as well, so it confused me and I felt hurt.


Now, I realize that shit has happened to her overseas that she told me about and something probably happened at home. I now feel like a major asshole. She hasn't talked to me at all by choice in about two months now. While I have tried to initiate conversations with her, it's never been directly at her.


A couple days later, I'm stressed about a school project, and my mom tells me not to worry and that I can stay home. We go out for a while and at lunch, she drops the bomb on me. Apparently, two people had come forward and reported to the school counselors that they were worried I was going to harm myself. Now the school wanted to keep me at home for an excused absence, which was basically a suspension. They wanted to keep me away because they were afraid I was going to hurt myself or others. The people were afraid that I was going to resent them. They had also said that I was wishy-washy and they had to be careful with what they say to not hurt me. Well, this hurt me even more because they felt as though they had to hide behind anonymity to say this instead of coming to me. I would be willing to understand and listen.


That day, a friend has text me asking if I was alright. They heard that I tried to commit suicide, which isn't even true. I asked who they heard this from, and they said in our friend circle. That was just another blow. I was hoping that the friends I told would have the common decency to keep this on the down-low and not gossip. When I came back 4-5 days later, my friends said nothing about it.


Now present day. I'm back at school from the break and I feel as though I'm relapsing. I'm hating myself more than usual, I've become more annoying, and I traced around my wrist again. I feel like wanting to pull back from my friend circle. I don't want to talk to anyone about this, in fear that I might get emotional or they might talk to others about it. I do have a new therapist, ""S"", who I kind of like, but it's only been one session. It takes a while for me to warm up to people, so talking about feelings isn't on the agenda.


People of Reddit, I'm not asking for pity. I just want the straight up truth. I tired of being dicked around with or lied to or constantly having to analyze people to find out what they're thinking of me. I want to know what the best way to proceed with my friends, my family, and my new therapist, and what you think about this abnormally long text.

For the most part I’d say I’m pretty confident in my looks, and I always have been. The only thing that gets to me at times is my nose and I feel like a couple tweaks would just make me feel more confident. I’m not looking for perfection, just an upgrade so to speak. For the past year - year and a half I’ve been doing research on rhinoplasties and I’ve finally decided to get one as I’m 18 and have a pretty good income. 

The problem came when I told my parents about my plan, their reaction was way more harsh than anticipated. They basically told me that if I get a nose job they don’t want to see me and that they don’t want me in the house.

I knew they wouldn’t be thrilled about the idea because they’re more on the conservative side but I didn’t expect them to take it this hard. I mean it’s not like I’m getting a full facial reconstruction here it’s just a tiny tweak to my nose..

267,"I am seeking some life and career help to give my life more direction.

Quick recap - I am 25 in February. I finished University in London with a Media Production degree (producing video's) but a bad University experience lead me away from it as a career. I used to enjoy editing a lot but I haven't edited in years. I don't really want anything to do with it anymore (open to other suggestions). I then downgraded and worked a dead end job for 2 years wasting potential and time, not learning anything useful. I will start a new job this year employed as an events organizer for a political party. I am interested to see how it goes but I am not sure how LONG long term I want this job to be. I will need to be doing this job for at LEAST a year or two. Saving money where I can (I still live with parents) so I can start to fully support myself financially and move out eventually. I feel like i made a mistake with my College/university career path and in hindsight should have taken a year off to figure out what i want to do. I have always enjoyed history, science and Maths but a bad maths teacher in Secondary school really hindered my learning. (I am somewhat to blame but it wasn't easy learning stuff when you couldn't understand your teacher)

I have been learning a lot watching youtube, reading and browsing reddit. I enjoy learning about science, philosophy and technology a lot. I hunger for it but find the actual numbers work behind it daunting and don't think I currently have the skills for it. I often wish I could go back to school and maybe start doing Science, physics, computer science, some coding or something along those lines. I'm still young. However I do realize that work like that would require a lot of number crunching and formula work. I am not against the hard work but I haven't done any proper mathematics for years now and kinda think I need to go back to A-level (or lower) maths and maybe science. Things I learnt during School that haven't been put to use have been forgotten (like the maths). 

So my current plan for life is to work for at least a year at this new job, saving money (nothing saved at present) whilst my partner finishes their third year of University. Then together we will decide wether we want to stay and work in london for a while or live elsewhere in another country so my partner and I can maybe do degrees in countries where you wouldn't have to pay for the education (or pay less). I want help deciding if I should go back into some sort of education and if so what because I don't think I can learn enough without some structure/guidance as to what I am learning.

270,"So, I [20M] have this really close friend [21F] who has helped me through some personal issues that I’ve been having throughout the past year. During that time, I transferred to a school near her (for unrelated reasons) and we started spending a lot of time together. 

You probably see where this is going. She developed feelings for me, and though she hasn’t confronted me about them yet, her brother hunted me down on social media to tell me she’s caught feelings. 

The thing is, somehow I can’t reciprocate. I got out of a bad relationship about a year ago and since then have been extremely turned off to the idea of romance. At the same time, I’m very lonely, and losing her as a friend would be a huge blow to my morale. 

To complicate things, the two of us are supposed to go on vacation this spring, to Italy. I had planned a backpacking trip for myself and she asked months ago if she could come. I said yes, stupidly not realizing the potential romantic implications. That’s where the title of this post comes from: if we end up in Italy, I feel like I’ll be playing the part of the stand-offish guy who somehow ends up in a romantic situation with a woman and eventually they end up together. Not sure if I’m into that idea. 

My questions, then, are as follows: am I being stupid? Since I’m lonely, should I just give in, ask her out, and see where things go? If not, how can I defuse the situation and genuinely keep her friendship? I feel like I’m a mess, and insight would be much appreciated. Thanks for reading this far!",09Jan2019,1

Instead I ambled aimlessly through community college for years until deciding to go for dentistry.

I have just obtained my BS in science with a respectable GPA but with no more course work to bog down my thoughts I find my self feeling empty inside. I feel that I have wasted precious years of my youth that could have been spent travelling/finding myself. I have gone no where and seen very little. I greatly value the academic knowledge I picked up along the way but every journey I ever took was a mental one, in the same bedroom at the same desk in the same neighborhood.

272,"So I just had a 2 hour scolding from my mom after I went to my counselor and asked her to change my classes. I dropped out of jazz band and decided to Art instead. I'm unfortunately the best saxophone player in the band and I'm handed solos out of nowhere with people expecting me to play them, with people expecting me to lead and support the band, but unfortunately I don't give a fuck. My band director is an extremely Impatient, No bullshit,Rope around your neck teacher and he's going to shit bricks over this. He's not a cruel and heartless band teacher though, it's evident that he cares and isn't an asshole for no reason but he gets really fucking mad at his students. He has a good reason to be in this case.

Anyways I'm an idiot and applied for jazz band for the entire year. We have one festival in our first semester,and like....six festivals in our second semester. I'm quitting, during our second semester when they need me the most. It's also going to get awkard showing up for my first period(Band) when I could  be there an hour early for(jazz band). My mom yelled at me telling me I fucked up my chances of getting a scholarship by dropping out of jazz band. She made me promise her to be in concert band for four years in hopes of getting me a scholarship but I don't think I'm going to need one or even get one for being in band since it's not something I want to do after highschool. I mean...people don't just give you scholarships for just being in band, they're going to ask you if music is something you want to do in your life right? She went on and on about me being unreasonable for not taking the opportunity to get a  scholarship and quitting and for art when I could just take both.  And I could just take both, I'm able to, so problem solved right? Nope. (Btw she doesn't care what I do after highschool)

I fucking hate band. I joined band when I was nine and ever since than I've been playing because other people want me to. It's been so fucking exhausting and tiring playing for someome else. I have zero motivation,fucks and concerns for it at this point. In fact , I'm supposed to be at a band event right now but screw it . In fact I just might  drop out of band completely. My mom tried this shit with my 10 year old sister and I got so fucking mad. But she sucked at it and didn't have any talent or motivation for it so my mom eventually let her quit. 

So I can either be selfish and unreasonable by quitting jazz band and not getting a scholarship even I can do both or be charitable to my fellow jazz band students and possibly getting a scholarship by spending my last semester in highschool(I'm a senior btw)  being frustrated and angry by playing for everyone.

278,"Background info:

I have a close group of friends in my class, whom of Ive known since 1st yr of college (currently in yr 2). It consist of 3 other girls (im a guy btw). This is due to the fact that majority of my class are females. So, they are not so much the kind of friends that you do crazy fun things with, but the kind whom you can have deep conversations with abt life. These friends don't come easy for me, cos most of the friends I have are the former type (cos most of my friends are guys).

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the long ass story:

So a few months back, in Oct, I had a depressive episode (I have MDD), so I kinda isolated myself from them for a couple of weeks. My therapist suggested I open up to them about my condition as they were close friends that I did not want to lose. And so I did. Thankfully, they accepted it. They didn't really extensively help me out. They were more like ""we're cool with it so join us when you're ready."" They gave me space and occasionally checked if I was okay. I was completely fine with this approach tho. 

Initially, I couldn't really talk to them. Like I was dead quiet and only replied with occasional nods and 1 word replies. It felt awkward. They still talked to me sometimes, which I appreciated. Slowly bit by bit, I began opening up. We kinda began talking again, but it never felt like 100%. There was still this awkwardness between us. It's like I found it hard to join in the convo. 

So in December we had a 1 month trimester break. So during this break, we were all kinda busy with our own things (family, bf/gf, other commitments). I was busy training so I spent most of my holidays with my teammates, as well as my other group of friends. We didn't hang out or talk to each other thru text or anything during this 1 month, except on one of the days where we said we would meet up for a dinner and celebrate of the girl's birthday.

 So before I continue, fyi, in mid Dec, I was back on my feet ie I recovered from my depressive episode. So for the story here on, I was fine.

 So back to the dinner, as the days approached, I was kinda looking forward to it cos I felt I could see them and interact with them normally again. But the thing is there wasn't any update abt the dinner. So 2 days prior I asked one of them abt it and it turns out they had decided to meet up the next day for a shopping date and they decide to just celebrate the birthday there and then. So she told me the dinner was off.

At that moment, I was pissed. Not so much because I wasn't invited (I mean why would a guy  want to go shopping with 3 other girls), but more abt the fact that they didn't bother telling me that they were cancelling on me. It's like if I didn't ask they wouldn't have told me. It made me feel as if I didn't matter to them and that my time wasn't worth their attention. I actually pushed away other plans for this dinner.

But I decided to play it off cool. I didn't want to make the whole thing abt me, cos ultimately it was abt the birthday girl. Over the week, I cooled down and got over it (I think). 

In Jan, when school began, I looked forward to the 1st day of school, for the exact same reason why I looked forward to the dinner. As we met for the 1st time after the holidays, as we sat down for the lunch, it was the exact same situation all over again. IT WAS AWKWARD, but like different. During my depressive episode, I struggled to talk cos I was so self-conscious and I didn't want to interact with people in general. But now, even though I've recovered, for some reason, I just can't seem to talk to them. It's like my mouth just doesn't want to open. I had absolutely no problem talking with my other friends and the other people ard me. It honestly felt it little worse than before, cos throughout the entire lunch, the 3 of them were just talking among themselves, and I couldn't slot myself in. I felt like shit for the rest of the day, as if I did something wrong. The same thing happened over the rest of the week where we didn't talk much. It felt like we hanged out together because we were obligated to. It felt like a 3+1 rather than 4.  And a small part of me feel like they don't really want to talk me anymore (probably my overthinking)

&amp;#x200B;

So over the past few days, I've thought a lot abt this. Tbh I still can't pinpoint the exact reason, but here were some possible ones:

1) I've changed. It feels as if we aren't similar anymore. We didn't have common topics of interest anymore

2)  We grew further apart. We stopped updating each other about our lives at one point. And now we just stopped talking in general. 

3) I was so used to acting like this in front of them (being quiet) during my depressive episode, I subconsciously end of doing it now.

4) I'm subconsciously still cannot get over the dinner incident ( I didn't talk to them abt it)

&amp;#x200B;

Now it seems like our friendship has faded and we should probably break it up. BUT the thing is: I still want to be friends with them. I don't want to lose them cos friends like this are hard to find. 

So Im thinking of taking some time off this friendship where we don't have to be obligated to hang out with each other. But part of me is afraid that this time off may end up being permanent.

Or should we just talk it out 1st so that we can clear the air and then decide from there..

What are your thoughts abt this?

I wrote a really good paper and the teacher highlighted me, saying that I would get the best grade in class because only I made an effort.

He was going through a rough time with college at the time and I tried to make it into something humorous to cheer him up, but after 3 months he told me that he felt like I was using and abusing him with my ""jokes"" and ""pickup lines"" and accused me of trying to use him. He was afraid to say anything because he was going through a rough time already and he didn't want to make me upset, but the jokes really hurt him deeply to the point where he cried to sleep, during class and at one time in a nightclub bathroom. He broke up with me but we remained great friends. The next day, his female friend of 2 years asked him out after taking him shopping the whole day. He was afraid to tell me for 2 months but he did confess that to me. I lied and told him I was okay with him moving on but I was so heartbroken and cried in the shower. I tried to accept it because I didn't want to get in the way but recently I feel like his girlfriend is cheating on him with his roommate but I don't want to say anything because I don't want to look like a psycho ex making up stories.

Meanwhile, I started having feelings for someone new, which seems all fine and well... except... we don't really know each other, they live in a different state and that they're a decade older than me. He's an instagram bodybuilder from NJ and has 34K followers. Sure, from that he seems like just another beefhead but he's actually the polar opposite. Despite being masculine and an alpha male, he's one of the sweetest guys I've ever spoken to. We talk a bit but it's mostly through his Instagram Stories. He really adores my quirky and honest sense of humor and he even offered to give me advice and workout tips. Only problem is that despite being an evidently closeted bisexual, he has a girlfriend and they're into each other. Sometimes I want my ex back but at the same time I don't and want my crush. Me and my crush have reconciled but I want to fall for my crush. I don't know what my heart wants but I could really use some help. Can somebody please tell me what to do? I don't want to lose either of them.",09Jan2019,1
292,"I'm moving for work, and my start date is mid-Feb. I'm moving out of the family home and am trying to sell the house before then. I'll also be downsizing, so I can't just fit the whole contents of the house into a new place... There's a lot of STUFF that needs dealing with.

What things are easier to ditch and then re-buy rather than pack + ship (+ potentially store for months) + unpack?

Have you ever gotten partway through packing something and then thought ""why tf am I bothering to pack this?""

Are there ways to cut down on bulk somehow? (ie, I'm thinking to keeping my DVDs but ditching the cases)

What kind of things do you think people carry around with them but don't actually need?

Should I get rid of the mountain of books I haven't read but have totally been intending to read??

293,"Sorry for the format I'm on a phone. I live on the property my parents purchased when I was young so I grew up here. They split up here but continued to live together, Mum in the garage (self contained unit) Dad with us kids in the house. She was suicidal for years and they would argue constantly. I was a teen when she would threaten to hang herself and I never knew if my Mum had killed herself the previous night in the garage. She never did. I moved out when I was 16 and moved back in when I was 21. My 21st birthday I spent one of the first nights fully moved into the garage. We had just finished cleaning Mums hoarder friend out and it's not an easy place to clean. I had psychosis that night. It lasted 4 months. My boyfriend saw a lot of it and had to leave. I tried to kill myself maybe 5 times. That's a different story. Fast forward to today and now my brother lives in the garage. He has been for the last year , he hasnt cleaned once since hes been in there. He lives in his filth and it's so disgusting. The washing machine is in the garage so I go in there almost every day and the stench and the rubbish is fucked up. I tried to tell Mum to do something about it but she just prays and hopes he will do it himself. I tried to say if he needs help cleaning up I will definately help him. I'm not cleaning it for him Mums done that before and he just fucks it all up again. It's hard enough keeping the house clean with 3 dogs a cat a parrot and an old man who doesnt know how to wash his hands, but my brothers mess is flowing out of the boundaries of his walls and I feel disgusted living here. My partner and I were going to move but mum convinced us to stay as it is cheaper living here and she said that we can clean the property to sell it. It's been a year since we started cleaning and the property is still a shithole. She gave up cleaning about 5 months ago and now the new plan is the what I've always heard her say. ""Wait till your father dies then we can renovate it and sell it"". Dad is 78 and healthy as fuck. Alot of his sisters lived until their late 80s early 90s. I'm NOT living here for another 10 years. She says how much she hates it here (she moved out) how she just wants to burn it but she convinced me to live here ?! Now I've invested into the property rather than getting a rental and I want out OR to get my brother to help finish the cleaning so we can sell up. The same brother who hasnt cleaned his living area for a year..... yes I am leaving out a lot but this is too long already. Is being on this property so long actually turned my family's brains to fucking shit ? Am I supposed to clean it and fund the Reno myself just to get it done? Do I move out with my partner , take my Dad and all our animals and leave the property and my inheritance for my brother to destroy? How do I even go about addressing this issue to my Mum or brother , the only two people who have the capability and financial ability to do something... help ? ",09Jan2019,1

I don’t want to change my job and will prob find it difficult to get a mon -fri job anyway

In my first semester I went out and did all the things that are supposed to make you friends, like talking to people in class, going to dorm events, going to student organizations, etc. But 95% of the people I’ve met (including my roommate) are just not really super interesting people, and I can tell they feel the same way about me. I guess that’s to be expected though. The other 5% of people I’ve gotten along with, but it always just becomes a thing where I see them and we go “hey” but that’s it.

I’m just not sure how to bridge the gap between acquaintance and friend, I guess. Since I always had the same friends my whole life I never had to make any new ones, and I just miss the comraderie that came with having friends that you knew that well and for so long. How am I supposed to achieve that here?

I think part of it might be that I don’t have and have never had any social media, and I think that’s probably the primary way that people communicate outside of actually talking to each other nowadays. I kind of really don’t want to start using it, but I guess if I don’t have a choice... any thoughts on that?

299,"On mobile so excuse any errors. 

So I’m currently 19 and living in New Zealand. This year I’m enrolled to go to university and will be studying a bachelor of business with a major of digital business. In 2017 I finished half a year of Uni before deciding I want enjoying my degree (B of management studies) and left. Worked full time until late 2018. 

The degree I’ve chosen to study this year is something I think I’ll enjoy, although I’m not 100% certain. Luckily I have the opportunity for free fee for the first year so the only cost is accomodation and supplies. I would be paying for rent either way so that’s not a major factor in this. The main problem is for many years I’ve wanted to join the police and originally left uni to apply and join. Although I never got round to it because I thought I was too young. 

Now that I’m going back to uni, so many thoughts are popping into my head. I’m concerned about going back a year and a half later,  as there’s people 2 years below I’ll know and I have to take level 1 papers again with people not my age group. I’m also concerned about how I’ll focus and if i will be able to keep up on my work load. 

I feel like it’s to easy for me though to just say I’ll join the police later so let’s leave uni and work. Or just leave uni right now because I feel like I’m
Just nervous about it coming up so fast. 

So basically I’m just asking if the points about being afraid of uni that I’ve asked Is worth considering stopping my degree and choosing a different path. 

TL;DR Going back to uni after a break, and changing degrees. Coming up soon and feeling nervous about everything. Almost want to stop and go back to working full time and at Some point joining the police.

301,"So basically, my group of friends (only like 9 total) have a private discord server together and on there, we have a vent channel for ranting/sharing emotions. Recently, some people (only like 4 out of the 9) have gotten annoyed @ this one friend (I'll refer to her as W) because she tends to vent over people and turn conversations on the chat into something about her. Like in one instance, one friend (T) was talking about how they suffered from hallucinations at night and literally is kept up at night due to seeing a monster at the foot at their bed. W jumps into the conversation, offering some (disinterested imo) advice about nightlights or sleeping masks before turning the conversation about her phone troubles.

Because of this i sent a message on the vent channel that was pinned later that pretty much said ""dont try to vent over people because if someone's venting and then directly after that you only start talking about yourself it can get annoying. it's good to vent and you don't always have to respond because that can be draining but waiting before going is good""

W did take note of this message which is good, but she still redirects conversations in the vent channel to herself, only now she waits 30 minutes before saying some advice and talking about herself. For example, T was venting about their parent is very anti-medication and therefore against increasing dosages for T w/o asking and about 30 minutes later W comes in and [https://imgur.com/a/pDyMMJK](https://imgur.com/a/pDyMMJK) and starts talking about how she should get a job at starbucks and wants to start kickboxing???

When I saw this I was like ""....wtf..."" was about to shoot W a private message this time about not venting over people but then I realized that she was following what I had said earlier about not venting directly after other people. I was then gonna say something to her about keeping only heavier stuff/ being less conversational in the vent channel since it's for venting but that just brings up another question: what would even be heavy enough?? All problems are *relative* and trying to warn someone against sharing their problems/worries in what should be a safe environment in our friend group is just disgusting and honestly I'm ashamed I didn't realize that sooner. Also W is very pleasant and nice IRL generally and this situation is kinda odd because of that. Is there any proper venting etiquette or advice for this situation?

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: friends made a discord server w/ a vent channel, 1 friend redirects conversations all the time to just about her but she's technically not really doing anything wrong, is there a right way or proper etiquette when it comes to venting?

302,"Hello everyone, 

I'm male, 30 years old, 6'2"" and a whopping 350 lbs last time I checked (somewhere in the last year). I have always been big and so has one side of my family. In my late teens I got myself down to around 230 from my (then) max of 315. A good amount of that was muscle to boot as I was benching 230 pounds in sets of 15.  I am now embarking on another weight loss journey and would like feedback.

I have budgeted myself between 1300 and 1500 calories a day (but always aiming to keep it as close to 1300 as posdible). I am not exercising (yet) because I am trying to reduce the stain on my body a bit first. Obviously to get where I am I live a very sedentary lifestyle. My food choices during this diet have been less than healthy - but I've made sure to keep myself within the budget. I'm often really hungry during the middle of the day but I'm not as bothered by it now as I was the first few days. It also makes what I do eat that much more delicious. 

I am told by some people I should just eat tons of low calorie foods rather than two 500-700 calorie dense chunks per day, but my lifestyle is one where food has always been an after-thought. The convenience of fast food just made it that much easier to gain weight. Now I've dropped the soda, the fries and am ordering items that fit my calorie budget rather than my preference. 

I guess my big question is; can I lose weight by eating the foods I like in small, measured portions or is this doomed to fail? I'm making sure to budget in a cup of vitamin rich smoothie every other day so I'm not worried really worried about deficiencies. I downloaded an app to track my foods - but the app says I should eat twice as many calories as I am even though I'm not exercising. It seems counter- intuitive to take in more calories than I have to.

I would like to hear some people's opinions. ",09Jan2019,1
303,"Okay so I wasn’t actually sure if I was going to post this but I just need some advice.

For background I’m a 19 year old girl and I’ve never had a relationship. I’m also a freshman in university. The thing is I don’t know what is stopping me from having one. I always make the excuse that my parents wouldn’t want me in a relationship or that I don’t know if I want a relationship.

The truth is I don’t know. Everyone my age has had some sort of boyfriend/girlfriend even if it was when they were 10 years old. I feel weird that I never have, and I’m scared that I will meet people but they won’t want a relationship with me because I’ve never had anything with anyone before. 

I think I’d always be nervous to tell my family but but 15 year old brother has had relationships and they’ve never really made a huge deal about it, so I don’t know what I’m worried about. 

Also, I’ve spoke to people in the past but whenever they’ve asked me on a date or anything like that I get really nervous, I physically can’t handle it and I have no idea what’s wrong with me. I also never really meet anyone that thinks of me in that way.

304,"Hello!  I’m 15F and a sophomore in high school.  If because of my age you think I’m incapable of having true emotions - please don’t waste your time or mine and move along.  Thanks!

So here’s the deal.  I met this boy in 5th grade.  He was infatuated with me and continued to be all the way through now, 10th grade.  I never liked him back, he was a bit of a troublemaker and I wasn’t mature enough to be interested in boys/having a relationship.  Last year, our freshman year of high school, we both liked each other and had sort of a thing for about a month.  It ended for just reasons of bad timing but we remained friends.  Forward over the summer, we’re basically both still in love with each other but don’t act on it and don’t see much of each other.  Sophomore year starts, we reconnect and are both interested in each other again.  I didn’t make a move so he figured I moved on and ended up having a thing with one of my best friends.  Yeah.  That was shitty to go through.  It ended quickly, then he got a girlfriend for a few weeks, to whom he lost his virginity.  That was an INCREDIBLY toxic relationship, so that ended.  He started a thing with another friend of mine which ended as quickly as it began.  Finally after this rollercoaster of dates I admitted my feelings - which had not stopped growing since summer - and he admitted he felt the same.  We took things slow and eventually made things official almost exactly a month ago. 

Now here I am, crying in bed after screenshots revealed he’s cheated on me.  Multiple times.  Not by anything physical (that I’m aware of) but texts where he initiates wanting to have sex with another girl or asking if he can “stop by to pick up his pants”.  
Makes me wonder.  There are at least two girls he was talking to, one of them being his toxic ex girlfriend.  Turns out she’s not that bad, and honestly has been trying to help me realize he’s a douche this whole time.  He’s been sneaky and there’s been a couple little blowouts but this is nothing like before.  I dumped him and left a slew of angry text messages.  Nothing horrible, but I hope they make him realize how much he’s hurt me.  People have been rooting for us to get together for FIVE YEARS.  And now it’s over in less than a month.  I’m still in love with him and it hurts.  I want to kiss and hug him again but I’m so incredibly angry with him and know I can’t do that.  I even almost let him take my virginity a few days ago.  I’m devastated.  Absolutely heartbroken.  I was just talking to my dad about how much I loved him earlier today.  My whole family knows we were dating and I did nothing but hush over him.  And now I have to tell them we broke up.  Because I was wrong for trusting him.  Because he cheated.  

I know his actions don’t determine my worth but it’s still hard.  I’m still head over heels and would do anything for him.  I’m in this tornado of anger and jealousy and heartbreak and I don’t know how to move on.  He has been such a huge part of my life for five years and to lose him as not only a boyfriend but as a best friend is a devastating loss and I don’t know how to move on. ",09Jan2019,1

312,"Hey everybody,

Thank you for reading. I’ll just get right to it.

My current job has a ton of freedom. I work from home. No commute. No rush in the morning. In fact, I do some side gigs even sometimes because I don’t have to go through the motions of shit/shower/shave, get ready, etc. These gigs are actually pretty substantial side income. My current boss has either lied to me or I misunderstood but they haven’t been reimbursing my expenses for a year and it got me very bitter about a month ago when my coworker told me she does get reimbursed. Also, we have a new system and several new employees to compete with for commissions. I can hustle but I’ve been really slacking due to the learning curve and the lie that offended me. This has the potential to pay about $30k/yr. The thing I love most is I get to spend a lot of time with my older dog and learn from videos/audiobooks all day while I work.

New job offer is in an industry I’m familiar with but wasn’t great at last time, mostly due to unfair competition at work but still. I believe this time can be different and they seem to really want me on their team. No commission potential so no cheating coworkers this time. I would be looking at about $36k/yr. Also, a potential for $9k annually if team hits goals. Full benefits. 4% 401k match (I honestly don’t know how that works). They seem really cool and like my culture. I would have to go to a building about 15-20 minutes away and wear clothes to work. Fuel costs. Commute. Lost time. Less potential for gigs. I’d love to be in a social setting and it involves motivational speaking which I like.

Current job is making vacation reservations via inbound phone calls. I love our properties and I’m good at it.

New opportunity is a gym advisor selling memberships. I love the gym and I believe this time I’ll be better than the last time I did this for another gym.

Neither would be awful but am I being pouty about the situation with my current job?

Is going for the new job just me being money hungry?

TL;DR

Should I stick with my current, lower paying, easy job that has a lot of freedom and potential for side work?

313,"Hey guys, I work part-time in retail. I've chosen this because I view it as an auxiliary job to supplement me while I study. I've deliberately not wanted a promotion there or to be made a manager because I don't want the burden of all that additional responsibility and I like the flexibility of my part-time job.   


My department manager has gone on a few weeks vacation, so I've picked up some day shifts (that's fine). But the store manager keeps talking to me as if I'm the defacto manager of our department while she's away (I didn't sign up for this). I also don't know how to do a lot of the managerial tasks (orders, counts, markdowns, etc). Anyway, a big problem has been the store manager understaffing the entire store to cut costs. Because of this, people will often be alone in the deli inundated with disgruntled customers that aren't getting served fast enough (which is fine). But it is frustrating.   


I live in a small town, I don't have a car, and the public transportation starts at around 8 AM and ends at around 7 PM. So I've made it known my flexibility is within those parameters. But I just received a text from the store manager, asking me to come in at 7 AM (instead of 9 AM) because of her boss's bosses who will be visiting the store. Obviously, she wants to leave a good impression, but it's an illusion. The store is run embarrassingly on a daily basis, and I'd kind of like the big bosses to see this so we can cite the issues to them directly if they question. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also shit at saying no. How would be the be the most tactful way to say no? This is a very expectatious woman who often expects people to do things in their own time and expense (it's not said but implied). I'm worried a simple ''no'' might seem callous. But I don't have a great reason other than that I simply don't want to. If I explain my public transportation dilemma, she'll likely try to haggle her way by telling me to come in as soon as I can.

I wrote this so I might hear advice of someone else who went through something similar, but any advice in general would be nice.

This relationship was the first for both of us and ended about 4 years ago in highschool on bad terms. We hadn't talked since. 
This holiday break I decided to reach out and email her wishing her a good life. That way we had some positive memory to leave off in spite of how it had ended. To my pleasant surprise, she got back to me and suggested we meet up.

We got together last Saturday, and had a real positive chat. Catching up was good, and some apologies were made. She also told me how she's gay. It wasn't a huge surprise; she had mentioned that she thought she was bi during the relationship. Somehow my brain didn't even consider that her being gay included when we dated.

We kept in contact texting some afterwards and the topic came up. That's when she started correcting my mindset.
You see, we had our apparent issues more during the second half of the relationship. The first half had always been a cute memory I held of two highschoolers being in love for the first time, but apparently every sexually physical interaction was disgusting for her.
Tragically, her parents were and are extremely anti-gay, so she had some very homophobic ideas about herself back then. This is what led her to push herself to be heterosexual.

Even knowing that, it's hard to accept with what I remember. She said that every kiss was unenjoyable, but I recall seeing her smile afterwards. She would take her own initiative sometimes when we made out.
We got involved sexually, and I had always thought it was just two high schoolers enjoying their first experiences, but she tells me that she had to dissociate herself to get through it.. I did that to her.
But I recall how when we had to lay off the sexual activity for awhile, I told her all about how I was starting to day-dream about sex, and she told me that she was so happy I said that because she had been doing the same. I believed it. I trusted every word, and she didn't even need to say it.

Every time we did things, I would see smiles. She would laugh about the sexual situations we we're in after almost being caught. I remember passionately making out for half an hour. I recall kissing on the neck the first time and her telling me how incredible it was. Hell, I once told her to stop kissing me so I could think straight and she giggled before kissing me even more.
And it was all an act?...

It screws with my head. I was in a relationship this past year with a girl, and I'd swear at the very least, the kissing was just as enthusiastic.

How did I miss it all? Why didn't I see any disgust after we kissed, or when things got heated? I don't get it. How can someone lie about such an awful experience and get me to believe they liked it?

She says she took initiative on things because she wanted to make me happy. It makes me sick thinking about it.
I was fucking torturing her. I was enjoying myself while she was having to separate her mind from the experience to get through it.
I hate myself thinking about it. I hate how she lied so well. I hate how I never fucking noticed it.
It makes me want to punch my wall and sob.

It's like I failed on picking up on such a terrible experience in someone who I loved more than anything at the time. Isn't that something I should've been able to do?

--Some extra details--
She had PCOS (another doctor recently says she may have been misdiagnosed though). Essentially, her body had very low estrogen production and she took BC to regulate it. She doesn't get periods so we were pretty certain she couldn't get pregnant and didn't use a condoms the first few times during sex.
At the end of our relationship her doctor told her to get off of the BC for awhile so they could do another test. It was during this time that she first said anything about not enjoying sexual activity. We broke up during this time as well. I had always attributed her getting off the pill to the reason why she stopped enjoying sexual activity.

We would make out a lot before doing anything sexual, and only did PIV maybe 4-5 times total. 
The first time, we did a lot of foreplay and she was wet enough that I don't recall any friction when we started (and it ended pretty quick ofc).
I have done multiple rounds with another girl where we had to use lube after the natural stuff wasn't doing it. I'm aware of how it would've felt if we had tried starting and she wasn't wet.
PIV was painful for my ex and we both were concerned, but after talking to her friends she thought that it would get better if we did it a few more times. We kept it to rare occasions hoping it would be better each time and she even thought it did improve, or at least told me so.
99% of our sexual interactions was us using our hands with each other.

People may ask, so yes, she would get wet. In fact, as much as I can remember, she was always wet after we had been making out.
One night, she really, really seemed interested in making out in my living room even though my sister was just out of sight (we weren't allowed to go into my room). When things got heated, she was extremely wet. Afterwards she told me how she had missed a day of her BC, took a double dose that morning, and believed that it made her hornier. That always stuck with me because I had thought it was awesome.
She doesn't remember that last occasion, and she told me she trained herself very well to get turned on.

After finding out, I wanted to doubt it all. I found a post in r/Bisexual where some bi girls said that they shifted their tendencies to be more lesbian and less bi when they stopped taking BC, but my ex got back on BC in college and came out as gay afterwards, so that doesn't line up. I have to accept that what had been a good time for me was a traumatic experience for her.

My ex is much happier now. She doesn't seem to have totally forgiven me for all she deemed blamable, but at least she's in a good spot now.

I have a lab in 3 hours. I'll get what sleep I can and respond to any comments after I'm done with classes. Thanks for reading. 

--TLDR--
My first ex and I met up after years of being on bad terms. She told me how she's gay and actually was nearly traumatized by our relationship.
I was oblivious to anything wrong and now I hate myself for never noticing anything and having taken part in what was essentially torture for her.",09Jan2019,1
316,"A friend who I have recently reconnected asked to stay at my apartment for a few days while she transitions into her emigration and to save some money.

She recently lost her best friend in a car accident and ended it with her fiancé a few weeks later so she is going through a tough time, and I was happy to help. We aren’t super close but having also broken up with my long term boyfriend, I thought the company would be nice and we could bond. 

Yesterday she arrived. And I could tell she was on SOMETHING. She’s always been a bit of an experimenter with drugs so I’m not naive that she can party, but I didn’t expect her to arrive on a Tuesday afternoon tweaked out of her mind. 

I had sent her some money because she claimed she lost her card. Which I was happy to do and asked her to pay me back when she went to the bank today. Not having seen her or knowing she was in this space. 

Turns out she bought a gram of coke, and was also popping Xanax and sleeping tablets to try and sleep. She only ended up passing out on the couch at 5 am. And has been sleeping the whole day (it’s now 12:20) 
No sign of her going to the bank or even taking a shower. Her skin looks grey, she’s deathly thin and I’ve never known her to be like this so I know something is wrong.

I feel uncomfortable having her here. And I don’t want a situation where she mooches off of me for weeks. I want her out by tomorrow but don’t want to leave her homeless. (She was in an air bnb before but it’s expensive) 
She has no family close by, and I’m not really close enough to her to intervene with her parents etc. 

I don’t know what to do? How do I handle this? 
I’m sure I won’t see that money back so I’m willing to learn a lesson and lose it, but I really need her to leave because I’ve got a tough work and personal few weeks ahead of me and can’t have a tweaking girl on my couch.

321,"Hello I am a 20 year old guy from a 3rd world country named Bangladesh. It is a shithole anyway but for poor people like me it's hell.

Technically my family is just about lower middle class, but the problem is that my father is a skinflint and mentally fucked up. He gives me only 60$ per month as allowance. I know many of you rich people earn more than that per day. With this small amount of money I can barely buy enough food to survive. I wear old clothes and ride crappy busses to save money. I never had a car and always dream of owning one. I don't have enough money to get my teeth fixed or buy some new clothes.

I am close to finishing uni and my dad is angry for paying about 800$ each trimester. It wasn't my choice to go to uni because I am autistic and I am just not University material. I fucked up most of my courses, failed or barely passed them. It happened because I am depressed all the time and have no hope of getting a real job. I don't show dad my grades because I am scared. I just tell him I am doing fine. In short, in the job market my certificate will be worth just much as a used toilet paper.

I have no idea what I am going to do now. I thought I would find some freelancing work online but it seems impossible. I hate my parents and it would be really great if I made enough dough to live on my own. But with my autism I have no hope of landing a job.

Please give me some ideas. I am not asking for money. Just tell me what can I do with my disabled brain. I am so desperate that I would even suck cocks but I don't know where I can find that kind of work.

324,"I wasn’t too sure how to word the title. Basically I’m wanting to start living life drama free.

I have very little drama in my life but as I see it, any drama is enough drama. And I would rather not carry any drama from day to day.

I’ve come to a conclusion to see things as my fault and nobody else’s. 

An example would be if my buddy got mean with me because he thought I was being an asshole through text, instead of getting upset at him for thinking that, I should see that maybe it’s my fault for the way I worded some texts.

Another example would be if a buddy of mine cancelled dinner plans last minute with an excuse that I’m almost positive is a lie. I shouldn’t get mad he lied, I should be understanding he didn’t want to have dinner and didn’t feel comfortable enough to tell me the truth. 

Or if my SO gets upset with me, instead of thinking of the reasons she is wrong to be upset, I should start thinking of the ways she is right to be upset. 

I’m gonna take the blame from everyone else, and put it on myself. I’m not saying that I should see myself as a fuck up or the only one that makes mistakes. I just think I should be the one to focus on the ways I could have been in the wrong and leave everyone else’s mistakes to themselves.

327,"Hi reddits, in advance, Spanish is my first language so I'm sorry if I dont talk correctly. 

A little background: My bf and I been in a relationship for about 4 years. We grew up together and been through a lot of shit, jealousy issues, bad treatment, etc. From the beginning I made him delete her ex gf from social media, and asked him to stop greeting her when we crossed her everytime we go out (he went mad every time I ask him this, he felt he wasn't doing any wrong. But I always felt sad when he said hello to her, bc I was his close friend when he started his relationship with her and been present since their day 1 to their last day together).

He made me delete some friends of mine that in the past (way way back in time) made the attempt to ask me out. I didn't complain, I understood how he felt about them and I did what he asked for.

He is a caring, loving man but doesn't express his love through words as much as I'd like, he rather buys me things i like (i dont ask for any of it..anyway) and helps me a lot in my studies and in every other need I have. I appreciate him so fucking much for it.

Anyway, last year he told me he wanted to break up, he said: I wasn't enough, I never gave him anything (assuming material things), that I never wasn't able to do or get a little thing by my own, I wasn't making him happy, and those sort of things. I felt extremely bad bc I loved him so much at that point, and it hurts being told those thing by the person u love. 

I tried to work things out and do things he wanted me to do, changed my career (engineering to photography, bc I was having a hard time with engineering and wouldn't be able to find any job quickly). Among another things. I seems that I failed. 

3 weeks ago, he told to break up again, this time he said I'm worthless, meaningless to him, that I only gave him sexual satisfaction, that he didn't love me, and that I will never gave him some financial stability. Plus, he started to get physical when we ocasionally fight, not to the point to punch me or something, but he pushed me, squeezed my arms, obviously I cry and feel horrible. He gets mad at me for every little and banal thing.

I'm a little tired of his treatment and I went distant somehow and dont know what to do. In parallel I met this guy from my college, he is like my doppelganger as we have so much in common. We started chatting (we saw before only two times) as friends only of course. I started to develop some emotions towards him and told some friends about it (me and my bf are in the same close group of  friends). I like this guy, but I dont know how he feels about me, last night he suggested that he has some intentions to have sex with me to which I responded stupidly with a heart emoji as I dont even know wtf to do in the big picture. 

I feel horrible knowing that I'm developing some kind of love for someone else and feeling less in love every day with my bf. It seems I'm a shit of a person who is not trying enough to please or commit to the needs of the person I love. Also, I dont feel right to step out of a 4 years relationship for another guy that I dont even know if he likes me in that way (we dont see each other as much as I would sadly like). 

 I feel like shit for the ""I'd break up with A to be with B, but not until I make sure B likes me too"" situation, it's just bullshit. I dont know what to do. Please insult me if I'm messing things up or help me if you feel so.

Just for information, I was doing good in middle school ( age 13 ) I was talking to girls and was on the path to having a girlfriend/sex at a young age. When I turned 14, I just started hanging with the stoner loner type crowd. I forgot about all girls, and I spent all my time with the same group of mostly guys for like 3 years. No one else cared about girls in our group, so we wouldnt ever find girls to talk to. 


Now im 20. I think that basically everything besides girls is lame. I dont want to start a career. I just want to find other guys who arent stupid, and will help me find some girls. Its actually hard to do though. Most people I meet are boring, just like the people I hung out with for so long. To be clear, I just want to hang out with girls, go to parties, maybe get a girlfriend, then Ill be happy to turn 25 and 30. 

If I could give any advice to younger kids, I would say focus on girls as soon as possible. Even if your friends think you are weird, it doesnt matter. Its the only way to truly use your time wisely. Make a little bit of money on the side, and get average grades.

339,"Hey all,

&amp;#x200B;

A sum of the main points:

&amp;#x200B;

1) My girlfriend has been looking for a new job, is in the process of applying at a specific company on my advice

&amp;#x200B;

2) I have been offered a much better paying role than my current one at the above company (an extra 6/7K a year)

&amp;#x200B;

3) The job is about 2 hours drive away from where we currently live and where her family live

&amp;#x200B;

4) We don't yet drive (first lessons this week, learnt to drive a decade ago before)

&amp;#x200B;

5) Her dad is currently just coming out of hospital following major operations

&amp;#x200B;

6) He needs further medical work done, unknown length currently

&amp;#x200B;

7) Her family aren't coping very well with her dad as it is in general

&amp;#x200B;

8) There are currently 6 of us living in her home at the moment, so we need to move out as is

&amp;#x200B;

So, the longer version of ""hmmmm"" thoughts are: If I take up the job offer and she DOESN'T get the job it could crush her as for me it's just ""yeah why not, that looks fun!"" whereas for her the company is a way to have a career. Even if she wasn't crushed by not getting the job then I'd have to move up there...right while her father is really ill and she'd need support as would her family. If we don't go for the jobs then we'd likely have to move out asap as is, but we'd move in-town to enable us to be around. That being said if we stayed around we'd also miss out on massive opportunities job wise as well as the looming threat of her potentially not having a job anyway come...May I think?

&amp;#x200B;

Then there's the other side of things. If we both take jobs up there and move, then we don't currently have driving licenses. The train network allows us to visit, but it would take 3 or 4 hours to get there so we wouldn't be around to assist with health related matters when they need us the most until we learnt to drive. Of course, if I can pass my test ASAP then I'd get a car on finance and then just suck it up and drive down often because fuck it, they need the help. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if that really explains everything in a sufficient way, but sometimes it helps to write things out to formulate it and then get points of view on it. I'd hate to just jump down a one-track-mind point of view and not take into account everyone else's feelings on the matter, but I also want to get an opinion from outside the family so that we can plan accordingly and see what is really reasonable from a choices option (we're all pretty bad a jumping on things without thinking during highly emotional moments...)",09Jan2019,1

342,"tl;dr I see my friend as a fake friend and I told him to leave me alone and now I regret it and think I should apologize.

Hi, english is not my first language so apologies for messing up. I had a friend that was sketchy from the beggining and I could sense something wrong with him, but I couldn’t tell what. He was very close to me and he was telling me everything about his life and friends, and he met some girl through internet and she friendzoned him, I dont want to go into details about her but she’s important in this story so I’ll name her G1 (as in girl one). He then got a girlfriend(G2) and I was extremely happy for him. G1 got, idk, jealous I think and started to shittalk my friend and then started to call his new gf names (like bitch, whore)(she was just lashing out in anger because she lives 350+km from where we live) so he asked me what to do and I told him that that means she’s not really so good of a friend if she cant be happy for him, and he told me later he told her to „fuck off”. Then he broke up with his girl, and everytime he came to my house he kept telling me about both of these girls and that they are both(ill just stop it here but he was using really bad language). Like a month later he told me that G1 apologized through snapchat and what should he do. I told him that her behaviour was wrong and he shouldn’t just forgive her so easily because their previous relation was toxic anyways because she was only using him as a „pillow to cry on” when she was sad, and didnt give a fuck when he was sad. He said im right, then he was doing everything he could to hide the fact that he is on good terms with her because he knew i wouldn’t be very happy with that, he was still coming to my house and kept on telling me about how they are both (bad). Then he came back to his girlfriend and I only laughed at that because i know he isnt very trustworthy because he kept telling me that she is „a whore” and everything bad about her, yet he easily forgave her. To end the story, I told him he cant speak to me anymore because he is fake, and he needs to fuck off from my life. Now i dont know if i did the right thing because i think he is going around and telling lies about me behind my back just to appeal to people who dont like me.

He said,""stop playing ur pho.."" that's where I cut in and said I was discussing my homework with my friend. Then, he said when we are going japan, u guys (my bro and i) can't bring ur phone out of the hotel. I acted alittle rash because I wanted to bring my phone out to take photos and the thing is I never bring my phone out to eat (in my own country) he keeps thinking im addicted to my phone but I'm not, that's why I got pissed off and started saying this to myself


""Why can't I bring my phone, I barely being it out and I just want to bring it to Japan. I wouldn't even play it or go to Instagram or reddit."" I grumbled all this to myself and my father was like could u shut up? Obviously I did and listen to my dad. He kept complaining how everything that came out from my mouth would make someone mad like a few days ago, my parents  were planning to have dinner with my dad's family,  which I'm not close with, during Chinese New Year. I said ""oh come on, I'm not close with them."" I admit I shouldn't have said that and that was my bad. 



The main problem is he always think I'm addicted to my phone but I'm not, it always pissed me off how he thinks I'm addicted to my phone, This is a small rant as well. I admit it was my bad to say that I wasn't close to my father's side of family and I'm serious.

344,"I wanted to get advice from people that had no ties to the situation so I came here. I need to figure out if I should move back home in with my family for my mental well being. I’ll give some back story.

I moved to another state a few years ago and ended up becoming engaged to an amazing man I thought my future was set but then I found out he was cheating on me and he took me for granted didn’t care etc. So we broke that off in September.

Since then my mental health has become increasingly worse. I’m on medication, I go to therapy but I just feel myself drowning more and more. My ex fiancé left me with a mortgage. (Only in my name due to his bad credit) I’m struggling financially and it has taken the biggest toll on me.

I also believe I’m anorexic. I have lost almost 30 lbs since September and some nights I find myself not eating at all. My normally calorie intact for the day is about 400.

So my parents want me to come home. They want me to quit my job right now and move back tonight, they told me they would take care of finances and sell my condo for me. They are worried and say I need to take care of my health. 

I feel like a failure if I end up back at home but I’m almost wondering if I should to make sure I stay healthy and ultimately not end my life. I’ve had a few nights where I almost went to the ED, stared at pills, thoughts got increasingly worse. It seems to happen more now. 

I have a few friends here and I LOVE my job but maybe I should move back home to take care of myself? 

I don’t know I need advice please. ",09Jan2019,1

350,"Hi Reddit,

Tl;dr: been clean 10 days, friends still use drugs every weekend, they have no pity for a 16 year old who made her addicted (for me redflag), I want to stay clean. Need advice what to do to prevent a shithole.

Last year I've been semi addicted (last summer til 31 december 2018)  to a research chemical. My friends are also addicted. They all go to college and I have taken a year off so I can decide what study I want to do, i also work around 30 hours a week.

My friends buy/bought the drugs from a local shady dealer for around 20$ a gram, I had some money left and invested in buying the drugs from a lab (it's legal here) and sold it to my friends for 10$, I told my friends exactly how much I invested etc. (Don't lie to friends right?). This is where the trouble begins.

I am/was earning more money than my friends so I was able to afford everything I set my eye on like for example a game computer or a ps4 pro. I always tell my friends about the things I bought like maybe once or I showed it to them. I also allowed my friends to pay me out later and I shared food/drinks and other stuff because I knew they weren't earning as much like me. Heck I even lowered the debts they own me sometimes and even said ""pay me how much you like it's okay"".

Now here comes the problem, I've been clean for 10 days and I love it. Every Monday I have to work and I don't feel like shit anymore. I feel so great that I actually wanna stop doing drugs at home and only use it at a music festival. My friends however keep on doing drugs every weekend and support their addictions. The thing that makes me worry is that they have no pity for a 16 year old girl who has been using the research chemical every day even though one of my friends gave it to her and made her addicted. Another issue is that they want me to lower the drug so that I don't make profit at all which I told them I won't invest anymore.

I need advice on what to do now because clearly I have an idea this is going to turn in a shithole.

351," So the backstory is that during one of my university classes last summer I saw a girl I really liked. It took me a few weeks to gather up the courage to approach her since I was new to the country and therefore a bit shy to talk to strangers especially a girl I like. I went up to her and started a conversation when I saw her going home after our class one day and kept it casual, talking about majors and what subjects she was doing. That went kind of okay in my opinion. Later on, I knocked her on Facebook and asked her if she wanted to go for a coffee or movie. The only thing I got was a 'thumbs down' reaction which I assumed meant that I kind of creeped her out the previous time and she's not available right now. So I kind of left her alone completely and tried to forget her for the next year or so.  


Fast forward to this summer, after not seeing her for a year, she's taking the same summer course as me again and I'm back to the same situation again. I don't think she saw me or if she did, doesn't care.  Even though I might possibly get the same answer, how do I approach her again and ask her out or should I just leave her alone so that I don't creep her out more right now (and maybe even get reported for being a creep)?  


P.S. I'm making this post because I really like the girl and she's not just some random crush. And throwaway account cus of obvious reasons. :)  


TL;DR: I asked a complete stranger out after talking to her randomly on the streets one year ago and she, later on, reacted with a 'thumbs down' in Facebook which I assumed meant that she's not interested or I'm a creep.

352,"Hey everyone, 

I need some serious advice. I got married recently, and I am happily married and in love with my wife. However a new problem came up recently, and I want to solicit advice to have aid in helping me make my decision.

I recently got a new job in November for a company I always wanted to work for in the state we reside. Everything is going great, and I love my current job. 

Last week however my wife received word from her dream school that she was accepted into a master program. She is 100% going, but this program is in a different state. The program is 10 months long, and she doesn’t think she will be moving back to the state we currently reside after the master is over, but she also doesn’t think she will stay in the state where the school is located.

My advice I wanted to solicit, should I move with her for the 10 months she’s in school if she’s most likely not staying in the city afterwards? If I don’t move would it most likely cause a strain on a new marriage? I have pretty severe anxiety and am worried moving multiple times will cause a strain on my mental health, but I also don’t want to strain a new marriage and have lasting problems. I am completely open to moving once she’s done with school and settling into the new state, even if it means leaving the job I currently love. 

I’m not sure if this is relevant, but I will be the sole income provider (including healthcare) for us when she is in school.

I am just at a loss of what I am going to do, and wanted to get outside input to help me think about all angles. Sorry for any poor punctuation or grammar this is on my phone. ",09Jan2019,1
353,"Very very very long post, tldr at the end.

Context:
(You don't have to read this, I just have to rant)
The school I currently attend is a popular school to pick to go to after our graduation of elementary, since the elementary school I attended was small and didn't teach high school. The school I attend, although called ""prestigious"", is very easy to get in. So that is why many of my past classmates are still my schoolmates.

The school is very far, it is usually an hour drive if you're lucky. So one of my classmate's parents decided to buy a van and house us, 15 of us (Although not all of us were from my old school, most of them were) and just collect a monthly fee. Since most of my old classmates attended the same school I went too, and I also have to travel with them for an entire hour 2 times a day, I can't ignore them. Believe me, I want to. I see many good friend groups that I want to join, but it's very hard considering the fact that your old classmates are always bugging you to hang out with them. 

I understand why they can't find new friends though, they suck. And I wish I don't have to be entitled to hang out with them just because we have history. I have met people who I've only known for a year and a half, yet I would rather spend my entire life with them rather than my old classmates. This is how much they annoy me and discourage me. 

They're already shitty friends in general too.




Story:
2 of my old classmates and my cousin (They all ride in our van;My cousin is a year ahead of us though so I didn't really know her that well until this year when I found out we were cousins) were talking about Miss Universe and how they didn't agree that Miss Spain should be there, Miss Spain is a transgender woman. 

One made the argument that ""I'm not homophobic or against transgender people but they didn't accept themselves in the first place, why should we accept them?"" Another made the argument that ""Why aren't we allowed to join Miss Transgender?"" I wanted to tell them that ""Transgender women are women, Miss Spain belongs there."" ""If someone with an unhealthy body weight didn't accept themselves and in turn made themselves better by eating a healthier diet and exercising, we shouldn't accept them either? Because that is the same logic."" ""Miss Transgender literally needs you to be transgender, it is in the name. Miss Universe doesn't require you to be a universe, idiot. It requires you to be an intelligent, beautiful woman. And transgender women are real women."" But I didn't want to start a fight, so I didn't say anything.

I already had homophobic vibes from them though, seeing how they reacted to the gay flags hanging at our school during pride month. They at first reacted negatively but them acted to be supportive just because everyone else was supportive.

I know I sound very SJW right now, and I'm not, I hope I don't. But it really ticks me off, I am also part of the LGBT+ community and I am not yet out. I'm glad I'm not, if I was, they would probably convince me to date the opposite gender, like a straight person(i'm not against striaght people! You guys deserves rights too! I won't hate you because you're straight, I probably hate you because you suck) But imagine if I was out? The things they would say behind my back? I don't want to be friends with people who won't support me just because I am who I am. I don't want to be friends with people who hate people just because they are being who they want to be. 


Conclusion: 
I'm probably getting an apartment in the same city my school is in next year, so I will easily be able to ignore them. Just a few more months until graduation and I have freedom from my van friend group entitlement. 

I have no problem with letting these 3 people go. One is a selfish person, who only cares about themselves, someone who looks for attention and cries when even the slightest stressful thing will happen to her( It's high school, what did you expect? That it was going to be easy? Grow a pair) One is a dumb bitch who is leeching off others popularity to try to be popular too (it's not working at all, for good reason) And my cousin is just a mean person to people she's close with. She's been close to this one person for years and she treats her like shit, she actually cried once because of what my cousin said to her. But she has known me for under a year and she acts like we're siblings that haven't fought in our lives. It's sketchy and I feel sorry for the people she's been friends with for a long time.


TL;Dr

My 3 ""friends"" are homophobic. I am LGBT+. These 3 people are shitty people in general anyways.

My question for advice, what do I do? Do I tell them they shouldn't be homophobic? Should I stay silent? Should I ignore them for the rest of the year? Should I still pretend to be friends until I get an apartment? Should I tell my other friends about their homophobia? 
Someone that's older, please give me advice. I'm sort of young and I freak out when even the most insignificant thing my friends do hurt me. Please don't judge me, it really hurts to know that people you've known for so many years could actually be against you. Thanks anyways :)",09Jan2019,1
354,"Basically my friend and I booked flights overseas, I'd been sending them the details and even at the time the dates were wrong by 3 months but neither of us noticed and went ahead and booked.
Fast forward to a few days later when I noticed the error and we are now facing around $500 extra each to get the right dates. Naturally one of my first thoughts was I should cover their costs too because I found and sent them the flights but there a couple of things to consider:

1. We went over several options before deciding to cancel and rebook our flights, one of which was to just keep the current ones at no extra charge and make it work
2. I'm not as financially stable and can't afford to cover both of us right now

Which brings me to my other alternative - to pay for some attractions in the lead up/meals and stuff during the trip.

You don't ever wear makeup do you? If it makes you feel pretty then wear it. If you don't like wearing it then fuck it.""

368,"See this is about a girl. I‘m 17 years old (boy). We in the same friend group so we spend time together quite often, her boyfriend lives in my hometown so I meet her when she comes over to him, he‘s a good friend of mine. She‘s also in my class so I meet her there as well.. At some point I started liking her a lot while she was with her bf. So I start caring a lot, typical nice guy. Later I go to notice she doesn‘t really give a shit. I went deep into personal developement, gotten a lot prouder and secure in myself. So I really didn‘t take it that hard anymore that I won‘t be that kind of person to her. It was more that I knew my strenghts now and was more secure. Then the real problem came though: I as a person was more secure and not jealous and shit but I still liked the girl way too much.  When we went out I had a lot of great evenings with her, she gave me reasons to trust and love her. I enjoyed buyi g drinks for her every now and then because I felt she deserved it so much.
Pretty much I settled for friendship instead of avoiding her because she felt so valueable.

Sorry for the long intro, the situation now:
I noticed she will appreciate me doing what I  can for her, just being nice in return, letting me know I‘m a fun guy to be around with. But that only really happens when I spend money or do something for her first. It‘s a toxic relationship where I care way too much and she really doesn‘t care a whole lot. Telling her what the problem is doesn‘t do shit because it‘s me who is expecting her to do things A,B and C to show she‘s thankfull. Only attempt I made was when I asked how her day was when I didn‘t see her at school. I do that a lot, I knew it‘s annoying her so I said „Sorry to annoy you with that question so much“ Actually just wanted a reaction where we can talk about what‘s up. She goes on to actually tell me about how her day was, no comment on what I said.

So TLDR I know there has to be a change because I still think and care a lot even if I‘m a more positive and better person,but I can‘t really clear anything up cause that causes chaos in the friend group and I don‘t even have anything I could be mad at her for. She just has a bf and she can‘t care as much as I do. Ignoring her really doesn‘t help at all, it just doesn‘t. Thanks so much!",09Jan2019,1

I would love to reconnect and see how they are doing but I have social anxiety and find it difficult to know if things like this are actually inappropriate or if that is just in my head. ,09Jan2019,1
377,"I’m not a big writer so I apologize beforehand but I’ll try my best to make it readable! If this Is the wrong thread, I’m sorry.

I have been thinking a lot lately and I don’t know where to go from here. 

I’ll start a bit early just so the entire thing makes any sense. I come from a “rich” family, not snobby rich but still quite wealthy. The kind of family that everyone in my hometown knows because we’re one of the largest employers. Starting in school I was always “that” child. People would make the strangest assumptions about me. Obviously I must have everything I ever could wish for and my parents would solve everything for me. I am not making this up, people actually told me as much.

Well, if they knew my parents they likely wouldn’t have said those things. My parents together worked for their success, and together they went from bankruptcy to something very successful. They also tried their best to raise me well, meaning no tv no PlayStation,.. (mind you most people I knew had those. Well tbf I had a laptop quite early on but we also didn’t have a family desktop). 

Now I’m also a partly very anxious person. Why partly? Well because In topics that I was good at I could be quite confident, if I wasn’t good at it chances are I’m quite anxious about it. Well social interactions is one of those. As a result of this and being “that kid” I went down the path of being quite lonely all throughout highschool. I didn’t give up on social interaction/ friends entirely but rather worked on it as much as my anxiety allowed me to. On the other hand, i tried capitalizing on the things i was good at specifically maths. This kinda allowed me to look forward to after highschool and in comparison to a lot of people I knew what to do with my life ( well ya know, as much as highschool kids can know about their future).
 
Well later on I graduated from high school well enough and started my undergraduate degree abroad. Well as uni allowed me to specialize more I started doing better and better. Social life also began picking up. I’m not the most popular guy but I’m also not a loner and I’m in a great relationship.

I graduated in the top 1% of my year and knowing that I still had loads of capacity left I started doing my masters at one of the most prestigious universities in the field ( top 5ish). Well , turns out at this level I’m not competitive anymore, and I mean not at all. This took me a bit surprise and adapting to it has been difficult. The pace is something I’m not used to. The first round of exams has just come around and I’m not doing too well. I will pass everything but that’s all I’m willing to guarantee. 

Now I do have a strategy in place for the next round of exams which I think might solve the issue (can’t give up hope eh). But realistically this might not end as good as I would like it to.

Given this I’m sort of mentally not in the best spot of all times. Realizing that you’re not as good at the thing you thought you could kinda hurts. 

Before all this I was planning to go on to do a PhD but this suddenly doesn’t seem to be that brilliant of an idea even though I still absolutely love my subject. 

For the first time in 6 years I do not know what comes next. It’s a strange scenario I never wanted to be in but here we go.

I just want to know what you would do in my place. A break to Continuously listening to the echo chamber that is my brain might be nice :)

Lastly, i hope i don’t come across as major arsehole, but then you never know.

378,"I was in the hospital a lot as a kid, and lately I've been thinking about the people who supported me at that time. There is one guy whose name has stuck with me. He was just there to go around and visit with the kids in the hospital. He'd sit with me and play card games. I'm 99% sure I've found him on facebook, but it's 30 years later and I was wondering if it would be terribly awkward to message him (he's going to think I'm a stalker for remembering his name all these years!) or if he might appreciate it.

380,"Hi all! Recently my boyfriend “came clean” about a reason he may not want to move forward in our relationship. That reason is my weight... I understand that we all have preferences, but I am feeling rather hurt/confused/angry that it would be a reason to put our relationship on hold or end it for that matter. I know that I am not in the same shape I was in high school and I am 10-12lbs heavier (depending on the day) than I should be according to my doctor. But I fail to see how this could be a deal breaker considering he says everything else is there. I believe him when he says that which is why it concerns me that this has remained an issue for him. Any help sorting out my mixed emotions is appreciated. ",09Jan2019,1
381,"After 4 years of friendship, my friend told me she no longer wants to be friends with me. For the past 1.5 years or so, she had been on-and-off distant, and I have a complicated family history that has given me some abandonment/attachment issues that I am aware of and have been working on and she was aware of. She and I originally bonded due to both coming from low-income, non-traditional, toxic homes, and were close up until the spring of junior year of college (we met freshman year). I have always been more social, more optimistic, and am the kind of person who takes every opportunity I get. I did very well in school and had a lot of positive relationships with professors and other students. She, on the other hand, was always less social, pessimistic, and did not perform as well academically in college as in high school. During late junior/senior year, I did become less interested in long conversations with her because she was constantly negative and never wanted any positive feedback. I remained kind and supportive and we both worked together so we chatted there frequently.  This past summer, after graduation, she stopped responding to my texts and made excuse after excuse for not hanging out. One of her close friends (who I am also friends with) stopped following me on social media and she herself stopped liking my posts. I wrote a letter to her explaining my perception of her behaviors and how it made me feel. This was the second attempt at open communication about how her actions made me feel (I spoke up after junior year once as well), and she did not respond. She was in Ireland last fall, and I sent a letter asking how she was/how the trip was, and expressed that I cared about our friendship. She never responded to that either. 
We are both in the same friend group, and my best friend in the group was completely confused as well about what I could have done and agreed her behaviors were strange. A few friends and I planned to go see a concert in November and I found out she was planning to go as well. She didn’t make eye contact with me and avoided me all night, eventually going out with a couple friends in our group, who I was bummed that I couldn’t hang out with too due to the awkwardness. I texted her and expressed that it was unfair to our other friends, and that if she was unwilling to speak with me about whatever was upsetting her, she could at least be cordial. 
She then responded (after over 3 months without a word) and explained that she felt I was exhausting and it was stressful to be friends with me, that I overanaylze and she did not want to be friends anymore. She also said that there was nothing positive about our friendship and we shouldn’t make more out of our friendship than there was, which was superficial according to her. She said that we could “discuss it” if I wanted but that she didn’t care either way and that she decided she should respond instead of ghosting me. 
I was surprised and hurt that she felt this way, as I only ever reached out twice in our entire friendship about what had been bothering me, and both times were when we weren’t together at school, where we got along well and were kind to one another. I felt like we had a genuine friendship and feel really sad that she doesn’t feel our friendship is worth working on. It’s also hard because she is still friends with everyone else in our friend group. My best friend suggested that I avoid interactions with her for the most part and see if we can slowly learn to be around the same people again and be polite to each other.
Last night (over a month since she messaged me), I suggested to my best friend that maybe I reach out to the other friend and propose an in-person conversation at a cafe or something to talk through things. My best friend feels that the other friend was direct in that she doesn’t want to go into it, so this could be a bad idea. I feel like we never had a real conversation about things, so there is a lot of miscommunication and lack of clarity about what happened.

382,"i live in a 4 bedroom apartment right now with 2 other guys. one of them shares a dog with his girlfriend and this dog is over here a lot of the time. i have nothing against dogs and i like this one but she is young and sometimes they leave her inside for long periods of time without a bathroom break. well anyway she came in and jumped on my bed last night while i was playing xbox. later i went to go to sleep and found a huge, cold, wet, and smelly stain that smelled like urine. so i went over to his room to tell him and he denied it saying she had been in his room the whole time. i went in the kitchen later and he came out and went off about how he didn’t want me coming at his dog like that and had the audacity to blame me and say i spilled something on my bed when i knew i didn’t. i was really stoned when all of this was happening but i’m just wondering why he would be so angry at me when i had evidence backing up my claim. i don’t want to escalate anything because we have been friends since we met a few months ago and this has been the first issue. i don’t want to argue for the sake of being right either. but now i feel super awkward in my own apartment. i don’t think i should apologize though, i just wanted to let him know what his dog was doing ",09Jan2019,1
383,"Let me get straight to it. My school has this system wherein the guys avoid conflict when asking girls to prom by announcing who they wanna take in a group with the other guys in the batch. There’s this girl which I decided to ask to prom but word got around and it made its way to her. This was about 2 months ago and we were never really close to begin with and when I made the decision it was a mix of peer pressure from her friends telling me to ask her and my thoughts of how we had a lot of shared interests. Afterwards I felt good and proud that I decided to ask this girl but over the next week until now I’ve had my own share of insecurities, doubts and just conflicted feelings trying to figure out if I decided to ask her from my own feelings and because I wanted to or if I decided to ask her because it was something I did in the heat of the moment. The prom is in about a month and our friendship hasn’t really progressed all that much but we were supposed to hang out on the holidays but it got canceled due to her being abroad and both of us being busy.

Even if we aren’t all that close I do care about this girl and really want her to enjoy her prom and I don’t want to hinder her from enjoying it due to me being indecisive and unsure of myself and my choice. I’ve definitely had chances to maybe speak to her and get closer but in the end I back away and these decisions always eat me up inside but when another opportunity comes I just can’t bring myself to act. I know it’s mostly my fault for being indecisive and to put it bluntly, a pussy at times that we’re not that close. I don’t really know why I posted this. I feel like I needed to rant, to here advice from people who don’t know me to see different perspectives and I’m not necessarily looking for answers but even just a clue would do.

Then his girlfriend gets very very emotional and starts crying over and over about how she is so lonely without him. My friend told me that she would spend the nights crying thus ruining her performance at the university. My friend then told me that he was thinking about breaking up with her because he didn't want her grades to suffer at the university because of him. Also she didn't want her psychological health to suffer as well. As he said: ""If we break up, she'll cry for 2 months and she'll get over it, if we don't, she'll cry for 4 more years. (The years left to finish her university)"" which is a very good reason to, but as I said before, this is soulmate levels of love we are talking about, so this is not a good idea.

387,"So over the past year/couple of years I’ve had back pain when sleeping, ranging from severe to none depending on the day. One thing that guarantees do make it worse though, is if he sleeps next to me, because the bed sinks down and I’m sleeping on a mild slope. We’ve tried sleeping head to foot, and it still happens. :/

We’ve been together 9 years, and after the first two we haven’t regularly shared a bed anyway because his snoring started to get so bad it would keep me up. However, he’s recently lost about 35 pounds and it’s gotten a LOT better, to where we can sleep together without a problem, other than my back.

Do you have any suggestions, other than purchasing an expensive bed? :/ unfortunately, we have a pretty small apartment bedroom currently that can’t fit anything larger than the queen size we currently have.

388,"I have a friend that I grew up with. We’re very close. She tends to be somewhat territorial with me at times. She even gets upset when people are trying to interfere when she’s talking to me because she feels I’m pushing her away at times. Every time we got tipsy she would hold my hand. One time she was drunk and tried to kiss me but I turned my head away because I didn’t want to ruin a friendship. She left me hickeys and cuddled up to me asking why I didn’t want to kiss her. I responded that she wasn’t in her right mind and it’s not real. The other night we got drunk together in my room and started kissing then that lead to some things being said. She said she’s loved me since we first met, that she’s in love with me, if we’re not married later on in life that we should get married (she said when she’s 23 but she’s 20 now). I pretty much blacked out at that point but woke up with a bit of blood on my sheets and two condoms on my floor (no she wasn’t on her period). The next day When she left she snaps me a hickey on her chest wondering how she got that. I snap her all the hickeys that we’re left on my body so she realized it was from me. She said it was okay because it was me. I’m trying to brush it off to “she was probably talking just to talk” but it didn’t mean anything because when she’s sober she talks about how attractive some guy is.

392,"Me (F18) and my brother (M15) have always been really close and sort of a united force in fights with our parents. He is the middle child, had a lot of anger problems early but was extremely sensitive on the inside. He always had clashes with our father, who has a plethora of anger problems himself, and our mother didn't really know how to calm him, so I always felt like I was the only one who could actually get to him and understanding what he is going through. About three years ago our parents had a divorce and a month later our mom told us she has breast cancer. I had a major break down and got  depressed and so my parents had that to deal with together with everything else. My youngest brother was too young to fully grasp the situation, but my middle one just shut himself off. I don't think my parents have even noticed it until this year. First he completely stopped talking to our father- never wanting to go over to his house, not answering his phone calls, and blocking him on WhatsApp. Then, last year he gradually stopped talking to his friends at school, being appalled by the thought of meeting with them and even once kicking out a friend who popped over asking if he wanted to hang out. (Like, physically, violently).
During the last summer vacation he was pretty much 24/7 in his room watching anime and playing video games and and got out of the house only once. (When our mom begged him to come along and celebrate her birthday.) He is constantly angry and cursing at us (that includes our 10 y/o brother). Our mom started guilt-tripping herself about not paying enough attention to his needs during the last three years and started treating him with silk gloves and ignoring it whenever he was cursing her and basically stepping all over her. As this school year begone he decided he just doesn't want to go to school what so ever. At the beginning my mom was really anxious to show that she is not stern and inconsiderate like our father and just allowed him not to go. He stopped showering and generally taking care of his self hygiene and my mom tried to confront him on that, which blew up into a huge fight. A couple months have gone by and my mom decide she wanted to put an end to it and actually get him some help. He seems to have social anxiety and when mom started to talk to him about maybe going to therapy he took it as a huge offence. She attempted a few times to limit his time on the computer and get him to actually shower and sleep at night but each time it ended with him locking himself in his room and furiously screaming that he was going to make her suffer. 
This week she reached out to a psychiatric hospital to help her and guide her through how to deal with him, and the first thing she did when got out of the first appointment is asking me to put his desktop on the WiFi blacklist through an app I have on my phone. I did it, and about two hours ago he started texting me about it and about how our mother is trying to ruin his life and to take away everything that brings him happiness. I told him I'll be home in a bit and asked if we could sit and talk about everything and he said he doesn't want anything to do with any of us, that when he leaves home we will really never see him again,  that he will make us suffer and make mom reggret everything. He finished with writing ""this world just isn't worth it. Bye."" And blocked me. I tried to call him but he wouldn't pick up. I called my mom (who is currently at the hospital with our younger brother who is having a surgery) and she said she also got a lot of the same messages and that he won't answer her too. She was kinda calm because she's used to it from him, and just asked me to remove him from the blacklist. 
I have no idea what to do and I'm just really fucking scared. ",09Jan2019,1
393,"Hi everyone, I desperately need some advice on how to make a move!
For some time now I (F19) have been having a huge crush on this barkeeper (M20) from my local pub! We went out once in October '18 after he gave me his number and we had such a sweet time (non-sexual). After flirty texting for a couple weeks but failing to go on a second date due to lots of work from both of us, he texted me that maybe it's not the right time for him atm bc hes super busy at work and that he needed time to think. Okay fine. We haven't texted since but always did a bit of small talk at the pub (where I go every weekend w/ my friends) and he was always super sweet. Last week we were there again and my older brother (23) who had visited me joined us. Idk if its because he saw me with another guy or what, but he texted me to tell me my drunk friend won't get any more drinks (which he had told my brother at the bar literally 1 minute earlier). We exchanged a couple messages before he texted me ""You looked good tonight 🤷🏼‍♀️ x"" to which I replied ""Thank you 🤗 x"". Strangely he didn't answer to that anymore and we haven't texted since. So far for the backstory. Now, I am really attracted to this guy and would totally sleep with him and one of my best friends said that maybe a ONS/FwB is what he has in mind anyway. I wouldn't mind. I'm only in this area for another 7 months and after that I'll be gone. 
So how do I initiate contact again or make it clear to him that I'd be open to that? Since we haven't really talked in a longer time I don't know if I can just text him that 😅🤦🏼‍♀️ I will probs see him again this weekend so if you have some advice on how I can make a move, I would really appreciate that!!

Which is why Debbie talks to me about it all, which is good, but whenever I try talking about my own shed basically brush it off as if its nothing compared to her and goes back to her own problems.

Also, when I confronted the two of them about it, Jane got annoyed and said shit like ""We're not leaving you!"" and proceeded to defend herself. Sometimes, theyd even ignore me and pretend like I heard nothing, espescially Jane. Then she'd just laugh it off and say ""hahaha love you"".

396,"I am moving to Germany this summer (from the US). I’ve had Pablo and Nutella since they were babies, the last 14 years. I’ve had them my whole adult life and acquired them in college. 

These cats picked me to be their human in 2004.  They slept on my front porch in the flower boxes out of all the other people in my college apartment complex, so I told them I would love them and take care of them forever. Since then they have traveled all over with me, and lived lots of places due to my husbands job. I love them immensely, and my kids refer to them as their brother and sister. 

What I need is advice on should I risk flying them overseas to Europe? I would get a direct flight from dc to where in Germany we are moving, so they will only be on one flight. I’ve flown with them in cargo, they did well- but it was 10 years ago. I am unsure about cats flying in the cabin- or if that is safer? They are healthy. I get them checked regularly, and the vet says they are safe to travel (based on a doctor visit last month). 

But then they will be 18ish when we will move back to the US- I cannot tell the future, but that seems REALLY old for a cat to fly back. 

I could leave them with my mom, if I chose not to take them. She would take decent care of them... but she has a lot going on right now, and I don’t want to add any stress to her life.

I’m excited to move so much, it’ll be an awesome experience- except this worry for my cats. I really, genuinely love them so much. So do my husband and my kids... and they are cats so they aren’t as expressive as dogs- but I feel like they love me so much. The way Nutella looks at me is like “you are the only human for me”. Pablo looks at my husband the same way. They stared out as my pets, but now they are our family pets.

398,"Hi there! I'm in need of some advice. I have problems falling asleep and staying asleep. I'm a super light sleeper so I almost instantly wake up at the slightest noise/movement and am unable to easily fall asleep after waking up, which happens every single night. To be honest, I've been using cannabis for the past 1.5 years to help with my anxiety and insomnia. It helps tremendously. But I'm trying to take a break from smoking because it's quite obvious that I've become dependent on it so I'm trying to prove to myself that I don't need it. 

I decided to make my end date two days ago. The past couple of nights I've tried to go without smoking before bed/when I wake up in the middle of the night, but it has resulted in me getting less than 4 hours of sleep total for the past two nights. My boyfriend's mom gave me one of her 100mg trazodone pills to try. I took it last night before bed and it didn't help me at all, just made me feel slightly drunk after taking it. I literally didn't sleep at all last night except for the last 30 minutes before I had to get up for work. 

Anyway, I'm thinking about going to see my doctor to maybe try sleeping pills but I'm terrified that I'll become dependent on them. I don't know what to do at this point. I'm exhausted and there's no way I'll be able to deal with this much longer.

Does anyone have any advice on trying sleeping pills or any tips to help with insomnia? Any advice is greatly appreciated!

(Law schools forbid their students to work more than 20 hrs a week if in school)

401,"For the past few months our 23 year old son has been lying to us about his drinking and a slew of other things,is disrespectful and will not follow any house rules given to him. We had to take his car keys because he cannot be trusted to not drink and drive and are sick of him coming and going as he pleases.

He refuses to get help and is refusing to leave or move out of the house. He is now refusing to go to work. He calls working stupid and would rather stay home playing videogames and making music. He refuses to take an Uber,refuses to pay rent/bills etc.

We have tried AA, counseling, anxiety/depression medication and more. We are at the end of our rope any and all advice would be greatly appreciated!",09Jan2019,1
402,"**Sorry for the long read, I don't know how to be short**

So I have this issue with plans. My boyfriend is usually the issue since he tends to delay or cancel much more often than I do. Okay, let's not call him the issue, it's not always cause he's being unreliable.

If on monday we make a plan to go out on wendnestay, I will get mentally ready and will put that piece of my day away especially for that. I will look forward to it and it'll take up a spot in my mind. 

When the plan gets put off for the next day because of whatever reason (he's tired, he wants to stay later at work, he forgot to do whatever), it kinda ruins my day. Like, I get super angry most of the time, even if it's just to myself, and I can *not* deal with it. That day is just ruined and I can't get over it. Even if the plan was put off for Thursday, I will have a hard time not being really pissed off because of it.

There are times when this feeling is justified, and he really is just being an unreliable person. But other times (like my example above), it's not really. Saying ""sorry I'm really tired can we please do this tomorrow instead"" shouldn't be such a big deal to me. But it is. And I get so hateful. I try to not spew it on him but I will still be kind of icky when he talks to me. I just sit there and find reasons to get more pissed off.

In my defence in this current situation he *was* supposed go give me back a key I had to return to my old boss and I wanted to get it off my mind, but a day of delay isn't a big deal for this either.

So yeah, I don't know, I used to always feel justified in these things, but now I feel like sometimes I should just let it go.... But I can't... I don't know how to let anything go. ",09Jan2019,1

I've had the past three years of my life focused on Oxford - it's been my dream since I realised I had a chance (or at least, I thought I did). I missed the last years of my youth for that uni, only for them to turn down.

Right now all I can feel is resentment. I'm aware there are other options but this was my dream. I want retribution, revenge on people who didn't even wrong me. The anger in my head's putting this down to an elitist bias on behalf of Oxford, and as such I find myself hating everything upper class, even though I know they're not to blame and this is unfounded prejudice.

Whatever the explanation, I need to channel my anger in a way that'll make me a better person, rather than succumb to it. I just don't how; this is the closest to real grief I've ever felt.

So I was friends with a girl I'll call Nancy from about 6th grade until I was about 31. We became best friends after High School. My family didn't think much of her, she got pregnant young, dropped out of HS and was pretty trashy. So I began dating my now Husband when I was 31. That's when she became super jealous and tried to throw a wedge between me and my man. She was saying horrible things and was trying to break us up. I ended our friendship. She tried her hardest to contact my family and friends through social media and get me back. I changed my number and blocked her on everything.
Fast forward to now. I have re-connected with my childhood best friend, let's call her Tracy, who I did everything with from birth until about mid high school. We grew up on the same block and were thick as thieves. In High school we had different friend groups and grew apart. Nancy and Tracy knew each other but didn't like each other in HS. I recently was contacted by Tracy saying she would love to get together however she just married Nancy's brother Ralph (I swear this is legit). Tracy and Ralph have a very strained relationship with Nancy and her (and Ralphs) mother. They are nasty and jealous of the newly married couple. So it's not like Nancy would have anything to do with my meet up with Tracy. My husband wants nothing to do with Nancy, she gave him stress and PTSD over everything that happened. I feel that I have to come clean to my husband and tell him that Tracy and Ralph are married but I'm scared of his reaction. I don't feel like he will be happy about my contact with Tracy at all.

I know that there is way more to a person than looks. However, in an oddly romantic way I always wanted my SO to find me beautiful. 

I’ll admit I knew I wasn’t what she expected irl. We met on tinder and I’ve been told I’m hotter in pictures. I even told her that’s it’s okay if she finds me average, or at least at first.

She has told me she considers herself the “hot one”. She recently told me that on the first date she considered me “not ugly” and figured she’d still get laid since I have a nice body. She told me this after I made a self deprecating joke about my appearance. When I seemed upset, she told me that she “thought I liked brutal honesty”, and that was what I liked. 

It has started to bother me, because of my own insecurity, and also due to the fact that she’s been lying to me about my appearance since we got together.

Hello,

I'm 20 this year, and it seems that my mum still treats me as a 6 year old child. I do not drink, nor do I smoke. I barely go out at night, and even if I do, it's with a few friends my mum knows personally, and I ALWAYS return home before 12 (latest), and usually will be home before 10pm.

I decided to type this post, because I really need advice on how to get my mum to not be that controlling. I text my mum often when I'm out, and I update her on where I am and who I'm with whenever I go out late.

Recently, I went out at 7pm to meet a friend who has been studying overseas, and only comes back once a year. We had so much fun talking and chilling that I only left the place at 11:15pm or so. I also walked my friend to the bus stop that she needed to go in order to go home, as she can't really remember much about our country since she only comes back once a year. After walking my friend, I went to my bus stop, and got on my bus. I recall it was 11:30pm. The bus is only 15min away from my place, and then I have to walk a small walk to get home. My mum starts blowing up my phone, giving me missed calls, texting me repeatedly that it's late and it's not safe. My country is famous for being a safe country, and it is extremely safe for a girl to walk home at night. She even got my dad to send me a text about how I should think about their feelings. But I really don't get it??? I text her often to update her on my location, and I am sure I'll get home before 12? I was hanging with friends my mum knows personally, and she knows very well that I'm not the type to stay out late. Guess what, she waited for me at the bus stop I was supposed to alight from, and starts giving me the silent treatment. When we get home, she starts nagging, and I try to reason with her. After a while, I felt that I was a bit harsh, so I tried to start some small talk, and she started saying things like, 'don't talk to me, after the attitude you just showed me.', 'you're so rude to me, I'm your MUM. You're going to regret this when I'm gone'. LITERALLY DRIVES ME NUTS

Imagine this - your mum starts blowing up your phone at 11pm, knowing full well you're safe with your friends in their house, and screaming at you, asking if you know how late it is. Telling you how dangerous the outside world is, when our country is top 10 in terms of safety. I was really close to home?? To get home, all I need is to hop on a bus for 15min.

It stresses me out, because I know I have done nothing wrong. I do not party, I do not go to the club, I do not smoke, and I do not drink. All I do is I literally buy boba tea, sit in a cafe, chat with my friends all day long and spend less than 20 bucks. My mum scares me sometimes. She seems like she's really unusually obsessed with me, and can't let me go. My mum demands that I ask a boy if he's a Christian before proceeding to date him. My mum guilt trips me everyday, and tells me that I have to be nice to her before she dies. I hate how she always uses the idea of death. Someone please advice me. I am really at my wit's end. I have done everything I possibly can.",09Jan2019,1

432,"This may not be the best avenue for this type of question but for as long as i can remember, there hasn't really been many nightmares I've experienced in my adult life.  Definitely none that stuck with me, or woke me up abruptly in the middle of the night like this one.  

It's brief.  *I'm driving down a dark road, seemingly in the ""bad side of town"" in a random city at a random place in the world.  I'm driving (29/M) and my little sister (25/F) is in the passenger seat.  It seems like it's late at night, as there is not much activity.  We drive by two strange looking people (women maybe, I can't quite recall) looking very out of place just standing there staring at us as we drive by.  They are wearing, like, white dresses of some kind.  It just stood out to me because of how out of place they seemed dressed like that on an otherwise empty side street in the middle of the night.  They stared as we drove by and I was fixated on them too, looking back as I was driving.  Out of nowhere I hear this bizarre scream, almost sounding like a scream I myself would do when trying to be funny.  Definitely not the haunting sounds you'd expect from a nightmare scenario like this, but nonetheless, it's very creepy given the context and it's very loud.  Something comes flying towards my car out of nowhere, almost as if it was in front of the vehicle and I didn't see it.  It flies by my window and is illuminated by some light obviously not coming from my car.  I can't describe to you what it was, it was like a little green alien looking animal that I want to say (my memory is faded here too as to exactly how it looked).  At that moment, I felt so much terror and my sister began screaming, I immediately sped up and rushed to the end of the street heading directly for like a fence of some kind (the road splits right and left, and forward is no longer an option).  I come to a rumbling and uncomfortable halt, but I manage to stop dead in the middle of the intersection before crashing.*  

That's when I immediately woke up, and checked the time.  It was sometime between 3 and 4 am.  I remember genuinely feeling afraid of going back to sleep because I was so filled with terror even after waking up.  I had remembered the dream just as vividly as I have described it above, and the memory never left me.  I want to reiterate that I DO NOT REMEMBER DREAMS, EVER.  Very, very rarely.  And never this in detail.  I eventually most of fallen back asleep but after that moment I just know I kept waking up throughout the night and especially in the early morning before I normally get up for work.  I felt serious anxiety, couldn't get comfortable, couldn't sleep.  I almost felt like I might be having a heart attack, that's how uncomfortable I was.  I borderline called out of work, but eventually decided to head in.  

My day has been relatively normal since then, but still, when I think about the events of this morning I get anxiety and feel slightly uncomfortable.  People have remarked on how tired I look today and it brings me back to the memory of this morning and my dream.  

Is this just something that normally happens to people and something I shouldn't be looking too much into? Why today of all days do I remember this dream so vividly and why has it had such a lasting effect on me? My best explanation for the dream was that I typically fall asleep with my Netflix on, but I remembered my little sister having complained that I take up a spot and she can't get on and watch sometimes.  So I thought of her right before turning off my TV for bed last night.  I've been re watching Dexter. too, for what that's worth.

435,"Hi Reddit Fam!

For the past 3 years, I have been researching/sourcing/designing a line of winter coats for men and women. I'm proud to say we are now done, and are slated to launch winter 2019/20(next winter).

The problem we are having is our logo. For now, we have chosen a blue reflective armband, with our logo centered.

Someone has pointed out to me that the armband is reminiscent of the Nazi armbands.

I'm taking to Reddit to ask you; is a BLUE armband (in the same upper arm location and size as the Nazi armband) with a different logo too similar to the Nazi armband? (which was RED)

Is it too much that people wouldn't wear a coat because of it? Should we get rid of the reflective armband entirely?

I’m comfortable on the phone with my family and boyfriend, but not even my friends. I prefer to text or use social media, in rare cases I talk on the phone but even then it doesn’t last longer than 5 minutes.

My heart starts to race every time a call comes on and at times I just shut off my phone when I get too overwhelmed. I stutter A TON over the phone, I get cold shivers when I talk and my chest starts to really tighten.

I don’t even like calling people such as placing an order, asking what are the hours for your store today or tomorrow... I’m not sure what’s wrong with me. I am getting ready to be trained on the phones and my chest has been tightening for a while now and I honestly don’t think I can do it.

I’ve tried to prepare by talking to myself and having some form of phone etiquette but I just can’t. I tried doing exercises where I call people but I would just hang up the phone if I find that it’s too difficult for me.

My job normally doesn’t have much calls which should be great but I sincerely cannot be on phones. I feel the my job would be in more jeopardy if I were to be on phones, I can’t control myself sometimes, ESPECIALLY difficult customers. I never know what to say and I start to cry.

How can I reach out to my manager about this issue? Mainly we do emails and get maybe 3-5 calls each day.

438,"So I'm planning a meal out with some friends next week for my birthday. There are 20 of us going so it's a big ask for the small restaurant to begin with. Of the people coming there are some couples, couples which I consider both of them as good friends, hence the invites. Others I've invited have partners but know we hang out without them so are coming solo and haven't assumed.

One of my friends replied with 'we' can do the date but not the time and suggested a later time of joining. I invited the friend as 'can you come' not 'you and x' or 'you both'. It's been assumed I am extending the invite. I don't really get on with the partner and don't consider them a close friend of mine. My other friends have point blank said to me they don't like them all that much. I'd rather use the space at the table to invite another friend I really want there.

What do I do?

I can't say it's no partners as there are already some there?

I cannot move the table to a different time (it's the partner who can't make the time I think). Do I just say well come anyway?

I don't want them arriving mid way through a meal as that's a bit odd?

Do I just be honest and possibly upset them?

She literally hates waking up to the point where she gives herself only the exact amount of time to get ready and go to work, meaning if there is any hitch in the morning she is late. 
It’s clear almost every morning is so difficult and dreadful for her. I feel like the ten alarms she sets every morning only compound her stress. I am wondering the best way to wake her in the morning so she can have a better start to her day.

I personally resent people who keep me awake when I’m falling asleep like the disdain is unparalleled, I wonder if she does something similar for people who wake her up. 
I also know the biggest point of contention between her and her mom when at home falls to noisiness and inconsideration in the mornings.
Any advice is greatly appreciated although lifestyle changes that follow as ‘go to bed earlier’ might not help her, she is an individual and I hope she can make her own decisions about when to fall asleep.

445,"Hi all,

I'm not a person to post on social forums like this, but I really need advice. I am truly appalled at how I’ve been treated.  American Airlines has the worst customer service of any airline I've flown with.  


My situation: On September 27th, 2018, after months of research to get a good deal, I purchased an American Airlines ticket (flight AA 2617 from Dulles/Wash - Dallas, and AA 1215 Dallas - Puerto Vallarta) for $317.74. 

This flight was scheduled to depart on December 28th. The reason for my trip was to attend my best friend’s wedding on Dec 29th in Yelapa, Mexico.

On December 28th I woke up at 3:00am for my 6:26am flight and received a text from AA at 1:52am saying my flight had been canceled. **No explanation was provided.** There was a phone number listed (800-223-5436). I called and was on hold for over an hour, while frantically looking up alternative flights. **No one ever answered and I never spoke to an AA representative.** 

At 3:56am I received another text saying that AA had rebooked me for a flight departing on December 30th; TWO full days after my original flight, which would make me miss my friend’s wedding.

 After an airline cancels a flight, it is the airline's responsibility to find them another flight that departs that same day. **Being rebooked for a flight departing on December 30th, two days after I was originally to depart, is an absurd, unviable, and unacceptable “solution.”** 

Therefore, I was FORCED to buy a far more expensive ticket from another airline so that I wouldn’t miss my friend’s wedding. **I was forced to buy a ticket for $1,001.63 from Air Canada Rouge. Please see the Air Canada Rouge receipt attached.** 

It was then 4:45am and I raced to the airport for my new 6:45am flight. At this point I had suffered considerable emotional distress, not to mention the new hefty financial burden. But at that point, what other option did I have? I had already spent money on lodgings, currency exchange, etc - not to mention, had made a commitment to my friend that I would be there with her on her special day.

Now American Airlines is refusing to reimburse me for the more expensive flight I was forced to purchase due to their negligence. **I am asking to be reimbursed $683.89 - which is the difference between the original, cheaper AA flight I RELIED on taking and the expensive Air Canada Rouge flight I was FORCED to take.**  To a big corporation, that amount of money is nothing -- to me, it's almost an entire month of rent. 

I have been a loyal and frequent American Airlines customer. This is unethical, immoral, and bad business. I am shocked at how I have been treated. 

My emails to customer relations - AA employees Pedro Saren and Sarah Lear - are going unanswered. I called the customer service number and received no help. The woman said her department couldn’t help me because my issue was a matter of customer relations not customer service, so I asked to be transferred. She said that wasn’t possible as there is no phone number for customer relations, just an email. Then the woman wished me a good day and hung up. 

I then received an email from AA today (1/9/2019) saying that my refund is complete. **But why am I only being refunded $253.24 when my flight was $317.74?** This is absolutely inadequate. My refund is NOT complete!

Furthermore,  the $100 eVoucher that Pedro offered as a token of goodwill is not nearly enough considering this entire ordeal. **I respectfully request to be reimbursed $683.89 to compensate me for the difference in the two flights. I also request to be refunded the full $317 that I paid for my original AA flight for services not rendered. This is the only fair solution.**

&amp;#x200B;

# My question to the Reddit community is this -- how do I best go about getting my full refund and reimbursement? Does anyone know anyone who works at American Airlines that I can speak with? It's impossible getting these people to respond to me! Any help is so greatly appreciated. I'm currently out a lot of money because of all this, and I really can't afford it. 

# I've started posting on American Airlines' Facebook and Instagram accounts, too. Any other suggestions welcome. Thank you!

452,"Hello!

So I am in my mid 20s, and though I have worked a few jobs before now this my first time that I have a degree and am entering a more white collar workforce, and am in a “highly skilled” job market, if that makes sense.

My last contracted position ended in the beginning of November, so I began looking for and applying to jobs in October. (I didn’t know at the time that wasn’t nearly far enough in advance.)

Since this is my first time looking for the aforementioned type of work, I had very little idea how to navigate this (and my family is working class so I don’t really have anyone to turn to for advice on this.)

I didn’t even start hearing back from anywhere I applied to until the end of November/early December, and now I’m 3 interviews deep into 3 different positions right now.

I know the holidays probably set back these places search processes, it’s just super discouraging to have applied to 60+ jobs, and only hear back from a few who are now putting me threw the ringer!

I’m grateful I’m being considered for the positions that I am, but I have yet to ask about salary, benefits, their timeline for picking someone, or frankly how goddamn long the rest of this process is going to take.

I was basically living paycheck to paycheck before now, because of car and school and phone and groceries and rent payments...the list goes on. I saved a bit of money to try and be proactive, but I was not ready to be unemployed for what has now turned into 2 and a half months!

Additionally, I’ve been traveling for these interviews, so the part time jobs I’ve applied for have turned me down, citing my unpredictable schedule.

So, how do I ask these jobs I’m far along in the process with what exactly comes next? I don’t know how to do this in a professional way that doesn’t also give away my pure desperation.

I have an issue that is really bothering me. I don't know how to deal with this issue and it's tearing me apart. 

I'm a compulsive lier.

I lie about everything and nobody knows the truth. I like so much I'm forgetting the truth. My relationship with my fiancee is forged from lies, my friends don't know anything about me and everyone believes the same thing.

I'm too far into the lies to tell the truth.

The hole is too deep and it's slowly caving in. I love the woman I'm engaged to but she loves the people I tell her I am. She knows NOTHING about me my family or my background. I feel like if I told her the truth she would most definitely leave me. But I don't blam her.

It's killing me slowly

I've thought about killing myself or faking me death maybe running away from all of this shit. Maybe starting over but if I was to do that I know I would end up right where I left off in a year or two. 

I've lost all hope.

I've tried going to therapist for this but it never seems to work. I liked when I was younger as a defense mechanism but it's gotten out of control and I've resulted to just internally eating myself. I know that I will end up in a ditch dead. It's a very strong feeling of hopelessness and self destruction

456,"The first time I saw this dog I thought it might be a stray. It had no collar and was scared to come to me. I was walking my chihuahua at the time and this dog seemed to be about the same size. I finally got it to come over to me and the dog was really sweet and friendly. Him and my dog got along fine and they were just running around sniffing stuff while I stood there trying to figure out what to do.

About 15 minutes go by and I hear someone that sounds like they’re calling for a dog. There’s two voices a guy and girl and they’re yelling “Buck!” The dog in front of me seemed to not even acknowledge that someone was calling it, it didn’t seem to know its name. So I walked over with my dog and theirs. They had been calling their dog from their apartment door on the second floor. They didn’t even walk down the stairs to call their dog. Didn’t even bother leaving their apartment until I walked up and said “is this your dog?” He said yes and the dog ran past him upstairs and into the apartment. 

I thought that would be the last time that I saw Buck but no. The next time was a day or two later I was walking back from the mailbox and I see this dog running through the parking lot yet again. While I’m trying to call him over to me some other girl pulls up in her car and asks if it’s my dog. I tell her no but I’ve see it before and apparently so has she. She told me she had almost the exact same situation. That the dog was running around the parking lot with out a collar. 

We went to go knock on the door of the apartment the dog owners live in and they didn’t answer. We knocked four or five times over an hour and nothing. They had left their dog outside in a parking lot with no collar and then just left their apartment. We decided we couldn’t just leave the dog outside so I left a sticky note with my phone number on their door and brought the dog back with me to my apartment. 

As soon as we got inside this dog starts peeing on everything he sees. My boyfriend says we can’t keep the dog here if he’s going to pee on all of our stuff and I agree, so he suggests we take this dog down to the apartment office. All three ladies that work there are total dog people and they should know what to do. So we bring the dog to the office and tell the lady the situation. She seems pretty upset by it and says she will contact the owners. (Also at that point I took my phone number off of their door). 

So I figure that once the dog owners get their dog back from the office that they wouldn’t let the dog out like that again. Apparently I thought too highly of these people. The next day I’m out walking my dog again there’s Buck running around the parking lot. I brought him to the office again, there were two different ladies working this time but they knew right away what a apartment number this dog was from. 

So my question is, what should I do if I see this dog running around again without a collar on and no owners in sight? The dog doesn’t look neglected, it seems to be a healthy weight, nails are relatively trimmed, and he smells like he’s gotten a bath recently. I’ve only seen the owner one time but they seem to think that the apartment parking lot/leasing office is their own personal doggy day care. 

I was toying with the idea of brining it to a shelter but the thought of taking a dog from a home and putting it in a shelter really upsets me. I thought about just taking the dog but he literally pees on everything in his sight as soon as he gets inside and plus I have my own dog and a cat to worry about. My plan right now is to just keep bringing the dog to the leasing office but it feels like there should be something more I could do. 

Any ideas?

457,"So I’ve been working for this company for 5 months now (almost 6). It was really good in the beginning but now there are some major red flags and it’s making me reconsider working here. Here they are below.

1. The Vice President, my direct boss, is incredible manipulative and LOVES playing games. I don’t like this. For example, he will call one coworker A asking what time coworker B came in. Then will call coworker B asking what coworker A came in. He will ask multiple people the same question to see if he gets the same answer. He will call my coworker and gossip about other coworkers. Then he will call another coworker to gossip about the first coworker. 

He had cameras installed outside of our office without our knowledge and would call if someone left for lunch for an extended period of time. I had drinks with my coworker and he said “you look stressed. You should grab a drink at______ (place we were at last night) and we did some Instagram digging and found out he had a secret account that he’s been viewing us and other coworkers content on. That’s creepy.



2. I asked for two days off, a Thursday and a Friday for an extended weekend. This is the first time I’ve asked for a day off. I’ve been working 11 hour days (I’m on salary, I don’t get OT), sometimes weekends. And my VP made a HUGE deal about it. Saying I’m a new employee and shouldn’t feel entitled to time off. He sent an email out to my team asking their opinion of me leaving the project for two days and then said “if you value work ethic and deadlines you should cancel your trip” Excuse me? I’m a human being. I need time off for my mental health, I’m not a robot. And I only asked for TWO DAYS.


3. I was hired for a specific position. I told said VP in the interview that I don’t want to be pushed into any other positions as this is my niche and this is what I’m good at. He totally agreed. Then the project starts, we are short staffed, so I end up doing ALL of these tasks that are part of another position. As well as my original position tasks. (Hence the 11 hour days and weekends) This is my fault, I should have nipped that in the bud from the beginning. 

Anyway, I tell VP that the workload is too much and that I need the other tasks to be delegated elsewhere. He hires someone else for the team, but I’m still left with these tasks. I tell him AGAIN. He says the next person they hire will take those tasks away. So I wait. They hire someone ELSE. And then the VP says this person will take my original tasks (that I was hired for) and I will be left with the other tasks since I’m so good at them (that I shouldn’t have ever been doing and don’t want to do). WHAT??? 

So I firmly put my foot down and told them I’m not allowing that to happen. And right now it’s a wait and see approach. 





It kind of feels like punishment for going against the VP and taking the two days off. I don’t know if they’re trying to piss me off to quit or what. But I don’t understand that because I have incredible work ethic and have been making the company a LOT of money. And leaving after being with a company for 5 months doesn’t look good for my resume. But I feel very undervalued, insulted and unappreciated.

What should I do?

458,"Was a top student in school, and was widely touted to turn out to be a ""successful"" individual. Am very fickle-minded, lazy, and tend to procrastinate a lot. Always trying to find the least demanding way to get something done. Couldn't get into a college of my choice because I didn't prep for the entrances seriously enough, and had to settle for a mediocre private university. Pursued a bachelor's in Physics because that is what I wanted to do at that point but I soon  began to doubt whether I wanted to pursue a long-term career in the same. While I was consistently scoring top grades (without really working that hard and engaging with the material deeply), I began to doubt if I had it in me to succeed in the field. My interests gradually shifted to the environmental sciences, a field I've always had a genuine interest in. Landed a prestigious internship at a top research facility and worked on a cool project, decided to apply for Master's programs in environmental science and sustainability. However, now that I'm in the process of completing my applications I'm beginning to doubt whether I've got the prerequisites I'll need to undertake the programme. I've got no formal experience studying social science during my undergrad, and I fear that I might not be able to cope with the social science components of the program despite the high degree of my interest in them. I'm second guessing my decision to switch fields now. I haven't applied for any physics programs, and neither am I ready to sit for physics entrance tests. My degree doesn't really garner decent job opportunities in my country, and I am feeling really confused about what I should do. I need to get my shit sorted fast and figure out what I need to do. 

I also think that I've got this bubble I'm living in where I'm ok academically, and I want to avoid putting myself in situations that genuinely challenge me for fear of failing and realising that I'm not as good as I and everyone else think after all. 

TLDR; lazy, fickle-minded Physics undergrad about to graduate, planning to switch to environmental science, second guessing my decisions, confused what to do. ",09Jan2019,1

461,"My mom has Alzheimer's and tons of other health issues like diabetes, stroke, etc. She keeps on scratching her body causing scabs and then scratching those scabs off which leads to recurrent cellulitis. She's gone into the hospital around 8 times in the last year and a half.

My dad has a stay at home job specifically to take care of her. But he just keeps on neglecting to make sure she gets a reasonable amount of showers each week (she usually gets one), she brushes her teeth at night, she changes her underwear, she puts medicine/bandages on her wounds to heal them, she has her compression leggings on to help with her blood flow, she has her nails trimmed so she can't scratch, she gets exercise, etc.

Instead, he just sits in his back office working, coming out occasionally for coffee, snacks, bathroom breaks, or lunch. She just sits all day, eats, uses the bathroom, watches TV at night, and goes to bed.

My dad also seems to not care about his health either. He had a heart attack a couple of years ago and he started eating healthier for around six months. Now, he has desserts every night and eats everything he's not supposed to, while not really exercising. 

Often, I am the one who ends up taking care of my mom with nail trimming, getting her medicine on her wounds, and taking her to the gym. I don't want to do that because I dont care about her since she was an abusive mother to me and I don't have a single fond memory of her. If I wasn't around she would have died by now.

What should I do?

Tldr. My dad doesn't adequately take care of my mom or himself and instead just lives to work, eat, and watch TV. And instead I usually take care of my mom.

462,"Small backstory, I’ve had a passion for a certain animal for as long as I can remember. Grew up really far away from that animal, one year ago I moved to the best place in the United States to see and study that animal. 
For this first summer I didn’t pursue a job with them, because you either need to have a lot of fancy science degrees (which I do not), or you need to weasel your way in through connections. So, I spent the summer getting connections and watching the animals on my own to get to know their habits better. 

Now, things are finally happening. An acquaintance, who moved here with fancy science degrees and had a job with the museum that runs everything, had to suddenly move away and asked if I would be interested in taking over a project she was working on, as an intern. I said absolutely! 

I’m more than happy to do the internship/volunteer projects because A. I enjoy doing anything to do with the animal and B. To weasel my way in. I’m hoping that if I can show dedication and do a good job I just might be offered further opportunities when the work is done. 

I go in soon to chat about it, I’m wondering what recommendations you might have as to questions I should ask, how much passion I should show (I want to obviously seem interested, but am scared that if I fully show how interested I am I’ll seem like an obsessed fan girl, and unprofessional, if that makes sense.) and any other tips for how to approach an internship!

463,"I'm not normally an anxious person. I manage my family's retail business. My dad owns the business. If you look at his car or areas in his home, that my mom doesn't have control over, it's extremely cluttered and disorganized. 

I don't know what his issue is but he loves to save everything and squirrel it away. He also doesn't like to organize and nothing is in a logical place. If there is an empty space on the wall he has to put up shelving or put up artwork. If there is empty space in the floor he has to put in shelves or a table. Unless you are barely able to move through a room or every space is filled up he isn't satisfied. It's like he feels safe surrounded by stuff and empty space scares him and is ""wrong.""

2/3 of the counter that runs from one end of the store to the other comes up to my chin. You have less than three feet of space in the ""employee area"" from the counter to the wall. For nintey percent of that ""employee area"" behind the counter you have a shelf running across the wall less than six feet off the floor. The shelf extends well over a foot off the wall. Then you have a bunch of one foot deep steel shelving on the wall in fifty percent of that ""employee area"" that runs from the floor up to that wall shelf.

I'm okay in that section when the shop is empty but when were busy it's filled with staff and customers. I can barely see over the counter and then i have this giant shelf looming over me loaded with stuff. Then for fifty percent of the ""employee area"" you have less than two feet between the counter and the steel shelves.

 I've never had issues with tight spaces or claustrophobia but working in this section gives me a lot of anxiety. To be honest if I can I'll work in the section that doesn't have tall counters and put staff in the tall counter section. I've brought this issue up with my father because he's semi retired and I'm working double his hours during busy shifts and he tells me I'm insane and refuses to make changes. He's also elderly so I think he likes having stuff in arms reach and this set up does that. Hes never worked during busy times so he has no idea how it feels in a store loaded with staff and employees. When he works in our business he sits in a chair behind the counter and literally doesn't move unless he's helping a customer.

Im going to be going to beauty school to get an esthisiology degree so i can work as a freelance makeup artist while i pursue a bachelors degree.

I kind of have this gut feeling that i should pursue a degree in history (or math) and education because i used to really want to be a teacher and all of a sudden i feel like that's what i want to do again. 

I had originally thought to try and finish my communications degree but it really no longer interests me. I also thought of possibly doing a business degree seeing as i have an etsy shop but im not sure if I'll ever actually want to do something business related as my career.

I love history and Im really good at math and i used to dream about being a teacher and i chickened out of an education degree when i was in my freshman year and started to go downhill mentally (especially with my anxiety).

465,"I’m in a friends group where one of them is someone that I used to hang out with alone sometimes since she used to invite me out a lot. The thing is that whenever I talk to our other friend who is my best friend of many years, she just pulls up her headphones and gets antisocial until someone starts a conversation with her. She used to fish for compliments from me a lot which was weird, but not anymore. She also used to say that she suspected me of being a lesbian until I used to have a crush on a guy. because of my interests in girly cartoons and once told me that she was scared of probably being one herself. I said that there’s nothing wrong with being gay and she got mad ”But I don’t want to be one myself”

We don’t talk that much lately because she’s been acting weird since we had a fight a few months ago where she would go too far in ”teasing” which had turned into verbal abuse at that point and I lashed out at her. She later apologised blaming ”anxiety” which also was weird but I still forgave her. Since then, she’s been obsessed with the relationship between me and my best friend, often asking about whether or not I know where he is and when the two of them has something in common she’s always up in my face about it. 

The two of us would always pick up food before meeting the group, but she’s been telling me that she’s not coming for a while now, but litterally always shows up after all. Lately, she’s been avoiding me in school and I’ve been avoiding her back since she obviously doesn’t want to talk to me. Yet, the friends group will meet up again soon so I walked up to her today and said hi, but she avoided eye contact when answering.

466,"Here's the backstory: I handed in a lab last semester and didn't receive my final grade in the course, I found out a couple of days ago about the misconduct when they told me about my meeting for it. The plagiarism was 22% similarity on turn it in and for the similar parts, I cited the article. The professor I had the meeting with today was not the actual prof, just another one in the department who's known for being pretty crappy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I walked into the meeting at 10:56, it was at 11, and  he said ""you're really early"" I said ""I know I'm sorry, I can go outside and wait in the hall for you"" he said ""no i'll just have to finish what I was doing later, I haven't had time to look over your case yet"". He then proceeds to grab my lab and say ""your parents wouldn't be too proud of this, and I doubt you're going to tell them"" (both of my parents are dead). I told him no they wouldn't. So instead of even thoroughly looking over my lab, he's like I can see what you've done here, and all you've done was taken their ideas and place words between them to try to make turn it in not find it. I told him that wasn't what I was trying to do, and my intention was never to play the ideas off like their mine which is why I cited the journal. He told me he doesn't actually know my intentions so we can't talk about them. The conversation continues, with me apologizing and saying I realize this is bad, and I'm in my 7th year of my undergrad, have written hundreds of labs and this is the first time I've ever been in this position. I asked him if it's even worth it to him to explain my circumstances and he said no. He gave me a zero on the lab, which took my mark from a B+ to a C+, and I started crying. I told him I was finally in a position this semester where my grades were high enough to apply for masters and he said ""if you were in your masters you'd say the same thing except that you were going to your phd"" I gave up at this point, and said I've come to you and admitted I was wrong, this is my first time experiencing this and I think a zero is completely unfair. He gave me a 50% mark deduction on my lab instead.

&amp;#x200B;

While parts of me do think a 50% deduction is fair, I also think 22% similarity, where it even included ""diffuses across the eggshell along their partial pressure gradients"" which is exactly what this lab was about, does not deserve me dropping 10% in a course for a mistake I've owned up to. I was diagnosed with ADHD last year, which was causing me to receive 60-low 70% grades for \~6 years of my undergrad. I've been working my ass off with this diagnosis now and my recent grades are high 80's, and I can finally apply to graduate school and include a note about why my grades were low before. I will now have a terrible mark in between the 5 good grades that I've received since the diagnosis. This 50% reduction is more than just one course for me this could literally be the difference of if I continue my education past my undergrad or not. I work full time in order for me to continue to attend university full time all because of how badly I want to continue my education to a masters level. I can't stay the 8th year in my undergrad to complete more courses and continue only making money to attend university. 

&amp;#x200B;

I plan on having a meeting with the dean, not only in hopes of changing the punishment but just to let him know how unprofessional and disrespectful this professor was.

467,"If you look at my post history you will see that I posted here previously about an issue with training new co-workers but having a very small desk (so small that the person has to basically sit behind me). I had requested a larger desk in a different part of the office away from where the other large desks are due to a VERY LOUD coworker. I told management that I would not be training new people until that changed and they were fine with it. 


Also, training is NOT listed in my job description; I looked at it this morning several times.


Now there are even more new employees. Management has one sitting with me to ""observe"" and ask questions. I asked if this was training and they said no because I won't be filling out any forms verifying that they are meeting expectations, but it's essentially the same as when I trained before.


I'm not sure what to do now. I have already let them know I wouldn't be training new employees without a bigger desk; but I feel like they are being sneaky by calling it ""observing"". I asked who the trainer is going to be/is and they said it's ""still up in the air"". 

I want to tell them by the end of the week that I will not be doing any more ""observing"" due to the same issue with training- the size of the desk.

My boyfriend is concerned I will be fired for non-compliance, but as I said before training or ""observation"" is not listed anywhere.

473,"Being forced to learn a language in school is utterly bullshit. While I will agree learning a new language can help one's education,(as is learning how to code computer applications, do brain surgery, etc.) it should not be forced upon. That's like saying learning to be a doctor, a mechanic, a pilot, etc should all be mandatory because it'll improve your education.

While America has no ""primary language"" The most spoken language is English, so therefore technically it's the primary language (even though technically there isn't one.) if you walk outside and talk to your neighbor, they will more than likely speak English. When you read textbooks from class, they are more than likely to be English. When you go to the DMV, they will more than likely talk to you in English, etc. 

Why are kids forced to learn a foreign language to satisfy others? I remember back in high school I was FORCED to take Spanish. Me and other kids were having a hard time, well this Mexican lady was able to speak fluent Spanish (Surprise surprise.) The teacher then says ""you guys should pay more attention and be  like her!"" Excuse me bitch? The reason she's able to come in your class and pass with an A is because her primary language is Spanish.

The U.S constitution was written in English, we are mostly taught English in schools and as our primary language ever since kindergarten, so why are others and myself included was forced or even still to this day, forced to learn a foreign language? If you wanna learn Spanish or another language go ahead. If you live in America and wanna speak Spanish or another language, I'm completely fine with that. What I'm not fine with is people forcing me and others to learn another language when the most common and used language in America is English. I do not go to Mexico or Germany (where their primary language is either Spanish or German.) and I do not force their education system, businesses, etc. To learn my language. If I go to a foreign country, I will learn their language, and that's how it should be for America.

Again, I'm fine with people wanting to learn or speak another language, I'm not okay being forced todo so because of illiterate people coming to America knowing very little to no English at all, and we're forced to adapt for them. I would like to hear your guys opinions and insight and if you agree or disagree, however, if you are going to agree or disagree, please be at least someone intelligent, open minded, and be prepared to have a debate.

476,"Hi,

I (25/M) am facing an issue at my job with my team member, and currently not sure how to handle it. 

There is a girl in my team, who I believe was very interested in me when I joined the company last year in July. She started trying to get close to me, always initiating conversations, flirting, touching me, trying to initiate eye contact when we were in the same room and saying double meaning jokes. At the beginning, I was friendly, thinking it's just her style, but then for me it became apparent she is interested (someone else had noticed also - but the person already left the company). I started ignoring her, rejecting her, which she ignored first and kept approaching me, but later she also got mad. I've confronted her twice about her behavior, and after the second time she accused me that I am interested in her and that's why I'm mad... which is false, I was trying to keep my distance because I was not interested. I reported her two of my managers (one is my boss), but she had no idea. Then things cooled down around the beginning of November, but as it turned out only because she started hitting on another team member (who she tried to kiss). The other guy also rejected her, asked my advice about the situation (as he heard I had a similar issue), and I told him to report her too, as this behavior is unacceptable. The managers confronted her about all of this, I told them everything and I thought we have settled this once and for all. This was right before the holidays, mid December.

Now after the holidays, what I see is she is not showing any remorse at all and my boss and one other person from the office (who she started talking to) started acting cold with me. Also I keep seeing she is going out for conversations with my boss and having a discussion with another team member, suddenly whispering about something while I am there, then later they start talking in a normal way about a neutral topic.

I've made one mistake in the past when she sent me a message which was written like she rejected me, and as I was reading it in the morning dizzy, I just replied something like ""yes, whatever, just keep your distance please, also I believe we are on the same page as I am not interested neither"". I should have asked her why she is sending me a message like that.

Now at this point I am becoming paranoid and I get very mad if my reputation gets bad while I did not anything bad, and I am afraid she is spreading lies behind my back (I believe she is a very good liar and she lied about others before, which we've proved with the other guy mentioned), and there are actually people who believe her lies. I think she is trying to completely turn this around, to something like ""I was upset because I got jealous when she started hitting on the other guy"", or I don't even know, the other guy already told me she accused me of this. I hate seeing people becoming cold with me, it's going to affect my performance, let alone relationships with other. I have past conversations and evidence she was flirting with me and touching me.

Shall I just let this be? How should I handle this now? Maybe it's just me who is overthinking or overreacting, please let me know then. I'm just afraid the more I'm going to wait, the worse it's going to be. She is the most unattractive person in the office and I don't want people to think that we had any kind of affair, though I admit this is my problem, maybe I should just ignore this thought. Also the manager I reported her (not my boss) warned me that she will possibly try to turn this situation around.",09Jan2019,1

478,"First, I'll give some information. I'll also use fake names. 

In october I joined a band in my music school. I play the piano there. It's a simple band that was run by this teacher, that I will call Rose. Other members of the band are this guitarist and the main singer - Amy, the drummer - Anthony and the violinist - Dave. I didn't know these people, because we all went to different schools. I believe, that they are also older than me. They have been going to the music school for much longer than me and they are better at music than me also, so fitting in was hard for me. At first I was very excited and happy to be in a real band, but now I see it more as a chore than a fun activity. We already had two concerts together. 

I made a list you reasons to quit/stay in the band. It was easier to write my reasons this way. 

Reasons to quit:
Amy, the main part of the band, is a very slow singer. She never looks happy and she always looks like a zombie and everyone can hear that clearly. She pulls the whole band back, but Rose loves her and doesn't say anything. 
Rose, the teacher, doesn’t help me out at all and I have to write down all the sheet music myself, since I don't know, how to play by chords. 
The band practice is very late and I come back home around 7-8pm. I have barely any time to do my homework. My egzams are comming and I might need some more time to get ready. 
All the songs are lyrical, slow and often written by artists I don't like.
My parents have to drive me 20km to the school. At first there was only one lesson per week, now Rose wants to make two. 
I feel like Rose doesn't respect me. She does praise me, but more often I feel, like she belittles me for not knowing chords or other musical theory. 
Rose can play the piano herself. 

Reasons to stay:
My main music teacher is very happy that I'm in a band. 
Rose has a big concert planned in spring and wants me to play three songs then. We already have all the songs planned out. 
I might regret it. 



I really don't know what to do and how to say to Rose, that I want to quit. They were searching for a pianist very hard, since the last one had to go to an another city or something. I don't know if I should quit, when there is a concert planned already.

I currently just started back to a different university. This one being a public and much smaller and local than the other one. I still don’t fully like it here. I’m still very un sure as to what I want to do. Whether that be stay here and get some sort of degree or find something else to satisfy me. I want to find something that I like and enjoy, not something that I will hate for the rest of my life.

I’ll give you a little about me so someone could possibly figure me out better than i can figure myself out.

I absolutely love almost all sports. Hockey, football, baseball, cheerleading, basketball (sort of), soccor (only playing it, hate watching it), bowling, Lacrosse, and a few others. I have been apart of a team for each one of these besides soccor and lacrosse at a competitive level. I have also umpires baseball for nearly 8 years.
I also love computers and video games. I’m the person all my family and friends call for their tech support.

Im so stuck right now and just need even the slightest advice at the moment.

484,"Let me start off with saying I've been stuck in mid-level management hell with the same company for years and with a predominantly female staff, I have undoubtedly witnessed some amazingly petty shenanigans. 

These coworkers of mine are part of a small group I work directly with and oversee. Co-worker A has been an issue almost since day 1, and has always found a reason to be upset with co-worker B.  I hadn't thought much about it since I've seen this kind of thing work itself out before. A couple of days ago co-worker A is with another employee in our break area trying to track down co-worker B's boyfriend on social media because she's decided co-worker B has ""crossed her"" and she's ready to blow the lid off of this and attempt to destroy their relationship. Given the details of their situation I have absolutely no doubt the truth would come out about who messaged this guy no matter how sneaky she tries to be. Normally I would keep out of this kind of mess but as a manager I have to wonder what kind of issues this could start in my business and how to handle it before it blows up.

My mother has always been very overprotective. She’s also the type to take what facebook says as gospel.
She’s also extremely self centred, and from talking to my siblings, she is the only in the house to cause any arguments.

She controls my financial savings accounts. I set these up when i was 17 (currently 21), and i have a rather large sum in it. She always hounds me to give a large portion of my wages into this, which i understand as i have no other real expenses. I know she wouldn’t steal money, but i would rather have the account completely under my control
I asked her why couldn’t I have it, and her reasoning was that my cousin had the same thing, and blew it all.
I get the point, but i’m very not like my cousin.

Anyways, she needs to know where i am 24/7. You know that app on your phone which links with your families to show you where they are?

We had a shouting match for three hours when i left it.

She also doesn’t allow me and my gf to sleep in MY double bed in my room. She insists i sleep on the couch when my gf comes to my house.

There has never been this issue in my gf’s house.

These are the main issues i want resolved, but i want to do it peacefully if possible. I don’t want to move out, as i do want to save for a house, and renting is expensive dead money.

489,"Before I get into it I'd like to say, that I'm grateful for everything my parents do to me, because while we're not even an upper middle class family, I'm still a pretty spoilt kid. If they don't want to give me more money, I accept it, I just don't understand their logic, and want to hear other's opinions on the matter. We live in Hungary, but I'm converting everything into dollars for better understanding.

I get 7 dollars every month from my parents. They said that if I'd buy my food from the school cafeteria, I'd make everyone's life easier. They would be willing to give me a dollar to buy food every day. That means 5 dollars per week, so I can assume that they can afford giving out 27 dollars a month without any trouble at all. I don't eat at school. I don't get hungry, plus I'm on a diet, so I don't even want to eat pointlessly. But seeing that they have no problem giving out that much money I assumed they wouldn't mind giving it to me as pocket money

Now I didn't go up to my mom demanding that she pay me 30 dollars monthly because she can afford it, but I asked her if she can give me another 7 dollars per month and she straight up refused my offer.

Am I wrong for asking for that raise? I really don't want to seem like a spoilt asshole, but as I said I just don't understand why I was refused.

490,"Little backstory first. While I was still in high school and looking at college options ,a close relative offered to pay for my education as he knew my family couldn't afford it. We accepted, but it came at a price.  Constantly being bombarded with awkward questions, weird requests from them. Asking for money for the things they said they would cover has been overcomplicated everytime.

I (19M) am currently living in a foreign country. I make enough to feed myself and pay some bills but not nearly enough to also cover rent. 

Recently, when I called my sponsor to let him know how much the rent was going to be for the next few months, he asked why was I telling him that, and that we had to pay it ourselves. (we have been at this point for close to half a year).

Now I want to be honest. I'm not a good student. I'm not very smart. I don't really grasp concepts and I tend to be very lazy.  I recently started my bachelors and I realize that it was one of the worst options I could have chosen.
I want to change it or drop out. 
Problems with changing : one years tuition + rent wasted. Don't think my sponsor would approve and would stop paying for everything. Family relationships will get messed up. And even disregarding all that, i honestly don't know what I would go for as even after research I haven't found a profession for me. Yeah I have hobbies like shooting some hoops and all those basic everyone hobbies but nothing that I actually want to or can work with.
Problems with dropping out : lots of the above things, no idea what id do instead and i feel like my life will just be wasted away.
Problems with continuing: 4 years of not knowing when my sponsor could stop sponsoring me, and nearly having to beg for money. Getting a degree in something i hate. Not even sure i can get that degree. 

I am honestly lost and I don't know what to do.",09Jan2019,1

I found a room for rent on FB Marketplace, and am going to go meet the folks and see the room in a few days.

493,"Hey Reddit definitely a burner account here,

This is a long one, although it could be longer. I’ll try to be brief but thorough. 

I recently moved across the country with my long term girlfriend for a change in scenery. I’m originally from somewhere uninteresting and now live in a beautiful area and awesome city.

Some quick background on my professional life. I have a bachelors degree and have about 3 years of corporate work experience. I’m pretty young I suppose so this is all that I have so far out of college. I work in account management and sales. I’m pretty well off skills-wise and have always succeeded at jobs, even prior to my most recent corporate job. 

Back to the point at hand.. I interview strong and sure enough I received an offer from the very first company that I sent my resume to. At this point I was still interviewing with other companies but given the need to respond to this offer, the timelines didn’t match up and I let them go.

The offer was great and the salary was more than I was expecting. I was leaning towards a different company at the time but decided to accept the offer, after all it was a sure thing for a job... something I was beginning to need for financial reasons after my move. 

I started the job with gusto, coming in and trying to learn and perform as best I can. However, very quickly I realized that this is not the right culture or industry for me. I won’t rant too much and will refrain from listing the nit picky details but please find my major concerns below:

SLOW sales cycles, little to no training, poor communication, I’m the youngest employee by 15+ years, other coworkers seem as though they are unhappy, lack of enthusiasm from everyone and soul sucking job overall. 

I’m sure there are other big details that I’m forgetting at the moment but I’m sure you get the picture. 

I’m now in a situation that I wish I had never accepted this job. The problem is that I need to have a job. I’m also worried because I’ve only been here 5 months and I don’t want that to look poorly on my resume. I’m not sure what to do but this job is causing me so much anxiety and I’m unhappy all the time now. I used to love my old job and I’m generally upbeat person so I don’t think that it’s simply an attitude issue on my part. My girlfriend sees that I’m suffering and is supportive of any decision I make about work. Unfortunately she doesn’t make enough to support both of us though, nor should she have to support both of us. 

Another side note, this is not a performance issue. Management seems quite happy with my performance, almost as if they are surprised that I’m giving so much effort. 

Please give me some advice, I’m not sure if I should stick it out to a year at the expense of my mental health or if I should make a quick getaway and maybe find a menial job until my next big break. Also if I do leave this job I’m not sure how to address it to future interviewers. I’m sure that my current employer would not be happy if I left with such short tenure and would not be likely to offer a good reference. What do I do? I’m literally going crazy here.

TLDR: I’m 5 months into a job that I hate and I don’t know what to do. 

Edit: I’m sure there are grammar mistakes, apologies.

Sometimes she’ll walk into a hair salon to get a cut or trim and she’ll have to force herself to leave. The other day she even ordered me (jokingly) to chop her hands off if she tries to cut it.

495,"Sorry in advance for the shitty formatting and sentence structure. Sleep deprived as fuck

I’m really not sure where to begin. My stepdad has been part of my life for almost a decade. He’s always been pretty strict. In 3rd to 5th grade my brother (now 15) and I (17) were given a punishment for incorrect homework problems. For each homework problem we got wrong, we had to do 5 or 10 (I don’t remember the exact number) push-ups. He always came off as rude and dismissive. This upset me a lot and that’s when I started wanting to run away. Maybe I was overly sensitive, maybe not. Middle school wasn’t any better. I started having thoughts of self harm in 6th grade. He soon established a new policy he calls “pay to play.” The rule is that I must have a B- or above in all classes and no missing or late assignments in order to play video games or hang out with friends. What he didn’t mention is that he’d take away video games for stupid reasons such as me not putting my shoes away or not cleaning the dining room. So I was put in track and field in 7th grade because my stepdad believed that I could get a scholarship that way. For the short period of time I was in it, he actually treated me nicely although I was once called a disappointment for “giving up” in a race with my brother who is 5 years older than me. I ended up quitting track because I kept getting bullied by others. Another minor thing that happened in middle school was an incident where I was texting a friend about an idea for a short story (which featured some really dark themes) because I enjoyed writing at the time. My stepdad asked to see my message history with said friend and I deleted the messages because once again, the story was dark as fuck. I deleted the messages and my when stepdad found out he accused me of sexting, told my friend’s parents, and completely ruined our relationship. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety in the summer of 2016 and my stepdad has never made an attempt to understand my deteriorating mental health (yes, I have a therapist and she knows half this story) High school has been utter hell so far. In 10th grade I was forced to take AP biology and failed it because I started beating myself up over every fucking mistake I make. My parents finally found out I‘m suicidal. I told my sorry excuse for a mother that my stepdad makes me want to die and she didn’t respond. This stupid whore lets her piece of shit husband push us around and only occasionally steps in to force him to give a forced apology. Nothing is ever done to change his behavior. A few months ago, my stepsister (6) ended up getting a splinter and only wanted our mom to take it out for her. She threw a fit and he responded, and I quote, “Fine. I hope it hurts more.” No apology. No response from our mom. Nothing. Anyways, I’m a socially inept basement dweller. My social life is online and video games are my only escape. I often end up falling asleep when I get home from school and relax. My stepdad calls me lazy and I’m always rudely woken up. A couple months back I woke up with a text sent to me from my stepdad. I opened it and attached was a fucking picture of me sleeping that he described as “evidence in case I tried to deny it.” Recently I got (and lost) a job that my parents forced me to get. After my first paycheck they told me that I had to pay them $150 a month in order to “provide for the household.” Flash forward several weeks. It’s 3 or so days before Christmas and my stepdad is driving me to work. He brings up the fact that he’s buying my mom new tires for her vehicle and I’m paying for part of it. I never agreed to or was told about this. I was pissed off and said something along the lines of, “It’s my money.” So he responds with, “So are you paying or not?” Knowing him, this was a trap. I said, “You’re just going to call me selfish.” And he turns to me and says, “I won’t. I promise.” I stupidly answered, “No.” So we’re about 5 minutes away from my job, about 10-20 minutes on foot. It’s chilly outside. He says, “Okay, then I’m dropping you off at the gas station and you’re walking the rest of the way because it’s my money,” so that’s what happened. I’m currently failing just about all my classes. I dread going home in the afternoon. My house feels like a prison. I have no escape. My social life is online. My online friends say what I’m experiencing is abuse. My stepdad is a cunt and every fucking day I feel violent and vivid thoughts toward him. I want to run away or just go ahead and hang myself. I can’t stand seeing the failure I’ve become. I can hardly find a reason to get out of bed. I’ve given up on my future. I feel trapped and I don’t know what to do.

497,"  Hello reddit I have come to you today looking for some advice.  My problem is that I'm thinking of trying to reconnect with a girl from high school that may or may not have shown interest in me, but I was too blind at the time to see it and I don't know if it's a good idea or not.  I am currently 35 years old so my fear is that too much time has passed and I should just cut my losses at this point.  My story about how I got to this point is down below.

  Back when we were in high school we had a few classes together but would not really hang out outside of those classes so I never got to learn much about her other than the little free time we would have not doing class work.  She was always so sweet and nice that I never even thought there was a possibility of her liking me until I read a yearbook post from a ""secret admirer.""  It wasn't until after my senior year that I was able to put the pieces together to figure out that more than likely she was the admirer and by then I felt already too late to do anything about it as we did not go to the same college or have any real mutual friends and cell phones were not as widely available as they are today.  She even gave me her email but at the time my family did not own a computer.  Being able to contact each other was not happening anytime soon.

  Over the next decade as I would become more familiar with computers and social media I decided to do some searches to see if she had a Myspace account but was unable to find her there.  I was also not much of an email person so I never attempted to reach out to her that way.  About 5-6 years ago I finally found her on Facebook but I was sad to see that she had changed her name and was married at the time and had just had a kid recently.  I was happy that she seemed to be having a great life that I feel she deserves, one that I would never be able to provide for her even after all these years.  I respected that fact and left it at that, but recently I see that she has gone back to her maiden last name on her profile and the husband no longer shows up in her photos.  I don't know much other than that.

  Over these last 18 years I have struggled with being obese, dropping out of college, getting by on whatever jobs paid the bills, partying, drinking, playing video games, and just being an overall loser in general.  I live with my parents, don't have any kids, never had a girlfriend, no savings, bad credit, and just never put much effort into life in general.  I am only now seeing the mistakes that I have made during my life and I've been having serious regret and some depression over it as of late.

  This all may be too much information and maybe I am putting more thought into this than I should be.  My problem is that I've always wanted a chance to see what could have been with her but I am afraid of rejection and don't know how I would handle it.  There have been many times like this over the past years where I would thinking about her constantly but find a way to suppress it after a while until the next time it resurfaced.  I drive myself crazy thinking about her too and I don't know why I am so scared to do anything about it.  Part of me is glad that I finally have a way of reaching out and making an attempt to contact her, but another part wishes that it wasn't that simple.  After telling you all of this my question is should I make an attempt or shouldn't I?   Thank you for reading this if you cared at all.  I feel like just getting this out there is helping me out.

&amp;#x200B;

music has been my dream since I was 5 years old sitting at the piano.  I made up songs about the sandman and monsters under my bed.  I started guitar at 13.  I had my first open mic around 13, and performed on the streets  from when I was 15 till I was 21 to help pay for college.  When I graduated, I decided to pursue music full time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wish I went to school for music, but I think I was scared that I would lose the love of it (I had 4 friends who pursued music ALL flunked out, and I considered all of them better musicians than me) 

&amp;#x200B;

So, to my parents relief, I went to a 4 year school and studied biology.  I remember bawling my eyes out and multiple anxiety attacks I just KNEW I wasn't doing what I was supposed to.  But I stuck with it because I didn't know what else to do.  and I was good at science, and I did like it.  

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm 23 (I know that's not super old) I spent the last year teaching myself how to produce music, I released two singles and an ep (with a total of almost 6k streams between spotify and apple music) , booked and played a total of between 50-60 gigs, still played some on the street, had my first paid vocal/writing studio session for another group, and upped my social media presence.. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've done so much.  And I feel like I'm going to get stuck at this.  I see other artists moving faster than me.. I feel like no matter what I do I'm not doing enough and I'm always coming up short.  I'm job searching for a day job but can't nail one down, I've been living out of my car between friends couches and my boyfriends place.

It’s frustrating and kind of embarrassing for me but we’re not friends.   It’s not like this is a situation where I’m her only friend, I KNOW she has friends who are a lot closer to her. So why is she messaging me? How do I tell her that I’m not the person to talk to about this? Is it better for me to just block her?",09Jan2019,1
508,"Obligatory sorry for the very long post, but here goes...
I am a part time dog walker and have, for the past several months, been walking a pooch who is extremely neglected. She's got matted fur and wounds on her front two legs which will not heal and are not being addressed. In addition to this, the home she is in is riddled with trash, urine &amp; feces, and clutter to the point where you can hardly walk. Her owners have been made well aware that this is an extreme problem and that they should consider at the least, caring for her or even rehoming her. 
No matter what is said, nothing seems to be done. I am not the owner of the pet care service, but from what I understand, we are more or less there of our own accord. In other words, if we don't show up, she will never be let outside. They do not pay us consistently. 
On top of all of this, we are all fairly certain that one of the household members is physically abusing her. Although I have no proof of this, I have heard him yelling and screaming at her (from outside) on more than one occasion- not physical abuse obviously, but the signs are apparent (the wounds, flinching when you reach down to her, extremely timid, etc).
At this point, I don't know what to do. I feel a sense of obligation to make someone aware of what is going on, but am terrified that it would be an even worse situation for the dog- she would be locked in a cage all alone. I'm also fearful that if I report them, they will legally come after the business. 
I'm so torn, what would be the best route to take here?

TL;DR: dog I know obviously being abused, unsure who to report it to or if reporting would be in the dogs best interest.",09Jan2019,1
509,"I made a decision to leave my roommates (2guys so close to me, know them since childhood) , we live together.. pay for stuff together, study together.. yes they do help me alot in many things, but Im that kind of person who prefers to live alone for some reasons;
1. Privacy (which they take away always from me)
2.  Have stuff that are my very own
3. Do whatever I want without being asked why and whatso
4. I Respect a clean environment, which they dont provide
5. They make me pay for rent alot, and food sometimes which ends up with me not saving any money.. I cant say no to them because they dont say no to me when Im in need.. but the same time I dont think I would be in need if I dont spend my money on other people things)

Im planning on going on and living alone, It will be tough to tell them since we are so close, but Idk.. I just feel like I need to isolate myself. I will be there with them still like most the time but NOT living with them anymore, am I taking a good or bad step? Is this bad?

510,"My boyfriend is a groomsman in our friend's wedding and I know this means I won't get to sit with him at dinner, at the ceremony, etc. I'm pretty social so this isn't an issue. 

But he does have to be at the wedding location 4 hours before the event - this wouldn't normally be a problem, except its a 3 hour drive to a secluded beach town, no busses go out there, I can't drive, and we're the only people from my city going

I can only think of two options, 1, find out if anyone is driving from the next city over, catch a 2 hour bus there in the small hours of the morning, then catch a ride into the wedding with someone from there, or 2, go in early with my partner?

My partner says it's fine if I go in early and I'm worrying about nothing, but what would I do? It's too far out of the actual township to go get coffee etc. Would it be awkward? On the other hand, spending 6 hours travelling and relying on potential strangers doesn't sound appealing either? ",09Jan2019,1
511,"The last week and a half have been a fucking nightmare and I’m out of ideas on how to handle anything at the moment

Shortly before Christmas, my fiancée tells me she thinks she’s pregnant. We were wary to get excited as we have had a miscarriage in the past. But we’re silently optimistic

Fast forward to 12/31. Her boss calls her inquiring about some missing product at work. Fiancée is confused and unsure what’s being said. Go through the day, back and forth with boss, corporate wants heads to roll. Her boss is gonna try and save her employment but she has to take a crazy demotion and go back to only 30 hours a week. Two days later (1/2) of being in limbo, being told she can’t come to work yet, and boss finally tells her the corporate won’t allow her back at all and wants her fired. Even though the issues was caused by somebody else, without my fiancées knowledge, since she’s the senior most on shift, they want her held responsible. 

Another two days goes by, now 1/4. Her father gets ahold of her to state he will no longer be able to pay the rent. 
Quick backstory: father has money, figures money buys love, offers to help get her and her daughter a house to rent while fiancée goes to school and gets her career in order. So he’s been paying the rent a year at a clip. 

Well he says her “can you and your SO afford the rent going forward?”  She says yes. That give us another six months or so until the lease is up, plenty of time to figure out what we’re gonna do. We were talking about moving anyways so we have time. 

1/7. Landlord texts fiancée asking when will have the rent by. She’s is confused. Speaks to landlord, come to find out, things are not as they seem. Her father did renew the lease last year, but went monthly, not yearly. Father also notified the landlord at the beginning of December about this change in ownership, didn’t notify us until the fourth. Landlord is confused because there’s still a lease agreement with her fathers name on it, that claims she’s agreed to take on the responsibility. Oh also, the rent isn’t $1100 a month for the house, it’s $1800. So now the landlord is looking at us like “yo I need an answer as to wtf is going on” and we’re looking at him the same way

He says he can negotiate down a bit with us but not by much, and only if we go on an extended lease of like 16 months, otherwise we have to find somewhere to live. Meaning, move a three bedroom house with two adults, a special needs child, possibly one on the way and two pets in under three weeks. No place will rent to us under those circumstances, in that short a period of time, nor would we be able to move in that short a period of time

Her mother says she will help us, but only if we do things her way. Well playing by somebody else’s rules is what kinda got us into this situation in the first place. 

Fiancée is all exhausted between the morning sickness and stress, so things aren’t getting done around the house as they would normally because it falls on me when I get home and I have only so much energy and can only do so much. We both have been scrambling to find her a job and me a better job, see what we can do to try and save ourselves from this situation. Otherwise we’re expected to come up with $1800 by the end of the month and it’s not going to happen

I have no idea what options we have. I don’t know what the best option is. I’m literally lost on how to handle any of this",09Jan2019,1

514,"Hi Reddit! I'm really hopeful you can help! To start, I have lived in my home for the past 4 years, and have been lucky to have quiet, child-free neighbours this entire time. I am not a parent, so I have gotten used to the quiet. I live in a detached home, and have lived in the basement suite. When the couple moved out, I moved into the upstairs suite.

I have new neighbours now that moved into the basement, and they have a 1-year-old baby. They are both in their 30s, and it's their first time living on their own (they used to live with her parents). Their baby screams all the time, from when they wake up at 10am, until they go to bed at 2am. Now, I get it, you can't control a 1-year-old. Babies are meant to cry; it's how they communicate. But the dad tries to silence the baby by yelling at him, and this in turn makes the baby cry even harder. I work from home, and this cycle of crying and yelling is very disruptive.

The other night, they had a party where the baby screamed almost the entire time, and the party goers just yelled overtop of him. I knocked and asked them if they could keep the adult voices down when it went on past 10PM, but they just said ""sorry"" and carried on as they were. I walked outside of the house and I could hear them clearly in the driveway, even though the suite is on the back side of the house.

I feel terribly for the kid, but I don't think it's my place to tell the parents how to deal with their own child. I thought about having a polite conversation with them, but they're East Indian, so there's a big language barrier. Communicating even basic things with them like the wifi password has been difficult.

I've already asked the landlord about soundproofing, there's not much I think they can do short of ripping up the ceiling and drywall downstairs and sealing the door between the suites. I have noise cancelling headphones that work well in loud public places, but I can still hear the screaming and yelling through them.

Is there anything else I can do? I want to enjoy being home, and I want to be able to work on my home computer, but I don't know if that's possible anymore. I also don't want to stir up drama with the people I need to share a house with, since I can see that spiral out of control. Any advice would be much appreciated!",09Jan2019,1
515,"So, I just started university a few months ago and have moved into a condo nearby my school. It is very expensive, so I was hoping that the people that would also live there would take care of the suite, and be respectful of the fact that they have a roommate. I share a room with one other person. 

He is a nice person but is possibly the most unhygienic person in the entire world. He hasn’t done laundry in the past 4 months, he showers only 2-3 times per week despite being a nearly 180 pound man who is very hairy (his hair falls everywhere). So granted, he smells bad, his room smells like a septic tank, and it is affecting my life. 

Ive asked him on many occasions to clean up after himself, which honestly he should know at this age (18M). Things like flushing the toilet, cleaning the hair after he shaves, and cleaning up messes after he eats, I have to tell him to do or else he will not budge. I’ve been forced to my room, and I rarely ever leave unless I need to go to class. I am paying so much money every month just to hate it so much, simply because of a grown man who can’t take care of himself.  

I need some advice. It is obvious that he knows I don’t like uncleanliness, because I’ve told him so many times to clean up his own shit. Do you think he is doing this to piss me off? What can I say or do that will make him be more respectful? I feel like I’ve given him enough clues. ",09Jan2019,1

First my FIL has most if not all his passwords set to auto fill from his pc. They’re all pretty simple passwords. Like family members name and some numbers and one symbol. 

About an hour ago he came to ask us if we changed his email address on his amazon account because he couldn’t log in, wasn’t receiving a “forgot my password” email, and the amazon representative was telling him is email wasn’t the email on file. Well, my husband and I watch videos from his prime account from time to time and I had just happened to be watching something on it last night around midnight. I brought up the switch accounts option that shows his email and it was a @mail.ru email associated. There wasn’t any purchases made yet and we removed all the cards from the account via the representative. 

I guess my question is does he need to change every password he has? Does he need to stop saving them to his pc? Does he need to cancel his cards since amazon doesn’t show but the last 4 numbers of the card? Do my husband and I need to change our stuff? 

There is just so many questions. Any help will be appreciated. ",09Jan2019,1
518,"Not to give too much away, but a friend of mine who is currently still in high school is in a very toxic relationship. She’s had a lot of family issues, and this guy has seriously taken advantage. (Just to note, he’s also in high school) He treats her as though she’s a possession. He’s made her cut ties with a majority of her friends because none of them like the way he treats her. I’m one of the only people she has left, and he’s trying to get her to cut ties with me as well. He’s always calling her degrading things, and just generally treats her like shit. She basically lives with him, and he consistently takes her phone, and today he even hid it so she’d be unable to take it to school with her. He’s cheated on her (asked for nudes from other girls in front of her) more times than I can count, but yet says he doesn’t want her on her phone because he doesn’t trust her. She has to call people when he’s not around in order to talk to them, or else he’ll take her phone, read the messages, and had sent some very nasty things to her friends pretending to be her. She was in denial for a while, but recognizes now his behaviour is toxic, but still doesn’t want to leave him. She says she knows he’s bad for her, but she loves him and doesn’t want to leave him. I don’t know what to do to help my friend, and it’s getting to the point where the abuse is getting physical. If I tell anyone who could do something about it, she’ll deny everything.

521,"A lot of shit has been happening to me recently that has made me completely lose my motivation to do anything. I'm still in high school so this is an issue as I'm now borderline passing my classes when I used to maintain an 85 or above in most of my classes. A lot of shit has happened and been happening as of recently and the shit just keeps piling up. First I learned that my father had a stroke. He lives in upstate NY so it was about a three hour drive to see him and that was the last time I've seen him. That was a few months ago. I learned last night that he's going back to his country because he cant make a living here and I don't have an opportunity to even say goodbye. I don't have a relationship with him but he's still my father regardless of all of this and it hurts knowing I may never see him again. On top of that, my grandmother got pneumonia and died in the hospital but was revived shortly after so it was just a wake up call that she isn't really going to be alive for very longer. I'm still mentally preparing for that. On top of that I no longer live with my mother because my grandfather passed away last year so she had to move in with my grandmother to take care of her because no one else has the time to. My mom doesn't have a job and doesn't drive so shes been living off of our family for as long as I can remember. My main caretakers right now are my brothers. Shes been getting more and more manic and shes not been very present when I go to see her every month or so. Our phone calls are very awkward, and I feel like somedays she cares more about seeing my dog then me. Its as if were strangers that accidentally called each other. And that hurts. On top of that, I just had to give the girl I've been talking to a lot over the past year an ultimatum. We've grown extremely close but the situation in which I'm being presented with is not healthy for me to be in. I have strong feelings for her and she says she has strong feelings for me but this situation has been going on for months and slowly but surely its been draining my energy and pushing me closer and closer to the edge. Hence the ultimatum. All this shit on top of more shit and more shit would take me forever to talk about but the main issue is the fact that I don't know how to deal with all of this. I really realized how much its affected me. I haven't ever truly contemplated suicide this seriously till now, and I know I wont do it. But I also know that thats just a sign that I need help. Badly. I know deep down I don't want to die, but everything is pressuring me and I feel like I'm carrying all of it on my chest. I feel like I'm being crushed. And each day I try to push on and everything starts to get brighter, I just get knocked back an extra 5 feet from where I started. I cant find a way out. I cant. Please help me.

531,"Hi everyone, this may end up being less detailed than I hoped as I procrastinated too long and my next class is about to start. 

I've been dating a girl since my second semester of 12th grade, im in my second year of college now, we live in Michigan. She has had problems with anxiety and depression her entire life it seems, and it really shows. I'm not really sure where to start, my last couple of attempts to write this have ended up a jumbled mess; probably due to the emotions I'm feeling at the moment, I'm so scared for her. 

So I guess I'll start at the beginning then. We started out as a high school relationship, which was incredibly cathartic to me, and she felt good as well and it showed. She has always been deeply and unnecessarily apologetic towards me, she has no problem confiding in me either, which is where the problem starts. 

Ever since a couple months into our relationship, she regularly will express her desire to end her life; although, much more colloquially. Shes so frank about it you'd almost gloss over it if you weren't paying attention. 

At first I thought it was her way of expressing Twitter humor or something, but I've talked people back from ledges before (not literally but in middle school those hormones are off the charts,) and it really seems as though she is fed up with her life, and these are some of the reasons I've gathered:

1.) She is too anxious to make phone calls, she regularly has me make calls on her behalf.

2.) I believe she feels trapped in her own body sometimes, she will say (and I'm not even really paraphrasing) ""I didnt feel the motivation to turn the TV on so I layed in bed all day."" 

3.) She has an eating disorder of some sort, she isnt bulimic or anorexic, she just eats a very small amount of food, so little that I'm extremely surprised she isnt a skinny girl.

4.) She does have some sort of body dysmorphia; although, it's more likely her stomach ulcer contributes to the eating disorder than a need to be skinnier. 

5.) She has been to a few different therapists, she stopped going 3 months after seeing me. She feels like therapy is never the answer because she isnt feeling in the mood to talk oftentimes when her appointment is scheduled.

6.) She has lost interest in hockey (she has played for years but wont touch ice anymore,) video games (she used to play video games constantly but as I said, she cant bring herself to do it anymore,) she won't paint anymore, she is thinking of dropping all of her classes at school. 

7.) She quit her job at the beginning of last semester because she felt doing both school and working part time would burn her out. She doesnt have an income stream anymore, and she's thinking of dropping out of school. 

I'm not sure what to do anymore. I dont think I'm enough to help her at this point and I'm getting desperate, I love this girl and I've always seen past this huge looming shadow of depression and self loathing. I just need a way back into her positive side because it's almost gone now. If you read my chicken-scratch and have any ideas for me I'd be deeply grateful.",09Jan2019,1
532,"I'm \[27M\] and come from very conservative Asian family. My parents do not want me to leave the house until I'm married.

I respect my parents enough to be obedient, but I still do my own thing. Obviously, I do want to live by myself. So, I'm asking how you did it and how it turned out. It would be nice if someone is or had a similar situation as mine. 

Personally, I want to move out by the end of this year because of a couple of reason.

1. I plain in simple want my own place even if it is renting my own studio or 1 bedroom apartment.
2. I want my own solitude and privacy. This doesn't mean I hate my parents. I love them very much.
3. The pressure of wanting my own place because as a man I need to be ""settled.""
4. I feel somewhat of a loser staying in my parent's home. (I do make 50K annually before taxes which isn't really enough where I live to live alone comfortably)
5. Sometimes I want to party or go out without having to constantly tell my parents where, what, and who I'm going out with. (oh how I love the old college days...)

533,"So last academic year I just started medical school. I fell into depression at the end of first term/January. Told my GP about it in February - she signed me up for CBT which had a 6 week waiting list. I wanted antidepressants but was not prescribed it as it could interfere with my epilepsy (just my luck).

So nothing to treat my depression it kept me awake at nights and caused me to miss lectures the next day. I spent most of the day not revising and just... worrying.

CBT started at the start of May, though I only managed to fit in about 3 sessions due to therapist being busy and had postponed a couple to revise for exams. 

Failed my exams. Had to retake all of them in the following august (spent revising from 5 to 8 hours a day during this period). Failed again by a small margin.

Now I'm retaking first year. I'm commuting to university. My parents don't let me join societies or go to the gym (let alone socials) as I let them down last year by failing. I've not got much of a social life - I have two friends who I don't see too often and they don't do much besides studying.  Last year I had loads of friends and used to go out to party often (before depression).

I finished my CBT and was feeling better but relapsed due to failing my exams, leading all my negative thoughts to come back. I'm lacking motivation to study.

Had a few ""dark thoughts"" but never would really act on them... for now at least. 

So great, am I gonna spend the rest of my student life lonely and miserable?

Oh how I envy the calm minded students passing all their exams while using their freedoms to drink the night away...

535,"A little bit of background might help you to understand the situation that I'm in right now. During my undergrad I was depressed for almost 3 years without any therapy. I used to feel that I should just quit as if it was all just a game, quit it and restart it. But I couldn't do it because of my family and also of the thought that I should at least accomplish something before I give up. That something would be my undergrad degree. Somehow I survived it, by not focusing on my thoughts and trying to get by every day. With no sense of purpose, no direction I spent those 3 years. After that I spent a year at home doing nothing. I didn't feel motivated to do anything. The thought of giving up lingered almost every day but it couldn't do it. At some point I decided that sitting at home doing nothing won't help so I decided to go for MBA as it seemed the right thing to do. A major part of that decision was because of my parents. So here I'm 5 months into the program and I feel that I have taken the wrong decision. I can't quit the program or 'quit' now as I have a huge debt to pay. Sometimes I feel that I should have given up when I had the chance after my graduation. Even if I think of giving up after paying up the debts, by that time many years would have passed down and it'd be too late. I'll be having at least a few more responsibilities than I do now.

539,"I have always sucked at complicated material. I graduated from college with a 2.2 GPA in Finance, and that’s after switching majors like 6 times because I sucked at everything else I was mildly interested in.

I somehow graduated, and got a job as a bank teller, which I absolutely sucked at. No matter how long I was there, I kept getting into complicated situations that no one else screwed up. I worked as a bank teller for a year and felt like I had no idea what I was doing; I was getting help from people that were there half the time I was. My manager genuinely thought I was stupid and explained things to me differently than my other co-workers because she thought I wasn’t up to par with them. I managed to find another job before I got fired.

Now, I have an even harder job where I manage clients’ IRAs, and I have been working here for one month today. I am REALLY bad at this job, and my meeting with my boss today was about him thinking I’m not cut out for it and that I really need to improve. I started with another guy on the same day and he is doing really well and don’t make nearly as many errors as I do. I study so hard for this job every night, and I just don’t understand it.

540,"back story: so i still live with my mother (divorced  but has a boyfriend) and im under 16 im very slightly autistic (possibly a false diagnostic i do not act autistic i have been told multiple times) mildly depressed and i have insomnia. 

my mother and i have  had a recurring argument in the last couple years in which she has called the police on me for abuse by abuse she means me pushing her around a bit i have never left any sort of bruise and do not believe this is wrong in the context the context is i do all my work and all school work on computers when i cant work depression kicks in and i loose the ability to get up in the mornings i struggle to eat and sleep becomes even harder.

 now i know it is very common for mothers to punish there children for misbehaving etc etc but a recent argument was with her and her boyfriend (he was staying with us for a bit) and i get into an argument with her about something silly i think it was swearing, okay fair enough to her, then her boyfriend gets involved and starts yelling at me (i have never met this guy before IRL) and shoving me around he has threatened to hit me and has said and i quote ""If you were my child i would drag you out into the garden and give you a beating you wont forget"", he tells me i am a bane on my family and i am the reason my brother has anxiety. he says i threaten my mother and that she only listens to me out of fear that is the second to most recent argument.

The most recent one just involved my mother she took my laptop she started thoughtlessly yanking cables out of my PC because i said to a friend my mother is a bitch i then pull her away saying no you know what happens when i cant work, why do you want to do that to me she then screams at me you are abusing me and i say to her well your boyfriend abuses me then she goes quiet and starts pulling cables out again (she stops saying i am abusing her) i pull her away again.

i  say no you cant do that i need to be able to function and she bites me i cant do italics on Reddit but she fucking bit me, i have a mark on my arm i took a photo and intend to show it to someone with authority. i then text my father and say to him this is the last straw i cant deal with her, can i come live with you. i then call a friend start explaining what happened to her. my mother hears that and cancels my phone and i can no longer communicate, then she took my PC and left. i then grabbed my laptop from her room and sit down to write this. am i the one in the wrong like obviously its wrong of me to talk badly  of my mother behind her back, and yes i shouldn't shove her no matter how okay its seems to be to her to get her boyfriend to shove me around but is there anything i can do anyone i can turn to because i cant deal with this any more even outside of arguments she mutters about how shitty a person i am under her, breath makes bad comments about me and refuses to tell me whats going on in my own family.

 am i the worse person here or is she worse please help cant do this.

So I’ve decided I want to move out this year BUT before I do that I realistically need to clear a few credit debts which have been a thorn in my side for two years (don’t buy expensive cameras or guitar gear)

I have a Huge debt to PayPal via PP Credit card and a substantial debt to my bank.

I’m debating some choices:

Option A. Pay off the entirety of the PayPal debt with savings then use next pay day to pay off the credit card.  (Fastest)

Option B. Leave my savings alone. Use the money I would normally use to add into my saving to clear my debt (take a couple of months to clear)

Option C. Pay the most minimal amount each month into both debts and carry on with life. (Will take well over a year to clear)

The credit card debt charges me £20 - 30 so i could completely ignore it if I wanted to while PayPal is costing me between 130-200 per month. But at the end of the day it all adds up FAST.

547,"I was just hired last October to a new position in a very small office.  There are **currently** 9 people that work here full time.  My boss was hired last August- so she hired me roughly 2 months after she started.  This is going to be somewhat jumbled, because I'm at a loss right now.  I love my job, I really do, but she's a psycho.  She is in her forty's but dresses like a 15 year old.  We work at a small non-profit.  Her title is national marketing and sales director.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the questionable things she's told me:

* She has stated multiple times that she owned a ""Multi-million dollar business"" by selling insurance
* She has ""overseen and managed 50 employees"" and she's ""never had to fire anyone because I always hire the right people""
* She has bragged about her ""lavish"" lifestyle where she has gone to the Kentucky Derby and is a member of the Million Dollar Table Club (idk what the fuck that is).  She claimed that she was making upwards of five million a year, but because she was living like she was making 20 million a year, she was in debt. 
* She decided to leave her last job and sell her assets so she could ""make a difference"" at our company.
* She told me that she used to weigh 100lbs, but since she's gotten married she's put on 80 (this is a small lie, but paints a picture)
* She graduated from a private college with a marketing degree
* She hates working on Mac computers and doesn't know how to use them
* She lied to my face about an interaction we had together just yesterday... which is why I started to do some research.

Here's what I've found out in the last 24 hours, after doing research and finding out what is actually going on... It didn't add up.  Competent managers know you can NEVER fire someone without proper documentation.  Competent marketing people know how to use a Mac computer (or at least from what I've heard).  Competent people also wouldn't have painted a web of lies that are now crashing down.

&amp;#x200B;

After going to her LI account, and piecing together what we know from people we know from her hometown, and double checking everything on Facebook:

* She has no college degree, she attended the college but never graduated.
* She was an insurance agent for a small Midwest company.  She worked there for 3 years, average salary listed on their website is 30k
* She has no marketing experience
* The only ""management experience"" I can tell that she has is from her MLM.  
* The small town she lives in isn't a fan, because she's a homewrecker (again, not really relevant but paints a picture)
* She's been married/divorced 5 times
* She was dishonorably discharged from the Army.  We don't know why.

Now, at this point yesterday I was close to looking for a new job.  Now I'm wondering if I need to go up the chain and show all this evidence, or that might backfire so I kind of want to keep my head down and just wait.   I'm furious that she is taking advantage of this situation and has no business leading this team.

I’ve been dealing with some stuff over the last 2 years that has made me not want to be in a relationship at the time, and I’m glad I wasn’t. There’s this girl that I know who was really into me, and to my knowledge still is. I really liked her, but didn’t show any signs. We don’t talk much at school, because I’m pretty awkward around her now, after really admitting to myself I like her. At the tail end of dealing with my problems, I said fuck it. Told her last night she was hot af, and she responded pretty well. I could definitely turn this into something, I just don’t know how.

552," After lurking for months, I've finally decided I need to share this issue with you, Reddit.

For some context: At the age of 22-23 I noticed that I’ve basically living my life on autopilot. Other than the desire to make something of myself, I found myself extremely lost and feeling helpless. 

&amp;#x200B;

My job, which had been meant to be a 6-month internship, had morphed into a position I never wanted to be in. For a year I went about trying to fill the void I felt with things that entertained me or made me feel productive and happy. I took to reading more books, watching Crash Courses on YouTube and spending less time doing things I considered a waste – but I felt as if I got nowhere. Before turning 25 I went to visit an old professor I had been fond of for some guidance, and I got the “do what you love” speech. Unfortunately, nobody was looking to hire someone in my field at a shop where I would be able to pivot out of my role and do something that better suited my interests. So I focused harder on other things that I loved, including basketball and tennis. I thought that if the remaining 10 hours of my day were filled with things that made me happy, that strange sensation would just fizzle away and I’d be fine!

&amp;#x200B;

I wasn’t fine, and it didn’t feel like things were getting better. After I had turned 25, I spoke with my brother’s colleague who happened to have closely related interests to me. Like me she enjoys project management, finding new ways to approach problems, making processes and workloads both more efficient and optimal from multiple perspectives and getting the chance to dive deep into research of certain subjects. She told me her story, and how she ended up where she is today by always accepting new work. Eventually her trait of “picking up sticks along the way” brought her to the position she holds now and she genuinely enjoys her work. From her, I learned that “doing what you love” may not be industry specific – maybe it was task-specific? As long as I had work to do that fell in line with work I enjoy doing, then I would love my work!

&amp;#x200B;

My chance appeared when I was moved over to a different division. While some monotonous work remains, for the most part I get to interact with people more and I am learning a whole slew of skills that can be easily pivoted from to get me another job should I ever want it. Yet the same emptiness remains. I’m come to realize that the approach of picking up sticks along the way may probably result in me working for years and years without a set goal in mind. Even with knowing my interests, there isn’t anything I can think of that I can set as a goal for myself. My work, while decent, could be far better if I had the fire to work for something. But unfortunately I have yet to ever feel this kind of fire. 

&amp;#x200B;

Reddit – where does your fire come from? How can I do better in determining an end-goal for myself? I’ve recently turned 26 and I feel like I have made zero personal progress since I was 22. I’ve thrown out all the dead weight like self-doubt, self-pity and depression. The only thing I want to feel is a fire, and something to work towards.

558,"To start this the things you need to know before reading this is I’m 15 I have average tests scores (usually around 60 to 70 percent) and I’ve had a history of anxiety.

I also want to say that I don’t blame my parents for thinking this, I admit my test scores could be better and I have some teachers who aren’t very good, plus I’m irish and in Ireland we have this thing known as the junior cert, essentially it’s a bunch of test you do in every subject which determines weather you can do that subject fir the leaving cert, which in Ireland is what collages look at when you apply for them.

Now you know all that let me make my points and if I should stick to them or just move, as I said I’ve suffered from severe anxiety in the past, this is what led my to move primary school as a kid to where I was immediately at a better place it’s by far the best thing that could of happened to me at that time and I will always be greatful for that, this is my parents main argument.

But the thing is I’m probably at the best place I’ve been at in years when it comes to my mental state, it’s hard for me to make friends and in my first year of the school I didn’t make any, in my second year I broke out my shell and made a few friends and now in 3rd year I have amazing friends who have helped me through a lot.

My fear is if I go to a new school I’ll be right back where I was being the antisocial introvert who doesn’t like talking to a lot of people and hates confrontation.

Another thing they say is about how some of the teachers i have aren’t good which is fair, but what’s to say the teachers in the other school will be any better, yeah they look like they care in the open day but they always did that my teachers all did that and some of them are now my worst teachers

Till I passed 10th grade, I used to love and was extremely passionate about Science. So when I got to 11th, I chose the Science stream and then, I don't know what happened but I started to fail. Everything. I'm at the end of 12th now and it's time to choose what I'm going to do next but I have no idea what to do. I'm still failing and I can't afford to.

On the other hand, I still love Science but I feel like I am losing all confidence in it. 

I am confused about whether to stick with what I chose in the first place or change to Law or maybe some other stream (if you could suggest it) before I lose all confidence and interest in Science, which I really don't want to. I feel like if I switch streams now, I'll be able to be fascinated by Science as it will become a non-academic subject which I can read about whenever I want. However, I also feel like if I don't switch, maybe the higher classes will help me regain my fascination but before that, I have to pass the entrance exams for Science and get into a good college, which is feeling really difficult after all that I've gone through in the past 2 years.

Briefly about my situation: I'm 27 years old, having a AP in Multimedia Design and currently in Canada where my girlfriend is sponsoring me. 

While I was studying Multimedia Design from 2014-2016, I got a job offer from someone who owns a small company doing public relations. The job was hourly pay and while I enjoyed it at times, it wasn't really my passion and I didn't make a lot of money, really. I still worked there for four and a half years and learned a lot about the business world but that was it, I didn't feel like I gained much else. In 2016 I quit that job to travel to Canada on a one year work permit, partly because I was ready for a change and partly because I have fallen in love with someone who was studying in my country who were from Canada. 

While I have been here in Canada, I've been working part time for a small newspaper in a small town in Canada which I really enjoyed but the position was unfortunately entry-level for someone looking to get into journalism so the pay wasn't good. I also worked in a resort for the first time ever but the pay wasn't good either, minimum wage with tips. I am currently in Toronto going through immigration stuff as my girlfriend is sponsoring me, waiting for a work permit so I can work in 3 months so I'm basically just waiting around and I wonder if all the decisions I've taken in my life is wrong.

As mentioned, I am 27 now and I wish I would have considered education more before choosing one and also committing to it 100%. I feel like I am quite intelligent but have never excelled at anything. I loved doing photography and videography for the small town newspaper, they loved what I was doing but it wasn't really something that required a high level of expertise. They had to be done quickly because it had to come out for the news with only little editing. 

If only I had chosen to study journalism which was my initial dream to do or study architecture which was my second choice and stuck to it to get a bachelor's degree, I feel I would be a lot more set for life than I am now. Both earning more and doing something that I'm passionate about. 

I don't know what to do right now. I could move back to my country to get the education I need but that means leaving Canada and my partner. I could stay here in Canada, live with my partner and see how far I can go with the level of education and experience I have now, hopefully finding something I somewhat enjoy. ",09Jan2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the thing... I don't know what to do. Simple as that.

&amp;#x200B;

This was always a problem. My dad has the same, so, it's in the blood. I want to do EVERYTHING.  

Yes, I do have hobbies and things I like to do more, like gaming, making people laugh and movies. So, I started a Youtube channel with a comedy theme (vlogs, sketches and stuff). I was getting good feedback, but then I quit. Some years later I started another channel, now focused on videogames, because it's what I love to do. The feedback was also good, but, I quit too. I started over, and it's like a snowball. 

I also thought about starting a channel directed to movies. Short and long films. But I start thinking about the long-term difficulties, the expensive equipment, having to organize a team, etc. And I start to give up before I begin.  

People have also praised my writing. I already thought about having a blog. I've thought of writing a book. But on what subject? Should I make it serious or funny? Should I do it by chapters or followed? And what about the blog? Games? Problems of the present day?  

Yes. My biggest problem is this. Thinking too much. And thinking about thinking too much. I'm 23 and I wanted to start fighting for something more, but the decisions are so many that I do not know how to organize myself and my life... ",09Jan2019,1

576,"Can anybody please give me insight on academic appeals? I am currently writing one, and I NEED for it to be granted. Any and all advice is welcome, this is my letter so far: 

To Whom It May Concern,

Firstly, I would like to thank you for the chance to explain my poor academic performance in the past two semesters. I accept full responsibility for the mistakes I have made. In the spring semester of 2018, I became very ill with mononucleosis, on top of my grandfather, who I lived with at the time and took care of, fell ill and passed away. My attendance was poor, and I chose to become reclusive instead of reaching out to my professors and let them know how badly I was struggling. I see my mistakes in that, and I wish I had gone a different route. This semester, I moved into a house three minutes away from campus in case I fell ill again, I sought out counseling from the counseling center, and attended tutoring. While the counseling helped me significantly in dealing with my grief and stress, it was not a good semester. The housing I moved into was with 3 other girls, and I was the odd one who didn’t fit in because I was the only one who didn’t want to go out or throw parties. What started as disliking me, turned into making my living there miserable. This is not an excuse for my poor academic performance, but it did impact my mental health quite a bit. I also thought I could handle algebra for calculus, and I couldn’t. I sincerely want to better myself, stay here at *university*, and improve my grades. If my appeal is granted, I plan on continuing with counseling, as well as taking an algebra prep class before repeating algebra for calculus, and focusing on required general education classes next semester, as well as repeating Microeconomics, to improve my cumulative GPA. I will also be seeking out new housing for the sake of my mental and physical health. I also take full responsibility for any classes I missed, and I do not plan on that being a repeat occurrence this upcoming semester. I realize my mistakes, and I want nothing more than to have a chance to fix them. I consider myself a good student, and I want to be able to prove that again.

Apparently the kids room is under my bedroom. I have done everything to oblige this
woman and her kids. For example, my bed frame is a little squeaky so before my gf comes over I throw the mattress on the floor. We tend to get busy before these kids go to bed, and I also spoke with my gf and told her my situation with the girl downstairs and she even has tried to be quiet during, but I can't stick a pillow over her face.

We text on average one message per day, learning about each other's cultures/lives, language, etc.. I'm still grieving from a breakup that happened 6 months ago, so I know I'm very vulnerable and susceptible to latching on to anyone that gives me attention. That being said, I don't think I'm exactly ""rebounding"" because I'm usually the type to develop a friendship first before thinking about being in a relationship, so I really value the friendship that we have, and want to continue it. Still, it's not good for me to start thinking about her in a romantic way, especially because of our distance. I've been thinking more and more about her, waiting anxiously for her to text back, fantasizing about being in a relationship with her, etc. It's not to a point where I'd say I'm in love with her or that I'm obsessed with her, but my thoughts are definitely changing the more I interact with her. I have no idea how she feels, but I'm sure it's best that I assume that she sees me as a friend and nothing more. Who knows, she might even be in a relationship already!

I've actually been thinking about and starting to plan to move to her country to work there. It's been a long-time dream of mine, and not something that I just came up with after meeting this person. But I wasn't planning to move there any time soon-- maybe a year from now at the earliest. So any advancement of romantic interest surely isn't a good idea.

Three of the four of us are juniors in college, so we were sitting around the table and having a discussion about our plans after graduation even though that's a bit more than a year away. It was all about potential first jobs, the possibility of grad school, what area we think we'll end up living in, stuff like that. We're a biology major, a computer science major, and a mechatronics engineering major. We'll call the computer science major Roommate A and the mechatronics engineering major Roommate B.

The fourth person we live with is a freshman and she's an English literature major. I think she's very insecure around us because her age and being the only one of the four of us with in a liberal arts program. We'll call her Roommate C.

She was in the room while we were talking and she's said before she doesn't like being left out of conversations if all three of us are talking with her in the room, so I asked if she knows what she wants to do with her degree yet. She said she plans to be an author. Roommate A asked if being an author really requires a degree, and Roommate C said no but she wants one anyway. Roommate B asked what jobs you can get with an English literature degree besides teaching English, apparently being an author, and maybe going into journalism, and Roommate C got pissed. She gave us a big lecture about people in STEM looking down upon liberal arts degrees as ""useless,"" left, went to her room, and has kind of been a bit of an asshole since. 

She's been picking at us over little issues ever since. We shouldn't be allowed to cook and eat meat because she's vegan and doesn't like it. A picture I hung in the living room bothers her apparently. It annoys her when Roommate B FaceTimes her younger sister to help her with math homework. Roommate A is in and out too often.

589,"PLEASE help me. 

**BACKSTORY**: So, this is a girl who i talked to about 3 years ago, and we had a short relationship before i ended it due to the fact that my antisocial self would not hang out with her, and i honestly did love her. I ended it because at the time, i thought it woulf be better if she was with someone who was worth her time. I dont know what the fuck i was thinking, because i ended up just being depressed. 

Fast forward about September of last year. We became friends again, even though this girl had gotten together with my best friend. Oh well, i caused that so i had to deal with it. I still had feelings for her and she expressed to me how unhappy she was with her current relationship, he cheats on her, etc., so in about October i let her know that my feelings never went away and i loved her. She then came out and told me she felt the exact same way, and the only reason she went into another relationship was because she couldnt get her mind off of me. This of course put an immense amount of happiness into me, hoping we could actually get something going again. Early November comes along and they officially “broke up”. She told me that she wasnt completely ready for another relationship just yet, but she definitely wanted one with me soon. As the days went by, we talked more and more, hung out more, the whole nine yards. I was so happy. BUT, when i tried to tell one of my extremely close friends (not her ex) that i was talking to her, she found out and basically flipped on me. **That was the first red flag.**

 I decided to ignore it, even though a ton of people told me her and her “ex” were still in a relationship. She denied that over and over, so i believed her. Thanksgiving came by and she didnt answer the entire day. Whatever, we’re good, it’s okay. She finally answered 9 hours later and told me she was busy with her family all day. Later that day do i find out via her “ex”’s mom’s facebook that she was with her “ex” all day. This got me in tears, knowing i shouldve trusted everyone else and not her. What hurt me most was the lying. I could get over her being with her ex for a day. She apologized and so we kept talking. Her lying about that was **The second flag.**

THE VERY NEXT DAY, she said she was going to busy with her sister. I of course had lost trust in her at this point, but i decided to trust her. 9 hours later, i found out AGAIN from her “ex”’s mom’s facebook that she had been shopping with her “ex” all day. Once again, tears. She apologized, i forgave, but i still just couldnt regain that trust. I lost it all. She lied again, so **that’s the third red flag.**

How many red flags do i need? WAY TOO FUCKING MUCH.

Now fast forward to early-mid december. Every day she didn’t respond for more than maybe 2 hours, i assumed she was with her “ex” and just got sad for no reason. I don’t know why i was still in this “talking” phase with her, but whenever i brought up if her and her “ex” were still together and if she really wanted something with me, she would get super defensive. “I had no right to rush her” “she was afraid of change” “she loves me”. Okay. Christmas comes around and i KNOW she was with her “ex” for christmas but at this point i have no solid proof. Got incredibly sad, but still brushed it off. Keep in mind that we are still talking, she denies they are together, they dont hang out, and i still cant get rid of these feelings for her. I fell in love, got too attached and now there is no way out. Im still holding on to the hope that she leaves him completely soon and makes “us” public. Us never leaving this talking phase and her lying ONCE AGAIN is **the fourth red flag.**

Fast forward to this month. January. At this point, im depressed whenever she doesnt respond for more than an hour because i figure she’s with her “ex” unless we’re in school of course. I hate it so much, but whenever we hang out and talk, i just forget about all of the negative and hope for the best. I probably shouldnt be doing that. I think about bringing up how unhappy i am that we’ve gone nowhere in 3 months, but whenever i bring up her “ex” she get’s defensive and i just don’t want to get her mad. But of course, the day i build up the courage to talk about it with her which would only be a few days ago, her mom dies. She’s heartbroken and i can’t do that to her, i can’t make her even more sad. At the moment, she is now at her mother’s funeral and im balling my eyes out because i just want a relationship with her, but i cant because of her “ex”. Im starting to believe im here as just a side option, but if i bring that up she gets defensive and says she loves me.

**Im too attached to leave, but knowing she’s still with her “ex” makes me hurt every single day. Help me please.**

**TL;DR: Me and a girl i met awhile ago began our second relationship recently. She tells me her and her “ex” are broken up, everything points to that being false. She lies about everything invloving her “ex” but im too attached to leave, being led on to believe she wants to dump him completely and start something with me soon. I don’t want to leave because i want a relationship, but i can’t have that because of her “ex”. Please help me.**

Today's my last birthday of my 20s. I don't exactly have, well, friends, so I wasn't expecting much, but I do still have my Mom and my fiancee, and work usually does something for people's birthdays too, so I was kind of expecting a little something, you know? Nothing big, just something.

&amp;#x200B;

My partner thought he'd have to be out of the country for most of this week for work, but he found out his meeting was moved more locally (less than two hours away). I said I didn't mind - really I don't begrudge his travel for work or being busy with work-related things, but it kind of hurts as most of today and yesterday was a mixture of meetings and 'team building' fun (go-karting, drinks, bowling, going out for dinner etc). 

&amp;#x200B;

I wasn't expecting him to come home between his back to back meeting days (I know he really wanted the chance to catch up and bond with some of the newer team members, and he doesn't get the chance to go out and drink much as he's usually the designated driver), but I guess it just hurts more than I thought it would, that I've only had a handful of texts on my birthday from him.

&amp;#x200B;

I was more disappointed really with my mom. I woke up to two messages from her; one wishing me happy birthday, then one sent a minute later asking to borrow money. 

&amp;#x200B;

Add to that, my work is pretty laid back and lets some of us work remotely from home on some days; sometimes, if it works better for the team rotas, they ask us to work specific days from home (they actually suggested I work from home today). 

&amp;#x200B;

I get a message about 2-3 hours after the start of the workday from someone saying 'oh! I didn't realise it was your birthday. Happy birthday' and then an awkward half dozen people chiming in on our messaging system. Like...this is somewhere where they usually put up banners and cakes for birthdays. Cards circulate the office a week or two before.  To not realise would mean there wasn't a card waiting for me tomorrow. Which sounds really petty I know, but that card actually means something for me, as I'm really the sort of person who makes friends easily or, well, ever.

I'm a teenager, and I'm currently going to 11th grade in a German high school, and I honestly don't know how to deal with this situation.

For my whole life, I thought I had realistic ambitions. I thought I was fairly intelligent, not painfully stupid, not a genius. But I thought I was pretty smart.

Recently, I realized that this is far from the truth.

Because I skipped grades, got into higher schooling, had average to good grades most of the time and people generally precived me as competent and smart, I thought this was true. It's not. I have average to bad grades, all my friends and especially my girlfriend say they're not smart while outperforming me by lengths. I'm horrible with numbers and have a hard time doing any schoolwork. I had ambitions when I was younger and thought I could reach them with some work. I'm currently failing math and physics while getting bad As and good Bs everywhere else.

I’ve never done anything like this and don’t know where to start but today I realised I REALLY need help but I just don’t know what to do. 

Today I beat up my dog and it’s not the first time I’ve done something like this. I beat up my mum once too. Usually it’s my dog because she’s the closest thing to me. I do things like stomp on her paws, slap her, kick her, grab her by the scruff of the neck and throw her across the floor. I’ve never drawn blood or made her need the vets but I just get so fucking angry sometimes that hitting inanimate objects or screaming into my pillow doesn’t cut it. 

There’s no reason for me to get angry, either. Like it just happens and I have NO control over it whatsoever. I’ve been to the doctors and therapy but neither helped. I’ve had 3 partners in my lifetime and I broke it off with all of them because I treated them like shit but they never saw it. I’d dig my nails in their arms and squeeze their hands as hard as I could and I’d pull their hair and stupid shit like that. I know it’s fucked up and I’ve tried to stop it but every time I think I’m getting better I do it again. 

I currently live alone with my dog, I have no friends because every time I make one I just ghost them because they deserve better than me. 

My dad was the same as me, so is my brother and my nephew is getting like it. My dad use to beat me and my brother, kick us and punch us and once he knocked my tooth out because I accidentally cut the pond pump with the lawn mower when cutting the grass. He strangled my mum in-front of me when I was young, I love my mum but she just puts up with us and even when I beat her and threatened to kill her and myself she was just like ‘oh well, do it then’. 

My dad wasn’t an alcoholic, he didn’t do drugs and he didn’t even smoke and, like me, he tried so fucking hard but he still had these outbursts. He ended up killing himself when I was 16 and just left us a note saying he couldn’t live with a fucked up head and fucking hell I just want to kill myself too, it seems like the only option. I’m not getting better and everyone would be better off without a psycho like me in their lives. 

I dunno if I should just do it but I know my mum would be sad because she’s had a lot of people on her side of the family die too. I can’t keep living with my fucked up head and I can’t keep taking shit out on my dog. I’ve already broken almost everything in my house. My tv, my computer, my phone, my radiator. All my walks have holes in them.  Despite this I’m a total pussy and I hate going out and talking to people, I mean I’ve already gone out and and seen a doctor/therapist but they all say I’mm just depressed but THIS ISN’T FUCKING DEPRESSION. I’m not sad, I’d don’t want to die because I’m sad. I want to die because I’m fucked up and don’t deserve to live. There’s a difference. I just don’t know what to do. ",09Jan2019,1

You see, she has this power to change the entire families opinion of a family member with as little as 1 sentence. It's mind blowing

So a year went by and I finally defied her and just before that I told my parents and grandparents to expect a rumour. (Didn't tell her mum as she defends her). And I was finally free to walk where I want to walk and do what i wanted to do. It was great

Until last month when she asked if I wanted to walk with her. And I thought just one day. Except the new tactic is to ask me through her mum. And when I said not today, maybe tomorrow I got questioned. And saying I just want to walk by myself today just makes her offended.

So my mental health has dramatically eroded away over the last few months.



Got a new job in the fall with normal hours,higher pay, and friendly co-workers only for management to be no better. They fired the shop foreman months prior so nobody was training me despite specifically stating i would need it as their work is different from my former company , i was just thrown on jobs and did my best.  After new years the head manager fired me for “ poor work performance “ after 3 months despite me literally not doing anything wrong, my direct supervisor and co-workers were shocked (one being my actual weld teacher ) so it really isn’t me.


Father is stationed on the west coast having been divorced since i was 6. It’s been easier to talk with him as i got older and he’s eased up but i’ve never been around him more than 3 weeks at a time. Dropped my pride, told him what was going on with him saying it happens and i can stay no issue. I was intending to save up and move out there ten months later but this fucked everything up.

I got fired for the first time, feel burned out from a career i initially love, no clue for a different career path, i’ve fallen out from my core friends, i have severe anxiety,  and now have a few weeks to clear out my cozy apartment to move cross country with a parent i’ve hardly been around.


I feel so tired and this just the beginning , i don’t know how i’m supposed to start all over when i hardly had things together.",09Jan2019,1
598,"Im currently 10k in consumer debt working a food service job making $14.50/hr making $25000 annually but I know that (A) it cannot support me financially in the mid to long run ,because for one,the place Im living has been purchased and is being pushed down in 2 months and rent anywhere else is 200-400 more a month, and (B) it isn't what I think anyone but my manager would call a dream job. 

So I took a bunch of tests and quizzes based in some way from Cliftons Strength finder and  4 categories kept showing up that it claims I'm strongest in. I've looked up their meanings but I'm still stuck, from my perspective, hence why Im asking my fellow redditors.

Very Relaxed- comfortable working without structure allows for me to be adaptable but makes it hard for me to see the benefit of simple tasks

Autonomous-I can work with a team but I'm at my best when I can focus on my own work

Independent-I can network well but prefer to work with those I am familiar with or just do the work myself, making me very selective of whom I spend my time on/with. 

Modest-I'm realistic about limits and realize that confidence on a subject does not imply competence of said subject. My wife says I don't always give myself credit (she's my wife, she's supposed to be my biggest fan right?)

I don't have any hobbies (I work to make money to pay bills and spend my free time reading books on getting out of debt, financial planning, investing retirement etc to put us in a place of stability) and every thing I read says to increase income but that's where my questions stems from. 

What career would I be good at well enough that I could keep it LT and what career would I enjoy well enough to want to stay there LT. 

Tl;dr: I've got a short time (2mon) to increase my income; what career should a very relaxed, modest independent autonomous person persue that will make good income (more than 25 k) to get out of debt but not make me lose my mind.

I have other data points but these are my top 4 so I decided to start with these. Thanks in advance",09Jan2019,1
599,"Me and this girl have been friends for a year, at first I didn’t have any feelings for her. We met in school and we’ve always kind of been two awkward quirky people with similar interests. She’s had a boyfriend for about four years and I’ve kept it cool because she’s my friend and he’s a really nice guy, plus like I said I told myself everything is platonic. I kept a good code for a long time that I wasn’t going to be that guy that breaks up something good and I can always still be her friend. Recently we’ve been hanging out a bit more because I’m moving changing cities in July and we’re trying to hang out more before then. Sometimes though now I see myself being attracted to her. I guess that sometimes I see her more as a friend and I care deeply about her, and I catch myself often thinking that I might be falling in love with her. 

What should I do? Should I bury my feelings for her until July when I move? I think about her a lot and I’m just kind of stuck in limbo with my feelings. ",09Jan2019,1

602,"I realized my mom seems to be slightly on the spectrum, which my dad must have realized at some point too, because he cheated on her when I was a kid, but then they lied about it until I caught him attempting (not subtly at all) to cheat again, so my mom admitted the first time had happened. But even after they they are still together (I think because my mom knows she would have nothing left without my dad, she has no social skills and very few friends) and my little brother still doesn’t know any of that.

So my neurotypical father and on the spectrum mother also happened to raise us to be outcasts, to march to the best of your own drum, and to explore all your curiosities, fascinations and obsessions to the fullest.

This was a great environment to grow up in as a kid, like a dreamland daycare center, and I was confident and nice and loving, I was a star student early in school and I tried a variety of instruments, represented my elementary school in competitions, played sports, got along with everyone, was a leader in school and selected to play prominent roles representing my class at our many patriotic plays that we would put on for parents in elementary school. This was because both of my outstanding character, and my lack of fear of being in the spotlight, almost craving the spotlight.

The culmination of this was when I was 9 years old. My nickname in baseball was “Mr Mayor” for my diplomatic, glue-like presence. So I was selected by my school and my classmates to play George W Bush in our school’s enactment of inauguration week. I had a “first lady” a beautiful girl in my class and “secret service agents” several other male classmates dressed like secret service; them and I got to skip classes all week to attend events such as a “parade” down the hallway lined with kindergarteners, an “inaugural luncheon” with first graders”, or an “inaugural ball” with second graders in the gym which had been transformed into a function hall, where my “first lady” and I were made to square dance for several local newspaper reporters and pose for ceremonial pictures. 

But the other part about my parents that I didn’t mention is that they saw this potential early on and tried to help me develop talents, figuring I could hopefully master on of them and use the rest of my intelligence to fulfil my potential and become a star in my field.

They did this using the methods prescribed by Tiger Woods’ dad. At first they literally tried to raise me to be tiger woods, as they are both golfers, and so they would bring me to the golf course and have me watch golf on tv, making tiger woods my idol. And I do love golf, I love golf courses, I love the history of golf and I want to broadcast golf. But at the same time despite expressing interest in becoming a professional golfer, I absolutely hated practicing, and had a horrible temperament on the course for a drawn out game like golf (my emotions tend to ride or die on every single shot, which means my momentum can be halted quickly). This makes me perfect for golf broadcasting, as I can inject much needed drama in a mostly lifeless tv event (except when tiger’s playing). 

And that’s where we move the story along because it was clearly not going to be golf, and it wasn’t looking like it was going to be piano either, as I began to struggle because I didn’t want to practice. So at age 9, the quest to make me a prodigy at traditional things seemed to have failed because of my lack of commitment, but at the same time I was having my personal peak with the “Presidential inauguration” week and completing the sweep of finishing first in my class every year of elementary school. So the idea that I could be generationally great at anything I wanted to was still there, I was showing tons of potential, it just wasn’t likely to be in a traditional child prodigy field like golf or piano.

But what I was realizing at this time was that I loved television. I watched the tv coverage of 9/11 as an elementary school student in awe, having just been to New York and learned about manhattan and the street grid and stuff and specifically asked my dad when we were at Ellis island looking back “what are those two huge buildings sticking up that don’t match the others? Why does only one of them have a smokestack (The iconic red and white twin towers antenna of course)?”

After this I began watching Peter Jennings every day on the news, and I began watching golf instead of practicing golf. I started paying closer attention to the broadcasting as I got into baseball and football. By the time of the “presidential inauguration” I had recorded myself announcing for the first time a few months earlier during Super Bowl 39, the first Pats-Eagles Super Bowl after the 2004 season in February 2005. 

After then “inauguration” elementary school was over.  I began mock announcing hundreds of sporting events a year at home, while at school I started realizing that being super diplomatic was not going to fly anymore and that my old nerdy friends were not going to help my get girls. So with my mind now set that my future was secure as a sports announcing prodigy, I set about trying to make myself popular. A growing problem was my mom because she was not letting me grow up and being overprotective, so I began to associate her nice diplomatic ways that she taught me with childlike naïvity, and I sought to counter that by becoming popular by denouncing my old friends and making overtures to a group of potential new friends by first trying to impress them by being “funny” (doing all sorts of weird crazy shit that was not funny), or being “evil” (mock-support for bad guys in any situation) which I saw as a counter to my mom’s influence.

I started a “coolest kid in school” ranking which of course I modestly put myself as tied 2nd, with two of the kids I was trying to become friends with tied for 1st and another one of them tied with me for 2nd.

The result was a disaster, as I basically was so oblivious that I let myself get played for a year before one of those kids let me down easy early the next year by telling me “hey we let you have fun with this last year but you need to leave us alone now, it’s not funny anymore”. So I first did the same cycle on a new group of kids that year, before they just ignored me enough that I cut my losses following a year. I also started realizing that the rest of my family besides my immediate is rich and began to notice little slights against my family by my cousins parents.

After that I tried to run back to my old friends but they wanted no part of it, plus I now had a reputation as a weirdo creep because of the things I had done the prior two years. 

There were only two of my old friends on my bus that would still talk to me, so I formed this gigantic mental crutch complex, a TV network named after myself, that in my imagination replaced Fox and had all its sports rights. I replaced all the daytime programming with “headcam” footage of my various life events. The two or three kids on my bus still nice enough to still talk to me humor my TV network by participating in “shows” at recess and on the bus. I would spend hours a day taking Fox Sports graphics and modifying them to have our names and my network logos, also taking the opportunity to “fix” anything I didn’t like about fox’s graphics package at the given time. I talked about going to Syracuse university and following in the footsteps of bob Costas or mike Tirico or Marv Albert. 

However this sports announcer/tv producer thing was becoming more and more of a mental crutch than an actual realistic career goal. I was something to hold me mentally together while I tried to rebuild my ruined personal life. After three years of the TV network thing, a tumultuous 5 years of middle school were over. When I walked in I was an A+ student who had loving friends, family, and a bright future as maybe a politician or a tv news anchor. When I walked out I was a C student with virtually no friends, an intentional Truman show complex to keep me sane, and a pipe dream to get into Syracuse university (top sports announcer school) which I couldn’t afford to go to. 

So I left the public schools to go to private catholic school and a fresh start. In the first months of high school I suffered another setback when I caught my dad trying to cheat again as I previously mentioned.

My only mission in high school was to first make sure I was the announcer, then to make friends. I did bit of those things quickly, so all of a sudden my personal life was back in order. I was back babyI started focusing on trying to get into Syracuse but my grades weren’t quite enough to get a scholarship. So I went to umass, a large rung down for sure in the sports world, and a not even on the map in the world of sports announcing.

So I was going to the zoo zoomass, woo! I started smoking weed and partying with my high school friends. Suddenly my personality completely changed. It was as if I had “woken up” from a deep sleep of aspbergers. Suddenly everything that had happened I could see from the point of view of a neurotypical person, as if the weed cured me of delusions. I could relate to people, whereas previously in high school I had been a happy tagalong. Now I could only feel my aspy level emotions when smoking weed, I feel neurotypical emotions otherwise unless it’s the morning right after I’ve smoked weed when my head is in a fog.


I was emerging socially as my own person with a real personality but the problem was that this personality began to hate and despise the aspy personality, and therefore forces like my mom and my family. Because being born to a family of outcasts and raised to be different, then having that family turn out to be fake, while my mom’s emotional, on/the-spectrum-level love for me makes my childhood spy personality burst out into tears thinking about how much I love my mom yet also thinking about how much my neurotypical personality despises and somewhat rudely tries to correct and fix my moms aspy sayings or behaviors. 

So I can only “feed” the aspy side of my personality by smoking weed, it’s the only way to feel my old emotions while indulging some of my aspy passions. At the same time, once I switch into that mode it’s very difficult to switch out. So over the last 5 years I’ve skipped work, school, family events, to get high, but then I feel like I’m letting my family down so I don’t even get the fulfillment of my aspy emotions for the day. As I have to fulfill my aspy emotions for about 4 hours a day, this leads me to continue trying by smoking more and more weed. So I wake up the next day in an aspy state which makes me unable to change into my neurotypical personality at work or school as I would automatically if I was sober, severely hurting my ability to network. At school I just didn’t show up for stuff even was the director of sports radio, something I’ve done a couple times at my real job but I don’t want to be fired so I’m careful. But this is some shitty temp job, I want to be a sports announcer but it’s all about connections and at school and at all my internships I was universally hated because I would never travel on team busses, when I had to use them I would be late, my conspiratorial and gallows sense of humor about everything, and my attitude that announcing is performance art like a pianist or a ballet dancer, and my tendency to relate everything to pro sports or politics. Like many artists and performers I can’t wait to drop the facade and get back to my introverted interests and my weed once the performance is over, after I have reviewed my own perforce of course. It’s about hitting all the cadences, making sure your calls are smooth, using creative transitions, not being repetitive, being self deprecating on the air, etc. My attention to all of these things is why I kept getting positions, I am great at the job. But two the other two kinds of people in the field are either stat geeks or ex athletes. The geeks are obsessed with the game and broadcast, the ex athletes are obsessed with music and girls and going out, meanwhile I’m interested in discussing how to exploit drama within the team to increase viewership (since I believe conflict and drama is what draws interest), professing my love for diva athletes and who have exploited the public love for drama to make money, planning future potential political endeavors by discussing ways to use the public’s own emotions to divide and conquer their loyalties, or simply talking about an imaginary future in which our whole broadcast and production team is working for like Fox or something.

So basically I’m scared to get an announcing job because my childhood personality is aspy and it’s so sad that my new personality knows too much about my old one and hates it and my family. This creates a feeling of self hatred and internal deadness that makes me not want to try hard and smoke weed all day to try and feel like it’s 2008 again. And then on top of being essentially a dead person who died 5 years ago in high school, my new personality *still* doesn’t even solve the problem of not being relatable, it did in high school but now it seems to clash with the personalities of other announcers as I just mentioned above. So what should I do? Should I got into politics and cut ties with something with so much personal baggage for me like sports announcing? Or no because my aspy personality is the better and more moral person and the real way to honor my mom would be to fulfill my dream of being a famous sports announcer and my mom’s dream of having me be a passionate and successful person (I used to call announcing my “passion”)? But politics, despite being dirty and ugly, would fulfill my goal of being able to have a voice in the media, and my parents other goal of me being remembered in history. So there’s a lot to consider. Thanks for taking the time to read this.

I’m having some anger issues lately. 

My girlfriend and I recently went on a break to work things out (I asked for the break) and it worked great surprisingly, we both started working on ourselves. I got some much needed time to myself and a new perspective, etc.  


Fast forward to Christmas Eve, we were driving back from my parents and she asked me to look something up on her phone and I found out she’d done cocaine (based on a search that came up). I’ve made a post about it earlier so if you want more detail you can read that.   


I’ve always had issues with getting frustrated easily, but I was making headway and ever since I found out she did that I’ve been in the worst headspace. I’ve been extra depressed, paranoid, jealous, extremely angry, etc. 

To her credit, she didn’t do the coke while we were on the break meant to be working on ourselves, but she still kept something from me. I’m now paranoid she’s lying about lots of other things and that she’s cheating and literally nothing she says means shit to me at the moment.   


I know it’s not the end of the world but I want to stop being pissed off. I tried talking to her to say how I felt and she said she felt bad already and tried to justify her actions. I feel like I can’t actually talk to her. She just wants things to go back to how they were.  


I’ve been so mad at everything and everyone, I know it’s no excuse and I usually don’t yell at people but I snapped at a post office worker and a bus driver today. I get so mad that I wait till I get home so I can scream. I’ve been working out to try to get some of it out but it doesn’t seem to be helping.

610,"	I am currently a college freshman at a university that I hate. Long story short, I was rejected from my first choice school and wasn’t very happy with any of my backup choices. I ended up committing to a university across the country because I was dissatisfied with where I was in life and thought a new city could be the change in pace I needed. Unfortunately, my first semester at this school was not great. I had a lot of problems with my roommate which inevitably led me to switching dorms. Although moving out has put me in a much healthier environment, many of the friendships I was beginning to form were with people in my old suite, so moving out basically ended those friendships and quickly isolated me. The new suite I am in is a lot less social than my old one, so I have really only developed an acquaintanceship with my new roommate. I am a very shy person so I have a hard time reaching out and making friends in my classes. I joined some clubs in order to meet new people but meetings are constantly cancelled so I haven’t been able to form any friendships within them. On top of this social dilemma, I’ve began to hate the major I am studying. While applying to college, I was not 100% positive of the career path I wanted to pursue, but decided to apply for a generic major that would direct me to a stable career field later on in life. Although this major did not make me feel excited, it felt the most right at the time. After taking a major oriented class, doing an internship in that work field, and interviewing people who work within the area of study, I have concluded that this major is definitely not right for me. Before anyone says to simply just change majors, the college I attend is an incredibly small liberal arts school that does not offer many diverse major choices. I have recently sparked interest in one particular field of study that is not offered at my current school, meaning that I would have to transfer universities in order to study what I want to. Although transferring is a scary and serious decision to make, the idea of being at a different school makes me want to cry with joy. I have really struggled being away from my family and boyfriend, especially given my displeasure with my social and academic life at my college—I’m just really tired of being alone. After meeting with multiple different academic advising and career development counselors, my parents and I have decided that the best option for me would be to transfer to a university closer to home that has a much broader selection of major/minors. While this may sound like I have figured everything out and am working to put myself on a better path in life, I still have one major issue: surviving my last semester at my current university. 
	I unfortunately didn’t decide to transfer until after applications for the Spring 2019 school year we’re past due, meaning that I have to stay enrolled at my current college for the spring semester. Since I am depressed about the idea of returning to my college for the spring, some of my friends and family suggested I take the semester off or attend a local community college instead. Taking a semester off is definitely not an option for me because I am trying to graduate early (for personal reasons) and cannot be delayed. While I could go to community college for the spring, I am afraid that it would hurt my chances of getting into some of the colleges I’m applying to transfer to since they are fairly competitive. My parents, counselors, and I thoroughly analyzed my options and we have concluded that I really need to just stick out this spring semester. But as the end of my winter break is drawing near, I have turned into a complete mess because the idea of returning to this school is devastating to me.
	I am reaching out for some advice on how to survive the next 5 months of my life in an environment that fuels my depression. I do have plans to try and make more friends and whatever, but I am really seeking lifestyle advice on how to get through day-to-day. Everyone in my life has told me that I just have to wait it out, but there has to be more that I can do to improve my circumstances. To anyone who has been in a similar situation, what did you do? What worked? I have 3 days left before I return to college and have fallen into a slump where I am unable to leave my bed and stop worrying about my this next semester.

A few weeks ago, I told my boyfriend that I wanted to be in an open relationship because he doesn’t satisfy me sexually. 

Sexual incompatibility has been an ongoing issue that I’ve tried to resolve with him in multiple different ways, so the open relationship idea was honestly a last resort. 

When I told him, he agreed to it shockingly fast and said he didn’t really need to talk about it much, so we kind of brushed over the conversation. (I did also tell him I’d be willing to have a threesome, because I thought it’d soften the blow, ha.) 

Anyway, I ended up fucking some guy, and that was also terrible, and I’m starting to think I just don’t even like sex and should stop trying to make it feel good because it’s never going to. 

Now, my BF is all gung ho about finding a girl for a threesome and we reached out to this one who said she wasn’t interested in a threesome, but would like to be with him. 

I told him I didn’t want to meet her if it was just going to be them two, but he insisted, and we had her over for dinner a few nights ago. Turns out, she and I have a lot in common (although she seems to be much more outgoing, and I am objectively slightly more physically attractive). 

Today, I called him to ask him when he was getting out of work and he said he was hanging out with her. He still thinks he can convince her to have a threesome with us too. 

I am SICK to my STOMACH about it. I’m trying so hard to distract myself and not kill myself I bought a bottle of wine, ordered pizza, put on a face mask, painted my toenails, and now I’m sitting in the bath watching Bojack Horseman and writing you lovely folks on Reddit. 

Now I don’t know what to do or how to tell him how I feel. I’m so depressed and so dissatisfied with every area of my personal life at this point, I think the best course of action is to just drive far away and shoot myself so he doesn’t have to find my body. 

I love him and I want him to be happy, but I want ME to be happy also, and I feel like there’s no way this is ever gonna feel the same. I feel so stupid and disgusting and unlovable. I’ve been acting like an actual crazy person and I have no idea how to come back from this without sounding like a psychotic bitch. 

Has anyone been through something like this and managed to save their relationship? At the very least, has anyone managed not to jump off a cliff afterwards? ",09Jan2019,1
619,"Sorry for a vague-is title. My mom died two months ago. At the time we thought it was because of natural causes. She had struggled with alcohol and drug addiction for years, and at the time of her death she had pneumonia. We weren’t close to my mom, I haven’t seen her in a decade and my sister last talked to her about a year ago. We have two younger half siblings who was taken by CPS as my sister and I are too young to take care of them and their dad isn’t in the picture.

After all this time, we still have no info. We keep calling the mortuary and despite allowing us to do the cremation, they haven’t given us a cause of death. Every week, for 8 weeks, we’ve called and received no answers. I tried to call CPS and they didn’t answer until last week. When I finally talked to them, they said our previous case worker was fired and we got another one. The receptionist tried to search for our file so she can forward us to our new case worker, but she couldn’t find anything. She search my name, my sisters name, both half siblings names, my moms name, and my aunts name, and just... nothing. Apparently they can’t access the files. We told them if its a police matter and they have to keep it on the DL and can’t tell us anything yet that’s fine, but they haven’t confirmed.

Now, as for what my sister doesn’t know.... I talked to my aunt on my moms side for the first time in my entire life. From what she’s told me, my half sister was abusing my mom physically. The morning of my moms death, my half sister and mom were fighting. This was confirmed by my moms ex-roommate who was there to hear it. Apparently my half sister also killed this same roommates dog. I don’t know how, but either way its disturbing. I have no doubt in my mind that my half siblings had seen a lot of abuse, drugs, and other bad things because of the people my mom was around. She had been clean the past 4 years though (as far as drugs go) and was trying to get better, but it doesn’t change the fact that the children were exposed to dangerous dangerous situations all their lives.  My aunt was able to talk to the former case worker before she was fired, and the woman confirmed that both my half siblings were getting a psych evaluation.

I’m beginning to think my half sister killed my mom. My dad and aunt think the same. I haven’t told my sister because 1) its rumors 2) she knows my half sister (she had met her, I haven’t) and 3) I want it to get confirmed by police first. But, it’s causing me a lot of stress and a lot of guilt. It’s making my family and I fight more, it’s causing lots of arguments between my sister and I, and the wait is just preventing me from moving on.

My question is, should I tell my sister the rumors? Do you think it would help stop the fighting at home? Or would it just make things worse? I’m terrified to tell her and for it to not be correct, but it’s really beginning to feel like it is true.",09Jan2019,1
620,"So bit of some background info: 
We’re this group of friends that one can say inseparable. Mixture of guys and girls (total of 4 people) and we see each other almost every single day. 

Lately over the past few months I’ve been noticing that whenever anyone needs a favor for anything, everyone including myself offers to help. But when I need a favor more often than not I get excuses. For example, one of them was heading to a nearby city via train and everyone knew. We all offered to take them. When we learned when they are coming back, again we all offered. However when it came to me, no one offered so I asked and all I got were excuses. 

It became more and more noticeable and I had 2 options:  bottle it up and stay quiet about it or confront them. 

I confronted them and it all went to shit. One of them isn’t speaking to me anymore.

623,"Hi everyone. I'm (F21) thinking about going back to college after two years since I drop out. 
So my history is this.

I'm a spaniard girl and I'm always been a great student. I had pretty good friends, I was sociable, funny and responsable. But this all change in my first year of college. I was in a relationship with this depressive guy who introduce me to weed. I never smoked before and i loved it. It made me feel happy and, honestly, i feel cool. How stupid i was.

Then the relationship got worse as his depression did. We smoked more and more because that was the only time when we feel good together. My college career was awful. I skipped classes, I made no friends. My life was weed and him.

So I got depression and anxiety. I changed completely. I turned quiet, I couldnt speak and shower was a nightmare.

Almost two years before y finally drop him. But It got worse. I started fucking with a lot of guys, party a lot and did a lot of different drugs.

My family noticed that i was losing my mind so I had to live with my dad for almost a year. Depression again. I was by myself all day, he is a sailor and works at night. 

But at the time i tough i was getting better, by January of 2018, something clicked in my head. And I had the mania episode. I run away from home and put myself in danger a lot. I dont want to give details because its too painful. If I werent found my actual boyfriend, who took care of me, gave my a home and encouraged me to go to the doctor, i think i could be dead, or worse.

Now I'm better. We live together, I have a job, i do no drugs and I'm starting to feel myself again, but maybe in a more mature way. Making friends and socialicing is being difficult but im working on it.

This september im planning on going back to college and finnally achieve my dream of achieving something better in life. But oh my good im terrified. For me college means depression, loniles and being a failure. I dont want to fuck it up again and become the girl who fuck with everyone and did drugs, or the weird girl always quiet and looking down.

So, if you got any advice, i would love to hear then.
Thank you all for reading and I'm so sorry for my spelling, I'm still learning english.

624,"Title pretty self explanatory. We’ve been having some bedroom issues the last few years. We’ve been together for a little over 5 years in these 5 years, we’ve added two kids ( 4 &amp; 2 year old) a house, we got married fast. Our sex life was pretty constant and steady in the beginning but obviously as time and kids were added on, it dwindled. 
He’s frustrating in the bedroom because he doesn’t last long, but at the same time, we don’t have sex anymore. The last time we had sex was 6 months ago. Our problems started because I was getting more and more frustrated with him being selfish in the bedroom. He would always get off but leave me hanging, I would be VERY vocal about what I wanted but honestly I think he was just scared and didn’t know what to do. He has autism and has performance anxiety it now seems. As time went on and since me being vocal and angry he has seemed to have backed off of trying to have sex or try anything.  He probably figures he can get off faster by watching porn than having to bother me. 

I’m not innocent, I’ve had a ton of health issues I’ve been diagnosed with the last two years, POTS, fibromyalgia, ehlers Danlos. I’m always in pain, crabby from my kids, never in the mood and just crabby in general with him. He’s an amazing father and good guy, but he lacks the emotional capacity to know how to do anything romantic or understand how to be affectionate. Again, the autism thing. Anyways, he had a lot on his plate 6 months ago and we tried to have sex and he couldn’t get it up and I made a HUGE deal out of it thinking it was me because I find porn on his phone all the time but when it comes to me he can’t get it up? That was the last time we had sex. 
 
In the middle of the night I took my clothes off cause I was itchy. Our kids woke up early and were in and out of our room this morning so when my husband woke up, he noticed I had no clothes on and tried to have sex with me. It was a recipe for disaster. Our kids were pounding on the door screaming, he couldn’t get it up, there was a lot going on, and it had been 6 months since we’ve had sex and all I could say was really?! 

Am I in the wrong? I mean... 6 months. He keeps telling me he’s really nervous and he feels like he’s going in for a big job interview when he has sex with me. I don’t know why he feels the need to be nervous. He said it’s cause we never have sex. He never lasts long, which I don’t know why cause he freakin’ jerks off constantly. I’m frustrated. Our sex life sucks now after our kids. I don’t think I’m bad looking. Our relationship isn’t even horrible at all, we have a pretty decent marriage minus this sex life. Still to this day he lies about how many girls he’s been with and I know for a fact it’s wrong. I will catch him in lies, I think he’s very inexperienced and is scared because he doesn’t know what he’s doing, but he doesn’t want to learn how to do anything new. ",09Jan2019,1
625,I've done 4 semesters of my college track so far and earned my Liberal Arts and Sciences with around a 3 GPA(Don't have access to exact number atm). While some of it was fun most of the time I was very stressed and not interested in most of my classes even if I thought I would be. I ended up being interested in some of the more complex topics that I thought would be textbook boring but the amount of time I'd need to spend in school to make a profession out of them is one I never imagined doing so I'm kind of sitting in an intersection with infinite roads around me. I have no idea where I want to go. I've always had a passion for writing but realistically I don't think that's a viable option to convince my parents with. I'm just very lost and don't know which direction to take. I've looked at all kinds of salaries from garbage man to personal trainer and I realize I could make a living off them but I'm worried my parents will be disappointed no matter what choice I make considering my two siblings before me graduated in maths fields and make decent money.

-as someone battling back from depression and homelessness who has been self-employed throughout his adult life, I don’t have a record for a lot of these proofs.

-I rent a room and my landlord has offered me one of the utility bills. It is no good to me in its current state, but if I alter it, I can use it as my final proof.

So there’s this guy, and I’m starting to like him. We’re good friends, and I love hanging out with him. However, I really don’t want to like him, or date him, for a couple of reasons. 

1) I’m not allowed to date, according to my parents. Hasn’t stopped me before, but it is a factor. 
2) He was close friends with my ex. Ex no longer goes to school with us (moved) but there’s that. 
3) He dated one of my old friends, and no one knows if they actually broke up. Like, they never acted like a couple, even when they were confirmed dating. Then some things happened and they won’t say anything. I also have classes with this girl, but we’re not as close as we used to be. No big fight, we just grew apart. 
4) We’re juniors. We’re all over worked and stressed and barely have time to sleep, let alone date. 
5) Between clubs and classes, we see each other every day. So there’s no way to “distance” myself. 
6) Due to high school being high school, there are rumors that I like/am dating someone else. None of these are true, but I don’t know if he knows that. 
7) I liked him, past tense. The feeling went away, and we stayed friends, but due to clubs we’ve been hanging out more and now they’re back with a vengeance. He never knew, and he’s never gonna know if I can do anything about it.

640,"We are both twenty year old college students. The relationship we had was a very toxic and dramatic one. She often threatened to hurt herself and then not answer my texts to scare me. She also would log in to my social media, even if I changed the password, and freak out over small things. She also could say some really over the line things to me if she was upset. We fought a lot about other boys, I was uncomfortable with the way she would text them all the time and I thought she was too close to a few of them and my gut feeling was that it wasn’t okay. I received a lot of “it’s your fault you can’t trust me” and “you need to stop being so jealous and controlling”. Near the end of the relationship she was seeing me and another boy at the same time for a while. I found out about it and she dropped me and left me for the other boy. The break up was awful on me for many reasons, she broke up with me over text and said some really mean things to me. She logged on to my Twitter and didn’t like how I was venting to my friends about how she broke up with me. The last thing she ever said to me was “fingers crossed I don’t end up killing myself”.  

I understand in the logical part of my brain that it’s good I got out of the relationship. But I miss her and the good times we had a lot. Some of the happiest memories of my life are with her. Now when I think back on those times I think about the end, and the other guys she might have been talking to at the time, and it makes me feel sad and bad about myself. I know I shouldn’t blame myself or beat myself up over it but it’s difficult for me not to. I have been through break ups before but the process has never been this confusing or painful. Months later I still deal with residual feelings of unworthiness or sadness. I still miss her a lot sometimes and wonder what happened to the sweet person I used to know. The period following our break up was one of the hardest of my life for me, and I say that as someone who has dealt with trauma and abuse before. 

I am starting to wonder if our relationship was maybe a little bit abusive and I need to figure out how to recover from something like that. I feel a lot less confident and happy than I did before I knew her. The words she said to me still ring in my head sometimes and I still have intrusive thoughts about her infidelity. I don’t think it is a normal relationship to get over. If anyone can give me advice on what I need to do to get over these emotions that would help. ",09Jan2019,1
641,"I am broken right now. I can’t control my tears whatsoever, they just flood my face. Like many times before, me and my drunk dad were just yelling at our faces. Police came, gave him a warning (3rd time they came in my life). My mom planned to have her and me to tell him to move.

I am almost 16. I have been dealing with my dad all my life now. Police have come to our home several times now. 

I don’t hate him. I HATE THE ALCOHOL. Don’t get me wrong, when he is sober, he is like the best friend I have. The days whenever my parents get along and as a family (me and little sister included) go out together and eat or something. We genuinely enjoy ourselves ALOT and those are the happiest moments that I want to see continued. My dad without alcohol is a good guy, very funny, and wants the best for everyone and tries to keep us happy.

But when he is drunk and addicted to alcohol, he is my nightmare. He yells in our faces, and I see both of my parents cry. We haven’t had a case where things gone physical since LONG time ago in the past, which my mom has apparently forgives. 

However I have been broken down again (uncontrollably flood of cries, mental meltdown), and only broken down only from when my dad is drunk and the family tears apart. We always been able to temporarily sew our family relationship together, but it ends up tearing again and breaking me. 

I DONT want to see all the saturday morning breakfasts me and my dad used to spend at Dennys go away. Friday nights we as a family before went to go eat (not recently because the drinking has been active). 
I know it kind of sounds selfish. But my dad rarely spends time with me and I dreamed of and yearned for those times again where we would go to the pool, casually eat fast food we enjoy, or even watching TV together. We have done so every now and then when he isn’t busy. I don’t want to see that all gone, disappear forever

Deep down, certain thing is that my mom, sister, and I won’t suffer anymore. The alcohol will be all completely gone. However, my dad himself (sober or not) will be gone. 

My mom and I won’t have to deal immense stress anymore. I feel bad for my dad as well though. Certainly if he moves out, I know he will be heartbroken, destroyed, and turn his life all to alcohol without a single fuck in the world. Eventually he won’t be able to support himself and be without money. Even his mom (grandmother of mine, no longer with us for a long time now) has thanked my mom for keeping him because otherwise he will surely be out on the street. 

The choices
- Mom, me, sister continuously stressed whole life except for times my dad is able to get it together temporarily until things go to hell again

Or

- my dad’s life going to absolute nothing. Everyone else lives happily ever after

He has been drinking for as long as I remember, and more. Decades. He is not willing to accept help from rehab, let alone his own family members. We tried our bestest efforts of now. Some days he just happy that he isn’t drinking and everyone is happy as well. Most days he is just consumed by the alcohol. Some days every bit of him is taken by the alcohol and he unleashes his rants endlessly even if it is 2-3 AM and there is school and work tomorrow until police come

**Important questions**
- Should I tell my dad to move? I don’t want to, hoping for peace one day and because my dad without alcohol is a good guy deep down. Everyone knows.
But everyone knows if his alcohol stays, which I’m convinced it will, everyone is highly stressed.

- If dad moves, how can I help my mom earn money. What jobs can I do as a 16 year old? Both my parents don’t earn much and are struggling. If my dad goes, I don’t think my mom can single handily support the family. 

TL;DR

HOWEVER, despite all of those problems, and all the times I asked family for advice, nothing worked and nothing made him quit (if anything he drinks more than before). Asking Reddit now, how should I make him quit? (I know he wants to, but can’t)

Or should he move out?",09Jan2019,1
642,"Backstory: About a year ago, my coworker (we’ll call him Jack) brought his girlfriend (we’ll call her Jill) to the office on a Saturday. He and I were the only ones scheduled to work that day, so she sat in the office with me while he took care of a few things in the warehouse. We introduced ourselves and made small talk until he was finished and ready to leave. (In case it matters, I’m female.)

A couple of months later, I receive a strange text from a number not saved in my phone. It said things like, “Wow, you don’t really know someone until you live with them!” I called the number to see who this person was that was texting me. She says it’s Jill, and it takes me a couple of minutes to recall who Jill is. She says she couldn’t talk, because she didn’t want him (meaning Jack) to know she was on the phone. She resumed texting and told me that he’d been yelling at her and throwing things at her. I didn’t know this woman, and given the fact that I had to work with Jack daily, I definitely didn’t want to get involved. I asked if she was in any immediate danger to which she said no; she didn’t believe so. 

In the following months, Jack can be heard almost daily on his cell phone; arguing loudly with someone. Of course, we all assume it’s his girlfriend. About a week ago, he indirectly told a few folks, myself included, that the relationship was over as he was spending that upcoming weekend moving things from his house into storage. Jack was normally a nice, funny guy to alll of his coworkers, which is why it caught a few of us off guard when while complaining about the laziness of some of our peers he said, “They wouldn’t be laughing if I brought a gun up here.” My initial thought was that the idea of such a thing was pretty extreme just because a few guys don’t stack their empty pallets and put them away.

Last night, Jill reached out to me again. She explained that he ended up being the meanest and rudest person she’d ever met and that she felt like he was legitimately crazy. She alleged that he did hit her; that she called the police to the scene but ultimately decided not to press charges. She alleged that he threatened to sit in her ex-husband’s driveway until he arrived home from work so he could kill him. She also alleged that he made the statement that he wanted to bring a gun to work and “kill everyone”. Not any particular person but everyone. When I read that, my mind went back to his prior comment about bringing a gun to work.

I shared this information with my manager this morning as I don’t know what his real intentions may be or what he’s capable of. However, my manager doesn’t know what to do with that information or how to proceed.

What should he do? Fire him based on allegations? Discuss the allegations with him despite the risk that letting him know that his coworkers are aware may set him off?

I make a pun (a good ass one) when i see her opening my message and her little bitmoji pops up. ""I caught you 'read' handed"". She says: No, I said no more bad jokes. And blocks me.

645,"Hi Reddit, 
I have been in a bit of a dilemma about a long term friendship I have with someone. I am at a loss about what to do, and this is my last attempt to try and get some alternate perspectives. 
I have been friends with this person, let’s call them Jeremy for around 15 years (we are both 29 now). 
Jeremy had a pretty terrible up bringing. His mother killed herself when he was 12 and he had to go live with his abusive father till he was 18. He has no contact with any family now. 
Jeremy has always used drugs in some capacity. He also has diagnosed ADD. 

Throughout our adolescence, Jeremy was a good, smart friend. He was not without his issues, but who doesn’t have issues as a teenager. 
Jeremy has always been particularly good looking, charismatic and intelligent. He has always had a group of friends that hang off his every word.

As we have gotten older his issues have seemed to increase. He goes through cycles of having problematic relationships, drug use, suicidal tendencies, homelessness, unemployment and demonstrates aggressive, manipulative behaviours. 
To tell the whole story would take hours so I will tell you about what has been happening over the last year or so. 
Jeremy worked as a tradesmen for a few years, this was good, he seemed kind of stable. 
However, he was desperately unhappy. He has always had a lot of friends, however his friends now (apart from a few of us from back in the day) seemed to consist of meth addicts and other people going through some pretty heavy mental health issues. 
Jeremy became quite low and went on a trip to Thailand with some of his problematic friends. During this trip it seems that Jeremy had a breakdown. He called me several times discussing his mother and how he felt about his life. 
Suddenly Jeremy met Anna, a 21 year old girl from German, and fell in love. 
Anna came back home with Jeremy. They were very loved up and it all seemed fine. Anna went back to Germany and soon Jeremy was discussing his plans to marry Anna, although only knowing her for 3 months. Jeremy got some work through me, and borrowed money from me to buy Anna a ticket to come back. 
The day before Anna was meant to get on the plane she called Jeremy and told him she was not coming as she wanted to better prepare herself for her upcoming course at University. 
Jeremy took this very poorly. Although they were still together he began doing meth, quit his job as a tradesmen and met a girl called Sophia (20 years old) who he would do meth with. 
Jeremy began dating Sophia whilst still talking to/dating Anna. 
Another long term friend of Jeremy’s, Josh, reached out to me about his concerns about Jeremy. 
Together we attempted to help Jeremy. We helped him to go overseas with Josh as an attempt to give Jeremy some clarity, which worked for a while and Jeremy is currently not on meth (which is a success for us). 
The issue now is that Jeremy seems to be going backward again. He recently had to stay at my place for several weeks. When he was staying at my house him and Sophia hung off one another like two 18 year olds at a party. Jeremy showed some quite aggressive behaviour toward Sophia. It is quite clear that there is an imbalance of power in their relationship, with Sophia doting on Jeremy no matter how poorly he treats her. 

My concern now is I don’t know  how to help Jeremy anymore. For a while now our friendship has had a strange dynamic. We are not so much friends as I provide Jeremy with emotional and financial support. The issues I discussed above are not isolated events. In the entire time I have known Jeremy he has had equal, if not more dramatic issues. 
It is clear to anyone who knows Jeremy that I act as his biggest support, however at times he can act with aggression toward me. 
Josh has acted as a great support to both Jeremy and I. However he is now moving interstate to begin his career as a doctor. I am also beginning my career as a teacher in a disadvantaged area, and worry about how much time I will be able to dedicate to helping Jeremy (I currently see him several times a week, to check in on him and make sure everything is okay). 
Many of my other friends, and my fiancé have discussed with me their concerns about my friendship with Jeremy, however, although I feel frustrated and tired I don’t think I would be able to cut ties with him. I worry about him constantly and want more than anything to see him achieve what I know he is capable of. I just am at a loss on how to help him. 
Josh has suggested we have a semi intervention with him and has asked me to write down the changes I believe Jeremy needs to make to better his own life. The issue I am having now is I am unsure what to even say. I don’t know where to even begin. 



TL;DR: Long term friend with traumatic past, drug addiction and problematic romantic relationships. 
Need help on what advice to give him to help him finally break the cycle of unhealthy and dramatic behaviours. ",09Jan2019,1
646,"        I’m a seventeen year old kid about to be eighteen in a few weeks. I work for at a movie theatre and have for for nearly two years. The first bit of working there I really enjoyed it and had a good time. The schedules were always decent and posted on time and the managers were great and helpful. But they’ve gotten some new managers over time and new staff. I’m the only person left from the original staff that I used to work with.  
         The new managers and staff just aren’t as good as they used to be. The scheduling goes against availability that we have set up and has extremely long hours(8-10 hour shifts) for a part time job. The customers have begun to complain more because of renovations and new items we have and the new policies have become a pain to follow and keep up with as they’re constantly changing. 
        I’ve been thinking about leaving and looking for a new job elsewhere and have been for quite a few months. I feel as though I’ve gotten all I can from this job and want to move to something different. However, when I mentioned this to my parents they got extremely mad at me and said I’m being ungrateful and “should just tough it out cause work isn’t supposed to be fun”.  I’m not looking for fun. I just want to work somewhere I don’t absolutely dread going to nearly everyday. Am I in the wrong here? Should I stick through it even though I feel unhappy and drained?

648,"Hi all!  My Mom needs advice, and I know how awesome Reddit can be, so here I am.  

So, she bought a new car and after a day or so noticed that it has chips in the paint around the hood.  Just one or two very small ones, no big deal.  She figured they'll just take care of it next time she goes in for a tune-up.  Well, she still has her old car, and they're both registered with the dealer so that she has all their history online and such.  Well, because her new car is registered, she noticed a maintenance notice from last October on how they had to remove the hood and realign it (on a brand new car) because it was causing the paint to chip on the sides somehow.  OK fine.  The problem is, the dealer she bought it from was very rude to her, and she didn't want to buy from them (long story), but now they have also lied to her about this because they told her it was brand new off the line, no problems with it at all.  Um... no, not true.  
Her question is (sorry, long post) should she go straight to the dealer because this is just one more problem lumped on all the other problems, or does she at this point go over their heads because now, not only were they incredibly rude to her, now they have lied and withheld information?  And if she does go over her heads (Toyota) who does she call?  The manufacturer?  
I hope this makes sense... and this is a really big deal to her, she was very excited to have this new car.  

I know.  Humor me.  She's very upset.

Thanks guys.",09Jan2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

About my Situation I am a 19 years old boy who goes to School.

 I changed school one and a half years ago because a had trouble with the people at my last school and came out of a long term depression and social anxiety, which was treated in a clinic. 

So i am just out of realy hard and bad times. I had to deal with this troubles since i am 13 yo and had no or few contact to people in my age or people general.

I changed my personality, the way I deal with problem and how to deal with trouble in my social life. But i never learned how to deal with girls and women. I just had never contact to them and when i was extremly shy (normally i am very confident in disscusions and other topics of life).

And now I have a crush on a girl in my class. I am a person who cares a lot about personality and dealing nice and carefull with all people. The moment when I had feelings for here were as she participated in a Poetry Slam at out school. She has made an own poem , a real personal one, in that moment i felt something similar between us. She may be not the prettiest girl but i don't care about the look of anyone. 

When we talk we mostly talk about topics of deeper meaning things (no small talk) like the society, politics or our life at school and the values we follow. We have a lot of similarities and are often of the same opinion.

But because I have little to no experience in dealing with girls and i am extremly shy when it comes to topics like love I don't know how to react and what I should do about it.

One of my main problems is also that i want to  rationalize it and i try find reasons why somebody would like or even may fall in love with me. But i am not very self confident and i don't have a good opionion on myself. Maybe because i am overweigth and also not pretty. The only thing i have to offer is a good interllect and a openminded and helpfull character. But i think for the most people, especially in my age, charcter is not important .... it's all about the look of someone. Every time i think about this ""why would someone like me"" I despair and lose all my self confidence.

I learned from my hard times in life that seek advice or help is always an option that will help in situation where I don't now any further. So now i am here to ask you for advice. 

How should i deal with the situation?

What can i do to become more confident in contact with girls?

How can i come more in touch with her ?

There is someone who used to be in my life who died. I loved this person a great deal, but for many reasons, we weren't close at the end when he died. 

I have been thinking about him so much lately. It is getting to be an obsession and I realize that it is because I never got to mourn him or say goodbye in any way. 

I'm not close to his family. I tried to contact his sister on Facebook to give my condolences. She never knew me and didn't respond to my message. I am not on speaking terms with any mutual friends or acquaintances.

I was thinking about having a small ceremony for just me to somehow serve as the funeral I couldn't attend. I also thought about making a donation to an appropriate charity in his memory. But I feel like there must be something else I can do to give myself closure and a way to move on with his memory alive in my heart but not on my brain constantly.

Hello, I'm M19 and I've an issue making friends online. I'm not looking for someone special, just friends to play games with and share some similar interests. I have no trouble making friends in real life, I have plenty friends which I can hang out with at any time. 

Few years ago it was pretty much the opposite. I was extremely depressed and antisocial. Spending 14~ hours a day playing games if I had the chance to do so (Never stopped attending school due to it being illegal). I've had plenty online friends which I voice-chatted daily with. Most of them playing the same stuff and around the same age. 

I only speak a very few amount of these people still and I kinda want some new contacts, to play with. But I simply don't know how to anymore. When I enjoy a game with someone and I want to add them, they add me back and after a few days of playing together, I get removed or blocked.

I always try to be as nice as possible and trying not to ""tilt"" (get mad because I play bad). 

Tl;dr: I would love some advice on making online friendships.

657,"I have three years of university under my belt. I decided to drop out to start an electrical apprenticeship because I thought I would need to support my father. The reason being that there was a possibility he was going to be deported.

659,"As the title says, I currently live at home with my parents. I did go away to college for a year but I became severely depressed to the point that I ended up in the hospital when I came back. I decided that particular college wasn't for me. After my hospital stay, I slowly picked myself back up. I went to community college for gen eds and now I'm at a great local college working on my bachelor's in biochemistry. I have about another year until graduation.

So that all sounds great, but my dad and I butt heads a lot. He's always yelling at me about something. Today it was that I was taking a nap and fell back asleep when he had asked me to help carry in the groceries. Now I admitted my mistake and apologized, but he just kept going. He threatened to take away my access to a car. He pointed out that I'd gained weight and picked apart my ""unhealthy lifestyle."" Should I start eating better and go to the gym? Yeah. But every time I build up the motivation to do so, one of my parents will lecture me about my weight and I'll lose that motivation. (I'm 23F and weigh about 200 pounds, not ideal but not obese). Anyway, my dad is always yelling at me or lecturing me about something. And this has been a recurring theme in my life, to the point that I cry during or after every time this happens. 

Therefore, I genuinely hate living here. But I don't know what to do. I don't think I have a choice. I'll have to live here at least for the next year and a half, or whenever I find a decent job after graduation. Moving out is not an option because I only have about $5k and no job, because my anxiety makes it hard to work and go to school. My parents also pay for my schooling, so if I moved out, I would have no way to pay for it, as they would surely stop paying. My best friend lives with her boyfriend so that's not an option. My boyfriend and I have been together for less than three months, and although I love him, I don't want to put the stress of living together on our relationship so soon. 

So I need some advice. Am I stuck in this situation? If so, what can I do to make it more bearable? I want to feel comfortable where I live, not waiting to be yelled at every second I'm here. Any suggestions?

P.S. I've tried talking to both my parents about the yelling but they basically tell me to suck it up so I don't think it's going to stop.",09Jan2019,1
660,"He's 13. I can hear your angry comments now. 

I know this makes me seem like a dick, but I can demonstrate why I think his phone is ruining his life. 

In November of 2017, we got him his first phone. It was an LG V20. He was previously in an advanced mathematics course that he was one of the top students in, scoring above 95% on each test. He then did so poorly on all the exams in the second half of the year that he was removed from the program. He spent every single day once he got that phone on YouTube, on Netflix, watching Life Hacks and slime videos for months. He lost so many points for not doing his homework it was unreal. He ended the year with no As, and he didn't feel a shred of remorse when he was removed from the program and even said ""now I'm in an easier class so I don't have to work"". The obvious implication is that he wants more time to screw around. 

It's now January 2019, more than a year since we got him his phone, and my parents seem to have given up. I didn't do so hot in high school, and I know my brother is vastly smarter than I am and could easily fulfill his dreams by actually caring. He's expressed wanting to go to Brown before, and even knows about their connection to Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) for Architecture and graphic design, among other things, so it's not that I'm foisting my hopes upon him. He's blazingly smart and could honestly be valedictorian if he cared, but he doesn't. He spends literal hours just watching TV shows, and it's even affected his performance in tennis as he rarely eats more than a sandwich or a slice of pizza before scampering up to his room to play on his phone some more. It's affecting his schoolwork, his eating habits, his athletic ability and may end up ruining his life.

I've been through many relationships for the past 6 years, none of them shorter than 6 months and the longest being 2 years. 

I keep giving all my heart and accepting everything, forgiving all of their flaws while we're together, which pushes boys aside. My parents tell me so, too. Today my boyfriend broke up with me after months of emotional abuse (for example, he once made me walk through the house naked because he thought I lied to him). He broke up with me because apparently he wasn't happy with me. He also stated that he does not suffer and we will never meet again.

The break up is not the problem. I can deal with being dumped by someone who treated me so badly.. However, I don't know how to be single without becoming desperate. I've been jumping from relationship to relationship for so long and everytime a break-up happened, I felt desperate to not remain single.

Soooo, yeah.. I (24f) am starting a support group next week and I’m terrified. It’s been nearly 20 years since the abuse first started and I’ve never really been able to talk about it. I haven’t told my family mostly because my mom is the sweetest human and i know she would blame herself. She also had a stroke a couple years ago and i can not be the reason something like that happens again... 

I tried therapy back in highschool after a friend passed away, but never was able to talk about my childhood. I’ve been able to tell friends and past significant others it’s happened, but i’ve never actually talked about it out loud. The guy i’m seeing now is extremely supportive, i trust him, and i’ve definitely never been so comfortable with someone. But still, i cannot bring myself to talk to him about it. Any time i’ve ever felt like i needed to talk it’s like words just escape me. Like there’s a total block there. 

I guess i’m scared that i either won’t be able to talk about it or i’m scared that reopening these old wounds will throw me in a downward spiral.

I just cannot live like this anymore. I mean i feel like the majority of the time i’m okay and i can handle it, but then there are those days i feel like the most screwed up human being. I go through phases where weeks at a time i’ll constantly have flashbacks &amp; nightmares. And small things trigger me. And in those moments i feel like the only way to make it all stop is to end my life.. And i don’t want that for myself anymore.
I feel like i’ve worked really hard to get to where i am, most of the time i am actually very happy and i don’t have the “poor me” attitude like i did when i was younger... But i’ve also shoved everything so deep down that i’m scared it will all come back up at some point, if i don’t get this figured out. I really want to get married and start a family some day, but i want to unload as much of my “baggage” as i can before that happens. I want to be the best &amp; strongest version of myself for my future family, as cheesy as that might sound..

I guess i’m just wondering if there’s anyone else out there who was in a somewhat similar situation? Talking about trauma several years after the fact
Did it actually help? 
Is it worth the risk?",09Jan2019,1
669,"I was once very confident and had a solid unbreakable frame (more or less). 

Girlfriend broke up with me 5 months ago for no reason no closure aka stopped loving me / was interested in someone else probably. 

Anyways, I went pretty insane, writing essays after essay for myself on why she did what she did, now looking back on it, I straight up went crazy.l and I’m glad my friends helped me through it. 

Started dating new girl for a month but we weren’t a match. Thoughts of EX vanished as mind was preoccupied with new girl, tried to recreate my ex within my mind with this new girl I think. 

Anyways, now I’m back to not deeply talking to any girl specifically and my mind goes back to the love of my life, my ex. 

I am getting panic attacks where I literally can’t breathe and feel like I am dying whenever the thoughts of her pop into my head, my heart skips beats or I forget to breathe, and it jolts/shocks/burns. 

When I hear songs on the radio which are mostly pop love songs, or any music really, I think about her. 

Idk what the fuck to do. 

I was once a strong guy mentally and physically , and now I’m some frail shorty version of myself, lost a bunch of weight(muscle), constantly getting sick, barely eating, no sun, probably low testosterone now. 

Currently just talking to random girls on tinder for casual sex but it isn’t helping at all and I fucking hate it. 

Need advice please. 

I think my soul or mentality is fucked. Once I love them, I love forever, and now I will have never ending heartache for the rest of my fucking life. 

It feels like my body is on the border of GIVING UP. Like if I were to get into a car accident right now / coma, my body would probably give up instead of fight for survival. 

TLDR: 
Heartache won’t go away after months, I will love her forever, can’t stop getting panic attacks getting worse, feel like I am disintegrating. ",09Jan2019,1

672,"  Hi, I’m 14, I live in Utah and I want to go to Woodstock 2019. No, scratch that, I need to go to Woodstock 2019. 

  I have spent the better part of my life listening to long dead bands and musicians, yearning to have been alive to have been able to see Jimi Hendrix or the dead live. I know this festival may not be close to the magic that was Woodstock, and probably is a solely an attempt to cash in on the Woodstock name, but I know that if I don’t see this festival I will regret it for the rest of my life.

  I have worked how I could get to New York, by train. I have enough money saved to be able to afford this whole venture, and I’m not afraid of the repercussions of my actions. 

  What are your thoughts reddit? What could go wrong here?

673,"Before I get into this, let me just give you some backstory. My boyfriend (22M) and I (21F) have been together for a little over a year, but we’ve been best friends for 3 years. He is the sweetest, most genuine, loyal and caring person I know. He treats me so well and always supports me in every aspect of my life. We genuinely love each other with all of our hearts and are very serious about our relationship. 

I lost my virginity to him about a year ago so sex to me is very special. I was basically waiting for the right person, and I am glad I waited until him. Our sex life has always been great and super respectful. He’s very caring and basically selfless during sex because all he really cares about is making me happy and being close to me. But the other night, something happened that has never happened before.

We started to hook up after seeing a movie and things were going fine. We were touching each other passionately and we wanted to have sex. But when he got on top of me from behind and started to thrust into me, he covered my mouth and said “shut the fuck up” twice in my ear. Before I continue, I want to mention that we do dirty talk &amp; have rough sex talk sometimes because I’m into it if I’m in that kind of mood, but he’s never said that exact phrase before. I also didn’t think we were being rough that night, I thought the vibe was passionate. So when it happened, my body completely froze up. And I got so scared. After a couple of seconds, I said “wait..I didn’t like that” and immediately burst into tears. It’s like my body just shut down on me completely. I’ve never felt anything like that before but I genuinely felt like I was being raped, which I’ve thankfully never experienced. I was sobbing and my body was shaking and he immediately stopped and held me and kept repeating my name and “I’m so sorry. I’m so so sorry baby, I would never hurt you. I’m so sorry. I love you.” Which was comforting because I could tell he was really freaked out and felt so awful for hurting me. But it took me like 20 minutes to calm down and look at him without feeling scared or weak. I felt like an injured animal or something....

We talked about it and he apologized sincerely and said that he thought I wanted him to be more aggressive during sex and that’s why he did it, which I have mentioned before but we didn’t establish a line to not cross. And we definitely found it.  He feels terrible and said he’ll never say that sentence again, which I know he won’t. This whole experience was just very crazy and unexpected, and I thought I’d share. If there are any other women who have gone through something like this, I’d love to hear how you dealt with it. 

Always establish boundaries with your partner before being sexually intimate and NEVER make someone feel like their feelings are invalid. Communicate!!!!! Men, always ask your partner before you do anything out of the ordinary. Pick up on body signals and be attentive of your partner’s emotions and safety. I’m grateful that my boyfriend cares about me so much. I’m making sure this never happens again.",09Jan2019,1
674,"Hi r/advice,
I'm a high school freshman, and my parents split up 4 years ago. A year after that, my mom had her boyfriend move in to our house. He's a douchebag, but that's not the point. He's always expressing how bad of a kid my brother and I are, and just being a key in general. He hasn't hit me or done anything physical except for one time last year. One day around noon, I accidentally woke him up, and he proceeded to chase after me. I ran into the bathroom (only room in the apartment with a lock) and locked the door. He kept screaming and hitting the door. Once he cooled down a bit and went back to bed, I snuck out of the bathroom and saw a huge hole in the bathroom door. It was a 10"" diameter circle. My mom said I had it coming because he was tired, but then again she was raised in Cuba where that kind of stuff is normal. I didn't really like the guy before, but since that event I've tried to communicate with him as little as possible. It's like I have a stranger living in my own home. I don't know what to do. My mom says he's a great guy because he works hard to provide, even though he doesn't speak English (lived here for 10 years) and works for Uber (minimum wage). She is a dentist that really brings in the money for the family. I've felt pretty fucked up since he tried breaking down the door, and I've been going to a therapist recently. I don't know if this is classified under child abuse under MA law. Could you guys help me out? What I've been doing for a long time is just ignoring him. On a side note, my mom is starting to act like him in some ways, like being very loud, getting angry at small things, and not even letting me be in her bedroom very long.
Thanks for the advice guys, I really am stuck.",09Jan2019,1

Abit of backround first - Im 16 currently and right now living in London with my mum, she moved when i was 12 i think i dont remember that well and when she moved she promised she would take me soon and that soon turned into not so soon 4 years and i waited and i wanted to move really badly because when she moved it fucked me up and i was with my grandma and i love her but living with her was really toxic and i fell into depression and my mental health in general was fucked, i had 1 really good friend and thats it but last year i got better and last summer i actually got more friends and all of us are really tight i started to revive my social life and actually go out etc but in september i moved to london and now i regret that, i went back for holiday in december and i was talking with the “popular” kids and i was going out alot and i was loving my time there i even got my first gf during that time and of course i had to go back. also my great grandma lifes there and i love her i know that not many people meet their great grand parents ive met most of mine and while both of my great grandas have passed both of my great grandmothers are still alive back in my home country. Well the one great grandma im the closest to has many health problems and as much as i hate to say this but she has a max of couple of months left in her and shes suffering while im here, thinking about that puts a stain on me mentally.I honestly want to move back but i dont know how my mum will react and if i move back i need to find a school in the middle of the school year and my mum will need to find a job, atleast we still have a flat there that is being used by a relative so that would be a problem. Im sorry if this is unorginised and any advice on what i should do would be greatly appriciated. And sorry about the spelling mistakes",09Jan2019,1
676,"Hello everyone, so i am 23 yrs old and i started smoking when i was around 16. After 5 years of smoking, when i was 21, i had some problems with my gallblader and my liver and got kinda sick for a while. In that period every time when i tried to smoke i would throw up and so i didn't smoke for about 2 weeks. 

After seeing that i could not smoke for 2 weeks and be fine with it i gave it up entirely and in March i will have 2 full years of not smoking.

Now i can say with almost certainty that if not for my sickness i would still be a smoker. But now that i am not, the fact that my friends are smoking around me is bothering me very much. 

I know i sound like a hypocrite and i think i am one, but i can't help it. I told them they can no longer smoke at my house (only on the balcony) and in my car but most of the time when we are not going out we spend time at one of my friends house and he has no problem with people smoking there as he is a smoker himself. In the warmer months of the year is almost fine as with the windows open it barely bothers me, but still does a little anyway. However in the winter the air  can get kinda thick with smoke and it bothers me a lot. I feel like i made the right choice and gave up smoking only to still suffer its consequences because of my friends.

This being said i feel like it would be very unreasonable of me to tell them ""Hey i don't want you to smoke around me anymore."". So i am in a bit of a pickle. 

Thank you all for reading and i wish you a great day.",09Jan2019,1

678,"I live in a room with other people that I didn't know before, as the land lord accepted us. There's this girl with her two other friends. She's really great, and I'd like to get to know her better and hope to develop a good friendship. I only really talk to her when I run into her near the house or if out paths cross in the kitchen. She loves travelling and experiencing cultures around the world. We are of the same age. How can I go about this? ",09Jan2019,1
679,"In 2017 I was in a relationship with this girl I know since preschool. Had one night with her sister (so got a second sister, too) 10 years ago as well, but haven't got deeper because they were (are) known to be Maneater and the prettiest girls in town. My ex was aware and ok with this.
Anyway.
On one day she texted me, that she has depression and can't see me right now. I was devastated. I missed her and I missed her daughter. 4 weeks later she texted me again. Say, how much she miss me and whatnot. Naive me startet to meet her again...until 4 weeks later. Almost the same text. I was devastated again, but got that it's over now. I'm pretty sure she fucked every cock grabable and cheated on me regularly. After that I was confronted from various people about topics I never spoke about in public. I'm pretty sure to know what that means. 
2 weeks later my niece, who is practically my little sister, because we were raised together and are only 7 years apart knew what has happened. Our whole youth and her young adulthood (I'm almost 30) we had a close relationship.
1 week after the final breakup my niece sits with my ex in a bar, laughing, taking shots, dancing. My best friend sent me a video of them. 
 They knew each other superficial back then. Now my niece works with her. My ex sometimes said mean things about my niece, when we were still together. I defensed my niece and said to my ex that she should tell her in her face instead of saying such in front of me and more importantly behind her back. 
Since my niece started her new job I completely broke contact to my her. I don't want my ex to know the slightest bit about me, I don't want to know the slightest bit of her and I just can't forgive my niece. I just can't and nobody in my family seems to understand my point of view. They even say my point of view is ""pathetic""
I don't get it? Is my point really that off?
I still love my niece to death, but no one this close hurtled me like she did. I don't know how to go from here. I can't even talk to my niece and show her my point of view in fear that she tells my ex and my ex tells my whole town. My parents had a well known store and it's important for them to have a good reputation.

Just one or two things more: a few days after the breakup i found an old picture of my dad and a woman I never saw in my car. Probably an affair of his. My ex probably stashed it there so I can learn things I never wanted to know. I asked him about it and he denied it ofc. Oh, and her mum fucked my grandpa (!) when he was 60 and she was 20 or something. Someone told me and my dad confirmed it more or less.

I'm sorry this post is chronological not well ordered and I'm sorry for my (probably) bad English. Feel free to ask questions if you want. ",09Jan2019,1
680,"I am a bisexual male and I recently started a new position at a car dealership doing noncommissioned sales. This industry is filled with Type A males and when customers aren't around, they cuss.
