1,"So I somewhat recently started a new job in the warehouse/distribution center of a local plumbing company. It's my first job in a long time, since I had some personal issues keeping me from working for quite a while. (I'm willing to go into more detail if anyone asks, but I won't include it in the body of the main post) Everyone there has been friendly and accepting of me, and it's gone smoothly so far. It's a fairly small business, but there's still a decent handful of people that go in and out each day. I've been at it for about a month, however because of the initial stress and focus I was putting on learning *how* to do this new job, I didn't really internalize the names of majority of the other people working there when I was introduced to them. I know my boss' name and his wife's name, but that's about it.

People don't wear name tags or any kind nor have a personal desk I could look at for some name plate or other source, my job doesn't require the use of any company computers so I don't have access to any files that could help there, and there's nothing at all like an ""employee of the month"" type display or large group picture of everyone with identifiable names associated to them. At the moment those are the only types of things I could think of to find them out indirectly.

While if I must, I will accept that I need to just bite the bullet and be honest that I messed up, if there's a way to avoid that awkward moment I would love to take that route. Not only to save myself that embarrassment, but also because I don't want to give off the impression that I don't like/care about the people or this job, especially because it couldn't be farther from the truth! I'm very thankful that I was given this opportunity after recovering and being out of work for an extended period of time, and I would hate for my appreciation of the situation to be questioned.

Anyway, feel free to ask any clarifying questions that may be needed to help me further. And whether you are able to help me or not, thank you for your time regardless and hopefully your day goes well! ♥",04Oct2019,2
2,"This happened when I was a freshman in highschool. It's always bothered me because I can't decide if it was rape or just a teenager with low self esteem that was too curious for her own good. Just a truly weird situation because I think I wanted some type of connection with this guy. We stayed in contact after it happened because of ME. I think I just wanted to understand.

I'll list the posts in order. It's only necessary to read the first 3 to understand the situation. They are very cringey, this was  14 year old me with a heavy case of anxiety.

I also have the messages from me messaging him years later, asking him if he thought he raped me. A few years after this in college a guy took advantage of my drunken state and I gave him head for about 1 minute until I busted into tears. The next morning, I searched the entire town looking for him. I always want answers from men who do things like this to me and I don't understand why.",04Oct2019,2
3,"I’m relatively young, still in my teens, awkward as all hell and socially inept. I really wanna ask this girl out, and so far all we do is talk loads on the way home from school and we are going to a festival this Sunday (hopefully) but, please help?",04Oct2019,1
4,"People seem to hate me. I don't know why, I'm pretty nice and have a positive energy, but about 90% of people at my school just ignore me. I'm non-existent and I'm sick of it. I'm so sick of the people who ignore me because they are ""better"" than me, and I'm so tired of rude and selfish people. I'm ""that"" kid in class who never has a partner for their projects, doesn't talk, and the person who everyone walks over. I want to speak up but I don't know how. 

Hoping for advice.",04Oct2019,0
5,"So after high school I went to a different country and went for pilot training. It took me a bit more than a year to do my PPL and I finally got my license. The idea was to get a CPL after this and work for a couple of years before returning to my home country (we have a family business there)
There is no scope of aviation there, and I don’t think aviation is the field for me, so I was thinking of changing my path and going for a college degree instead. I think this will:
1.	Improve my thinking, speaking and writing ability. (I only learnt to fly a plane)
2.	Give me a decent social life (made no real friends during my PPL as my routine was to fly with captain and come back home)
3.	Give me a bit more predictable and scheduled life so that I can invest my time in other activities. (I could literally get called for a flight anytime any day)
4.	Likelihood of more security and stability as I would have a college degree which can be more or less useful in my home country. 
5.	I want to return to my home country anyway after my education might as well study something that will improve me as a person. 


I think I have wasted so much of my free time coz I didn’t have a schedule when I was doing my PPL and everything was so unpredictable I couldn’t stick to any other activity. 

What do you guys think? Am I being unreasonable or hasty?

I want to learn and improve my cognitive ability and make me a better person.",04Oct2019,2
8,"I'll try to keep it as short as possible. I'm studying CS because I want to be a app and web developer. I want to make algorithms that analyze data and behave based on it. My ""dream"" or ""goal"", is to start a developing company that makes their own products (apps, programs, websites) trying to innovate in different markets and areas, and also helps clients on building their own apps. That's it. I have no interest on programming out of that. This is why I'm studying my major.

However, I overestimated the program. The entirety of the first two semesters form part of what they call the ""Exploration Phase"". Hence why I'm having classes with people from majors like Robotics and such. And since we're all technically studying to be engineers, we're having physics. Tons of it. I took very few physics on high school, and honestly, don't remember anything, but somehow thought that I would someway manage to survive.

And I'm surviving as of right now. But I feel no pride or honor on what I'm doing to do it. I do little to no work in group projects because I spend too much time trying to understand the concepts we're seeing in class, while my classmates are working on their advances. I spend hours and hours on simple homeworks, and stress a damn lot trying to go along with the class during classes. I'm already going with a tutor and trying to learn more online, but honestly, it's excruciating. I envy people on other major having the time of their lives.

This struggle has made me doubt my major a fuckton. I know for sure that after the first year, classes will finally be focused 100% on programming, but I don't know I'll be able to make it there. I also don't know if I'm willing to sacrifice my mental health even more (I've been having serious mental problems since July) until May, when the second semester ends. I also don't feel a 100% sure that this is my vocation. I was always more attracted to studying humanities on high school but changed my mind during the last semester.

As of right now, we're only taking one programming class (Python basics), and that class is the best 2 hours of my week. I enjoy learning, I enjoy doing the homeworks, and I even practice by myself, but I'm by no means the best of my class. I'll argue that I'm probably not even on the top 10 (that class is made of 30 people). I wonder everyday if I'm doing the right thing, if I'm not wasting my time.

What do you guys think?",04Oct2019,2
9,"I bought some items off of the e-commerce site Superbuy where you can buy goods from various Chinese websites and have them shipped abroad. I wanted to ship my items to an address in China where my grandmother lives and have them be picked up by a relative that was visiting China to circumvent paying high shipping costs. Anyway, because my billing address and shipping address were different, it could not be shipped to a Chinese address as it was deemed ""high risk"". I went to their support live chat and after talking with them, they said that it could be shipped if I sent a picture with ID and the debit card I had used to pay for the items. I sent them a picture that had the front sides of both my driver's license and debit card. I realized immediately after that this was a huge mistake and am terrified that someone could use my driver's license number to commit identity fraud. What should I do to respond to this mistake? Can I change my driver's license number? Can I change my debit card number? I am 19 years old and have no idea how any of this works.",04Oct2019,3
10,"It's senior year of high school and college app season. I'm taking one really hard class, calc 3, taught through our community college but held at school. I have two other AP classes and another engineering class but they aren't too bad at all. Really, it's the calc class.

The class is boring and awful and while I kinda understand things, I also don't understand some parts, yet then I'll be bored when the teacher spends twenty minutes explaining something easy. I think part of the stress is that I'm with all the most smart kids who are amazing and super talented and I'm constantly comparing myself. Theyre doing other homework in that class because they're bored and understand everything. And on top of that, it's college app season and everyone is talking about all the work they have to do for apps, giving me a lot of stress as well. 

I don't know where I want to go so I'm kinda stuck with my apps and haven't worked on them in a while, but I'm probably applying to like 15-20 schools, which is a huge feat. Everyone else applying to that many schools is doing so much work everyday while I'm doing nothing. 

The problem is that I have horrible procrastination. And on top of that, I get so anxious and overwhelmed, especially when I'm stressed, that I just avoid my work. So rather than just doing a bit of work and being behind, I've gotten so stressed and overwhelmed that I'm now just literally avoiding everything.

I've been stressed and unhappy and hating myself more than ever these past two weeks. I go to school with more sleep than usual since I'm sleeping a bit earlier (though still too late) since I'm not doing any work. I'm literally doing no work and sleeping more, but I go to school and still feel stressed and tired. I haven't done y of the work, but I'm feeling just as drained. I literally feel like I've done hours of work when I've done nothing. Everyone complains about how stressed and busy they are and I agree, then feel guilty when I realize I've done nothing all these weeks.

It doesn't help that I don't have anything to do for fun, so I just go home and sit on my phone not even having fun, just being bored and occasionally sleeping and feeling exhausted and existential. I'm getting so so stressed about college deadlines coming up and we have our first calc test Monday, but I literally haven't done any work. I think I just sit here stressed and get practically just as drained.

What do I do? I do think I need professional help for other issues, so I'm trying to have my mom help me look into therapy, but I'm just so lost and overwhelmed and stressed and hating myself and life. Everything sucks so much. Any help guys??",04Oct2019,2

13,"When me and my boyfriend get into arguments and disagreements, he controls when we communicate by turning his phone off or blocking me so I can’t call/text, removing his location (iPhone), blocking me on social media and controlling when I can and cannot come over to his house even if it was previously planned. I feel like this is kind of controlling and manipulative because for some reason when he blocks me on everything it really hurts my feelings and I don’t know if he knows when I know he’s blocked me. I just don’t say anything. We pissed each-other off the other night and I called the morning after to just to wish him a good day and he hung up on me then texted me “if you want any chance of contacting me in the future, u should leave me alone” this was two days ago so I’m over it but to keeps things level I haven’t contacted him except for texting him “happy national boyfriend day”. I wasn’t gonna text him this at first but then I remembered he made girlfriend’s day really special for me so I’m not gonna pretend I don’t know him. Anyway I want to call him but I feel I’ll just piss him off more. I just wanna settle whatever this is but I feel he’s still angry and will do something dramatic.  I do feel overwhelmed by his narcissism sometimes. But with that in mind I’m not a perfect girlfriend and when im moody i instigate most arguments and lie to make him jealous or to get his attention :/",04Oct2019,1
14,"During the start of my freshman year I moved to a new school. At my old school I had plenty of friends, but when I moved something within me changed and I got really scared of taking to new people. I'm now a sophomore and for the past 1 and 1/2 years I've only ever had sparse conversation with most people and I've only been ""friends"" with 2 people who recently ditched me. I'm past the point of being scared to talk to new people but I can't really start to talk to new people without them asking ""so why are you talking with me?"". I've basically made a name for myself as the quiet kid, and now I'm tired of it. I just want to make some good friends. 

FYI I'm in band and soccer (I'm acquainted with the people but they aren't open to hanging out outside of that or talking often ): so joining a new club or sport isn't an option.",04Oct2019,2
15,"16 yr old high school dude here.

So I’m gonna ask my best friend (and gay crush) for his number tomorrow. I’ve been meaning to do this for like, the past 3 days now but I get scared everytime that he’s gonna reject me, or think I’m weird, because I may think we’re closer than he does. Irrational, I know, but I just can’t shake those feelings. 

Best way to ask for his number? Other than straight up just asking him for it out of nowhere? Like, how do I naturally bring it up in conversation?

16,"So I was on omegle and was horny as hell. Met this girl who instantly was like hey you're cute and we talked. Things escalated and she started dancing nude. Eventually, I showed my dick for like few seconds, then she said Im gonna go on to my bed. She then switched her camera, went to her bed and then the chat got disconnected. I've never shown my dick online but for some reason I did that time. I gave her none of my info but my face was shown unfortunately. Should I be worried? I'm scared about what could happen.

I buy her food often and my friends and I have to persuade her to eat it, and it takes over an hour sometimes. She says that sometimes all she has over the weekend is coffee. She also tells me that she barely gets more than 2 hours of sleep and might have insomnia. I keep telling her to see a doctor, but she doesn't believe that ""you need a doctor for those things."" She says that she's been doing this for 3 years but, I know for a fact she's only been doing this for 2 months. What do I do?",04Oct2019,1
19,"So, I have always been a crier. Every movie, commercial, even sappy songs. It was almost endearing when I was growing up.

But now as an adult, I feel like it’ll set me back in my career. I just get overwhelmed so easily my emotions, whether it’s gratefulness, happiness, anxiety, or sadness, my heart feels heavy and I uncontrollably cry. Not a few tears, unfortunately, but more like waterfalls.

Recently, I had a slip up at work, and I knew I effed up. And I talked to my boss, and he expressed that he was disappointed in me. I recognized that I was in the wrong, why/what I did wrong, and knew how I could improve going forward. Still, though, I started crying. I hate disappointing people but I didn’t think this was that big of a deal of a conversation that I would cry a lot in front of my boss. Yet I did. I was so embarrassed. I’m young and new to the company, and I want to establish myself as strong and stable...and this was the last thing I wanted. I couldn’t stop myself.

I was so apologetic and tried to reassure my boss that I just often can’t control my emotions. While he said it was okay and he understood, I still am afraid he’d perceive me as basically child-like for not having a better hold of my emotions.

Now, I have a periodic work review coming up with the same boss, and I have been anxious about it. I want to have an open conversation and hear constructive advice from him, but I’m afraid I’m going to cry...just because I always do.

I’m wondering if anyone has any advice on how I can stay composed at this meeting and going forward. Therapy is probably going to be an important step but I’m on a really terrible health care plan right now and I can’t afford it. I hope to be on a better plan next year and actually go to therapy then. 

Other info: I was diagnosed w anxiety and depression, and I used to take meds for them. I’ve been moving a lot in the past three years though and finding a new doctor m/renewing prescription for that hasn’t been affordable, so I’ve been off my meds for about two years. I’d say I was the same level of emotional even when I was medicated. 

I’d appreciate any advice! Thank you.",04Oct2019,8
20,"It’s been 7 years. I still think about him from time to time, and always wish that I’d run into him again one day, either to get back together (far-fetched) or just say hi and have a good brief conversation. Regardless, I would still love to see him again one day. 

He lives decently far away, in a big city. I doubt I’d ever just “casually” run into him, it would probably have to be a planned date. We don’t talk, haven’t talked in about 6 years, so I know it would be out of line and completely out of the blue to try to plan something like that.....even contacting him seems risky. 

Based off his two pictures on Facebook (he isn’t active on social media, which maybe just leaves room for my imagination?) he has a girlfriend. I don’t really know much else about him and what he’s been up to in 6 years. That’s a long time. And I’ve been doing a lot, I’ve been in serious relationships, I’ve gotten a degree and made new friends, lost friends, lost family members, .....just so much of life has happened. I’m not naive, and I know that we are both different people now. 

But I still love him, or at least the memories of him. I truly thought he was my soulmate when we were together. The breakup was sudden, but in good taste. (He lived decently far away from me, and I was still kind of young and under my parents rules, it was hard to visit, so he broke up with me to let me mature and enjoy college).
I still believe that he’s my soulmate. I’m just so scared to actually do anything about it. I’ve been burying the feelings of longing, of old love, of dissatisfaction with my current lover. No one will live up to my first love. 

I’ve had these feelings for 7 years. They come in waves, and when they’re strong, they overwhelm me. I write poems about him. I sing the songs that we used to sing together. I dream about meeting him again one day, and everything just falling into place. 

I enjoy these feelings. I cherish the memories. I don’t really want to completely move on, and honestly at this point I don’t think I ever will. 

Do these feelings ever get easier, would it be a embarrassment to try contacting him, should I just believe that fate can help? Should I let these memories go and move on forever? 

Advice, anecdotes, even just references to fiction stories would be appreciated! 

TL;DR: I miss my first love from 7 years ago. I know we’re different people now, but I still feel a longing to be with him and I always have. What should I do with these feelings?",04Oct2019,5

25,"Hello! I work for a vastly growing law firm in the Southwest (don’t want to get too specific here😅). I was hired with an entry level job doing the work no one wanted to do. This was at the beginning of the year. It was just my supervisor and me in this specific department. Three months later, my supervisor got promoted and I took her job (minus the supervisor title). No pay increase. They added two other people to the department, and even though I wasn’t necessarily their supervisor, I delegates tasks and was the middle man between us and my old supervisor (she had more people to manage). Now they are changing up our roles so instead of one person in doing one task each, we are all doing ever task but only for specific attorneys. I guess all you need to know is that this adds more responsibility to each of us...but I haven’t heard anything about our pay. I know I haven’t been there a year but this is the second time my role has changed. Should I bring up a raise? How should I bring it up? When should I bring it up?

26,"My boyfriend and I have been living in an apartment for 8 months now. The people here are usually very nice and it's been good. We recently adopted two very young kittens and they're been walking around in our hallway to get used to living here. We have to close the doors to the other rooms connected to the hallway. It is a bit old here and there, so our doors are hard to close and make a sound when you do close them. 

A few days ago, our neighbour told us he heard some noise, we were more careful with out doors and we felt it was going well. We are also talking to the landlord about getting new doors. 

Skip to yesterday evening. It was 11:30pm and the person who lived below us knocked on the door. He told us we had been keeping him awake for days already and that he was getting annoyed. He wanted to fix it between us so he wouldn't have to call the landlord. We were already quiet, sitting on the couch. The only thing he could've heard is us closing the doors in a normal way, but maybe twice. 

We got pretty pissed after he left. He has been at our door complaining before, at 11pm while I was asleep and my boyfriend wasn't home. He asked if ""my husband was home"" when he opened the door and then said he heard noise and wanted to sleep AT 11 PM. We can hear his TV at night as well. 

Today, I was scared to make a noise. I was alone all day and I literally tiptoed. I even went to the bathroom as little as possible. I turned the TV sound so low I needed subtitles to follow the story. After 10pm, I was almost whispering everything I said. I really don't want to piss our neighbour off, but this is not a healthy way of living.

The culture, the people, the way someone can take their imagination and bring it into reality really brings a smile to my face.

Ive also had a knack for cooking and it seems recently I keep hearing the same question when I cook for others or share it on social media. Why didn’t you become a chef/have you thought about culinary school?

Once he left, he apparently sent her flowers like 5 times when he was gone for roughly a week and a half. When he's here, she completely shuts down as a person. I had no idea that he had left other than the fact that she became the same girl I knew while taking the online class overnight (funny, able to have a conversation, caring). This lasted a week and a half or so, and regardless whether or not she rejected me, she is so much more animated and just seems less miserable when he's not in the area. 

During the week he was gone, we spent a lot of time together because of tests that we needed to prepare for and also signing up for some clubs to put on our resumes. She told me about her relationship and how much he does (flowers, following her around etc.) and complains about it because he's all over her and she just wants him to give her space. She still won't truly call him her bf and basically says ""ig he is, idk"" every time it's brought up. When hearing that the thing I can't stand in a relationship is a gf that's too clingy she says that that sounds amazing to her and that all of her relationships are to serious. My other friends I've made here as well as our mutual friends say that we're cute together and that we should be dating, while others just flat out assume we are. I'm *definitely* not sold on the idea of dating her, but it felt really good to have her back again. 

But alas, the bf returns and I didn't even know except for the fact that I said 'Hi' to her multiple times and she ignored me each time until in the hallway and I said hey, she made eye contact and kept walking. Then I saw him, the little mouse boy scurrying behind her trying to get her attention. He's been here for the past few days. We went from spending the *entire* day together to not talking at all until today in the one class where he cannot come in due to a lack of space and she was the lifeless, miserable form of herself. This may not be fair because I couldn't even bring myself to talk to her past pleasantries; I wasn't being the most open and friendly person. But when she asked me for help on the exercises in class, I helped her-- I wasn't being rude by any means. She ended up leaving the classroom without saying bye or anything to me, and it really sucks when you help her prepare for the tests and talk about each other's lives and then just to get reduced to the friendship level of a distant acquaintance periodically.

So this post is partially to vent (which is why it's so long and boring LOL), but also to understand where to go from here. I feel like I'm getting used right now, as I get substantially better grades than her and learn and pick up new material much faster than she does. While it does help me a lot to explain the concepts to someone else, as it solidifies them in my head, it feels awful to think that she's just using me for grades and as a personal free tutor.

So, what do I do? To me there are four options:

1. Continue being friends and wait for the bf to leave and begin being a ""close"" friend again.

2. Tell her that I think that her bf is bad for her.

3. Don't get close to her at all and remain a ""distant acquaintance"" to her.

4. Stop talking to her altogether.

I have a bad feeling that 4 is the best option and I have a feeling that that will result in me feeling a weight lifted from my shoulders. At this point I'm looking for something for her to do to really piss me off so I can just wipe my hands clean of her and never feel the need to talk to her again. Unfortunately that hasn't happened yet, and I'm not convinced that she's not a good person just caught in an unhappy relationship that makes her just pissed at life when he's around. 

Thanks for reading to the end, I appreciate it... This really is so long lmfao",04Oct2019,1
35,"I have been holding these feelings in for a few months now. My best friend has been dating his girl for almost a year now. My relationship with his girlfriend was completely platonic until she wanted to be personal friends, I accepted. We than began to platonically cuddle (with her boyfriends approval). One night we were watching movies at her house and after the film things got heavy and she began to kiss my neck, ears all over my face. This went on for a few minutes before I decided to leave before things got heavier. We both admitted to have feelings for one another, however I am trying my best ignore my attraction to her. I have not made any attempts to kiss her or have sex but jesus christ, it sure is tempting. 

My best friend has no idea of my feelings towards her as he will probably hate me for even feeling this way. I feel awful and I'm not sure where to even begin to pursue/bury these thoughts and feelings.

36,"Maybe it’s something in my head but it’s very hard for me to breath when it’s loud. I searched it up on Google (which is a bad idea) and nothing came up. I feel like it could be related to asthma or something but I’ve never shown signs of asthma.

In Church, they play the music really loud. It isn’t traditional so they have an entire band with drums, guitars, etc. I complained to my mom that it was hard to breath and she just brought me some earplugs. The earplugs seemed to work which is why I’m afraid it’s just in my head. 

It started a few weeks ago when I realized I had to do breathing exercises during Church because it was too hard to breath normally.

I had to go with one of my friends and sit right next to the highschool band and watch them practice. They’re extremely loud and the entire time it was basically torture because it was hard to breath.

38,"My husband received notification today that he was not hired for a position. He is extremely qualified. They hired internally which left a vacancy in a much lower wage position. They reached out to see if he  would like to take the lower position.

He is having a really difficult time and is reflecting about how he has been passed over his entire life. He sat and provided specific examples of life stages and when he worked for something and it did not work out. Such as not making the basketball team even though he was a good player and practiced a lot before try outs. That was like twenty years ago. 

He is really defeated. It took him a year to start applying for jobs and putting himself out there. He feels he does everything by the book and it never works out.

I tried to point out when things have worked out, but he really does have a hard time. For instance he wants just one treat item and we go to buy it and the restaurant will seriously be out of that item. I have seen this. I have also seen him passed over for things he worked hard for.

He tells me there is no point in even trying. This interview process was grueling. He weathered it all and it just feels like they already had the internal candidate in mind.

He cried. I dont know how to help him. Financially he really needs a job. He said he doesnt know if he can take the lower wage one and work under someone who was hired out of favoritism or internally.

The jobs here pay so low and want degrees and years of experience for entry level. He has all of that. 

I try to point his skills out but he doesn't believe me. I am worried he will quit trying. 

How do you help someone who does seem to have bad things happen to them, like the universe doesnt provide any rewards to this person really? 

What do you say? How do I help? How does he change his luck? 

Thank You",04Oct2019,10
39,"Some background on us: We've been together for almost 3 years and we're both 19. There are a few things that get in the way of us seeing each other and it's his work and how far away he lives. He works full-time and often leaves around 6-7 pm and he lives 30-45 minutes away from me depending on traffic. On the days I do see him are during class on Tuesday nights and weekends for dates. I used to be able to see him when he lived 10 minutes away and he worked literally right next to me, so you can imagine how much of a toll this took on our relationship for a while.

Recently, my boyfriend made friends with a coworker who is 18 years old. He mentioned her to me the first day they met, and all I know is that she sounded incredibly sweet and funny. She's a temporary who is working for about another week and that's it. Now, what upsets me is that my boyfriend tends to come off as ""too nice"" and I'm guessing this girl has become quite attracted to him. She often talks about her breakup with her long-term boyfriend, which honestly, I think is too personal for someone you just met? Outside of work, she's already suggested that they play video games together and make voice calls to which my boyfriend agreed to. At this point, my boyfriend and I had a talk about this, and I explained that I have become uncomfortable with the idea of her contacting him like this outside of work. He explained to me that she is nothing more than a friend, in fact, he's even been trying to set her up with one of his friends. I appreciated him being understanding, but I felt like maybe she's the reason why he doesn't speak to me as much after work. She and him play video games after work, and I'm starting to feel a bit left out. The reason I'm feeling like this is because calling and texting is our only form of communication besides seeing each other 2-3 times a week.

I know that it'd be terrible of me to force him to stop, but the feelings are too strong. I get that a new friendship is exciting, wanting to try new things with someone, but it just gets me down. I know this is temporary, but I would just like some advice on how to deal with these feelings of exclusion. I love seeing my boyfriend happy, but I also feel forgotten. What should I do?

**TLDR;** Boyfriend became friends with a girl at work who is attracted to him. They have never up outside of work, but have been communicating a lot through calls and texts. He explains that she is just a friend and I know that. I'm upset because she has been talking to him a lot, causing me to limit the little contact him and I have during the week.

52,"Reading some of the other problems, this one doesn’t seem important but I’m unsure of what to do. This may be long so I’ll TLDR at the bottom.

A few months ago, my friend Rachel (not real name) texted me saying that we shouldn’t be friends. She said I was being a bad friend and that I was too judgmental. I was very hurt since it came out of nowhere and I didn’t do anything to anger her. My other friends all assured me it wasn’t true and that Rachel was exaggerating, but we were so close. I hate to say it, but I did cry over that.

A few weeks ago I got an out of the blue text from her apologizing, and saying she was in a rough place and didn’t mean it. I forgave her, and tried to get more information but she didn’t tell me a lot.

Since then I’ve seen her a few times. She’s always avoiding hanging out with any friends, and she spends a lot of time alone. Any time I ask her if anything’s wrong, she gets defensive.

I still have no idea what to make of this, and as far as I know, neither does anyone else. I’m just worried something happened to her, but she won’t talk to me. 

We were best friends almost our whole lives, and this is so unlike her. I just can’t figure out what to do.

Well, long story short, he did incredible work for three days building out everything! So my next move... Hire him as custodial services on a part-time basis!

Fast forward to today, we have provided him with free housing, a free bicycle to get to and from work, and decent pay. He has shown up to work every other day an hour or so earlier than his schedule states and he does great work. That was, until yesterday... No show.

Today, we come in, find him sleeping in the office and, him being an odd character, I shrug it off. He wakes up about 11am and asks to speak with me privately. In that discussion, he begins crying immediately, explaining that he relapsed the day prior on his drug of choice crack cocaine.

I called my pastor (I am a Christian, don’t hate me too hard) and he suggested a free rehab program he knows of. With this, I really have no good options... Keep him? He is a liability, could damage the room he is in, he could begin stealing from the workplace, anything! Get rid of him?

They are also requiring me to get a math endorsement even though I am not a math teacher and I was hired as a special ed for the school. My reviews for last year we're good but now my employer keeps having meetings with me an repeatedly ask me the same question over and over.

74,"Alright, so my birthday is in a couple weeks and I'm seriously considering getting an industrial peircing. I'm also in a highschool JROTC program as a freshman. I've asked my Seargent Major about it, and he told me I'd need to buy these clear things and put those in the days we have uniform inspections. (Which is every Wednesday) I'm fully aware they're against regulation on uniform days, but I don't think I'll be able to switch them out every week safely without giving my peircing and infection? If you have any experience or advice with this type of situation, please let me know. I may just have to postpone the piercing until Summer, where it wouldn't hurt so bad to switch the peircing every week. 

Please don't comment that these peircings are disgusting. I get you may feel a certain way about it, but please don't let this peircing define who I may be as a person.",04Oct2019,1
75,"I know the title seems weird but lemme explain.

I'm a junior in college and have noticed this the past couple years. People don't mind me, I show up to an event or party or something and everyone's cool, people say what's up we have a good time all that stuff but that's it.

I'm not a socially awkward person, I have a decent amount of success with women and I know and am cool with a lot of people on campus but obviously I'm missing something. The last straw actually came just now, my girlfriend apparently saw a friend of mine celebrating his 21st and asked me why I wasn't there. 

If I could sum it all up I guess it'd go like this. No one minds having me at a party but it's like it would never occur to anyone to actually invite me. It's depressing and confusing so if y'all have any advice I'd really appreciate it.",04Oct2019,2
78,"So I'm a sophomore in high school and lately I've been feeling really tired. School started a bit more than a month ago and everything else is great! I have all As and I tried out for the high school play and got a part. I'm also in the marching band, concert band, youth group, youth in government and the snowball committee. This is the best I've ever done as far as putting myself out there, trying new things and keeping my grades up. There's one problem. 

I feel so tired all the time. During classes I'll catch myself spacing out and starting to fall asleep. I'll be at marching band practice and I get go fatigued so quickly that I can't even play through the whole song. I get a fair amount of sleep every night. I go to bed at 9:30, maybe 10 at the latest, then I get up at 6. This has always been enough sleep for me but I find myself buying more coffee than ever.

What should I do about this? Is this something I shouldn't be too concerned about or should I try to fix it asap? How do I even fix this? 

Don't be afraid to ask questions if I didn't explain something well enough and any advice is wanted!! Thanks so much and please hurry because all this coffee is starting to get expensive 😅",04Oct2019,1
79,"All my life, I despised math. Although I managed to make it through high school (which is a total miracle since I had to cheat my way out).

Now the kicker here is this: i have this mental problem where I easily forget math-related learnings. It's been like this since I was in elementary. The reason why I say it's mental, and NOT just because I'm lazy or shite like that is that whenever I'm presented with an equation, my brain just shuts off entirely. I've had multiple tutoring sessions with professionals (i.e. my Grandma: an algebra teacher and chemical engineer) and all the progress just went down the shitter.

I need some insight on what's happening. I'll be in college soon and I'm afraid if I don't muster enough understanding, It could GREATLY affect my grades and progress in college.

This is my first time posting something really personal tho, so any advice is appreciated.

80,"Hey all. So my boyfriend and I are in our 20s. Been together for over a year, known each other for years beforehand. Sometimes when he talks about kids, it doesn't seem so bad. Other times I get such a pit of dread in my stomach. I've always been on the no kids stance but I selfishly want to keep him. I've never loved anyone like I love him and I think we could make it. But my greatest fear is becoming that mom who regrets everything and abandons her family. I don't think I could ever do that but who knows how strongly I'd feel or how I'd change once a kid is actually in the picture. I know once I decide one way or the other he needs to know.

83,"hi, im 18 years old and i just dropped out of college. i was going to a very good tech college as an IT major. first week of classes, and i realize that i have absolutely zero interest in any of the material. my most interesting class was my earth science class, nothing to do with IT. 

since i was little i always just kind of accepted that i wanted to work with computers. i bounced around between a few different things in computing, programming, video game design, etc. but i always knew that i generally wanted to work with computers. around my junior year of high school i decided i was going to be an IT major with a cybersecurity concentration. i was super pumped for college.

it was the strangest thing to me that after classes started i just lost all interest in computing. i went from 100 to 0 in the matter of days. i tried to force myself to become interested again, but i just cant. 

i feel totally lost because that was what i had my mind set on for my entire life. i barely even gave myself room to think about anything else as a career.

i have a bunch of other interests, but i cant see myself doing any of them as a career. i was thinking film or video editing, but i tried starting up a youtube channel to see if i could see myself doing it as a career, and i got bored with it after the first few videos. i like a bunch of different art things too, but im not talented enough to make it into a career that i can support myself on, and im not motivated or creative enough anyway. i also have an interest in architecture/interior design, but again, cant see myself doing it 40 hours a week/as a career.

im going to my community college in the spring to get an associates, but i have no idea what i want to declare my major as. since i already have a lot of the ""gen ed"" stuff out of the way (took college level courses in high school), theres not much else i can take that isnt directly related to a specific major. 

ive been trying to use my ""gap semester"" as im calling it to figure out what i want to do, but ive done next to nothing. most days consist of me playing video games all day. ive been applying for jobs, but only got a call back from a grocery store. money and something to do is good of course, but i dont consider shoprite a lifelong career. 

my question is, how the hell do i figure out what i want to do? career tests have lead me nowhere. my imposter syndrome is so bad that i cant see myself finding a career where i can be successful, since there are tons of other people who do it better than i do.",04Oct2019,5

89,"About a month ago, college started and I started noticing changes in their behavior that I have never seen. They seemed less involved in our discord server. When talking in person, they would turn minor details or complains I had into analysis about me. They seemed like they spent a lot of time with their new friends but if I didn't make explicit time and reach out to them, they could care less about talking to me. I have listened to their stress and we had talked about stuff like that, but suddenly they no longer want to, having me talk about my problems gives them stress?  I had initially asked a mutual friend who was in a relationship with them if they seemed off, and while the friend agreed, they made it seem like it wasn't a big deal.

They recently broke up. It came out of left field. When I saw them the day after, my friend asked a favor of me. They just wanted me to tell my best friend that they wanted to talk. I didn't think they were going to, but I relayed the message. I did not insert myself into it, I did my best to let them know it's their decision, I have no opinion. As I found from their social media, they aren't too happy with anyone (including myself I'm assuming) who did anything that showed even a tiny bit of support for their now ex. This excludes their new friends, who had no previous relationship with the ex, and so it was pretty easy to just show 100% support for one party. 

I'm not sure what the hell I should do. They've had a history of burning bridges and ghosting people. Should I just let it happen if it does? Should I confront them on this change I've observed? Is this just me overanalysising a bunch of one off, bad circumstances or otherwise coincidences?",04Oct2019,1

to give a little background, it has to do with an explicit picture. someone was sharing an explicit picture of me, and the said guy i like apparently asked for it. i had already told the principal, and he’s in hot water, but i feel so bad that he got into trouble even though he did something wrong. and like i still like him even after that, and i don’t want him to mad at me ig??

idrk what to do, i know that he really did something bad but i have feelings still, and i don’t want people to tell me the obvious like that i should just move on. it’s hard for me to just let it go, and we had already chatted a little bit before, so i kinda knew a little bit about him.

98,"This past year has been rough.
   
    I think this year has by far been the worst for my mental health. I can feel my happiness slipping away with every day that passes. 
  
    In April, my grandmother passed away. She was my rock, my best friend, the only person who I have ever felt safe enough to tell everything to. 

    Over the summer, my mother tried to commit suicide, my house caught fire, which killed my great grandmother of 93 and my cat. 

   I went to my house today, and they were taking out all of the walls and ceilings, and that really just brought everything back for me. 

      I feel this overwhelming sense of sadness that creeps up on me with every day and it only increases at night. I have this overwhelming anxiety that  just kind of sits on my back everyday, and it increases with every accidental bump in the school hallways, and every conversation I have even If I started it. 

   My self esteem has also gotten a million times worse. I was working on getting more confident over the entire summer, but in one day that was all gone, and since then it's only gotten worse and now it's to the point that I can't even stand to text people out of fear that I'm just annoying them.
   
    Not every day is entirely bad, some are mostly good. But there's always a little bad in each day. I've been trying so hard to just push the feelings down so I don't have to feel them. And I've tried to push the memories down so they aren't constantly on my mind. I've been just trying to go about each day with a smile and a calm demeanor,even if I am freaking out inside.  I hate when people worry about me.. but at the same time I crave the attention. 

   I feel this overwhelming sense of pressure to be perfect too. I have to have straight A's.. I have to have good attendance.. I have to make sure all of my siblings are up and ready for school, even if they're old enough to do it themselves. 

   I'm only a freshman in highschool, but I already have to worry about the amount of money I need to save to go to college, and I have to go to college so I can be the first one in my entire family. 

    I have a lot of friends, but they have their own problems to deal with, why should I add mine to the list? I have a boyfriend, but we just got into a relationship, I don't have to scare him off.

   I also have this overwhelming feeling of self loathing. I cannot stand myself. I can't stand to look at myself in the mirror and examine every single thing that makes me ugly. I can't stand to think about how my body looks, or what people think about the clothes I'm wearing. That's another problem, I care so much about what other people think, I don't even feel like a person anymore. 

  I don't know what to do anymore. I can barely motivate myself to get up in the morning. I just want to curl up in a ball and cry. The only thing that forces me to keep waking up is the overwhelming expectation of perfection.

We arrived in Miami about two weeks ago and everything was normal. Last week, while we were sunbathing together with my wife, a group of 4 well-built, young guys in their mid 20s approached us and asked for sunscreen lotion,we were generous and gave them the lotion,thinking only one or two of them were going to use it. Obviously we were wrong,all of them used our lotion and it was literally finished. We did not care about it but it was rude anyway. They oiled themselves in front of us,considering their attitude while oiling themselves,i think they were showing off their muscles. They thanked us and laid their towels a few meters next to us and started sunbathing. It was very strange because the beach was almost empty,so they had a lot of free spots to choose but they just chose somewhere next to [us.My](https://us.My) wife was topless at that moment. Disturbed by their presence, my wife put her bikini top back on saying some things a little bit aggresively so they could understand they were disturbing us but they did not care. We left there and came back to our room in the hotel. The day after,we saw those guys again on the beach,they were constantly staring at us. The same night, we ran into those guys at a famous club in the island, one of them approached us and asked if he could buy us a drink, we turned down the offer and left the club.

109,"Sorry. Super long ...

I have an older half sibling whom I haven't spoken to in over 5 years.

We've been close for a few years, and even though she's the oldest (41), I (33) was the more responsible one. We've always had completly different views, me being an atheist, a school nut, three jobs etc and her....well, she can't keep a job for long, a born again christian who's at her 5th kid with 4 different fathers. She's never been good with money and for years i've been helping her out.

Our father passed away unexpectedly back in 2013. His most recent testament was dated from 1995 and back then, he thought that he would never see my sister again ( her mother ran away with her when she was a baby, she found him when she was a teenager)- so, she wasn't in the will.

Out of fairness, I split my money in half, giving her 50 gran( maybe im too righteous for my own good) -I used my share with finishing school, putting aside the rest for internationnal adoption ( a big dream of mine). She blew her half in three months, and started asking me money again. I told her she was never going to get another penny out of me. Fastforward to 2-3 years later, she texted me asking me for 4000$. She said that tomorrow administration will be counting their funds at work and she embezzled money,  to go to Cuba, pay her rent etc and that once the money was counted, she would steal the 4k back from work to reimburse me.

I flat out refused. She called our aunts asking for the same, they refused also, under my advice.
I remember being angry that day, especially since around that time she wouldn't initiate conversation for any other reason other than money. I might of called her a dumb cunt, but my memory is a tad fuzzy about my exact words.

Roughly 6 months after that, she deleted me off facebook an cut ties with me and our youngest sibling ( who was 11 at the time and didnt understand why she suddenly vanished). I asked her what her problem was but she never answered. We haven't spoken since.

Now. I'm shooting you guys all the bad stuff, but there was a point in time where we were both really close. After 5 years of estrangenent, I regularly and very hatefully think about her. I think about how I'm going to tell her off if she finds me, and everytime, im stuck with this inner rage and feelings of betrayal. I wonder about what crap she told my nieces and nephews about me, on why she cut me out of their lives....honestly have a hard time letting go.

113,"So I’m currently taking the network engineer and cyber security program at my local community college. I joined the program on a whim, and I actually really enjoyed the CISCO classes where we actually work with network equipment and all that, but every other class I absolutely hate and I feel like that’s more of what I’ll be doing in the job. I just don’t think it’s for me anymore. My dilemma is this: I could just finish the program and get my associates or whatever, but that’s pointless if you don’t get the certifications which takes a REAL amount of dedication which I don’t know if I have. I really like the idea of computer programming and I’ve dabbled a bit and I’ve enjoyed it so far. I also worry that I’m not the biggest fan of math and i know it’s important for programming.

114,"So before I go into too much detail about the actual situation, I just wanted to give some back story. 
I am 25f and a lesbian. 
The end of 2018 I walked away from a very toxic relationship with a 30f we had been together eight, long horrible years.
We will call my ex A. 
A &amp; I got sober together when we first got together. 
We were doing some serious drugs, I moved out when I was 14 so I had been doing drugs for 4 years at that time. 16-18 it was every single day, this is how A and I met. 
We got sober, it was great. A year in she started using again, then was sober for a few years and started using again. She never worked. I got sober and got a job, went to college and worked (still work) my college level job. I supported her our whole relationship. She would steal money to go get high. I stayed. I understand that is on me for not leaving. About 5 years in we stopped having sex and because roommates. I worked, she cleaned prepped dinner and did the shopping. 
I leave at the end of 2018 because I was done there was no love there. 
Ended up falling in love with my bestfriend shortly after and never looked back... 


Except, me and A decided to stay friends. 
We were basically friends the whole time. 
She supported me while getting sober. 
We lived together eight years &amp; lesbians are friends with their exes all the time. Crazy I know.. but true lol.

We will call new gf K. 
K knew A because we were friends for a couple years..
A is using again, K knows.  
I have gotten A out of a couple sticky situations over the past few months. 
A has also moved on x2 and is telling this new gf she loves her. Our friendship until now was alright.. she used me a bit but I'm so scared something is going to happen to her. 
She is using needles to shoot pain killers now and I worry about her constantly. 
I love K more than anything in the world and I know that watching me worry about A 24/7 is not doing our relationship any good.. 
She is amazing and never complains..  
But after this past week she has said enough is enough. 
I haven't heard from A in 5 days. 
Her phone is in my name the contract still has a year left. 
So no matter what we are in contact atleast once a month but I used to hear from.her every day or every other. 
A's new gf also does serious drugs, is abusive, manipulative, uses her and every other lovely f%$#ing quality you can think of. 
A has made comments about being jealous of my relationship because it is so ""easy"" in the past. It isnt that it's easy, its we both love each other, treat each other with respect and we both have jobs, so we have a car and nice things yes finally. I have someone who contributes ! I'm not lucky. I just made sure I snatched her up as soon as I had the chance because I'd always kinda wanted to. But we were both with people and it wasn't ""serious"" she was just beautiful and hilarious. 
A uses me for whatever she can get now. 
I just need someone to tell me I dont need to feel guilty I guess? I'm scared she is going to overdose. 
I'm scared I'll feel it's my fault because I left her. Even though we both agreed there was no love there.. I feel like she is still my problem and I can't get over it. 
She is also mutual friends with K. Just so everyone knows she isn't some random
 They knew each other for years as well.
A will call when she is sick (no meds) her gf is sleeping with some guy at their apartment, she has punched her and she has no where to go and I feel this sinking horrible feeling of having to help her after doing so for 8 years.

115,"I posted earlier today about feeling guilty because I was looking for a new job. Well the 1st interview went really well and im feeling really good about this and im almost 100% certain im going to have the job from the way the owners were talking.

But before the deal is sealed I have to groom a test dog so they can get a good picture of how i'll do. Well when I go back to my current job and start packing up all my tools by boss is obviously going to know something is up. 

So im trying to decide if I should be upfront and honest about letting her know that I have this 2nd interview or if I should just lie about it. I dont know what her reaction would be, if she would send me home on the spot and not let me work anymore or if she would just kinda go with it.

The way things are right now, I would be in the same situation either way. Because im making next to nothing as it is working for her because things are so dead, that its mostly a waste of gas and time to go to work at this point anyways.

I notice the guy in it is staring at us I just keep looking straight ahead without saying anything, at this point my friend doesn’t notice because she has her eyes on the road. So he’s following us and not taking his eyes off of us the entire time he’s driving next to us. It’s been several miles and he’s still following us and staring, so I finally say to my friend that we’re getting stared at. Sadly, we catch a red light and he’s next to us and trying to get our attention badly. We both try to ignore it because we just know this guy is up to no good but then he starts yelling something about our tires and I remember a story her mom told us where she thought some guys were hitting on her but she realized they were trying to tell her that her car was smoking and when she realized it, she pulled over and it caught on fire like 2 mins later. Finally I creek my window open a little and of course. Just as we thought. He yells something really creepy and gross and threatening at us and so I just flick him off and roll up my window. It’s in the middle of daytime and there’s a lot of traffic so I didn’t expect it to go this far but he continues following and staring at us and it’s bizarre bc he’s not like a young kid, he was probably in his early 30s. When I’ve gotten harassed by men they’re usually younger and I brush it off like ok they’re just dumbasses. He tries to swerve in our lane a bit to get more of our attention or something!?! I have no clue honestly. He is weaving through traffic and speeding to make sure he’s next to us until we are able to make a U-turn and lose him. I wasn’t able to get a look at his license plate due to the fact he made sure he never sped past us but I did get a pic of his van in my rear mirror. I’m sure that doesn’t help any though. This is me partially asking for advice and partially just wanting to vent. I’m 19 and have never had someone so pursuing harass me, especially while on the road, and a busy road in the middle of daylight for that matter. Has anything like this happened to anyone? Was he just trying to be a dick or was there something more sinister happening? Should I be worried? Should I tell anyone?

The noise is similar to extremely loud stomping that rattles the windows and sliding glass doors.

It briefly stops for a about two to three hours, then the noise kicks up again for the rest of the day.

My partner and I are sleeping four hours a night. We are exhausted and frustrated. It's not loud music, or yelling, so I don't feel comfortable wasting a police officer's time with a late night noise complaint.

125,"Most of you will simply tell me to “get over it” or that I “have no chance” but I seriously need legitimate advice so say what you want, but have some sort of advice please.

Before I start, here’s a little background. I’m bisexual, and have been for a while now. So this girl, we’ve been friends since elementary school but we’ve only reconnected recently. Even though we haven’t spoken in a few months nothing has changed, we click, if that makes any sense. I don’t know her sexuality, which remains to be a problem and what most of you will probably judge me about. She’s made jokes about being bisexual but up until recently I’ve never taken them seriously, although now I’m overthinking everything. She has a boyfriend, serious but not super serious.

I didn’t know I felt this way about her until recently. She makes me so overwhelmingly happy, something no one has been able to do in so long. She’s just so perfect in almost every way. I’ve never been in love before but this is definitely it, she’s always in my thoughts and I always think about her before myself. We talk daily and I’m not going to lie our conversations border on flirting. When I talk to her every worry just goes away, I feel completely comfortable around her, I know she will never judge me. 

Okay, enough of me rambling about her, I’ve done that already. I’ve tried to just “forget it” and push my feelings away, forcing myself into the friend zone. I don’t want her to breakup with her boyfriend, because I want her to be happy and he makes her so happy, but on the other hand a part of me does. Their serious and I don’t think they’ll be breaking up anytime soon. Maybe once high schools over but I fear my chances would be even slimmer then. I doubt she’ll ever think of me in that way since I’m sure she’s straight, but again, I’m not completely sure. I feel so heartbroken and nothing has even happened between us. 

So, in summary, how can I forget her or at least come to terms with the fact that we will most likely remain friends? I don’t want to come between her and the people she loves, but I also don’t know if I can take anymore of this “watching from the sidelines”, it makes my heart physically ache.

Here's the deal...

Casual fwb while overseas resulted in pregnancy despite using control. I don't have any desire to start a relationship or father children but here we are. I've been openly honest about my stance both before and after the news broke but that doesn't really change anything as she's proceeding with having the babe.

I'm from Australia, She's Japanese and we met in America - messy!

I've known from the bottom of my heart since forever that i simply have no desire what so ever to be a dad, it's just not me. She's certain she wants to do it and said not to worry and that she'll go it alone etc but i am wracked with guilt about it. We found out it's a boy aswell which has made me feel even worse as i feel this sense of obligation. is that weird? 

Anyway i have no one to talk to and so i would like to get some opinions on what i should do before i make any wild choices. I still don't fully understand why she's going ahead with it, she said she never wanted kids either? oh well too late.

ok so options are...

(a) None - Live a weird secret double life of shame &amp; guilt and subject a innocent child to a life without a Dad but have the life i wanted.

(b) America - Highly expensive process to get a visa as neither are American citizens (child will be born there). America is also not without its problems. You need to be on a pretty good salary to enjoy life otherwise it can be depressing AF, especially if not in the larger cities.

(c) Australia - Look i'm biased but living in Australia is an easy life with good pay, work conditions and services for babys/kids but i don't want to be her only companion here as I am only considering continuing a dialogue wit her for the childs sake. I can't deal with my worlds colliding either just yet as i haven't told my friends and family - I just need some time!

(d) Japan - Top of the list as you may of guessed being the subject title. She would have her friends and family to lean on and I wouldn't have to face reality for the time being. I feel like as a mixed race child although tough at times it would be enriching to grow up with japanese culture and connection to his mums country. Japan has a long list of problems i.e xenophobia, stagnant pay, high cost of living and single parents are frowned upon. I would also as a foreigner make peanuts, have language barrier and live in a shoebox. I do like the country on the whole, but i am worried i would just be a big ball of resentment the whole time.

Crossposted from another subreddit, I don't have the energy to reword it right now

I previously made a post here (r/offmychest) under a throwaway about my dad with dementia and his crazy wife. 

It's a long story, but after a couple years of being diagnosed with  dementia and slow (but of course too fast) cognitive decline, in  mid-August he was diagnosed with cancer in his brain, lungs, and kidney.

He supposedly did treatments for a couple of weeks, but supposedly  the doctor eventually recommended stopping it. I don't if it was too far  along or he was just too weak or what. My formerly big, strong, full of  life Dad. Who'd gotten so thin and frail. I got this mostly through  hearsay from my sister, because Dad's wife wasn't speaking to me other  than to harass me at the time.

I got hired for a job that had an extensive interview process with  invasive tests, but I did it because I was desperate. I put a bunch of  money I don't have on my credit card last week so I could fly out and  see my Dad, since he wasn't doing well. I was able to spend a little bit  of time with him, but he was mostly non-communicative. I'm so glad I  did go out then.

The start date for the new job was yesterday. I got the call from my  sister before going in today. I didn't know what to do, so I went in.

I need this job. I need it so badly. It's the only one I've even  gotten an interview for. The pay's the most of any job I've applied to  (and I need it so badly, I have no money and won't be able to pay my  bills this month). The benefits are good, although of course they don't  kick in for a while. So no leave of any kind. There's plenty of  opportunities to make a decently lucrative career here, which I've never  had in my life. There's EXTENSIVE training. But it's group training.  And I stupidly told my trainer yesterday about my Dad being ill and  potentially passing away in the semi-near future (little did I know...).

So her supervisor came to speak to me today. One of the questions  during the interview process was ""You have to be here every single day  for the next three months, are you able to do that?"" And I said yes,  because at the time I had no idea I'd be losing my Dad so soon and,  let's face it, I have nothing else going on in my life. 

The supervisor of course couldn't directly tell me ""You need to quit""  but she strongly suggested that I need to go through my grieving  process and wouldn't be able to handle the rigorous training. And if I  missed a day (which at this point would only be needed to attend his  memorial service, he's being cremated so it won't be immediate and I  don't think there's any sort of a viewing before they cremate him) I'd  miss that day's training with no way to make it up. She offered that if I  resigned they could extend the job offer until the next training, but  that's still a ways away, and honestly, I need this money now. I'm so  lost. I feel like they're not really even giving me a choice. Everyone  else it telling me I need to be there for the memorial service, which of  course I would like to be if I can, other than my sister (my only  remaining sibling and my best friend) who knows how much I need this job  and has said ""What do you think Dad would want?"". All my Dad wanted was  for us to succeed and be self-sufficient. He thought I'd be a doctor,  but I bungled that. This job's not great, but if he were here he'd  probably rather I stick at it and make something of it and at least be  able to take care of myself. I don't even know if they'll actually  extend the job offer. I don't have anything in writing. She just told it  to me. The only thing that would be in writing would be my letter of  resignation. And then if I do that and they don't extend the offer to  the following month, I'm really, really fucked. Even more so that  getting the offer and not being able to pay any bills for two months. I  was so happy to finally be making decent money and being able to not  worry about how the hell I'm going to pay the bills. I don't know what  to do. But if I try to stay, both the trainer and her manager know and  are probably going to treat me weirdly.

So I created this account recently because I wanted to get something off my chest about a show I found I am very passionate about. But then I realized... Reddit is a very confusing place. 

I knew nothing about Reddit before I made an account. and I've learned a couple of things but I know there's **so** much more I should probably know, like what are the karma points all about? how do you get them? what is a Cake Day? and how do you begin to find things you like here???

I'll be trying to move to another country which I'll visit soon, so while learning the language I met a really cool girl online and we've been talking for almost a year now, while sharing pics and so on. I really like this girl and she likes me back, we get along so well and something romantic started to happen between us to the point of becoming a couple, we talk all the time and watch things ""together"", however, it all happens while texting. I'll meet this girl soon because I'll take some vacations on her country, but I'm a bit worried about finally meeting her in person and feel awkward or not meet expectations so I want to talk to this girl by a videocall to get used to the interaction before finally seeing her. However she has been reluctant to talk to me via videocall, I don't know exactly why, but I'm certain that she feels a bit insecure and shy about her appearance, specifically her smile, and her voice because she has hearing problems.

This past weekend I bought a sweater and it has two folds that are sewn down at the bottom. The care instructions on the tag say to hand wash it with cold water (which I don't have time for), and I decided to put it in my washing machine on the delicate setting with the spin speed at low and the water temp on cold. However, as I was hanging it out to dry, I noticed that on the inside there are these two exposed strips of what appears to be this white fabric that goes underneath the fold. I do not recall seeing this white fabric before as I was turning it inside out before putting it through the wash, and I'm afraid that the seam holding the fold down may have started tearing while inside the washing machine. However, I may just be crazy and perhaps it has been like that since day one. I REALLY like my new sweater, and I don't want it to get damaged so soon.

Tomorrow I see my social worker. She’s awesome and works with me well, but we struggle with something...

I’m trying to get onto disability, my mental disorders have hindered me from living a normal life. I can’t hold down a job, I struggle with memory loss and brain fog, I can’t leave my home for weeks at a time... all that good stuff...

Now onto the actual issue. Though we work together, I always have to have my mother, who I’m super duper close to, be in conference call with me and my worker, and she HATES it because “I should be able to speak for myself.” The thing is, with my memory issues I can’t remember five minutes ago on a bad day. I can’t remember the traumatic things that have happened and I can’t remember much information about myself. All this is part of my disorder.

I freeze when put on the spot. She ends our appointments early when I ask to call my mother.

I’m afraid nothing is going to get done. I’m afraid I’m going to lose my chance for disability because I can’t do much for myself. I’m afraid to ask to call my mom again. She’s the only one who keeps track of this. 

TLDR: I have mental disorders out the wazoo, my social worker hates when I ask to call my mom because “I need to speak for myself.” Due to my mental disorders I can’t remember anything. That’s where my mom comes in. I’m scared to talk to my worker because I’ll need to call my mother.",04Oct2019,1

When it stops, it can be gone for just a few weeks, or even a few months one time. When I am home alone for a long time, I get a quick surge of emotion once I notice that I'm by myself. This emotion, according to chat message history from when this happens includes most if not every emotion during the time while influenced by it. This usually lasts for a few hours, sometimes only 20 or so minutes. It ends by a moment of 'clarity', when I realize to myself that everything I'm stressing out about is completely unjust, unrealistic, &amp; just dumb overall.

I need help

my friends and i made a high school club centered around activism through education. We want to raise money for educational charities and collect and donate books and school supplies. We’ve already started doing this ($238.98 raised so far! all donated! we’ve also donated 40 books to our local elementary school!)

Now here’s the issue. We want to host an outside of school event (all of our money so far has come from bake sales and in school events) that would last 7 hours (maybe more) and require around 40 volunteers (it’s a charity golf tournament for those curious). Our school requires that clubs provide community service opportunities for students, but we need a nonprofit to sign off on students hours.

so in short, i need to partner with a nonprofit so they can sign off for our volunteers volunteering hours at our charity golf tournament (because otherwise no high schooler would go volunteer if they weren’t getting credit for it) My question is this: how would i go about doing this? Simply shoot a nonprofit an email and ask “can we partner with you to do you can sign off on our club members volunteer hours?”

What do i do?? i’m totally lost and there’s not much info on a predicament like this on the internet. THANK U GUYS!

181,"Hey everyone. I'm a 30 year old male looking for a new path in life. I've discovered that I really have a passion for the medical field and I'd like to pursue it, but I feel like maybe I missed my window. Here's what I'm working with:

B.A. in Political Science from UCI (3.15 GPA)

Ex-military with 3 years left on the GI Bill

Net worth - About $200k - $50k in my retirement, $150k liquid

One very serious S/O and no kids.

As you can see, I'd basically have to start over to pursue this field. I'd undoubtedly have to go into a post-bacc pre-med program to make up for the bio and chem classes I didn't take during my undergrad. I know my original GPA isn't anything to write home about, but I legitimately believe it's not a fair representation of my academic ability. I fell into some holes and did some stupid shit during undergrad, so I definitely think I can do better than that with this second pass.

That being said, there's a lot of risk. I feel like my old GPA may reflect poorly if I apply to medical schools later on. I'm also nervous that if I don't do well on the MCAT, I will have spent a year (or two?) doing my post-bacc for nothing.

196,"I have been on a bit of a roll lately when it comes to donating stuff. Today I donated blood, which is a big deal to me because I am terrified of needles, it's nearly a phobia at this point. So after I faced that fear I feel pretty good, and I decided that I'd face another fear-- shaving my head. I'm latina and my hair is super curly and very long right now, about waist length. I'm very attached to it, and a lot of my identity is based around my hair since it is considered unique where I live. 

I've donated with children's hospitals before (for my quinceañera I asked for toys to donate to the children's ward instead of gifts) and I found it to be a very rewarding experience. I heard about a girl who donated her hair and let the kids from the cancer ward shave her head, and i thought that would be something nice to do i guess. 

I desperately need advice on a good place to donate my hair to, because i know a lot of places don't actually work as charities. And if I want to visit the hospital how should I contact them?",04Oct2019,1
197,"I know it sounds dumb, I just love my dad a lot. Today he told me NASA and other scientists debunked and apologized for faking climate change. This really took me through a loop. This guy used to be so smart and skeptical of claims, but now he sees a fake news site and decides it's a fact. 

Every time I try to explain that something is fake to someone, they get offended and upset with me. I'm not trying to be a dick, it just upsets me that he's believing an obvious fake news site.

201,"Okay so I have a best friend that is marrying this great guy but the more they go into this relationship the more it seems they fight. I used to be their roommates and think they are a great couple but the way they have been talking to each other lately is really harsh. Lately being the last 5 months. 

She is always rolling her eyes at him and he is always annoyed at her. It might just be something they put on for others but it’s super awkward to be around. Any time he is happy she shits on him which makes him act out more. And any time she is happy he belittles her which makes her sad. 

They are in couple therapy which I hope will help but even talk with them about it all she did was roll her eyes at what he said.
I don’t know but when they talk to each other It is so bad I just want to ask her are you sure about this? 
Is that rude? And also if they end up splitting up later will I be the asshole who predicted it or the friend trying to watch out for her friend? I dont know I don’t want her to hate me but I also want to help.

202,"not sure if this is the right sub for this, but for context. i’m a 19 year old female. 

i grew up in a very impoverished and neglectful home, and was never taught any type of hygiene or given adequate healthcare despite having insurance. i haven’t been to a doctor since i was 13 (where my mother wouldn’t let me get vaccinated even though i wanted to) and only recently have visited the dentist after a decade (apparently i need 3 fillings, 3 root canals, wisdom teeth extraction, braces, and jaw surgery /: )

but all of that aside, i moved out on my own about a month ago, got my first job, and my quality of life is already drastically improving. my main issue i’m facing now is trying to teach myself basic hygiene. and i mean BASIC hygiene. when i lived with my family, i was only allowed to shower once a week so i wouldn’t raise the water bill, deodorant was too expensive and i should just share it with my mom, i used toilet paper for most of my periods, etc. 

i want to learn how often to shower
how to take care of my hair
SKINCARE
dental hygiene
bodily hygiene (deodorant, exfoliation, shaving, that kind of thing)
vitamins? how much water do i drink in a day?

I think i’m a beautiful girl, but I would be so much prettier and happier if i knew how to take care of my body. any and ALL advice would be appreciated. i’m very good on money now and will buy whatever is necessary to get my health back on track, so product recommendations would be nice as well. thank you💕",04Oct2019,1

There's a girl in my class (HS), lets call her Greta. She's already quiet an obnoxious person (explicitely tells others how good of a person she is, said that she thinks she has an amazing personality, talked about masturbating, orgasming and how tight she is very explicitly to the whole class knowing that the guys were uncomfortable). 

Greta's been annoying me recently for no reason. Whenever I ask her something in class she rolls her eyes and snickers at her friends. When I was talking about something to another person, she goes up to her and says ""why tf is she (me) telling you this?"" 2 weeks back someone brings a huge box of snacks to class and when Greta was behind me in line to get it she yells "" I swear if that b\*tch (me) gets the last one"" and looks at me signaling that she's watching me with her hands.  LMFAO.

214,"Background info: Used to be best friends with him, slowly started to get annoying, less of a friend now. That’s the main reason I don’t want to give a ride.

Our school starts at 8:15, my friend is very flexible on the time he can leave the house, he could leave between 6:00 and 7:45.

My house is about 3 minutes closer to the school than his. His house is 3 mins south of mine and my school is 10 mins north of mine (Driving.)

There are 3 main ways to get to school for us.

1. Drive to a parking lot and take a bus the rest of the way to school (Our school doesn’t allow parking near the school during the school day.) This usually gets us to school right on time. I have to take an extra 5 minutes to pick my friend up this way compared to if I drove alone.

2. I have my mom drive us. My mom has a varied schedule of when in the morning she has to be at work. She can sometimes drive me right to the school and drop me off there. I usually get there between 7:40 and 7:50. This way also requires 5 additional minutes to pick my friend up compared to just having my drive me.

3. We walk to school. I usually leave at 7:25 and get to school at 8:00. I have to wait a few minutes before leaving until my friend gets to my house.

In addition to him just annoying me in general, he also begs me to let him stay at my house after school even though 1. There is no reason not for him to go to his house. 2. Even if I have a lot of work to do he insists on sitting on my bed watching YouTube while I work in another room (I usually work in my bed because that’s where I focus best.) in addition he generally doesn’t really care about keeping my bed tidy so he leaves the bed with the sheets coming off the mattress when I had it clean before.

I told him that the racist shit needs to stop. I then asked him if he knew the guy? He said no. I said so how do you know he’s illegal? He said he didn’t know. Then I said “So instead of what you just said you simply could have said dumbass learn how to drive..” Then my dad goes into a rant about me being sucked into liberal politically correct bullshit. Like being a decent human being is liberal bullshit? I cut him off there and told him if it continues I will not have a good relationship with him if any relationship to be honest.

223,"Hi! thanks in advance for the feedback; I aprreaciate your advice with this important decision:

Some friends of my dad are selling an apartment in a very good location at a cheap price.

With my current job I could pay it in just 3 yeas or 2 if I really tighten my belt. Thing is, my job is slowly driving me crazy. It pays very well but I live away from home, only visit on the weekends and it's in a remote place where there's little to do (By some miracle the place has internet). Not a day goes by where I miss living in my city; I used to make less money there but there were my family, friends and there were many things to do. I really only took this job for the money, I don't have the drive or the passion of my peers.

what I would *want* to do is work 2 more years and save money to study a different degree, or move to work in anothrer country for a few years since my friends also have plans to move in that time. I'm afraid I'll miss our lat years together.

 My resposible brain says that what I *should* do is buy a place to live so I can become independent as soon as possible. I rent a place in the town that I work at, but on the weekends I stay with my parents. They like to ahve me around and aren't even hinting at wanting me to move but I feel that that's the *responsible* thing to do.

I feel conflicted because (as my psychologist says) I end up doing things that I thinik I *should* do and this pattern makes me unhappy. It has already happened before where I stay for years in situations that I could've just ended if I listened to my heart. I'm afraid this situation will become one of those cycles again and I'll end up regretting my choice.

I was sexually abused by my grandfather at around the age of 8. I was groomed by being shown comedy VHS's including people being ""pantsed"" ( people unknowingly having their pants pulled down) and from that, being told i could play a secret strip poker game on the computer as long as i kept it secret. I don't remember if it was directed, but that led to me pulling his pants down thinking it was a game. That led to me fondling of him, and possibly performing oral (as i remember). It very well may have progressed, but as a child i complained about having to shower with him to my parents, and im guessing that put a scare into him and it stopped.

When i told my family at 23. While most of the family believes me, i am the only one who cut him off. 
Afterwards my sister (who is 36) privately told me that she felt responsible for my abuse. That she was curious what a penis looked like as a child, pulled his pants down to see, and that put the idea into his head to use on me. I obviously reassured her that she carried no blame, but decided not to tell her that i felt she may have been abused as well by similar means, and just does not recall the grooming.

Difference now is she has a daughter that just turned 3, and the son of a bitch abuser is still alive and see's my niece a few times a year. She promised me that she would never leave them alone together when she was born, but for some reason it is gnawing at me tonight. I am terrified of him creating another victom, in my niece.

I am starting to think I should start to give up on them. 

Backstory: He was one of my best friends from high school, we made each other laugh and used to hang out all the time. I went away to college and stayed at home and now 3 years later I have a full time job and he is going to school in town. I met some amazing people while I was away, they made me look at my life and home friends and realize they are not as mature as I would want them to be. Me and my friend stopped hanging out as much but we try to see each other every once in awhile. I know him super well and he HATES it when I say, ""you do this a lot"" or any type of phrase that defines him. 

So I do not do/try to do that anymore, but it seems that any time we hang out it just ends in us arguing about something I did or how I missed some event becuase I had a scheduling conflicts or how everybody mistreats him becuase he is such an awesome person. I try to be helpful but it kills me to always be there for him when most of the time,  it is just him complaining about his life or him bragging about how awesome his life is. There are nice times when we make jokes and make each other lasts but it does not happen as much. It seems like we have just drifted apart and I am not sure what to do.",04Oct2019,1

242,I was prescribed adhd medication. I took it i loved the feeling it gave me so i told everyone it worked that i had adhd and it helped me out. Besides my best friend but at one point i asked her what she thought about it and she said i was being overdramatic etc. I don’t blame her i asked but it did hurt. Now nobody knows. It hurts a lot inside i cry a lot about it because i feel very guilty. I have lied and stolen a lot. It really eats me inside knowing that i stole from people who needed it. I’m a very open person and carrying around something like this is weighing me down. I had a breakdown tonight. I spent the night of my birthday crying alone in my bedroom and i don’t want to live with this. I know it’s bad and it only going to get worse if i don’t stop. I just really really don’t want to tell my parents. I know they would be understanding and kind they always are. But i don’t want to make them sad/disappointed in me. It would hurt too much i know i couldn’t take it. They the people i want to impress the most. I love my friends but they come and go my parents are the people who never left my side.

243," an internship at one of the biggest banks in USA as a software developer. They gave me an offer for full time and I gladly accepted because a. I enjoyed working there, especially the people, b. Their pay is simply incredible, lot more than what regular graduates expect even in a major like mine c. I don't have to relocate. I signed the offer letter.

Everything was fine and dandy until I went back to college, where everyone around me including my friends started discussing about the interviews they have lined up at all these high profile tech companies. 

I understand that I'm in a very good position, and the people who I am seemingly jealous over would also love to be in a position like mine. But I feel like it would be great if I applied to a couple more companies just to broaden my options and not feel a little tied down by my decision. 

I can do this. But the only problem is that, if I do get a better offer (probably impossible in terms of pay, but maybe in terms of being related to my field of study), I would feel kind of like an asshole rejected a company I already agreed on paper (non-binding agreement) to work with. I also wouldn't want to spend the time and energy to apply if I end up not getting any major offers (why not enjoy not applying to jobs for one semester? After all I've earned this luxury?).

What would you do in my position. I'm leaning towards applying to a couple (just 2-3 more) companies and see what happens.",04Oct2019,1

I was sexually abused by my grandfather at around the age of 8. I was groomed by being shown comedy VHS's including people being ""pantsed"" ( people unknowingly having their pants pulled down) and from that, being told i could play a secret strip poker game on the computer as long as i kept it secret. I don't remember if it was directed, but that led to me pulling his pants down thinking it was a game. That led to me fondling of him, and possibly performing oral (as i remember). It very well may have progressed, but as a child i complained about having to shower with him to my parents, and im guessing that put a scare into him and it stopped.

When i told my family at 23. While most of the family believes me, i am the only one who cut him off. Afterwards my sister (who is 36) privately told me that she felt responsible for my abuse. That she was curious what a penis looked like as a child, pulled his pants down to see, and that put the idea into his head to use on me. I obviously reassured her that she carried no blame, but decided not to tell her that i felt she may have been abused as well by similar means, and just does not recall the grooming.

Difference now is she has a daughter that just turned 3, and the son of a bitch abuser is still alive and see's my niece a few times a year. She promised me that she would never leave them alone together when she was born, but for some reason it is gnawing at me tonight. I am terrified of him creating another victom, in my niece.

Should i leave well enough alone, or arrange a serious talk with my sister and tell her my thoughts. So maybe she won't ever let that monster near her, even though if i am right it may crush my sister?",04Oct2019,1
247,"So 3 parts I'll make as short as I can. (TL;DR at bottom)

I'm in my 3rd year of university. I love my major and want to do a masters so I can do research, and have 2 papers about to be published. But lately I've been feeling like I don't belong, like I am not good enough to do what I want to do (I have a poor GPA and failed 2 classes). But at the same time I have no idea what I would do if I didn't end up doing what I planned.

I have 3 close friends. The only friend I feel close enough to talk about more personal things with is across the country. This makes it really hard when I am not feeling well emotionally (I've suffered from depression for years). I've been trying to make more friends, but everyone I try to talk to is really mean, for example two people I made plans with blatantly stood me up.

Even though I love what I do, I can't get up at a decent time and I have zero motivation. I need 9 hrs to feel only somewhat rested, and my earliest class is 1pm so most days I don't get up until 12:30 which has caused me to not be tired until 2/3am. Sometimes I don't even want to go to bed because I don't want to deal with the day.

249,"Right now I’m in the worst class I have ever taken. It’s a 3 hour ethics class with the most pretentious and straight up professor I have ever met. This is my first year at university (I was a transfer from community college) and I don’t know how common it is to get terrible professors but good god, man. 

For 3 hours he lectures about what he feels about the current politics, as well as abstinence. He’s obviously a super staunch conservative based on what he’s told us, which I don’t mind, as long as it’s not being shoved down my throat. I don’t think any professor should lecture about their political thoughts. I have learned absolutely nothing in this class. I would learn more about ethics by reading the bathroom stall graffiti. At the end of every non-lecture he invites us to critique his lecture through email if we didn’t think it was helpful. I would consider doing this, but this week I emailed him a simple, earnest question about homework and received this: (I’ll link the photo of his email in the comments)

On top of that, his quizzes are beyond unfair and basically incomprehensible. Last week he gave us the wrong quiz, and then just said to do it anyways. To put it in perspective, I’m a science student with above a 3.5 gpa, which I only bring up to show I’m not a slacker or anything, and my lowest graded class this semester is this level 100 stupid ethics class. It’s too late to drop the class, and I don’t want to have to retake it. I’m very stressed and frustrated and don’t know if complaining is worth it.

I'm a junior guy in highschool, so yes I'm young. I've been dating this girl (C) for about 8 months now and I really enjoy her. Everytime I hang out with her we have a great time. There are some issues though, she's emotionally unstable. It's not her fault though, her ex emotionally and sexually abused her and she's been diagnosed with PTSD, depression, and anxiety because of it. And it doesn't help that both of her parents or siblings didn't believe her when she was r\*ped. I don't blame her for any of this, and through these past 8 months I have helped her a lot through these things. She told me that if we hadn't started dating when we did she probably would've taken her own life and is grateful for me being in her life.

I met another girl (J) about a month ago and I can't explain it very well. She's a senior and I can't stop thinking about her. Me and J have grown close friends over the past month and I feel like me and J click better than me and C. Me and J tease each other about little shit all the time. I don't think I can mentally handle cheating on C because 1) I hate cheaters with a passion and 2) C's ex cheated on her multiple times without her knowledge so that would crush her if I did it to her. 

I don't know why I feel this way. I don't want to feel this way towards J but I'm not sure whats going on. I love C, or whatever the teenager equivalent of love is. Another bad part is that J has a boyfriend and has had one for god knows how long.

 I can't talk to either of them about it for obvious reasons and I can't talk to any of my other friends because they're automatically going to think I'm an asshole. This post is partially a confession because I haven't told anyone and partially looking for advice.

 I want to stay in my current relationship with C but also want to stay friends with J.",04Oct2019,1

I was at the dmv with my gf. Right off the back I kept noticing one of the clerks continuing to stare in our direction. Now, I’m not a jealous bf at all so it didn’t bother me that much. I just put my arm around my lady and continued to wait for our number to be called. 

Well our number gets called to the clerk that was consistently eyeballing us, or should I say, my lady.

Everything goes smooth. We submit our app with the guy. And she heads to take her written driving test. I go sit in the waiting area. 

She passes! Great! She tells me that the clerk that submitted her app ran into her on her way out and this was the exchange.

Clerk: “hey! Did you pass!?”
Gf: “yeah.”

And walks away. I saw from a far the entire exchange. She never stopped and the conversation was quick.

So we’re celebrating eating lunch. And she gets a text saying “is it ok to save your number?” She answers with a “whose this?”

Response “the guy who asked if you passed, how did you do?”

The DMV CLERK TOOK HER NUMBER FROM HER APPLICATION. So this guy took personal information from an application that has her full name, address, birthdate,SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER and phone number.

I know it’s kind of petty, but I have a group chat that I connect to all of my close friends in. We’ve had this chat since high school. (About 5–6 years now.) 

When I addded him to the chat, nothing seemed too off. We shared memes and all had decent conversations. It didn’t seem weird.

Until one day I was going to ask the group a question and noticed I had been removed along with my bf. I was kind of hurt by this due to no sign of it; my anxiety hit hard as I freaked out. I messaged the closest friend asking what happened.

It turns out that one person who rarely says anything (like for months.) removes me from the group. She was only added because she was cool awhile back. But she seems kind of mean now. Because my bf sent a meme that was slightly flirty and wholesome. She complained that she’s “a woman who just wants to look at cat memes and nothing PDA.” And told me to make my own group chat.

&amp;#x200B;

I am in a bad situation with 3 uncles a brother and his wife, lets just start off with me being honest, in my younger years in dealing with these people and family connected to them I did some embarrassing  things around them due to mental issues I did not have control over and I was not fully aware I suffered from but my actions were not violent disrespectful or personal just me being 18 and not having a filter on my actions.

&amp;#x200B;

But as of today, they treat me like total complete   s---t, like I don't exist, have feelings or  I am capable of doing anything about it, it's gotten to a point where I pick the days out the month where all of the family gets together  and I say to myself this is the day I set things straight .

&amp;#x200B;

These family members joke about my weight my mental health situation and just about everything from my haircut education style of clothes to the movies I watch. I am 34 years old and get treated like the quiet shy kid alone at the lunch table in elementary school, I am actually 34 years old and getting bullied by family members who are 40 30 and 60 years old.

&amp;#x200B;

I must add I am not afraid  soft or scared to stand up to them its more of me knowing that I don't like to stand up and trade daggers with people I don't have the mouth to do so, it is more of me knowing my true inner self and that I won't be able to hold back and possibly  go 1000% machete brass knuckles baseball bat on them and lead to a situation  where I will be in Jail and them in the Intensive care unit.

&amp;#x200B;

So what I am looking for is how can I end this in the proper manner because deep in my soul my solution is violence towards them and they would deserve it, but I don't want to upset my mother by putting her son and brothers in Intensive care unit what is the proper warning shot I could give? or how do I approach them to let them know that this must end

274,"Hello, I work for a plasmapheresis company as a phlebotomist. Essentially, its a manufacturing company that pays individuals for their plasma. You come in, and a phleb hooks you up to a machine, and your blood circulates through the machine until we get obtain a designated amount of plasma from your blood. (Blood is returned :) ).

&amp;#x200B;

A donor recently insulted me with physical harm because he felt pain during the disconnect. It happens sometimes and is an unfortunate possibility when it comes to donating plasma. Though, I think he was just upset because he had to wait awhile to be disconnected from the machine after his donation was completed. He did threaten me.. I kept cool and apologized profusely and he left. I referred him to management and listed the reason through the computer program we use.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

After a week, while im working, the same donor ends on the production floor and rushes right over to me and starts pointing at me while shouting to one of the managers ""That's him!""

&amp;#x200B;

For a second, I literally thought I was going to be attacked so I just.. kind of froze and was confused what was going on before it clicked. The manager on the floor said that the deferral process was done incorrectly because he had no way of figuring out who deferred the donor (Which is weird because the system does list who does what... so I'm not sure if I believe that), but the fact that the manager took off the deferral and let the donor on the floor, and he was so quick to confront me has me really unnerved.

284,Hi everyone. I'm asking this question on behalf of my parents. My parents hired a contractor to do roof replacement back in July. They stated that they would be able to get it done before summer ended. Fast forward to today and it still hasn't been done yet. We have called them many times and left voice messages but barely a response. Just last Friday someone finally answered the phone. We asked what is going on and the gal said they are still waiting on a permit to do work and supplies. My question is are they just bsing me or does it truly take 2 - 3 for permits and supplies to arrive?,04Oct2019,1

I've been struggling with chronic constipation on and off for almost a year now. and its ruining my mental health. Its the same exact cycle.

I can see the beauty in life and i have all my motivation. I feel good for a bit until get constipated again. And then I go back to panic attacks and depression. I got put on zoloft a few months ago and its been helping but its still not a fun time at all. I'm going to the doctor tomorrow. Does this happen to anyone else?

At first it seemed real, it was just one guy Q said he went to school with but then it became like 4 other guys all using the same account and then they all suddenly disappeared and became another guy and now we’re at the present. At this point some of us are really tired of it, another member has blocked both accounts but Q wants to keep being friends with them and is almost kinda obsessive, thinking that the other guy hates him and wanting to fix their relationship but honestly I don’t think their friendship could ever be saved unless if they stop lying about all these people or at least clarify some things. Recently Q was venting about being sad and not wanting to lose a friend (who I’m assuming is the person who blocked them) and is something that I’ve talked with them about before, I don’t wanna tell them that we think he’s lying about all these friends but how can I kinda guide him and give him advice about how he shouldn’t try to force a friendship and maybe just learn to accept loss without being mean?

289,"Hi all!

Recently I’ve swapped jobs from a rota based job (worked most weekends so didn’t see my partner much) to a Monday to Friday job. I think with the swap I’ve been having difficulty with not having time off by myself and him always being around.

Ever since then, I’ve found myself trying to create distance and kind of losing some romantic feelings even. 

A few of my friends recently have taken breaks from their boyfriends - and in both situations it ended in a break-up.

I don’t want that to happen to us, but I’ve really been wanting to take a break from it all without emotions getting hurt (impossible I know).

Has anyone ever taken a break from their partner? How did it end?",04Oct2019,2
290,"I've had dogs all my life and haven't had any issues with any of them until the last litter. Gave away most of them and kept 2, a male and a female ( Blacky and Maya). Blacky and Maya have been aggressive for a while, Blacky more so. Maya is also shy.
Have tried to train him but he rarely listens, and has a habit of nipping. 
Fast forward to yesterday ( dogs are 11 months old), was playing with my neighbours dogs and came back home. Blacky was at the gate and came to me. All of sudden he starts nipping at me, I try to get him to stop but instead he goes around me and bites into my calf and continues to circle. 2 seconds later Maya comes up and does the same. They both attack me, Blacky goes for my calf again, misses and then goes for my arm. Maya meanwhile is still circling me. All of sudden my other dogs who are both 5 years old ( Blacky and Mayas parents) who are super loving join in. They dont bite me but manage to ripe my Jean's. 
Lucky the guard was around, sees what's happening and comes running and manages to chase them. 
I immediately go to the hospital, luckily dont need stitches. Got 2 shots and and need to come back for 2 more plus got some antibiotics and anti inflammatory meds. 
Either way, I'm not to bad off. But im not sure what to do with Blacky and Maya I'm worried they might attack someone else. Everyone I have told suggests I take them to a dog shelter if they'll have them that is. But I feel like I did something wrong and didn't give them enough attention or didn't put enough effort into making sure they dont nip when they were puppies.

292,"Long story short, a friend (48 y/o m) and I (25 y/o f) have been lusting after each other for years. He was actually my college professor for 2 years, and once I graduated we became good friends. Let's call him ""J"". I had a boy friend at the time, though, and moved away not long after graduation to be with him. Well, things didn't work out between the boy friend and I (he ended up being a terrible person), so now I am moving back to my home town, and J and I have gotten back in touch. It's as if nothing has changed! He admitted to me that he'd wanted more with me after I graduated, but that he didn't pursue me out of decency for our friendship and the boy friend I had at that time.

There's always been this wild attraction between J and I. I'm kind of scared of him, and fascinated by him, and extremely drawn to him all at the same time. I'm still very innocent when it comes to sex and dating, but very smart intellectually and culturally. The idea of being intimate with an older man like him, someone who is so experienced, cultured, traveled, and intelligent, just scares me to death! Yet in the past when I've seen him, I had to resist this overwhelming urge to climb into his lap and let all of my feelings out.

Now that I'm single and moving back to the city where we met/where I'm from, anything could happen. He drives me wild in all the wrong and right ways, and I can hardly stand waiting to see what happens...",04Oct2019,3

299,"Ugh. 

My longest friend is turning 40 in a few months. He has this nasty habit of dating girls 20 years his junior. These relationships always fail (what a shocker!) 

His M.O. is getting *really* attached to these girls right out of the gate. Based on stories *he* tells me, the girl always does the same thing: she's very up front with him that she wants nothing serious, she's sleeping with other people on the side, she tells him the age difference precludes him from being a serious candidate.

Nevertheless, he wastes 0 time getting fixated on these girls and dreaming about a future with them.

This past week is the 3rd time in the past year he's gone through this situation. He complains about these situations to anyone that will listen, and as a result, has frustrated/alienated pretty much all of his friends, myself included. I got so angry with him earlier this week, angrier than I've ever gotten. The girl he's currently seeing posted a picture with a guy on Instagram. He saw it and had a total meltdown (even typing this out sounds like the most pathetic shit ever....jesus christ).......the twist? Turns out it was just her gay best friend. BUT EVEN IF IT WASN'T, it's not your girlfriend so wtf is wrong with you?! 

When I, and others, try to talk him out of this and point out that he's making the same mistakes, we're met with invincible stubbornness. He romanticizes his actions, arguing this is just how he is and it's not unrealistic at all to think it could work. He really can get through to her and build something real with her. If he just does this thing or that thing, THEN she'll come to her senses and realize he's the one.

Today I wrote him a HUUUUUUGE messag explaining all the problems I was having with our friendship as a result of his compulsive behavior.

About an hour ago he calls me to tell me that he went on a date with this girl and she showed up with hickeys all over her neck. He asked her about it and she admitted (which *she already had*) that she was fucking multiple guys. They went back to his place and made out, before she announced she had a UTI and decided to leave, telling him she couldn't do ""this"" anymore - it was all too much (good on her).

So let me back up here for a moment and drop in a very important detail....

The first time they had sex (about a week ago) this girl openly admitted (without being asked, she was being forthright) that she had sex with a man for money....unprotected.

My friend's response? He had sex with her....unprotected.

Look....I may not think this girl's making wise decisions with her life, but 1) I don't know her and that's her life, 2) she has been honest with him every step of the way about *everything*. She is not the problem, he is. He is being a fucking child.

When he told me this last week, I told him he needed to stop seeing her. I reiterated to him that the primary reason he shouldn't see her again is because HE is too crazy to have something real with her, but also because they clearly were not looking for the same thing. Underneath all of that (that should be enough) is the fact that he very likely could have an STD, so he needs to stop sexual contact with this person and immediately go get an STI screening.

So fast-forward to where I left off above....he tried to have sex with her tonight, and he would have if it weren't for HER being the adult and removing herself from a bad situation with him.

I am out of anger at this point. I'm fucking done &amp; TIRED of him running to me crying about these situations, only to admit (after marathon phone calls) that I'm right after all, only to run out and do the EXACT same thing time and time again. 

What do I do in this situation? I'm really just tired of chastising him, pointing out where he went wrong, etc. But being his emotional support line is not only getting draining, it's untenable. And at this point I'm just enabling him.

He himself has said he should be in therapy and he'd make an appointment, but that's just an empty promise. He won't. I know it.

Please don't reply with ""drop his ass"", ""wow what a creep"", etc. The latter statement is very obvious, so no need to be redundant. The former, I'm not cold enough to cut him out forever. He IS a good person and my longest friend. He's just VERY misguided. I'm wondering if I just need to tell him I'm taking a break from talking to him for a while until he gets his shit together, let him bottom himself out, and then hopefully resume later. That seems a little dire, but I honestly don't see him changing his behavior any time in the immediate future.

Thanks.",04Oct2019,1

303,"So, a little history. I'm currently studying in an international school in a third-world country. This school is a new branch that opened just a few years prior, our student numbers are minuscule; but we have good teachers and a Cambridge curriculum. Everything was absolutely fine until the new term started.

After summer, a new head of teacher was appointed, and she is...horrible. She was from England and apparently taught in many countries including China, Korea, Nigeria and so on. Now, I don't doubt her experience at all, but what she did in our school is quite questionable.

She started her first week by calling us 'appalling'. A few days later, she yelled at an administration staff until she cried; she didn't like part-timers (our school had many) and gave away my English teacher's desk. She used the f-word to describe our school. She angered away a few teachers and She vaped in her own office. She insisted we conduct Music, Drama classes, despite us having no funds to do so.

Recently, she gave our class an essay titled 'What you would change for your country'. I wrote about our education system and how most citizens were incompetent in English. Our class was called 'racists' and 'bigots', I was personally called a 'sexist' for using the word 'men' to describe mankind. 

 Now, it still doesn't seem like things are going to change soon, I'm having my O-levels soon, and she just got rid of two of our most diligent teachers. My mum wants me to be patient, because the owner won't stand idly by while this happens. I thought about writing to the owner myself, or even to the abhorrent head of teacher herself.

307,"Let me start off by saying that is my first time on Reddit ever. I’ve been feeling some type of way for a few months now and I cannot link it to social media or to humanity itself. 

Everyday I wake up and see on social media the terrible things that humans do to animals and other living beings, including other humans. There is so much suffering that some humans can easily inflict without pause and it baffles me to no end. 

I’ve grown to believe that humanity is based off of our ability for compassion. Have these people who commit such terrible acts lost all humanity, thus losing their compassion? How did this happen, and why? Is it a natural occurrence? Is it hereditary?

Or maybe these people lack certain pathways in their brain that links them to conform to social norms of compassion and regard for other life forms. But at the same time, having a conscience isn’t a social norm.  It’s innate I believe. 

There has got to be something absolutely broken about anyone who causes harm to another organism without remorse. There is something not right evolutionary wise, and social wise. The same “evil” that courses through all people who commit terrible acts could very well possibly be linked to one another, and if they are broken, how do we stop it? How do we prevent any humans who are broken in this way from becoming? Are they the yang to our utopian yin societal ideals? Are they there to balance the good, or to possible act as some sort of natural selection?

Whenever I see news of unnecessary suffering such as abused/abandoned animals or children, people who were grossly murdered or tortured, its takes a little piece of my with it every time. It’s slowly letting me slip into a weird depression I’ve never seen before. I’m trying to decide if my solution is to identify the problem, or to accept it. 

I’m betting on that I must have to accept it. People who are “bad” in social norms do not do terrible things for no reason. They do them because they can.

I did whatever I could to help with branding and sales during my free time from working my main job which he is the owner of as well. I was never a part of this new business but I always try and help when I can. I wouldn’t know if my help produced anything because i directed all contact to him and his partners. Long story short he tells me that he wants to start a second line... one that  will be more affordable and tells me he wants me to start it and run it and he will provide the product. So I ask him what his motive was and he tells me I am and I deserve better. I deserve to earn and make money like he is he tells me. So I trust him and I start the business but I tell him I want an scorp or llc and he tells me the product is ready and we need to sell it now and the only way to sell now is as a sole proprietorship anything else takes a minimum of a month or more .  So I tell him that makes no sense. Oh by the way him and his business partner would be silent partners on the new one I am creating. Both 20% each. So I tell him  that’s makes no sense if I list it as a sole proprietor I would be legally responsible personally for 100% of income taxes  including their share but he plays it off like I don’t know what I’m talking about.

321,"Thinking of faking an accent, please hear me out. I need advice.

Okay so if it’s the wrong thing to do, I don’t want to do it. But I think it might be what I need to do.

I recently moved to America from my birth country in the Middle East. I lived there my entire life until moving here for college. I went to public school and my schooling was in Arabic. We had English class but it was not anything intense like writing papers or reading books, it was learning English, we had a textbook and studied basic English and grammar. 

I’m also half American and my mom speaks English. I learned English from my mom so I have a “perfect” sounding American accent meaning I sound like I’m from here. Literally my mom and siblings were the only people I conversed with growing up, I refused to talk at school and to my extended family, it was a mental illness. 

Now fast forward I’m in college studying English literature. I have imposter syndrome because I am an actual imposter. Everyone in my class is educated and can write well and think critically. I feel so so dumb. I cannot think of the things they think of because I don’t have the ability to express/ find the words like they do and they have more complex thoughts or are more smarter idk. Does this make sense or am I crazy? I know I’m writing this in English right now but this is easy shit to say. 

Idk what to do, I have dragged myself through college so far but now my classes are getting harder. I also have debilitating social anxiety. I’m not supposed to be in college I’m a dumb anxiety ridden person but I want not be a burden on society, I want to be able to do something of benefit and I need this degree. Bye the only reason i got into college here in the us is bcuz of my scholarship. 

My professors don’t understand my struggle, they think I’m on the same level as everyone else. They see me and think I’m lazy and not tying because of my social anxiety mixed with my lower level English and book smarts. 

How do I explain to my professors what I’m going threw and that it’s not fair to have these high expectation of someone who’s here just trying to learn and improve, I’m not like the rest, I’m not going to write a book or a famous article or whatever. I just want to go back to my country and teach kids English. 

That’s why I feel faking an accent will fix my problem because they will all of sudden think I’m a English as a second language learner. There are other students here from other countries, don’t they get accommodation for the fact that they come from lower English level. Or even Americans that come from lower income schools?

324,"I don’t know what to do anymore

I need help and I don’t where I can go to get it.

I am sure she is mentally ill but undiagnosed she’s had an abusive past and terrible parents.

I am 18M and she is 16F. She’s living in a European country of which she does not know the language fully and is not comfortable in.

We met a year and a half ago and it was well for a while however once we got to a state of complete closeness and we talked and voice chatted everyday. She had her moments where she got mad at some small details of what I said and got incredibly vicious but it was quickly resolved. I was foolish and told and made her promises that I wouldn’t leaver her.

So if I say one thing, jokingly or not, she completely cuts me out for a little bit and gets angrier if I don’t try and get her back despite her always resisting.

She expects me to her reassure her and make her safe which she doesn’t understand how impossible it is since we don’t think the same way. What is reassuring to me is not reassuring to her and vice versus and is impossible to say the right things and leaves us both feeling like shit.

Her parents, while I believe they are loving, are old fashioned and don’t believe anything is wrong with her and that she is just lazy and won’t get her the help she needs I tried contacting them once and that turned out worse for everyone. They need to get her a therapist.

We’ve had a few sexual encounters when her parents were away (which she claims they approved but looking back I am almost certain they did not). She regretted them the week after or something and states constantly how she is not attracted to me and that she blamed me for not resisting her (despite us both being drunk many of those times and she always initiates). Once she even slipped off the condom and made me cum inside of her and got mad and scared that she might be pregnant. She tries so much to hurt herself and make me hurt her and blames me when I do hurt her by saying I am not resisting her.

Her mood is incredibly volatile and if something minor upsets (when her friends talk to someone she hates, we’re not doing want she want to do, I don’t understand her because she’s mumbling over the mic) then she goes into either a deep depression in which she cuts herself or incredibly angry, which I prefer, where she just tells me to fuck off and she states how she wishes to hurt me physically.

Whenever I try to fight back or stand up for myself, she turns into the victim of how can I do it this to her since i know what she is like and that I should just not argue back and take it so we can both move on which makes me feel like I cannot ever be fully open or honest with her.

She is incredibly clingy, which I loved for a while but now I cannot do anything alone and if I do I have to give her advanced notice and even then she usually gets mad or upset. She wants me to watch the show she is watching and if I don’t watch it at the same time she gets mad and won’t talk to me and if I don’t talk about it as enthusiastically as she does she claims I don’t like it and she gets sad. She wants me to be in contact all the time and if I don’t answer she guilt trips me into thinking I don’t want to be with her.

I am in love with her and she has told me that she does not find me attractive or will ever be in love with me despite loving things about me but when I told her I would try to get over it she turned on me telling her that if I did that we would never stay as friends and she could not handle that as I am one of the few stable things in her life. Like no matter how I reasoned it with her and saying it was painful to love someone who doesn’t love them back she kept pleading that I had to stay in love with her otherwise she would think I wouldn’t care anymore.

She has so many of this non-sensical logics and doesn’t understand how I could resent her for forcing me to stay in love with her for a long amount of time.

I am terrified of what might happen to her if I leave, she has claimed she wants to go back to her old abusive relationships because she’ll just hurt herself and say it was all her fault and take whatever shit they give her and I would feel responsible for this. I am seriously afraid she’ll want to kill herself or continue to torture herself until she breaks.

I feel like I am hurting myself to keep her happy and cannot leave her in the dust. I want her to find someone else, who is more suitable and know what it is like to go through similar experiences as her.

I tried standing up to her once and I felt like the worst piece of shit in the world given what I know because she doesn’t really mean what she says but it fucking hurts nonetheless. She overthinks everything which makes her think of the worst possible things which has affected a lot of her life including her kinks and our relationships

She told me she acts this way with me as a form of self-defence which I accepted but the thing in the back of my head is always telling me that to get the fuck out because no one should be subjected to that. And when she does tell me to leave, my mind is then like “you can’t leave her like this” and I feel I need to stay so I don’t become another one of her failed relationships and drive her back into the arms of her previous absusers.

There’s probably a lot more but I just want any sort of advice on how to proceed with her since it’s fucking with me every day. I need to get her help and I don’t want to leave her but I also don’t want continuously sacrifice my wellbeing for her.",04Oct2019,1

330,"My friend, A, and I are so close. We’ve known each other since elementary school, but really became friends in middle school. We went to the same high school for our first two years before I moved, but we always remained close. Even when all my other friends left me, she has stuck around and been my constant. When I went to university last year, an hour away, A and I texted every day and she visited every few months. Things really didn’t work out for me at school and I came home in a really bad place. She was there for me in ways no one else was. This year, she has gone off to university, four hours away, and she is having the time of her life. I am so so happy for her as she’s made so many friends, is the Vice President of a club already, and is enjoying her school work- something she’s always struggled with. College life suits her so well and while I miss her so much, I’m happy for her and proud of her.
I went to visit her for the first time a few weeks ago, which I won’t be able to do very often since 4 hour drives are really difficult for me, and it’s 8 hours round trip, and I met several of her friends, including her partner, D, who identifies as non-binary and uses they/them pronouns. D is super nice and they get along really well and, again, I’m really happy for A. There’s a lot of acceptance at that school around gender identity and it’s really progressive. I 100% believe that gender is a spectrum myself, so I’m happy to see universities become accepting of people who may not identify as either/ or. 
Anyway, a few nights ago, A messaged me, and told me she was thinking of changing her name. I love her name personally, but college is all about exploring, so I helped her brainstorm some ideas. Most of the names were unisex or masculine, which I thought was pretty cool. She basically had a list of ideas, and I told her my opinions on them (for example, if she chose Felix, she HAD to go as Fix It Felix for halloween, funny things like that). There were a few I had to disagree with because I didn’t think they suited her very well, or they were names of bad people in our lives. One of the names I told her I didn’t like was Josh (not the actual name) and by the end of the night, I thought she’d decided on a name that we both thought was pretty friggin cool. However, she sent me a Snapchat last night, telling me that she’d told all her friends to call her Josh and that she hadn’t realized why I said no until after she’d already told everyone. 
As I mentioned before, we were at the same high school for the first two years, and that’s because of a guy named Josh. I was friends with Josh at first, but things turned sour and for several months of my sophomore year, this much larger boy terrorized me with cryptic messages, thinly veiled threats, and personal attacks. He bullied my other friends (never A) until they stopped wanting to be around me, and it all came to a head when he told me one night that he had a gun. I called the police because I didn’t know if he was planning on shooting me, shooting himself, or shooting up our school. It was awful and terrible and it threw me back into old coping mechanisms that I’d worked so hard to get past. I transferred to a new high school that summer.
The thing is, I doubt A thinks about those incidents anymore- I doubt she remembers Josh at all; but I think about it almost every day. It’s been 5 years and I still have nightmares, I still get angry and scared and get panicked if I think I see him (which happens a lot because he and his brother go to the same community college as me!). The name certainly isn’t bad for her, but I can’t imagine calling her something that I associate with the worst time in my life. 
I want her to be happy, but I’m so upset she picked this name and I don’t know what to do about it. She’s announced it on all her social medias, told everyone at her college, all her other friends back home, so it’s too late for her to change it. I’m just lost and upset and feeling a little betrayed and I don’t know how to approach it with her, or if I should at all. 
Please, I know this is a long ass story and it might be a little jumbled because it’s very late and I’m upset as I’m writing it, but if you can offer some advice, I’d really appreciate it. I don’t know what to do.",04Oct2019,0

341,"Here's a bit of background: I (recent graduate/freelancer) became one of translation volunteers for this company last month.

Last week the CEO of the company had invited the translation team for free lunch, and I happened to be the only translator who showed up. When I got there, there were few other collaborators, and they talked about the ongoing project that I dont know about, but I had a chance to introduce myself as a freelancer when the CEO asked me directly. 

The CEO told me that she's thinking about having a translation team manager for translation quality review and said this position will be paid. She also brought up some other translation task and asked me if I'd be interested. I said ""Sure, I'd be honoured."" and the coversation ended for the day. We haven't met everyone on the translation team in person yet, so it was kind of implied that we will see the levels of language proficiency of each team member. 

Everyone will meet next week, and the operation manager in the team (who has been basically the manager of the translation team) said that this first official meeting is going to be about getting to know each other, discussing management/operation of the group onwards, and that people can ask questions they may have in their minds. 

Here are my main concerns that I need some clarity for: 

1)
I'm a little unsure about what to expect and what kind of questions to bring to this meeting. I've already met the CEO unlike the rest of the group, and we even briefly talked about tasks that can be paid. What kind of position does this put me? 

2)
If I'm going to work with this company as a freelancer, I'd need a contract. (The volunteers don't have it) At what point do I have to bring this up if the CEO doesn't say it during the next meeting? I don't want to come across as overly anxious. And given the circumstance, what would be reasonable for me to expect for the upcoming official meeting? Can I expect the CEO to bring up the matter of writing a contract?

3)
Also, I think the scope of my tasks can be easily blurred because of what I had signed up for as a vlounteer. How do I proceed in handling it?

4)
Lastly, there is this operational manager  (who doesn't know much about translation or language) within the translation team and he's been basically a manager. He's working as a freelancer and has known the CEO about 3 years. 

Beased on his subtle one-upmanship, a kind of putdown-ish backhanded compliment, and his inserting himself in my work, I think I need to manage this person somehow. I need more time to make any conclusion about this person, but I want to make it so that he doesn't get the idea that he's my boss. How do I go about it?

345,"Hello reddit,

Im a 26yo mechanical engineer who absolutely hates his major and career path. I've lost interest in it, not that I had some to begin with. I basically got into mech engineering because of the pressure from my parents and my own meekness . I couldnt stand up for myself back then when I had the choice.

But I decided to change, or to put it clearly, I want to decide to change but I just lack the experience of how life works.

My real passion is screenwriting, and as dumb as it sounds, I believe I can make a living out of it given the opportunity. 

I found a university that gives me the kind of education I want to be a screenwriter even though I'm self taught and I honestly don't need a university to be a good screenwriter but i want the network.

For now, I am unemployed and as childish as it sounds I just dont want to get a job related to mechanical engineering. I've given up on it.  I hate this feeling of indecision.

Do I pursue the degree or do I shut up and nut up and get a damn job in engineering?

Most people tell me to get a job and write in your spare time. Things is, engineering takes a lot of your time and i cant make time for writing but i would be exhausted after work. I tried for the last 2 years. It didnt work.

She’s been having panic attacks (though she doesn’t understand that that’s what they are), and feeling claustrophobic.

350,"I posted this problem on r/amItheasshole but it was removed for alluding to violence even though I was very careful not to include any details. Hopefully it can stay up here.

For context, my ex abused me for 19 months before I managed to get away. I got away almost a year ago. At the time I wasn't ready to involve police and now I think I've run out of time to but that's a separate issue.

I recently found out that my ex was stalking my reddit accounts, both SFW and NSWF, screenshotting posts and sending them to my friends. Luckily nothing on my NSFW account has been too revealing but it still makes me sick to think of him doing this.

If I block him on my accounts the I can't see his posts, comments or messages but he can still see me. He can still see my posts and comments and he can still show them to other people. The only way to avoid this is to abandon both my accounts and start again hoping he won't find me (I know he actively looks through the sub I'm most active in) or to log onto his account and block my accounts from his end. This would stop him seeing me completely. But obviously it's a bit morally dubious to log onto his account at all. I know his details because I set up his reddit for him using an old shared email.

How do I handle this? I'm stumped

P.S. before someone says it, no, I will not confront or talk to him about this. This doesn't make me petty or childish it makes me scared. I've been no contact for a year, I'm not going to break that now.",04Oct2019,1
351,"Cross posted on another sub.

I share a room with my sister. It's difficult as we had an argument years back and she can really hold a grudge. She ignores my existence and after a couple of failed attempts at talking I just gave up and went along with it. (There are people whom she has been ignoring for way longer) She likes to do some passive aggro shit where she makes snide remarks to rile me up but most of the time I just ignore it. Talking to my parents about it did not help, she doesn't listen to them.

She always stays up till sunrise so basically all of the time when I'm sleeping the light is on. I have to wake up early each day for school and once she said something that implied she did it on purpose until sleep pattern struck and she can't sleep any earlier than 2am. Fine. I adjusted by wearing a sleep mask. Again despite talking to my parents about this it's still useless.

Lately she started voice calling her friends at night. Not for school but just chatting. I thought she would have the basic decency to at least lower her volume since she definitely won't end the call just to spite me but apparently basic decency is beyond her.

My mother said that I was welcome to sleep with them but I'm not that enthusiastic about that idea. A couple of times I come back exhausted and just crash out on my parents bed, my father would wake me up with a none too pleased expression and tell me to sleep in my own bed (My father is just about as emotionally available as a wooden block)

I'm tired and frustrated and I'm afraid that if my sister makes one more snide remark within my earshot I won't hesitate to punch her or something. (My father will only warn me to ""Better control your temper"" and that sucks since he's not the one sleeping in a bright room with someone talking loudly)

352,"I feel like I'm not the same, amazing person  my lover fell in love with. I tried my hardest to project an idealized image of myself and the cracks are beginning to show. We used to be so perfect and so happy, for years we were the couple everyone envied, the golden standard to uphold. We genuinely fooled ourselves into thinking our relationship was a dime in a dozen, in a world of shitty relationships. We were each other's favourite person, and we couldn't even stand being a minute apart.

But something's changed. We irritate each other, we argue and bicker more, instead of small conversations there's only silence. There's tolerance when there used to be tenderness. I feel like I'm ruining everything. 

We've started working together, and that's when things slowly started getting worse for us. I think my fuck ups at work and our disagreements are causing this. When we get to just be alone, not think of work, there are glimpses and moments when I'm reminded of how sweet and in-love we once were. 

I've also changed, which is to be expected. It's only natural that people change over the course of many years. I had a very soft and gentle personality, and he was extroverted and bold. Slowly, I've integrated myself more into his circle of family and friends. The lifestyle is a bit... Wolf of Wall Street-ish. Aside from that, after being screwed over and getting older, I've grown cynical and I don't give a fuck about anyone else except for me, my friends and family. (selfish is the right word, no point in sugar-coating it) The scariest part is, I'm not entirely sure if I've changed into a worse person, or this was who I really am? 

How do you begin to salvage a relationship when Our work relationship is ruining things, but quitting is not an option for either of us. I need to go back to who I was before, and I'm not so bad at hiding who I really am. I think... I have been for years. It was only when he started encouraging me to be myself that I felt... ""Myself"" is a bad person. That's why, for so many years, I became someone else. I was never honest about who I was because who I really was, was a bad person, so I strived to become someone better. I never should have believed him when he said I had to be myself more.

So I recently started a new job(about 2 months ago), and this one pays about enough to pay the bills, and have some left over for food and transportation. Its something similar to my old job, and something along the lines of what I studied in college(multimedia arts/comm arts). 

Today, I was online on Twitter and a friend of mine retweeted something about a work from home gig that pays in $$$ (I'm from the Philippines), and is just about the same amount of hours of work every day. This one is more of a call center kind of job. But, compared to my current job, this one pays about x6.5 of what I get  in a month. I got the application form, they said they need someone for a full time position. 

With that being said, I'm sort of contemplating if I should take it or not. I have asked my friend who retweeted it and it is not a scam;he is friends with the person who is lookong to hire, and it really does pay that well(in the philippines anyway). But when I asked my boyfriend about it he said, ""if it makes you happy go for it, but i think youd be happier with a job that helps you grow in an industry you want to be in."" and his words sorta weigh heavy on the whole situation, because its true. 

I do want a job that helps me grow better in terms of career and my network in that industry, but I dont even know how long I'll be in this industry either. But then, I also want to take the shot of earning $3200 monthly so I can either enroll in another course that I actually want to take/own a small franchise/help my parents/invest, and actually have spare money. Please reddit, what do I do?

TL;DR : sorta new job im currently in pays enough for bills and food, but incoming possible new job that will pay x6.5 of what im currently getting paid for. Current job is in line with my course from college, possible job is a call center job that i have no idea how to do.

Which should I choose?",04Oct2019,2
354,"No matter what time I go to bed, I wake up at 6am each day. This has been occurring for a week or so and I can’t seem to shake it.

355,"Dear Reddit,

Over the last few months, I've noticed changes in myself that have affected me greatly. In a bad way. The things I told myself I wouldn't become, or things I would never do, all of them seem to become reality. I've been finding it hard to control myself, I seem to start doing bad things more often now. My overall attitude has become more negative. I became more rude and mean, and seem to have lost sensitivity to others. I am now much more short tempered. I find it hard to have a great time anytime anymore. I can't seem to enjoy life, since I feel like bad luck is always around the corner. I try to be positive everyday, but when the day ends, I'm as miserable as I was before. I've also been more paranoid, about what exactly I don't know. I don't seem to be a good friend anymore, since I'm losing them left and right. My grades have been sinking fast, causing me to think whether or not I can really have a happy, successful life.

I used to be a really great person. I used to think I was so mature. I had a really positive outlook on life. I had a lot of friends. I had advice to teach others that would genuinely help them, which made me happy. I used to have great traits, which people would be very proud of me for. Now, all of that's gone. I feel like I've hit rock bottom. I feel sad all the time now. The only things that make me happy are music, my family, and social media.

I want to go back to my old self. I miss the old me. I really, really do. That's why I'm reaching out here, since I feel like I can trust all of you. I love you, Reddit. Help me out. Any pieces of advice, to get my life back on track?",04Oct2019,5

357,"Hello reddit. I’ve been having a dilemma I was hoping you guys could help me with. 

I’m 21 and I work as a full-time employee as a laboratory technician for petroleum products. My company is opening up a new lab about 5 states north of where I currently live, and my manager asked me if I wanted to relocate to be the new laboratory supervisor there, despite me only just starting in the field 4 months ago. Regretfully I told her yes at the time, thinking there was no way someone as young as me could pass this opportunity up. However, I now have my doubts. From what I can tell, it’s going to be a shit show to get that lab up and running. It’s something that, with my lackluster experience, I don’t think I can handle. Especially since I’ll be moving 800 miles away, it’s not something that I’ve been too excited about doing. I just fear that it’ll be too stressful for me, and I’ll practically be living at that job I’ll be working so much.

So, with that being said, should I call her and tell her that I no longer want the promotion? It’s very close to me actually making the move over there. Would it be a bad decision to tell her I changed my mind when it’s so close? Or should I just suck it up and take this job because I’m young and I’ve got nothing to lose?",04Oct2019,1

However, this was on Monday (10/4/19) and I have yet to receive my refund. I sent them a reminder Wednesday and they responded saying they'd put it through today (today being Wednesday). According to resources I looked up, eBay gives sellers 6 days to refund customers and, when they do refund the buyer, it should show up immediately if you used Paypal (which is what I did). We're now on day 5 and somehow I don't see this going any better tomorrow. I'd like to send them another reminder, but also a notice letting them know that if it's not done by Monday I'll be getting the resolution center involved. Now I've got two problems if I go this route:

1. How do I phrase in a non-threatening/civil way and not sound like an ass
2. This one's a long one. Sorry. So the seller said that they would not be paying for shipping. When I went to start the return online, a label popped up saying that the seller had shipping covered (something like that I don't remember). Me being a fool used the label on the return only for it to be sent back to me for lack of postage. So I bought a label from the post office (w/ a different number) and sent it to the seller. So according to USPS and the seller themself (since they admitted to having it), the item has been delivered. However, eBay is tracking the label they offered and according to that, the package is still in a town or two over from me instead of another state. I'm worried if I bring up to the resolution center they'll only go by what info they have and side with the seller saying that they never got the item even though I have all this other stuff that says otherwise.

It was okay at first because I was taking 6 classes last semester + I’m a resident assistant. Over the summer, it wasn’t enough for me but luckily people were asking me to take their shifts. In August I got to work for 20+ hours in a week!!!

I ended up going home before Labor Day and worked for 8 hours. I worked for 4.5 hours on 9/20/19. 

What I used to do was put in 16+ hours of availability every week and they’d only schedule me for 4-8 hours/week (sometimes they won’t schedule me for a week). 

They scheduled 4.5 hours from 9/15-9/21.
0 hours from 9/22-9/28. 0 hours for 9/29-10/5 (this week). They posted the schedule and I have 0 hours for 10/6-10/12 (next week).  Not only that, my name isn’t even on the schedule (sometimes I’d have no hours but my name would still be there. Recently it would be on and off. But I called to see if I was working next week and whoever answered said that I should talk to someone about this bc my name wasn’t on it). 

I got 10 hours this week with my new job. I am considering quitting job #1 because of this BS but I want to see how things are at job #2 first. 

TLDR: my job hasn’t scheduled me for three weeks. Why are they doing this? I know I wasn’t fired because my name is still on the employment list online (and they fired a crappy associate a few weeks ago and her name is gone so it’s definitely up to date) What should I do?",04Oct2019,1

I thought things are about get easier and even better. I mean hey: fixed hours, higher salary, upgraded position... who doesn’t want that right?

But boy, was I wrong.

A position opened up at the retirement home that paid more than Chipotle so I decided to leave Chipotle. They didn't want me to so I stayed one day a week. A customer upset me so I decided to ghost them. I don't normally do this, I just don't like disappointing people. They ended up putting me on leave and then asking me to come back after 2 months of me being MIA.

For the most part I enjoy the job at the retirement home. My direct superior is great. But the other bosses in my department stress me out and put me down. I don't want to be here anymore when they are here. 

I love my coworkers at Chipotle, they are all amazing. The customer's are just entitled and closing shift stresses me out.

Pros 

Retirement home:
Tons of PTO
Higher Pay
Easy Job
Convenient for commute 

Chipotle:
Appreciates me
Amazing Coworkers and Bosses
Literally 10 minutes from my house

Retirement home:

The deadline for submission is the end of this month and I still don't have enough paperwork/effort put into the master's degree. I am however planning to take it, but not now.

They asked if I had taken anything recently illegally or legally (hydrocodone, oxy, painkillers) both categorically no.  It's been years since I have taken hydrocodone and never oxycontin.

So I came in a couple days later and I popped again for opioids and they are going to cut me off of my prescription. Now this is getting ridiculous.

I have no clue what could be causing the positive test.  I take a multi-vitamin and my prescription - that's it.  The only thing I could think could be the cause is that there's something ""extra"" in the THC edibles I bought from a dispensary.

I'm a 24 year old living at home with my parents. I struggle to do day to day things without my mum being there. I know growing up as a kid I was really close to my mum and that we had a strong bond. As I started getting older I started to gain my own life but sadly I was diagnosed with cancer in my late teens.

When this happened my mum went everywhere with me to the point she even came into medical rooms for scans etc to make sure I was ok, staying over at the hospital during chemos etc.

After my treatment stopped I tried to go back to my normal life but understandly I struggled with day to day tasks and adjusting to a normal life. 

I feel I have an unhealthy attachment issue with my mum as I can't try new foods, go to New places or even leave the house for a few hours without her otherwise I go into a bad panic attack. If she is unwell and I can't see her or go near her I have a massive panic attack too.

Any advice on how to break this bond or even pointing me in the right direction would be amazing and I'd be forever grateful

My boyfriend and i have been dating for a little while now and i care a great deal about him but i think he wants kids much more than i do. He told me i might change my mind and want kids but to tell him if i decide positively that i don't want kids. I've spent the time since he requested that thinking about my future and whether or not i might want children. I'm still not sure. 

The idea of having kids scares me on so many levels. My mother, sister in law, grandmother, and aunt all had hard pregnancies. My mother nearly died and my aunt was told after her first that another would kill her. My physical health is also very important to my work and I'm worried about the recovery from birth or c-section.

I'm also very, very nervous about raising a kid. My childhood was rough and I don't think I'm competent enough to give a kid what they need. It's taken me this long to just feel fairly comfortable with myself.

I don't know if im up for motherhood right now but i don't want to put my boyfriend in a position where he is with someone who won't give him the family he wants. I don't want him waiting for me and for me to take up the younger part of his life only to decide kids aren't for me.

402,"Hello everybody!

So I just moved to Florida from WV to start a new job. In order to become a resident of Florida one must (along with a few other irrelevant things) get a Florida driver's license. Once one gets a Florida license however, one must also register his vehicle in Florida from I can tell from Google. I do not want to do this though because registering a vehicle in Florida can cost $400+, staying on my parents' insurance which doesn't cover Florida is much cheaper as well, and I may only be working this job for a year. The car has both mine and my father's name on the title. Does this mean that the car can stay registered under my dad's name in WV so that I can keep the current insurance policy on it or is that not possible?

The reason why I want to become a resident of Florida is because of the no state income tax and my employer for whatever reason doesn't take out out-of-state state income tax (Are they allowed to not do that?).

Thanks for any insight that you may give me on this!

I’ve considered the pros and cons of both colleges many times. So far I’m thinking community college is the better choice for me 


Pros for Ivy League: 
•You build better connections 
•You get the top professors in their fields teaching you 
•You’re more likely to get a job 


Cons for Ivy League:
•The costs 
•You’re not guaranteed a job right out the gates 
•Its way more stressful and competitive 


Pros for community college:
•Its more affordable 
•Although you may not get the best professors you’ll still learn the necessary skills in order to land a job 
•It is easier to graduate early and outshine your peers 


Cons for community college:
•There are less connections 
•It’ll be harder to land a job

The stress got so bad that I had to flee to the bathroom and cry, and that was only an hour into the shift. It was like this for the whole day, extremely busy with rude customers with a condescending crew leader to top it off while I make mistake after mistake.

Even after the dining room closed I fucked up constantly. First a co-worker called me out for using the wrong kind of water for mopping (the lady who trained me didn't teach me half the shit I'm supposed to know) then I locked myself out of the resteraunt because a lady wanted to talk to me outside about her incorrect order and it took me 5 minutes of knocking on the glass just for an employee to let me back in.

423,"So, this is longer than the title suggests. My girlfriend from two years moved back to her home town 8 months ago (it's really, really far away). She moved to the city for college but never liked it and always wanted to go back to her home town. We kept it going long distance since. Non of us want to break up, but none of us wants to move where the other lives. I don't want to move to ""the end of the world"" (literally,  look it up) and she doesn't like the city. 

The ideal solution for each of us would be for the other to move in. But since that's not likely to happen, the next best thing is looking for some place else. Moving away from the country and work in Canada, Australia, etc. This option wasn't anyone's first choice, but is the alternative we found. 

The idea was for her to move back to the city while we plan this, but the idea is to make it super temporary (she moves in on January and we move together somewhere else that same year, as early as possible).

At the same time, my boss offered me a promotion to a small management job. It's something I liked, and it would be helpful to my CV because its something different to what I'm doing and would give me new skills, etc. I don't have a college degree,  so being great at my job is important to me. The issue with this is that it would require me to stay at least 1.5/2  years on the job. This is something my boss asked upfront. Not a contract thing, more or a ""it's an important job and if you take it I can't have you leaving in 6 months"" thing.

I asked my girlfriend and she told me she doesn't want to spend two years in the city. But the problem is that in 8 months we did zero progress on the whole ""moving away"" thing. We didn't check countries, Visa applications yet. We do have some savings, but not enough to start from scratch abroad. So I wouldn't mind turning down the job and moving abroad together if we had a plan, but it concerns me that none of us really did any progress towards that. And I believe that we might spend a long time figuring that out when she comes here in January. So ultimately we might still spend years in the city planning our trip so I would have turned down the job for no reason. 

My plan would be to take the job, spend the two years really saving money,  fix my apartment new so I can rent it properly when I leave and after two years ask for a transfer and work in a different office within the company. But my girlfriend doesn't want to be tied to the city for that long.

Bottom line. I want the job, but I don't want it to cost me my relationship. However, it's not like we really have a plan B (or rather we do, but it hasn't progressed in 8 months). So if I take the job and my gf doesn't move in with me, we're kind of done, because long distance is terrible.

426,"Hello, looking for some advice on what to in this situation:

My girlfriend and I (24&amp;25) just moved into our first place (3 family home - top floor). We have been there for 2 months now, and have had nothing but pleasant interactions with our landlord who lives on the second floor. Things have been going great up until this past Sunday. 

I had 2 friends come over in one car Sunday night. They were over for roughly 2 1/2 hours to watch football. When they got to their car to leave my friend found his car had broken wiper stems and some chipped paint. For about 15 minutes we were all outside trying to figure out what happened. Just then, our landlord comes out to join us, and immediately takes the blame for the damage.

He explained that many unwanted vehicles park in his (rather large) lot, as the commuter rail is a walk away. Apparently, days ago a car that looked similar to my friend’s had been parked in the same spot, also backed in. He stated his garage was broken into and so forth, and acted out of anger assuming this was the same car. 

So the next day my landlord texted me early and wanted me to let my friend know he has a brother-in-law who can fix the damage (did not specify if he was a mechanic or not). I let my friend know, but as most people in his position would, he opted to go strait to his car’s manufacturer repair shop, as he purchased this car recently. 

The total came out to less than what we expected - just under $250. Seems like a very reasonable cost. My friend then contacted my landlord with the costs, and his response was “the price is too high” while further pushing the idea of going to his brother-in-law for a cheaper rate on his end. 

My friend has no issue with going to civil court with him if thats what it comes down to - as he openly admitted to the damage, (plus the fact that he wanted to cause further damage) has cameras set up, and has 3 additional witnesses. 

My girlfriend and I obviously want to avoid court by all means, and just wish he would be more reasonable and pay up for his wrongdoing. We really love this place and outside of this incident - like our landlord. **Not sure if its worth mentioning but he is the head of a religious Muslim family. 

Any thoughts on what we should do?",04Oct2019,1
427,"I wanted to ask anyone that knows about this process a little to help me out. I applied online for apple retail and began the interview process on the 7th of August. I had 1 phone interview and then an in-person interview the following day and then didn't hear back for a week. I got an email a week later inviting me to the final interview which was going to be roughly a month later on the 10th of September. I did have the interview on the 10th but the ""store leader"" who was supposed to conduct the interview was out sick and another senior manager did the interview and told me she would get back to me about the final interview but didn't offer a timeline for that. After a week of nothing I emailed the stores generic email box just to follow up only with reply. I waited another week before calling and asking to speak with the senior manager that conducted my interview on the 10th. I was told she was busy and could call me back later. I never heard back and when I tried to call the store again I am placed on hold by the robo call guy and then the line hangs up. I was a little fed up that I couldn't get through to someone and decide to go to the store. However when I got there I was told by the specialist at the front that I would receive a call or email. That was last Wednesday the 25th. I have yet to hear from anyone. Should I just assume I didn't get the position even though I was told I would hear back? On the apple jobs site the position has not yet been closed for my store and it seems to still be taking applications. I am a little frustrated. I would rather them just let me know I did not get the job rather than kinda lead me on. I don't know what to do.

430,"Hello r/Advice, I’m new to this sub and hope you guys can help me out. 

Almost 3 weeks ago, I was involved in a very small vehicle accident where a woman reversed from her parking spot and hit the passenger side of my vehicle and left a dent.  She immediately admitted fault and apologized and we agreed to handle it ourselves rather than filing a claim. She called me the same day and we set up a date where I can get my vehicle fixed at a shop from someone she knew. Fast forward to that day and she tells me that the repair shop guy forgot he had a court date that day and won’t be able to get it fixed that day. She tells me she’ll set up another date when we could get it fixed but I haven’t heard since. I believe in California, the latest to file a claim is 10 days for vehicle accidents (please advise me if I’m wrong). Considering it’s been almost 3 weeks since the accident, what are my options? I took a picture of her registration, driver’s license, and insurance card. I have pictures of the damages to my car but not hers as she didn’t suffer any. 

Should I file a small claims suit? The only evidence I have of her being at fault are the text messages between us and her apologizing for what happened and “wanting to get this taken care of” but she doesn’t necessarily admit to being at fault in the text messages. Do I have a case? What should I do?

441," Hey guys, college freshman here.

My parents were pretty dead-set as a kid on me never touching a video game. As it was not something related to studying, they called it a ""stupidity"", and made fun of game adverts anytime they went on TV, saying ""They \[the elite, probably the Jews according to them\] make games for the kids to go stupid so that They stay on top"".

That didn't stop me from having the typical ""gamer"" personality: very poor social skills, being pretty much hated by everyone, self-esteem issues, weight issues, an inability to fit in with the ""normies"". I thought it would fade over with time, but it's only gotten worse; as I am typing this, I look around at my college class and weep, for they are all so, so much superior to me.

I'm a student in biotechnology; but we share our campus with a programming school. This is where I met my current boyfriend, and his friends, who don't seem to mind my company (which is very rare).

Now, the people at the programming school are pretty much all gamer weebs, to put it bluntly, with all that it implies - read: similar personality traits to mine. When I told them that I was reluctant to start gaming, they jokingly told me that me becoming a gamer was ""inevitable"" and my boyfriend tried to convince me to download at least one game so that we could play together. I did, tried to open it, and the fact it went fullscreen immediately made me burst into tears and shut my computer. I feel like this is a decision that might change my life forever. It might seal the divorce between me and the ""normie"" world.

I just happened to read the testimonies on this subreddit and I am afraid. Should I open the game? It's sitting there, waiting for me to start it. On the one hand, I fear I'm being too judgemental. On the other, what if I truly end up the filth of humanity? The lowest point on the social hierarchy? I'm scared, I'm so scared.

So I am a super senior public health major at a state school doing everything I can in my own power to not graduate college. 


I went abroad spring 2018 to Australia and after that, I have been terrified of graduating. And the biggest problem is that I keep getting in my own way.  


I always skip class. I always do assignments late now and even don’t do some. I’m always getting in my own way because I’m just so scared of graduating.

This is my third time taking an integral course to my graduation, and it isn’t a difficult class. It is a seminar on graduating. And I can never bring myself to go. I can’t bring myself to do the assignments. I don’t know why I’m like this and why I keep getting in my own way.

Then later on campus I'm getting a bus from the gym and realise that I MIGHT see him and understand what I'm doing is not okay so I move away. I've since avoided my impulses to see him.

I mean, it was intentional that I got off the bus earlier than usual and I knew that I have to walk past his area. I think I was hoping to see him on all of those occasions. I was going home but I also was at that bus stop hoping to see him. Another occasion went to the bar with my friend because he sometimes goes there with his friends. Not cool, I know.

467,"Hello all. I have received a notice in my door today for the second time saying that I've violated policy of my apartment complex. In the report it States ""loud walking, furniture shaking, loud voices between the hours of 12 am - 3 am from the master bedroom."" This was reported by my downstairs neighbor, who has been giving me trouble nonstop since I moved in. Here is a little bit of backstory:

I moved into this apartment with my father and my girlfriend around may. Day one while we are moving furniture in, we hear loud banging on the ceiling. Day two they are blasting music loud enough to shake the apartment. My girlfriend and I took the master bedroom and we noticed that the floors are extremely squeaky, especially in the hallway leading to the bathroom. It doesnt matter how we tried to walk, it squeaked. Loud. The three of us went to the office shortly after to report this because we were worried about disturbing our neighbors. We are told nothing can be done.

Since then we have tried extremely hard to be quiet.  We've tried walking on our tip toes, walking to our bathroom as if we were trying not to step on glass, yet nothing worked. It's a little bit more difficult as my partner is a bit heavy, so she walks a little heavier than I do. Every time me or my girlfriend got up to go to the bathroom, we would hear banging. Progressively harder and more frequent. 

One morning about 3 months in, my girlfriend and I made our way out the door around 7 am to get to work. That's when one of the two who live in the apartment down below confronted us. She had been standing at her door for a couple minutes and pretended to be leaving as we came out the door. (The only reason I know this is because we heard her slam the door a few minutes before we walked out.)

She introduced herself in a very standoffish manner,  told us that the squeaky floors were driving them crazy and that ""she understands it's not our fault."" She explains she and her partner were ""overseas"" the night we moved in (when the banging started) and that something had to be done about the floor. We told her we spoke to the managers of the complex and she said she would just have to talk to them herself. That same night, the banging continued. Louder and more frequent than usual.

We decided to tell the managers about this and let them know that we dont want to escalate the situation, but there is nothing we can do. We decided to file a complaint about the banging and ended up receiving one from them in response a few nights after. ""Loud walking, furniture shaking, moving furniture, and loud voices between the hours of 12 am - 3 am"". 

At this point we became frustrated and spoke to the office about it. They said there was nothing they could do and if we felt threatened by the neighbors then we should call 911 or the officer on site. The banging stopped and everything seemed to be going well. Until today.

I wake up to the second violation notice. My father and my girlfriend are visibly upset and I become very upset myself. I dont understand why they are doing this. We are asleep during the hours they are complaining about unless we come home from a night shift at our job, to which we eat and get ready for bed between 10 and 12 PM. We dont talk loud at all or walk unless it's to the bathroom during the night. I sleep with the TV on but with the volume on 15. I've done everything in my power to accomodate to them because I dont want this tension and drama, but nothing works.

The second violation notice states that I have 2 policy violation strikes and that I need to call the office or speak in person to tell them about what I'm going to do to accomodate to the neighbors. I called and left a message (the office was closed on my way to work this morning so I couldn't stop by) and have yet to get a call back. I'm going to explain that I dont know what they're talking about because we only go to the room to sleep, otherwise we are in the livingroom.

I feel like we are just going to receive the same ""we cant do anything about it"" from the complete managers as last time and I dont know what else I can do. We haven't done anything to these people yet they are trying to get us kicked out. What else can I do? Is there any way I can get these false violations off my record? Any advice would be wonderful.

Apologies for the long post, these details are important. Thank you for whoever took the time to read this and voice their thoughts.",04Oct2019,2
468,"TL;DR I want to switch roommates but I love my living situation otherwise.

I'll preface this by saying I consider myself a very friendly, agreeable person. I've always prided myself on my ability to stay cordial at the worst of times, and I've done well in all of my customer service jobs due to it. With that being said, I can't stay 'on' all the time and some situations there's no amount of friendliness that can get you out. So, this fall I started college, and I was faced with a pretty unique housing situation: live in a triple economy room, which is three roommates living in a bigger double room for cheaper; a single room in the most expensive dorm hall, which is way out of my budget; live in a double room in one of the cheapest dorm halls with no A/C, which isn't horrible but I absolutely do not handle the heat well; or live in a double room in the college's Greek village for sororities and fraternities. I chose the Greek village because I thought it could be interesting and it suited some personal likes of mine. I'm not part of any sorority as it is an unaffiliated house used for dorm overflow, although some of my house-mates do participate in Greek life but chose to continue living in the unaffiliated house.

A bit of background for the house-- it's my roommate and I, nine other beds (but eight girls, which I'll get to later), and a Community Advisor that functions basically the same as a traditional RA, making sure we're not drinking, smoking, being too loud during quiet hours, etc, although we also have an RA who lives in the other unaffiliated house. It has a community kitchen which includes a fridge, microwave, stove/oven, and a small dining table, a barebones living room, a chapter room (used by the greek chapters but by us for game nights or house dinners), one and a half bathrooms downstairs and two and a half bathrooms upstairs, and a laundry room. My roommate and I, along with the CA, live on the first floor while the other residents live upstairs. I consider myself a 'foodie' so having a kitchen and a fridge available for use was one of my main driving points, and the house's closeness to the rec center and half of my classes. 

When I made my room selection, the last bed in the house was open which I was able to snag, and since the other bed already had someone assigned to it, we were given each other's school emails, and we swapped snapchats/instagrams/facebooks as the youngins do. I found out my roommate lived about a half hour from my hometown, but because I worked full time during the day and night, wasn't able to meet up with her. We kept up on text though, and although she sent a couple weird messages and didn't have an opinion on room decorations, it wasn't anything I was worried about. 

Come move-in day, I realize that my roommate is a bit odd. I don't, in any way, mean to sound rude or mean, or presume something that's not mine to presume, but it's clear that she has some kind of mental disability. Again, I'm not going to try to armchair diagnose, but I've worked with kids with autism and Asperger's and she has some of the same mannerisms. Nothing that I've never seen before, and I'm not running for the hills, but it's been more and more difficult to live with. Being noisy early in the mornings and when I've told her I'm napping, leaving her space messy, changing clothes in front of me, and she has really bad foot Stank.

Now, I'm not going to sit here and pretend I'm the most considerate, courteous roommate to ever have existed. I come home late some days a bit tipsy and can stir up a bit of a racket, but I don't play loud music, I don't keep really strong scents in my diffuser or pungent food in the room, let her know when I'll have friends or my boyfriend over, and I keep our room tidy (taking out our shared recycling and sweeping). 

Lastly, I just wanted to ask what your guys' advice would be. I can put in a request to switch dorms, but that would mean possibly switching to a dorm with no kitchen or that is far away from my classes. Or, like I mentioned earlier, I can ask to switch to the one unoccupied bed that belonged to a girl that left school. My only worry with that is that I'll be viewed as a 'shark' or trying to move in on a place that's not mine to. I really would like to live in a room that has that classic dorm hall feel, where I can knock on my next-door neighbor's door for a hole punch or help on a math homework, and to have that close-knit feeling that I know the upstairs residents share.",04Oct2019,2

Recently I’ve swapped jobs from a rota based job (worked most weekends so didn’t see my partner much) to a Monday to Friday job. I think with the swap I’ve been having difficulty with not having time off by myself and him always being around.

Ever since then, I’ve found myself trying to create distance and kind of losing some romantic feelings even. 

A few of my friends recently have taken breaks from their boyfriends - and in both situations it ended in a break-up.

I don’t want that to happen to us, but I’ve really been wanting to take a break from it all without emotions getting hurt (impossible I know).

Has anyone ever taken a break from their partner? How did it end?",04Oct2019,1
483,"I used to suffer from a lot of anxiety. Like to the point it was hard to function. I would always think about every little thing that could go wrong and it was always such pointless shit. So I started seeing a psychologist and she helped me see the bigger picture. I also started doing some drugs like weed and shrooms. So through all that now I don't worry about ANYTHING anymore. I've gone in the exact opposite direction.

Before I would worry about consequences of things past and present, but now I realize no consequence really matters because long term consequences do not exist and hypothetical ones aren't worth dwelling on because just as these outcomes are extremely unlikely, THE FUTURE ITSELF IS UNLIKELY. I could die at any time from a freak accident or I could fall terminally ill from what the fuck ever, so why worry? 

How bad can anything really get when the worst possible outcome ever is a state of being where you won't even be? 

So I started living by this mantra but now I am in a complete lackadaisical state. We are here for such a short time that worrying doesn't deserve ANY vacancy. Good advice to an extent but I have literally lost all fucks to give. I find it very hard to focus with work, during sex, even when it comes down to bodily functions. As for these three things, I got fired, got dumped, and I shit in my bed, respectively. Not even joking. Actually, the last two are connected. Granted, I was stoned.

Basically, I was having sex with my girlfriend and I started getting stomach cramps. I was like... okay I think I can keep this turd at bay for a few more minutes. But then I thought nah fuck it and shit the bed while she was riding me on top. First, she smelled it. Quickly dismounted me, so then, she saw it. 

""What the fuck? You just shit the fucking bed, are you kidding me?""

""Oh, babe. Why does it matter? Don't you understand the only reason you find it unacceptable is because society has ingrained it in your brain that it is?""

""You've fucking lost it and you're cracked. I'm sorry yeah we're done.""

It didn't even affect me. And I was so stoned that I just went back to sleep. Woke up with a crusty ass like seaweed. The shit ossified on my ass.

This all happened last week. I'm now unemployed and single and I've been wasting time playing video games all this week because I no longer fucking care. Nothing bothers me.

Just yesterday is when things got really bad. A concerned friend figured I must be depressed about my break up so he invited me for a night out. He offered to be my wing man so I could find a rebound chick. I agreed. We got fucking stoned and drunk before even going out.

At our first club we both started chatting up some chicks. I slapped one on the ass and she was surprisingly receptive. I would have never done this before but like I said, I have no inhibitions now. She said we should go fuck in the bathroom and I said hell yeah. As soon as we got in there we started dry humping. Then she pulled my pants off and I was so fucking hard. She gave me one lick and I felt that about-to-orgasm feeling in my cock... Or at least... I thought I did.

I was like ""Yo, I'm about to blast"" and she was like ""What? Already, are you serious? Are you fucking 12 or something?"" and I started stroking it and was like ""Just shut up and catch this with your mouth slut"" You see, my friend and I drank like four beers before heading out so I was pretty full up. I thought I was about to cum but instead I started pissing in her god damn mouth. She moved back and it went all over her fucking face and I was like ""God fucking dammit you gotta be kidding me. Should I pay you for your trouble? At least let me buy you a new shirt I'm so sorry."" (didn't actually care but I wanted to TRY and de-escalate the situation.)

She just kind of stood there and collected herself then slapped me right in the face and screamed ""You're so dead!"" She went out to the bar and said ""The pervert in there just pissed on me!"" Within a few seconds a bunch of guys burst in to kick my ass. 

At this moment I had a very insane realization. Before, I would be so god damn scared. I used to hate the idea of fighting because I heard stories of people getting hit the wrong way and dying or accidentally killing someone and going to jail. So in this moment I realized my newfound carefree spirit extended to fears. I was no longer scared of a fight or of dying during one, so I just went all out on these guys.... 

Or so I thought. My friend told me later I took a few really bad swings three seconds apart at each of the three guys who all just kind of absorbed the punches before one smiled and cracked me in the face just once and knocked me out. Once I was out cold, a bouncer came in and told those guys to leave the bar.

After that, my friend told the bouncer to carry me to a nearby bench which is where I woke up, with my friend sitting beside me. He told me what happened and we laughed our asses off. Then he took a pic of me with his phone to show me my blackeye which caused us to burst out in laughter again. After that we called it a night and walked home.

But yeah I gave absolutely no fucks. I legit find it funny that I got a black eye and knocked out. But at the same time I know it isn't right to think like this. So I guess the only thing I'm worried about anymore is that I'm not worried. I know this is too far so I wanna know how I can take back a lil bit of control without becoming an anxious wreck again.",04Oct2019,1

Unfortunately throughout highschool i slid by, barely doing any real work and manipulating teachers to help me pass.

I work in a restaurant, I’ve been here just over three years. The pay practice had always been a little shady but we’ve always been taken care of. In the last several months however, paychecks have been bouncing, and I haven’t gotten a direct deposit in about 3 weeks. It’s been business checks whenever my boss gets around to it. I casually asked on Tuesday “hey, when are payckecks this week?”. His response was “things are very hard for me right now, just give me a couple of days.” 

Alright, it’s been a few days now and I checked, no checks for me. My rent is due and obviously the whole point of a job is to make money to live, and clearly this isn’t doing just that. I’ve not given up my job hunt and today will only ramp up my hunt even more. 


This is where it’s difficult and I’m not sure how exactly to handle it.

She is an alcoholic and was really bad in my young teenage years to the point that my sister and her relationship is beyond repair (they are civil and do love each other it just won’t be the same)

She was then sober for a year and everything seemed perfect. Now she drinks again. But she says she just does it sociably, but that’s like a drug addict just doing it a little socially - it won’t end well. 

She has started drinking at home and just having 1 or 2 gin and tonics on a night, nothing to get her smashed. But at the weekend she had a blowout and got raging drunk - luckily I wasn’t there so didn’t have to see it.

I’ve kind of been separating and distancing myself because all she does is nag me and say I’m moody or that I’m bringing the mood down.

502,"I'm  in my mid-twenties, living in Zurich (Switzerland) with my girlfriend  of 8 years. I have a well-paid job that I like, and I enjoy life around  here. I love the area, have a short commute to work, etc. On the  medium/long term, we want to stay around Zurich - mainly to be close to  our family.

We're planning to have  kids in the next 2-4 years, and asking ourselves the question: should  we leave abroad for some time before that? (\~1y) Essentially, I'm afraid  that I will, later in my life, regret not having taken the opportunity  to live abroad and experience other things. I didn't travel much after  college, except for 8 months in Nothern Europe (which went very well).  On the other side, it sounds a little stupid to move right now ""just  because we can"" - especially given that a move abroad implies a  non-negligible time / money / energy investment.

I  know that ""having kids"" doesn't automatically mean ""being stuck"", but  I'm pretty confident it raises much higher the difficulty to move abroad  for a short period of time (\~1y).

She was at my house every weekend and went on all family vacations. Last spring, I had something horrible happen to me that left me with horrible PTSD. After this thing happened, I now associated her with the event. Being around her made me anxious and the thought of being around her made me want to pull out my hair. I have since gotten help and I feel I am in a place to try to reach out to her again but she isn’t interested. See, when I told her I couldn’t be around her as it sparked my PTSD, she said she understood but I believe it offended her. She didn’t have anything to do with what happened, she was just there the same night it did. I reached out to her about. A month ago asking if she wanted to do something and she never replied. Now, she may have not seen the message so I tried again. I told her how I missed her and I was really hoping to try and hang out soon. She replied with “I understand” and that is it.

508,"Background story:  


I'm 25. I was born and raised on the central coast of California. Due to a series of events that unfolded in my later teenage years, my parents split up and my mother lives primarily off a portion of my father's retirement check he received every month.  I currently live with my mother (no shame), and have realized the situation to be not sustainable in the least bit.   


I currently attend community college and am majoring in Computer Science. There are a few issues that are preventing me from finishing my Bachelor's degree though:

* I don't / won't receive NEAR enough financial aid (gov loans included) to be able to sustain myself or even get a roommate with the cost of living here in California now...No matter which college I choose to transfer to for finishing my degree, all of them have insane living costs that I won't be able to pull. I would be more than happy to get a part time job while going through my courses, and I tried this once while still here at community college and it caused my grades to drop HORRENDOUSLY (I'm talking D's and F's).  
* I completely bombed my first Computer Science exam. I was warned about 1/3 of the way into the semester, a week before the exam, that the professor I chose to take is absolutely brutal on his students and does everything he possibly can to make people drop out of the program, and low and behold it came to fruition when he handed out the first exam and 3 people left crying hysterically, myself extremely confused as to why the material on the exam was not what was covered in class and was much different than the assigned homework.....This may be a moot point but it's caused me to seriously consider dropping out and(or) trying something else (perhaps accounting, as that seems to be a bit easier and more sustainable)....
* My father offered to cosign a private student loan and an apartment for where I choose to go...This seems all well and good but I don't think I could ever bring myself to put this on my father who's provided everything else for us, with a chance that I could end up not getting a job to be able to make ends meet while paying that loan off....and at this point I'm not even sure I'll be able to transfer given I probably got a low mark on my first CS exam....
* Even if I do finish my degree and get a job, I would, once again, be absolutely struggling and swimming to make ends meet here in California...It's not really a life I envisioned for myself growing up, nor a life that I would like to sustain for any length of time.
* I was stupid as hell 3 years ago and got a brand new car with a $24k loan...I've payed it down to $14k but I don't see this as being sustainable, and I have absolutely no idea how to get rid of it and get another car, as the worth on the car is much lower than $14k (it's about $9-$10k...). Live and learn, and in hindsight it was one of THE most stupid decisions I've made in my lifetime. 

&amp;#x200B;

So now that that's out of the way..I've been seriously considering dropping school, getting a full time job, and saving every single penny to move out of California and start fresh.  All of my friends around me are struggling and a LOT of them are becoming homeless very quickly, my family is struggling, my girlfriend is struggling, our relationship is dwindling and constantly hangs by a thread because of financial issues..Some days I don't eat, a lot of days I can't sleep because I'm up late worrying about these issues...and most days I just feel like completely giving up.  


Now the questions I have:  


Should I actually strive to get the hell out of California? My gut tells me I need to, but I'm curious as to just how far I can get somewhere else..I don't have too many skills, yet I have a decent resume and hold a bit of managerial experience in an extremely busy storefront, I work really well with people and can hold my own when things get intensely stressful.  


What places would be ideal for lowering cost of living? I understand that life is hard in general, but anything seems better than what I'm going through at this point. I'm willing to do WHATEVER it takes in terms of work to be able to provide a stable life for myself and my loved ones, and work towards giving back to my parents for all they've helped me with.   


I have about $2000 saved at the moment..What would be an ideal number to shoot for to be able to get the hell out of here, given I find a decent job in wherever I choose to move to?  


I'm sorry if this post seems all over the place...It's hard for me to put this all down on paper because when I do, I realize just how fucked up my situation is and just how much work it's going to take to turn it around.   


I appreciate anyone who's willing to give me some advice and possibly help, it means more than you know....",04Oct2019,18

I’ve been ruminating on this for about 2 years. Last year I tried to warn him that my feelings toward him were changing, and that I might not want to continue this relationship if things didn’t change.

Spoiler alert: things didn’t change. 

Now that I’m entirely checked out, it’s like he’s digging his claws in. He’s finally started talking about being open to moving states, like I’ve always wanted. He’s started to talk about marriage, “when we’re married”, much more often and openly than ever before. 

He’s a selfish lover and has never made me orgasm. We’ve not had sex for almost a year.

I feel entirely justified in ending this relationship, but he’s still been my family for these 5-6 years and it kills me to hurt him like this. 

He’s gained weight and is struggling at work. I don’t know how he’ll find somewhere else to rent with his rental history and credit. I feel like this is going to really fuck him up, and that hurts me deeply because it isn’t what I want. 

But I’m also just not in this anymore, and I’m wasting both of our time. To be honest.

514,"So in July, there was a horrible hail storm that damaged my car, after I got my estimate from the insurance they cut me a check \~$6,100 and I had a deductible of $250. I went to the shop and gave them the estimate to see if they could complete the work, and they said that they could. I booked an appointment and lined up my rental for two weeks, which is how long it would take to repair.

During those two weeks I never once received a phone call for any changes or updates on my car it wasn’t until I called them after 9 days to see if my car was ready they said not yet and that it would be done in 5 days; I said ok and set a day to pick up the car.

When I pick up the car I already noticed that some of the work that was done wasn’t done correctly, such as the roof which was supposed to be replaced but wasn’t, and you can see every spot where the PDR. I brought this up to the person when I picked up the car, and they said to come back on Saturday to talk to the owner about it and to pay my deductible since they didn’t accept cards.

I arrive on Saturday and talk to the owner who as soon as I start to talk about my concerns starts to tell me that “my vehicle needed an additional $4000 worth of work and that they( I’m assuming my insurance) wanted to total the vehicle” I was shocked at this and kept on saying I was dissatisfied with the work, so we agreed that some of the work was done incorrectly, so I set another appointment to have them repair the hail damage fully this included replacing or making the roof look brand new since insurance had paid for a replacement. After I left the body shop I called my insurance to see if they had received any adjustments from the body shop and to see if they wanted to total out the vehicle. Insurance said that have not received any contact from my body shop.

I got my car back this past Monday, and the repairs to my vehicle were not done and still look horrible. I have gone to three other body shops and have gotten estimates ranging from $3,200-$4,500 to finish the repairs and fix any damage from the original body shop.

So now, I am at the point where I have to contact the body shop and request a refund of \~$5,500 repairs + deductible + rental since I will have to get another rental while my car is being repaired and insurance won’t pay since they have already. Is there any advice on how I should address this phone call?

TLDR: Took my car to the same body shop twice to fix hail damage. Repairs weren't done correctly and now I have to request a refund of about \~$5,500 based upon other estimates on what it would cost to finish the original repairs. How should I request my refund when I call?",04Oct2019,2
515," So yesterday my wife left her iPhone in an uber she took.  after getting out of the car, within minutes she realized she left her phone in the car. she called me from a store and told me the thing so I contacted Uber. While searching I found that there is no phone number through which you can contact uber (apart from an emergency line).   
 fortunately, 2 days back, I bought an iPad for my wife and had her account setup there. I quickly went to find my app and checked and it showed me the location of the device moving. Then I marked it as lost with my message and number so anyone finding the phone would see that message. The phone already has a passcode so I think getting in would be tough. but minutes after I did that, the phone was switched off and have never been switched on

In the meantime, I contacted Uber through twitter and via online account and reported that my wife left her phone in her last trip. I got no response from uber for 2 hours.

Then I get a message from uber that they have tried contacting the uber driver. I also tried calling him via uber (though I don’t see his number, but the call goes through uber). He never picks the call; I have called him almost 100 times since yesterday and left numerous voicemails.   
 

This morning also uber tried contacting the driver but he has not responded yet.

As a precaution I have blocked the IMEI of the device as well through T-Mobile.   
 I tried contacting law enforcement based on the last location, but they say it has to go through uber. 

Uber will not give his phone number to me when I requested. I have the driver’s name, car make model color, tag number (got this from the receipt after the trip from uber). I have provided all that to uber in my report. 

I am out of options right now and would like to know if there is anything else, I can do?",04Oct2019,5

Or a pastor...because I was homeless and addicted to substances and i almost went to prison but I was so lucky and I promised myself to better my life and devote my life to God if I can’t do anything in my own will. I’m sober and at a Christian school and now a global ministries major. It is nothing like I thought. I thought we would learn about culture and sociology history bible maybe some business. All we do is talk about the Bible and like how every time foreign people and Jews marry it means God is a diaspora God a.k.a a god of all nations. Basically we just read the Bible and find anything and everything that you could say “God is a god of all nations.” It’s so dry and repetitive and ugh. I’m so miserable. I feel like I’m a horrible person though. Like I don’t like any of the professors in the ministries. It’s all making me start to resent the Bible. 
I don’t know. I’ve been depressed most of my life. I have ADHD. It’s hard to enjoy or get excited about anything. I’m usually too busy just stressing about keeping up. Idk what to do for a major. I just want to help people. I just want to feel like Im actually learning about stuff. Like I’m actually being enlightened. Idk, maybe I just hate this teacher.
I just feel empty inside. Like something is missing. I need to find at least a hobbie. How should I be able to tell what I’m passionate about? What are signs to look for when deciding or figuring out what your meant to do? How did you figure out what ur passionate about? How do u discover new things? How can I tell what I should do?

519,"Hello reddit, throwaway account here. My partner and I have been together for 6 years now, known each other for almost 12 years now. At the end of high school, she was just barely clocking in at 5 feet tall, weighed under 110 pounds. We hadn't seen each other for a while after high school, and by the time we reconnected and started dating she had put on quite a bit of weight, probably up to 150 now. Personally, her weight never bothered me short of concerns for her health. But it very much bothers her, and she's made it clear to me that it has affected her own self-esteem. She's tried dieting and had some moderate success. Last year before the summer she was 180, and went down to 165 after that Summer.

She continued sticking to her diet as strictly as she could, but the progress seemed to almost grind to a halt, and after not noticing any more progress over the next few months following, she abandoned the diet almost entirely. (No longer drinks regular soda multiple times a day, but still can't get her to give up diet soda)

&amp;#x200B;

As the title states though, she's been trending backwards these past few months. Just to give more context for the situation, I'd like to state she also has flat feet and even when she was at a smaller weight would complain about her feet hurting and swelling up after standing for long periods. She also suffers from sleep-apnea (She is constantly waking up due to lack of oxygen while she sleeps). The biggest problem (from my perspective) is that all of this combined has seriously damaged her self-esteem. I work part time, and I haven't qualified for health insurance through work in a long time, and I usually just pay the fee at the end of the year for not having health insurance. Until this year, my S/O has been under her father's health insurance plan. I had asked her plenty of times to see someone about her sleep-apnea since she complains about her sleep quality, and also because I know it can negatively impact her desire to lose weight, but she always would say something along the lines of ""They'll just tell me to lose weight."" Whether or not they would say that, I honestly have no clue.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point in her life, she's worked 1 job (lasted maybe two months), has expressed multiple times to me that just meeting my immediate family members would cause her to feel anxiety, to the point where she's begged me to ""Not make her go"". She says she wants to work a job, but because of her flat feet she would need a job where she doesn't have to stand, but at the same time she's so afraid to interact with strangers because she feels they will ""judge"" her. Lately, she's been getting more negative in her behavior (not just towards me, but even towards her parents). I feel like if she doesn't start tackling her self-esteem issues, that she will end up in an even darker place, where all her negative thoughts become self-fulfilling prophecies. I don't know what I can do that will help her anymore, I've always encouraged her, celebrated with her when she would lose weight, and talked at length about what she thinks she should do next, or what I might suggest she try. I've always leaned more towards the exercise side of things when it comes to weight loss, but she's very much in the 0 exercise, only diet camp. I know that can work just fine for some people, and if that's how she wants to lose weight, then so be it. But as of the time I'm writing this, her diet has been called off for the past couple months now. I just want her to be able to live her life to the fullest, but it's really starting to weigh on me. I know it isn't her fault that she has sleep-apnea, but part of me feels a sense of despair some days. I'll leave for work at 5 in the morning, and she'll just be getting into bed. I'll come home sometime after 12, and she'll start waking up around 2 or 3. Sometimes I can't even have a conversation with her without her getting confused because she can't keep focus since she never gets real quality sleep.

I want her to get better, but I am at a loss on how to help at this point. I just want her to take some control back over her life. Where do I even begin? What do I say at this point? She really means the world to me, and even if she were to never get better I imagine I would let things get worse before I ever considered leaving her.

529,"*tldr:  we are a group of three school friends and it seems like the bond is  about to break but I don't want it to end where the responsibility of  breaking comes over me or things end on a sour note*

Premise:

I am a 28 year old guy currently working away from my home town from  where I have two other guy friends. We have known since school being in the same class since 2005 and have had some pretty amazing time.

Out of my two friends one lives very close and is kinda a neighbor and we used to spend a lot of time together and would meet up almost daily at-least once in the evening or night strolling around our colony. After school he joined merchant navy so he used to be at home only for half  the duration of the year but still as my neighbor and we used to meet still. Let's call him Friend A. The other friend lives farther and  joined a college in another town so we would meet only few times a year ie. when he used to come to home for vacation. I went and stayed in his  college as well twice to meet. Let's call him friend B.

This was the college phase and things were fine still. This would go on till 2014.

In 2015 I moved to another town for work and would visit my home once or  twice in a year for a week or two duration. During this same time B moved back to city to prepare for an examination and has been here  since. A has been continuing with the same.

What happened / incident:

Now, yesterday I talked to B after few months and over call he told me that A  had come to meet him before leaving for sail. One thing that he added has been bugging me since yesterday. He told me that A had told him that  I didn't talk to him before leaving. Now that is surprising since I actually called him around a month back and we had an almost hour long talk. It was like usual.

Backdrop:

Now, since this has come would like to add some backdrop as well.

Let me tell what I can about A's personality. Since I moved out of town for  job, he got along with a group of guys with whom he spends the whole  day with. Most of these he met through a guy in colony. Now whenever I  have come back home, the routine with him has been going to either of  these new guy's place and smoking pot. Also it is not done once but  multiple times a day and successively they take 'joints'. Also he  doesn't do any type of activity / hobby and most of these guys spend  days at their home only.

Now,  personally I don't smoke. I have had a puff or two when I met him  earlier for company's sake but recently when I went home I didn't have  those as well. Also I am a very passionate person and spend most of my  time with hobbies(music right now), socializing with new people,  discovering events etc in town, traveling. So really we have become very  dissociated. And it's actually not the difference in lifestyles that is  the issue. Its mostly ideas around life. Even though personally I would  never spend a day like he does, I would still meet him when I went  home, thinking it as exploration from meeting different types of people /  lifestyle. However, recently he came across some situations regarding  women, socializing and when I shared my point of view with him on the  lines of meeting new people and finding whom you resonate with he  started talking on lines of that meeting new people is useless etc.

Coming to B, he is also a proactive person like me and we usually connect over meeting new people, having life experiences etc.

Now, the thing is whenever we used to gather during college or after college, it has *always*  been via me. I only used to take initiative to get together everyone.  It was not compulsive but since B used to live farther and I am quite  proactive personally I used to do it happily. Also like whenever I used  to go home, I would only *naturally* inform the others that I am coming to city and organically I would end up planning and coordinating our meet.

But  recently, since around a year when B has been talking to me, just like  yesterday he tries to impose this frame that 'talk to A', 'why are you not talking to A'.

Personally I am feeling that B is trying to force onus of us meeting on me which I am  not as much keen to do anymore, probably he might be realizing that I  will lose interest since A is quite arrogant and doesn't contribute much  anyways. Also the thing is in my absence A and B hardly meet up in  person or even over a call. The meeting he told about yesterday was only  the second time they have ever met in my absence AFAIK.

A big problem that I see coming up is because I haven't properly counter-acted B's *soft-accusations*  (unfortunately since they have been unexpected and I didn't know what I  can say without it coming as some sort of confrontation), tomorrow when  things break apart, I can be the one to get blamed since only I can be told that why you didn't talk to A. Also I think B knows that if he said something similar to A even once, he will immediately call it off. Now  otherwise my equation with B is fine, but I think he is trying to put  the responsibility of this connection on me.

Personally, though even if I am meeting either of them tomorrow (just  hypothetically as I am in another city right now) I would not arrange  our meet this time. I would have asked either of them whomever I would  have talked to, to do this instead. But not sure if that is ever going  to happen now.

So what I am thinking is what should I be doing with regards to this bond now. I am  sure that bond with A is not going to go ahead much because of lack of  rapport and him getting invested in other things. But a while back I  thought that this would last at-least for 2-3 years within which A would  most probably get married and it would be fine even if we wouldn't meet  much after that. However, it doesn't seem like we would be meeting now  most probably since I would want someone else to take initiative now  which doesn't seem to be happening. And it only pains me since we have  gone through a lot of our *formative* years together and I would never want for these things to end on a sour note.

Also  I fear if the onus of not meeting comes on me (ie. from B), our bond  would also be damaged since I would be seen as a distrustful guy. I wish I would have gone back with these points to him over call whenever he would say something like that to me - 'talk to A' etc.

535,"(24/F) I hope this isn't a terribly weird question itself. I suppose I am kind of bummed about this. What I would like advice with is how to stop being weird and be in control of the dumb shit I do.

Or to be more specific, I have a tendency to crack jokes that land only half of the time, if at all, which gets weird around people who don't know me that well. I also have personality traits that could probably be described as being quirky. It's fine with friends that I already have... but what happened is that University just started anew and we were all put into groups to meet the other new students, to make connections and to make friends. We did different things together that took a good 4 days from Monday 'til Thursday. However, I absolutely blew making any meaningful connection or even friends.

I think I didn't vibe that well with everyone, but I think I could have made some meaningful connections... if I was more in control of my own behaviors. Whenever I look back at certain situations with myself I cringe.

Now I'm wondering if anyone has ideas on how I can change and control my behavior more- aka stop being weird. Are there books? Do I need therapy which I can't afford? Just some constructive advice? This is really weighing on me now in retrospect. Damn.

(I'm not giving up on making friends of course, hence why I would love advice so I can try again with new people without screwing it up.)",04Oct2019,1
536," No girl has ever been interested in me. I try to be friendly and socialise. However, it has always bothered me that no girl has ever been romantically interested in me.

People say that I should be more outgoing and ask girls out. However, it is very difficult to do that when they show no interest whatsoever. They never initiate conversation with me and hardly ever discuss personal matters or subjects outside of work. The interactions feel so one-sided and I get the feeling that they respond to me out of pity.

It is pretty clear that something about my appearance or first impression repels them. I don't think it has to do with my personality as they never even give me the benefit of the doubt and go on a first date with me. I wish they would take the risk and get to know me better before rejecting me.

I’m kind of at a loss for words. I’m in a sort of long distance relationship with this really special guy. We’re in a bit of a talking stage, so nothing official. Irregardless, we really care for one another. But last night something terrible happened. His littler sister passed away. He had to hold it together for his family, but doesn’t have anyone he can lean on. When he finally got a free moment, the first thing he did was call me to hear my voice. I told him how deeply sorry I was, told him I was there for him, and spent some time just listening. He wanted to watch some Netflix to keep his mind off everything and we fell asleep together on call. Still...I feel like I’m failing him. It’s not as if I can go see him or bring him casserole. I don’t know what to be for him right now. I’ve had my own experiences with grief, but no one so close to me. I want to help in any way possible, but worry I’ll be too overbearing or not attentive enough. It would mean the most if any of you had some advice on how I should go about comforting him...or maybe share something that you would have wanted someone to have said or done that would have helped you during a time of hurt?

We swear she has some kind of mental disorder, like schizophrenia, ect. and she's one of those people who is always posting stuff to social media for attention. She's always talking about herself, how she plans on getting a job, how she nearly cried because she thought for a second she was going to get her old job back at a McDonalds, all because the woman in front of her paid for her order. 

This lady went nuts one time, was outside one night for a few minutes, had to pee, and thought the door was locked so she broke in through the window trying to get back inside. She obviously has issues, is very controlling and I have a hard time not feeling nervous around her because she never shuts up. Like she really, really, doesn't. I went on vacation with them one year, it was a six hour car ride, and the ENTIRE ride, nobody else said a single word. Except for her. Just constant rambling and rambling about how she was going to do all these great things and literally nobody was saying anything, from the minute we got in the car, to the minute we got home, at which point she was still going on and on.

The thing is I find myself in similar thought patterns. She's chunky, and has black hair. I have the misfortune of also being chunky, and also have long black hair, so I kinda look like her. I'm really worried I'm going to end up like her someday. She obviously doesn't care about other people, and me, I myself have a hard time caring about other people. I like to be alone, I don't really enjoy socializing with other people and it makes me wonder if that's what caused her to end up like that. I don't really ever wish any harm onto others, I just like to mind my own business. In fact when I'm out at work and stuff, I generally try to make at least one person smile. But right now all I do is work at Mcdonald's, and am working on going to community college. It's not the greatest situation, because we aren't rich, so I can't really afford to go to a full four year. I can't afford a car yet. I want a car, and I tell my grandparents all the time about stuff I want to do, that I sometimes never end up following through on. It makes me wonder if there's something wrong with me.

When I was 16 I've always wanted to get away from them both, and was so motivated. But my depression got so horrible and I developed a eating disorder where I really barely clung to life. I was forced to get treatment and am in mountains of debt. I'm better now, but my depression makes me weak. 

My mom usually needs all the money I make since she's too mentally ill to work more than 2 days a week, so I cannot get out. She calls me fat and stupid in every way you could think of every week. I'm not strong enough to say no because she threatens to kick me out or just makes me get into a episode. All the money I plan for my growth eventually goes to her.

I've ran away. I took a plan and got out. I was raped out alone and had to come back because at least I'm not hurt here. I'm really not trying to ask for pity but I'm just trying to push just how hopeless I feel. I was shy and reserved up until last week where I had finally snapped and threatened to hurt my mother, calling her every obscenity on the planet--whilst shaking uncontrollably. I need OUT or I feel like I'm going to lose it.

How do I get out? Should I go homeless and look into shelters? Anything is better than this.",04Oct2019,2

574,"I'll try and keep this as short as possible.

Worked at a car service briefly for about month or so and got fired for 'raising my voice' to my boss a few days ago.

I also had my car fixed there, after waiting for a whole week with it sitting in their parking. Run of the mill stuff (replaced the brake cylinders and one handbrake cable).

He told me to come on 16th this month to get my last paycheck and to pay for the car repair. I insisted to pay right there (for the 4/5th time), but he told me he needs to look over the files to make sure everything is fine (bullshit obviously).

And now I'm afraid I'll get shafted on both sides of the coin real bad and frankly I have no idea what to do. Recording the whole thing won't get me anywhere since I live in a shithole country ran by crooks.

So yeah, fuck me sideways.",04Oct2019,2
575,"A couple months ago, one of my best friends, who for the purpose of this post will be called Colin, got himself a gf.  Let’s call her Layla.  Layla is 18, pretty quiet and reserved, and a bit socially awkward.  About the same time Layla started dating my friend, I met her sister, who we’ll call Kristen.  Kristen is 16, but much more outgoing and socially adept than Layla.  Since I met her, I’ve developed a bit of a crush on her.  

Colin is going to be out of town for homecoming, so Layla decides to try and get a few people together because she still wants to go.  This group was to consist of me, an acquaintance we will call Dylan, and one of Layla’s friends.

Fast forward to last week.  I invited Kristen to hang out, during which I planned on asking her to homecoming.  She agreed to hang out with me, and all was well.  However, the day before we were supposed to hang out, I found out via Layla that Kristen was already going with Dylan.  I don’t say anything to either of them about it but change my mind on asking her the next day.  Then, half an hour before we are supposed to hang out she texts me to tell me she’s not able to make it.  Here, I decide to not go to homecoming on account of my not wanting to pay $20 to be depressed for three hours in favor of getting paid to do it at work.

Also at this point, Kristen and I are pretty familiar and comfortable with each other, and Kristen all of a sudden seems to really be trying to push me to go to homecoming with them.  However, I feel like the only reason she wants me to go is so that Layla isn’t following them around all night while they try to have fun.  Both Kristen and Layla are telling me that the only reason Kristen is going is because Layla is going, and the only reason Dylan is going is because Kristen is going.  I’m also not 100% sure whether Kristen and Dylan are going as a date or as friends, but either way I don’t want to try to force my way in since Dylan already invited her.

Homecoming is on October 12th.  Should I go, or should I ask to be scheduled at work that night?",04Oct2019,2
576,"To start with, I only really have about 3 good friends. Known all of them for half a decade. I'm 21 now, working in freelance. I spent a year overseas (study) and just came back about not more than 2 months ago.

The thing is, ever since coming back, I've gradually lost touch with friends. I just know that they all expressed being sad because I'm planning to move again overseas by next year to study Masters and live with my boyfriend.

Despite this, I tried maintaining contact even while I was out. I constantly reached out, made calls, etc. Two of them helped me for a day when I moved back because I asked for help. 

Now that I'm a bit settled in and working, I've been trying to reach out to hang out. They either postponed it or said they were too busy. I send messages asking them how they are, but either got nothing or a delayed response after 3-5 days. 

It's been a while and I don't know if it's worth trying. I've lost contact with my family for personal reasons. I only really have myself, my boyfriend (probably the only person who talks to me), and friends.

How do you know when you've lost contact with friends? 

I want to try to reconnect, but asking every week to hang and getting turned down feels terrible. I feel like we've all been through so much as friends. We went from sharing everything to not even responding. Do I seek out new friends now and just accept the situation?

For record, I do think it has to do with the fact that I moved for a year. I'd experienced a lot while overseas that I think changed me as an individual. I don't know if we've just grown apart as people.",04Oct2019,1

578,"I am in love with my best friend. We talk constantly, know each other better than anyone else, facetime every night for hours if we aren't together hanging out already. We study together for church, play video games together, and talk about anything that's bothering us. Constantly in and around everything is the feelings that I have for him. Feelings that he knows about, but does not reciprocate. We've talked about this (we talk about everything), and I made the decision that our friendship means more to me than anything and I would push through those feelings. It's been nearly a year and a half now since I told him how I felt

As of late, it's become harder to do this. We have only gotten closer, his family loves me and mine loves him. We've gotten each other through a lot. We support one another. We have our weekly Friday night hang out. It's all the same, but two very different things have developed that are confusing my head and my heart. 

1) We are constantly touching now. If we aren't holding hands, we're leaning on each other, playing with hair, hugging, tickle fights. I have no idea what this means, I do know that it's not like this with any other friends. I brought this up to him a couple of weeks ago, said that I was getting confused and wanted him to flat out tell me that he didn't like me, wouldn't ever feel that way, and that there was no chance of anything happening between us. He said I wasn't being fair, and he couldn't say that because he ""can't predict the future.""

2) He is telling me all the time now about another girl that he has a crush on. To an overwhelming level. I have told him that it's hard for me to hear this because I do still have those feelings for him and he attempted to stop, but we are best friends and he wants to tell me everything. 

What I really need help with: Today he asked me to distract the girl that he likes (she's a mutual acquaintance) while he left donuts and a note asking her out on a date where she was sitting. I am confused about how to feel because, on the one hand, I know that he does not like me. But on the other hand,  I can't comprehend why he is asking me to do things like this for him knowing how I feel about him. I am hurt right now, and not just because he asked another girl out.

Sorry this is so long, it was cathartic to just get out.

She said no so I became very angry. I got up and shouted at her calling her a short haired fucking goblin. She farted when I got up to take her breakfast off her, so needless to say I lose my bananas. I tell her ""Suck my fucking penis now you pickle eating bitch!"" She then walks away and goes to her room and puts her egg onesie on, NOT OKAY I FUCKING HATE EGGS! So I am enraged to the point of being fully erect, I run after her with my penis at full mast, and I jump onto her and smack her on the ass as hard as I can. She starts to cry then goes to the toilet. After she comes out she tells me she will not suck my boner anymore. This is absolutely unacceptable, my Penis is incredibly large (4 inches erect) so I don't know what the problem is. I feed her 2 bananas and a cup of rice per week, I let her eat pickles whenever she wants, and she can use the toilet once a day.

580,"Long story short, a friend of ours asked us to hold onto her cat for a while because she couldn’t take care of it. We have two other cats here currently, but we agreed nonetheless because we were under the impression that she would come back to get her. 

Now the friend is basically refusing to come back and get her, which is a problem. The cat is mean and hostile to our other two, is constantly starting trouble, harassing the other animals, etc. And now she’s in heat, making it even worse. We’ve been trying to convince the original owner to come back and get her, but she won’t. 

None of the animal shelters in our area are accepting anymore surrenders because they’re completely full to the max. We can’t exactly call the cops for abandonment charges because we really don’t want to turn this into a big thing. But we can’t keep this cat. We’ve talked about letting her just “accidentally” run away, but winter will be here soon and we really don’t want to leave her out to fend for herself.

581,"So as the title says, she got an offer that is way to good to refuse.

We’ve been dating for about 6 months now. And I haven’t had this much fun with anyone in such a long time. We got along pretty well from the start, but our social and sexual chemistry had only kept growing since day one.
 
I’ve had social and sexual anxiety for many years now and she has accepted and embraced that.  Made me feel comfortable and never guilty for the way I performed in bed.. whether I was a rock hard stallion or a limp piece of shit that can’t please a woman.

However, I’ve always done my best to make her feel good despite my penile dysfunctions by using my mouth and fingers. For two reasons, because I’m scared the my lack of manhood on occasion would make her run away, and two because I fucking love making her feel good. If she feels good I feel good. 

This week I learned that she will be moving away for in a few months for an opportunity that can’t be turned down.

I’m not mad at her for jumping at the opportunity. Not one bit. In fact I’m happy for her. She’s an incredible woman and deserves the best. 

I’m in love with her. I love her. I feel pure love, care, and tenderness whenever she touches me. And just the same when I open up about my problems and insecurities. Pure love and understanding. 

I don’t want to lose her. But I have to let her go. 
I want to drop everything and move away from here to go with her. But I just got promoted at my job about 5 months ago and have been making more money than ever with great benefits. I’m not making that much, but for me it’s a lot. Like 53k a year.

I almost want to take a step backwards just so I can be with her. But I feel like that might be a mistake. I like my job, I feel neutral about where I live, and I love her. I DONT KNOW WHAT THE FUCK TO DO OR THINK. 

We’ve decided to stay together for at least a month and pretend she’s not moving away. I feel sick. She admitted she’s in love with me after breaking the news. And I did the same for the first time after hearing the news. I felt it for months before then.

Any thoughts or advice on how to move forward would help. Is it worth it to throw away a good job for love? Is it worth it to throw away love for a good job?

I'm new to this sub, so I apologize if this has been recently asked. I recently (within the last 2 months) moved to the snow belt and am in the market for a used vehicle. I have a budget of $21k.

583,"Ok so my mom is borderline white supremacist. We've talked about it a few times and she has gotten better in some ways throughout the years. As a child I heard things like white people are sooooo pretty and unique, brown eyes look like shimmering pools of Poop ect. Well now I'm a grown woman with a 2 year old son.....he's Korean. He has brown hair, brown eyes, dark skin...he looks nothing like my family at all. I think he's lovely. A beautiful boy. My sister has 3 blonde hair, blue eyed children. They are also lovely. I love them dearly &lt;3 but my mom is making comments, and i don't think she means to ...but I'm starting to get hurt feelings. I'll give examples, but first some background knowledge:

My sister's children take after our family and are very big, way off the charts. My son is the opposite. He's so tiny there's been some concerns about his growth. My sister's son is very vibrant and outgoing, very social ect. My son is very quiet and reserved. My sister's kids are blonde and blue eyed, my son is Korean. Lol



So she'll make a comment like ""Austin(names are changed) is going to be so popular, and Lenard's mother (Lenard is a quiet, sensitive boy like my son) only wants to be friends with Austin's mom so that her loser son can follow on Austin's coattails. 

*Sigh* 

So there's nothing wrong with her praising Austin for being outgoing, but doesn't she realize by saying Austin is ""popular"" and the quiet child is a ""loser"" she's saying my son is also a loser? Hurtful. 


Also she's constantly remarking on how beautiful those kids are, but never says a peep about my son. Once I confronted her and she said ""I like blue eyes because they look like my family, but they don't HAVE to be blue. 

And it's like duh they don't have to be blue but can't you say my son is beautiful too? 

She's also constantly going on and on about some ""pecking order"" kids have and how in ""the old days"" my sister's children would survive because they are big and strong....

But mom, my son is small and more of a thinker, so are you saying he wouldn't even survive the old days? 

It feels hurtful. It feels like she's constantly trying to say that my sister's kids are superior than kids ""like my son.""

It feels like my son is the opposite of everything she says she's proud of. 

What would you do? Talk about it? Ignore it? Advice welcome.",04Oct2019,2

Even after getting into this high school that is supposed to be very good(in my country 8th graders have to write an exam and then see in what highschool they will get into and I got in with a 9,32/10 in the best class, grade wise) I just couldnt feel that I did something good. I just felt average. I had more collegues that tried to get into the same class and failed so why do I not feel that happy about it? I just thought that I didnt think I was supposed to be there. I didnt feel like I should have been in that highschool at all. My parents told me it would go away but I dont wanna leave things like this to chance. Also I feel like my self confidence is not helping me with getting friends or keeping any of them. Is there something I can do  or do I just have to wait it out?

This time I have another medication I'm taking, and searching online all led to the same answer: call your doctor. So I did. He was out of the office but the nurse offered to send him a message. I trusted her with my question and personal information and she put me on hold to wait for a response. 

She picks back up and says ""...aren't you 19."" I said yes and repeated that I was trying to be safe and informed, this isn't something I do or plan on doing all the time, and that my parents were aware. 

Instead of then answering my questions, several nurses came to the phone and kept telling me ""It's illegal AND you're on meds. We do not condone this.""
Yes I know it's illegal, I'm not calling about the law. Yes I know I'm on meds, that's obviously why I'm calling. After answering a firm and single yes to all of their questions they hung up. I didn't have the nerve and ask what my doctor said.

When I got to the airport for my return flight, I was unable to get my boarding pass. The agent told me that my ticket was cancelled by the buyer for a partial refund. Despite my persistence, they assured me that there wasn’t a mistake.

I called the company to tell them there was a mix-up, but they just told me they decided they would “going in a different direction”. I told them I was fine that I didn’t get the job, but I didn’t have a flight home. They just repeated the same “going in a different direction” phrase and told me they couldn’t help me. After calling back 3 or 4 times, they told me to stop harassing them.

588,"I've been working graveyard shifts for five years now because I naturally don't sleep at night. I probably have a sleep disorder, but I've never bothered to find out since I've been able to find graveyard positions pretty easily, and my daily life isn't negatively affected by it. 

My partner and I recently moved to a new state, and I was able to find a graveyard position. The training is two weeks long on the swing shift (my natural sleeping hours), and both my supervisor and trainer said that they would try to be flexible with my schedule but that this time on the swing shift would be valuable for learning the job. I figured I could manage.

I finish my first week, and I'm tired. Training is intense, but it's relatively fine. At the start of the second week of training, I get an email saying that I'm expected to do an orientation on the morning of what's supposed to be my day off. If you do the sleep math (considering I don't sleep at night), that would be over 24 hours with no sleep going from the swing shift to the end of orientation the following day also leaving me with only a one-day weekend which I normally wouldn't mind too much, but this line of work is EXTREMELY taxing mentally and emotionally.

I expressed to my supervisor that this isn't going to work for me because of my schedule, and he says he'll see what he can do to reschedule it. He gets back to me and says he couldn't reschedule because he'd have to talk to the HR director, and the entire orientation they planned (for 3 people) would be canceled for everyone if I couldn't make it. I then said that I have an appointment near the end of orientation, so I wouldn't be able to stay for the whole thing anyway. He said he'd let HR know, so we could at least work out me leaving early. Cool.

Right afterward, as I'm talking to my trainer about it, she says that I DEFINITELY won't be able to leave the orientation early, and in a separate conversation, goes on to say that she thinks I need more training and asks if I can either come in early for my graveyards or come in late and work into the morning. I tell her if I have to, I'd like to stay late because it's more natural for my sleep habits, and she reiterates how important it's going to be for me to come in early to learn on the swing shift but that I can get back to her tomorrow.

At this point, I'm frustrated and pissed off because I feel like this level of scheduling is above my pay grade, not to mention I've made it clear to my supervisor and trainer that I work graveyards in the first place because I don't sleep at night. To me, this is the equivalent of hiring someone for a day shift and saying, ""I know you've been working nights the past two weeks, and you're supposed to be on your regular schedule next week, but I think it would be really important for your training to come in at 2 in the morning next week."" I've never been in a situation like this working graveyards as long as I have.

So I'm confused and upset and drained, and the orientation was this morning. As I was about to leave, my partner stopped me and said I was in no place mentally or emotionally to be pushing myself anymore and that I can say no to going. I basically had a small breakdown because I don't want to lose my job or look irresponsible, and I've already been late to work a few times. In the end, I decided he was right and decided to stay home for my wellbeing.

I texted my boss, and he said he wants to talk to me Monday morning at the end of my shift. I'm genuinely worried about losing my job and am wondering if I'm in the wrong here or if I've been especially difficult to work with? I don't know what I should even say to defend myself?",04Oct2019,1

The last time I saw them, I was really stressed out because my family and I had to move states away because we lost our home. We did that and it didnt work out so we kind of jumped from state to state where we now kind of have a place to live. But it's temporary. I couldn't tell them when we talked in person because it's so embarrassing to tell someone that you haven't come around in a long time because you've been sleeping in a car in like 6 different states. I really tried but I couldn't. I felt bad because I think I made them scared because I tell them everything, and this is the only thing I told them that ""it's nothing"". Not for attention seeking, but genuinely because I didn't know how to tell them.

I had to clean the house up and carry things that a single person shouldn't be carrying, like a few mattresses and things that were pretty much my size. It was really hard and I was exhausted. But I had to get it done before we were evicted. I very clearly remember feeling the individual tears in my muscles and I was exhausted, my arms felt like noodles. And I had to do everything alone.

I know I shouldnt be embarassed but I can't help it.

598,"I  have known my gf for 5 years now. We started as very good friends, then  she fell in love with me and so did I. She had always given me good  advices and support whenever I needed it. She is very optimistic and is  very mature for her age. She was very good as a girlfriend.

However,  we broke up last year (both of us agreed with the idea). 3 months  before the breakup, things turned shady. She started treating me  differently and I didn´t knew why (I think now that she got bored of me  back then). We had sex once in a month. I worried so much about  everything so much that I started creating an overthinking habit and  this had followed me until today.

1  month later after breakup, she told me she missed me and that she  didn´t realize how much important I am in her life. We started to date  again and got in a relationship for the 2nd time. I think I would never  want to break up if she didn´t treat me differently.

In  this new relationship things were great. She loved me like crazy, we  had more sex than before, and we communicated more and got through  problems quickly. Sex was very important for me because I am very  sexually attracted to her. The only problem in our new relationship was  that I had my overthinking habit still and even went to a psychologist  to work it out (it helped me temporarily).

2  weeks ago, we got extremely stressed about our jobs and started talking  less (we didn´t fight). Her mind is cloudy with everything that’s going  on. She has a lot of problems in her life right now (socially, familiar  and professional). She is getting an appointment with a psychologist  for the first time. My overthinking habit got stronger and started to  feel a little weird when I was with her. Also, we hadn´t fucked in 3  weeks, and that affects my emotions strongly because I like sex a lot  and I have developed more hornyness in the last 2 months. Finally, she  is treating me differently (sort of like last year).

I  don´t know if I should break up with her on Saturday or wait until she  goes with her psychologist. In the other side, I am starting to believe  that she wants to break up with me too (because of the way she is  treating me now).

P.D: If you are  wondering, she is not cheating on me and I know it perfectly, so don´t  take that as a consideration. Also, she hasn´t been with another guy  when we broke up or anything so.

It's gotten to the point that they want to tell me **when to wake up, when to go to sleep, how many hours to sleep, what to eat, how to eat, how to take a shower** ^(oh god please spare me from this shit jesus have some mercy), it's sick. The want to know every detail of what I'm doing, what I did when I went out and what I want to do in the future, **like if they wanted a report of my life.**

And when they see that I'm not doing what they want me to do, **they proceed to start a discussion about it, to repeat their argument again and again expecting me to give up and obey, to not listen whatever I have to say about it and to try to guilt trip me,** blame me on whatever catastrophic event they fear and on their health problems. Also, this person may speak negatively about me and for some reason the rest of the family sees them like if they were a saint so I feel kind of alone in that way.

**Everyday. It's sick.** They also feel entitled to the right to beat me and I'm sure if they did the rest of the family would enable it and blame me. 

I can't afford to move out right now but I want to do it in the next months and I need some help about this. **At the beginning I fucked up by answering their questions just to be polite, because I didn't know this person was abnormal and it'd scalate into this situation, but I want to recover my boundaries slowly. How to act when...**

* **They ask me everyday** ""Why are you waking up so early/late?"" ""Why aren't you sleeping?"" ""When are you doing to eat and what?"" ""Where are you going?"" ""What did you do?"" ""Why did you come later today?"" ""Why did you come earlier today?"" ""Why haven't you taken a shower yet?"". **I don't want to answer, discuss or justify their questions and my decisions anymore.**
* **When they give me orders:** ""Stop doing that important thing you're doing because you're wasting gas/electricity..."" (which is a lie because those services are covered by the rent price itself but they don't care). ""Do this right now"", ""Don't do that and do it like I'm saying instead"". 
* **When they insist on knowing literally everything I did that day,** where I went, what I did there... Ugghh, I'm currently looking for a job and it irks me to tell them my job schedule if I get one because I don't want them to ask me why I'm coming home later or whatever.

And this is only one of my relatives. The other ones are different cases but sigh, let's work with the easiest to handle for now. **Thank you so much if you read until here, even if you don't have any advice, at least some support words would be enough... Thank you.**",04Oct2019,1

She’s been hanging out with this 18 y/o guy who i’ve known for years. He’s like a creepy neckbeard rapist to best describe him. He once asked my ex for my nudes so he could sell them, and then also tried selling my acquaintance/friends date rape drugs. He also sexually harassed me and some other girls I know. 

Anyways I’m really scared he might hurt her or something. I tried to warn her but she says she’s using him for free food (he works at mcdonald’s) and smokes. He won’t be any good influence on her and i’m scared of him hurting her. I feel like if she keeps having friends like this she could end up like the rest of her family in jail/rehab.

604,"Hey guys,

I'm a 27 M that just moved out of my parents house and life is really stacking up.

I cracked two molars and went to the dentist for the first time in years to see what the damage was. They said they would have to extract both teeth, get bone grafts, and that at least 2 of my wisdom teeth are impacted and need to be extracted. Most of it isn't covered by insurance so I got quoted something insane like $7k before implants. The cost and time for recovery worries me because it impacts other plans. I've pushed this off long enough and now it's only getting worse.

On top of it, my general mental state has been deteriorating. In combination with the dental issues above, my mind has been absolutely racked by the following:

Living situation: New living situation with roommates has been incredibly stressful and expensive. Lots of arguing and junk food. Considering moving back in with parents to save on rent.

Career: My boss quit his job and I've been performing his duties to the detriment of myself. I've been trying to find a new job for the past few months but have just been spinning wheels.

Stress levels are very high and I wanted to take a vacation to get a breath of fresh air but that doesn't really help my finances or health. That will also use up my vacation time that I could use to interview or recover.

I'm trying to plan my next steps forward but I'm overwhelmed. Do I get my dental work done and delay the job search? Do I find a new job and hope for better coverage? Do I move back home to save on cost?

Any advice is greatly appreciated.",04Oct2019,1

607,"Hey. I'm a 14 years old teenager. First sorry for my english, I'm french. If you don't understand anything, then feel free to ask me.

I answer a question that you will wonder: no, I don't manage my clothes by myself, my mother does it

So, to make it short, since about a few months, my mother disgusts me. Not since many time 'cause before, I didn't know what I'm gonna tell you. Actually, my mother lets underwear in the bathroom so she will re-use it tomorrow (yes I know, it sounds like trolling, but it isn't), in the stairs, the sofa, for others reasons ... And she lets my clothes sometimes on the same place. So my clothes are dirty, I put them in the tray for dirty clothes, and ...

And today, I discovered that she doesn't even wash them. She told to my brother, whispering to make me not able to hear (she lost), that she lets them in the tray for dirty clothes, then take them and put them in the closet, like it's now clean. I find that absolutely disgusting (isn't it?) and this is the reason why I'm crying right now btw.

As we have already talked about it and she said she will make efforts, I feel betray. I will not trust her anymore for this kind of things.

I know it's me that should make efforts, but I asked her if I could manage my clothes by myself, I don't know why, maybe she doesn't think I'm able to do that, she doesn't want at all.

&amp;#x200B;

That's all for the explanations, now, what I ask. I'd like to know if you have a drastic solution to make her understand... Please, don't tell me I should talk to her. Thanks

So for the solutions I'll try to be fully transparent, I already thought about absconding (I'm not sure about this word, so if you want to do your own searches, the french word is ""fuguer"" which is a verb), because this seems to be the only true solution, as I don't trust her anymore. The problem is that I don't want to do that then prey to go back at home, so if I do that, I'd make a full strategy, with how I'll feed myself, where I'll live etc. As this is too drastic and too complicated at the same time, this is not planned (even thought I don't forget the idea).

I think you can see it, but I'm lost, and don't know what to do.

So, hmm, I don't even really know what I'm asking for ... If you have solutions ...",04Oct2019,1

610,"Currently I work second shift at the front desk at a hotel. I am also going to school full time, while constantly working 4-5 days a week. I asked my manager for less hours, and initially she was hesitant and asked me why. I told her that school is becoming extremely stressful, and I also have midterms coming up. I work every single weekend, and by being in college living on campus it's so hard. I'm not able to go home on weekends, I barely see my friends so my social life is basically nonexistent, and I'm always so tired that I end up missing class just to get some rest. This week I am working 5 days in a row, even though I told her I wanted less hours. I see the way she got around that - our week starts on a Friday, so I was scheduled Wednesday and Thursday on one schedule, and Friday-Sunday on the second schedule.

Truly, my main issue with working so much is that I can't live a normal college life. I get off work at 11pm and by that time  1. liquor store is closed and 2. I'm exhausted because I've been talking to people all day that I just want to sit in a corner by myself and cry.

I'm seriously just so frustrated at this point that I want to put my two weeks in, but I also do not want to be out of a job. I would really like it if I could alternate weekends and at most work 4 days a week, preferably 3 days.

619,"Okay so,

(Background information) I have huge trust and abandonment issues due to a personal past, they're so bad that I can't even be in a relationship because I'm scared of getting hurt, but I still want love in some form or shape.

The story:

After joining a new school I started to get to know this guy, he was just an awesome guy I thought, he liked the things I liked, he was nice to me, and he helped me with many things. He had had a crush on me since he first met me and I knew

And suddenly, I also started to develop small feelings for him. I acted like I did not have feelings for him, I tried to forget it. So when a girl from my school told me she had feelings for him, I helped them get together. It kinda helped at that point and we remained friends, but even then my jealousy began growing a little bit. 

Fast forward and their short term relationship ended badly, I must say I was slightly relieved. He was a tiny bit hurt about how it ended and therefore needed someone to be there. I took the position of being the listener and guide him through his feelings which meant we spend more time together at his place... Which meant we kinda hooked up. 

I couldn't think clearly, at that moment I kinda just wanted him to be close to me. Suddenly the anxiety arose and I made it clear to him that I did not want a relationship. He was fine with that but my need for affection and his kinda let it end up being an unofficial hookup thing. He actually said he had wanted something unofficial for a while. It was fun for a few months until he started doing almost everything for me and touching me in public. People started to notice and I got overwhelmed which made me turn kinda cold. I also was very busy at that time with my private life and he was annoyed we could not be more together.

He began regretting that he agreed on the hookup thing, he wanted commitment. He told me he wanted a relationship and not this thing we had. I told him that he could choose to keep it like this or not have anything at all. After a while, he chooses to stop it and I said, fine. I mean I was fine for a short while. Until he got back with that girl.

Mind you he had talked a lot of crap about her when he was with me talking about how she was a replacement for me when he had feelings for me, how she was boring etc. So seeing them together made me kinda annoyed. 

Then one day I did something terrible. I asked him to cheat with me to get closure from the relationship one last time. He obliged. I just needed to see if he still would choose me over her in some way. I felt SO bad after, I felt disgusting. We promised not to tell anyone. 

I had to get it out cause it was killing me so I told my friend who was also his friend. They promised to keep it a secret. But of course, secrets always get out. He got furious at me, and I felt like I was gonna die right there. He didn't want to speak to me, the girlfriend was distressed. It was terrible. I got so sad and so mad that I spread some rumors that probably got back to them which didn't help my case. (I know, I'm dumb af)

I had a break from school to get over it, but they're still together. I see them every day at school now and I know they hate me, despise me. And I get that. But sometimes when his eyes catch mine, I feel like nothing has changed. I know he most likely never will speak to me again. But I can't stand seeing them together. I can't. And I can't get over him. Maybe it's because he was so nice to me, maybe it's because I'm just jealous like that. I don't know I didn't even like him that much, but I can't stand him hating me. I don't know what to do I just wanna erase him from my mind. I have tried everything, hooking up with other guys, partying, changing my mindset. I just miss him being my friend and I wish nothing ever happened. I can't text him cause he avoids me and I'm terrified of the rejection. He has to ignore because of her and probably because he despises me.

We met up and I refused to let him pay for me because to me this was just a friendly hang out and because I don't like owing anyone anything. I don't really have friends in the area so I didn't think of bringing anyone else. We had a decent conversation and I was being friendly and outgoing but then he started flirting and I got really uncomfortable. I didn't flirt back but being the non-confrontational person I am I didn't say anything either which I regret. He wants to hang out again but I'm considering ghosting him. I'm scared of running in to him on campus and it being weird if we do. I don't know what to do.

621,"Quick and to the point: 

Worked during the summer as a lifeguard to save up money to last me through the school year: 8k - 4.5k of which goes to tuition and the remaining $3500 for commuting ($250 a month) and outings food etc

Balance was around 500 on my visa which is how I pay for commuting and food and then pay it all down at the monthly statement in order to build up my credit. I’m able to ration my funds over the 7 months in school (as little as $3500 might seem). 

Wisdom teeth became an issue out of nowhere, had to remove all 4, costed me $2500 out of pocket because I don’t have dental insurance. 

Paid for the surgery with my credit card since I didn’t have the real money at disposal. Balance is now at 3000 and out of control, not sure how I’m gonna pay it without becoming broke.

Not sure how to pay it all down since I don’t have a job and or the funds. Parents are unable to help me. 

-Applied to a bunch of part time jobs I found locally and nothing will hire me (so far). So I’m kind of lost and it’s why I came here for help. 

Does anyone know what I could do for money besides a regular 9-5 because I simply can’t balance that and school 4 times a week at the same time? Any advice is appreciated.

635,"I’m 29 (f) and he’s 32 (m). We’ve been together a little over 3 1/2 years. We talk about marriage a lot. We both always talk about buying our own home, adopting more dogs and maybe having children. Whenever he talks it’s “in the future” but for me, we’ve been together long enough that it’s not for the commitment. 

My Dad recently brought up his concerns about whether or not my boyfriend and I plan on getting married. He asked me if my boyfriend felt the same about marriage as I do. My dad never interferes or questions my relationships, the only time he brings things up as if he is concerned. He said other people ask him about it too. Ever since he’s asked, all these emotions I’ve bottled inside have come to the surface. What hurt the most about this all was I had really hoped by now he had already asked my Dad for my hand in marriage. 

I am a professional hairstylist and make up artist, and I do a lot of weddings. Every time I do a bride that met her fiancé after I met my boyfriend and they will be getting married before my boyfriend has even proposed to me, always breaks my heart. Last year we threw a party and half of our friends walked in with their brand new rings and I just sat there upset but hopeful this past year would be the year. Nope. 

I brought up what my dad asked me to my boyfriend and he says to me “of course I want to marry you.” I asked him “do you plan on doing it before we hit 4 years?” And he goes “by March? That soon? I was planning something but next year.” Then he went to work and I spent the day crying. 

4.5 years is way too long for me, and that’s if he even does it. To me, he says our future is his priority but his actions aren’t showing it. I love him with all my heart, I do. He’s a great guy but the real commitment of marriage is not a priority to him like he always tells me it is. 

In the last year I’ve sent him pictures of rings I liked for him to get an idea. I’ve mentioned “you have to ask my Dad”. I’ve also mentioned how important it is for me to have my Grandma at my wedding because she isn’t getting any younger. So now I have to wait another year, then planning a wedding takes forever. I doubt his Dad or my Grandma will even be there. 

We haven’t talked in the past two days, he says I am being unfair and putting ridiculous time limits. I feel as if 3 1/2 years, and next year being 4 1/2 years is not unfair. It makes me feel like I don’t matter. Next summer into next September we have six weddings to go to, six weddings where I will still be the girlfriend and people will still look at me like I’m stupid for staying with someone who clearly doesn’t care to propose. 

Advice please 😔",04Oct2019,3

644,"This waitressing job is my first job. I started last year on August 28th. Recently one of our top managers bought the restaurant, he started out steady, and had a lot of plans to improve the store. 3 months ago he raised prices on the menu, and we were already expensive as it is. Let you know, this is an A&amp;W restaurant and 9 dollars for a combo meal is ridiculous because the quality is horrendous and we don’t use anything special. I’ve worked hard for a supervisor position since the first day I’ve started, and a few others too. He plans to promote a girl who has worked a year less than some of the best workers here, and she’s a person with low quality work ethic. He won’t promote the others who have worked 3 years at the restaurant, and they work extremely hard and work a lot. We’ve recently changed the clothing we wear while working, we all have to buy black pants, and I’m short on money because I’m paying for college applications and saving for a license, and I had to work one day with the tan pants we had to wear, I informed him about it, and he said some things that upset me. My dad has moved away a month ago and he was the one to help me get things if I couldn’t afford it. My boss commented “if you’re so short on cash, you should ask your dad to get you the pants. He used to buy you everything” in a rude tone. I was pretty upset, I didn’t have a 20 to get myself the pants and I was getting them the next day for my next shift. Our new schedule came out for next week, and I can tell he’s angry about me not being able to work weeks, because I’m a high school student going through recovery and I’m unable to work Monday through Thursday. He’s scheduled me last in for waitressing which means I have to stay until closing, when I’ve usually worked a drive thru or cashier shift. Which doesn’t give me time to do my homework or anything I need to do. He tried to schedule me the days I’m at credit recovery also.

661,"I have a very serious problem: a recurring longing/inability to get over my first love. This is cyclical.

&amp;#x200B;

Background: Parents divorced when I was 9. 60/40 custody majority at mom's who worked 9-5 home by 7pm. Met first love my Junior year in HS, her Freshman year back in 2010. Courted her over the next 6 months or so until finally we started going steady. We lasted about a year and a half, and it was the first time I experienced ""true love"". She felt like the home I never had. When I graduated, My mom had decided to move out of state. My father also lived out of state, so I decided to move in with him in spite of my mother. This is where I fucked up. In my own immaturity, I cut her out of my life completely and got with a new girl. It destroyed her. Months later, I get wind that my mom is moving back home. My mind immediately turns back to my first love. I break up with my rebound girl, move back to town, and try to patch things up, but to no avail. I've done too much damage at this point, and she doesn't see a reason to get back together. She said she had moved on. That was first time I experienced real heartbreak. It was crazy. I immediately felt an intense chest pain followed by the void feeling of numbness, then started shivering violently, even though I was under the covers in bed. I was around 21 at this time if I recall correctly

&amp;#x200B;

I can't remember exactly how the next few days, weeks, or months went, but I eventually forgot about things enough to pursue a girl at work who had been showing interest in me. Fast forward a year and a half relationship, and I find myself back at square one, thinking about my first love. She had popped into my dreams periodically, but one week just wouldn't let up. I reached out to her, which caused the demise of the relationship I had been in. It still didn't work out. She was with someone else. We grew up, and she said we were different people. It should've ended there, but it didn't.

&amp;#x200B;

a year or so passes, and I find myself courting my current love who is now my fiancée. In the beginning, It overshadowed everything in the past. It was my first time experiencing the honeymoon stages again. We've been together almost 3 years now, and we're getting married later this month. The relationship isn't perfect of course. I have many faults as does she, but we try to be better everyday for each other. But here's my problem. I posted a picture of our wedding invites on Instagram. One week later, I receive an Instagram DM from my first love about how she was cleaning her room and found my childhood teddy bear which I had given to her for safekeeping. Even since highschool, she has hated social media and accurately predicted people being glued to their phones.  I wanted so bad to see her again. I wanted to set up a meeting, but she said she was working late the next two weeks and was visiting her college town the weekend in between. I couldn't understand the situation.  She also had mentioned she would be visiting her boyfriend along with friends and her sister, but didn't care to elaborate when I asked about him. We ended up not meeting, and she sent my bear in the mail with no message attached. She either had no feelings full stop, had feelings but didn't want to rock any boats, or she has feelings and she really was busy. I want to believe so badly that it's the first option, but here I am again being haunted by dreams and thoughts of my first love. It's been almost a full month now, that these thoughts and dreams have been overshadowing my whole current life. I'm 25 years old now. I'm about to get married, and my biggest fear is having a beautiful family, and yet still wondering, ""what if?""

&amp;#x200B;

I understand the themes of unrequited love and wanting to right past wrongs. That's not why I'm here. I'm at my wit's end. I just don't know what to do.

671,"Hey r/advice! I’m not sure if this belongs here, but I kinda have a vague life question that I could really use an answer to. Or just like, some words of encouragement. Or something. 

So I’m on my last semester of college, and I’m going to for sure graduate unless something goes horribly wrong. But it’s been a giant pain in the ass, to say the least.  I didn’t have a ton of funds going into college, so I needed loans to pay tuition and money to pay the interest on my loans as well at living expenses. As a prereq for getting money from my dad, I needed to pick a major that was satisfactorily “employable.” So I did. But I didn’t want to give up on the things I actually wanted, either. I’ve always been interested in the world around me and had big dreams of being a globetrotter, so I picked a major that I thought would help me out with that, as well as an employable major. I picked anthropology and economics.

My college experience started off alright. I met a lot of friends, kept up with my hobbies and did okay in my classes. However, Economics at my school is very math intensive, and I have barely even a passing interest in math (let alone a knack for it), so it felt like a constant battle. As things ramped up, I started to give things up to keep my double major. I drifted away from a lot of friends, I wasn’t able to study abroad due to class requirement issues, and I gave up most of my hobbies. I even had to cut down on my involvement in the major I was interested in to focus on the money-maker. Throughout all of this, even after failing and withdrawing from multiple classes, I refused to drop my economics major for fears of a) parental disapproval and b) working retail forever. 

So, some good news: I have a job lined up for when I graduate. And I’m really really REALLY angry, because this job has nothing to do with my economics degree and is entirely related to my anthropology degree. I feel like I went on a years-long quest to slay the fearsome dragon threatening my village, only to find that actually the dragon’s been dead for 20 years and everybody was just being like, super dramatic. 

I realize how entitled I sound. I graduated college, my debt is comparatively low (like $45k) and I have a source of income going forward. I’m in a good place. But I’m also angry at myself for giving up so much and losing so much of myself when I didn’t even have to. I’m scared that I unnecessarily gave up one of the better parts of my life to fear of the future, and now I’m gonna go from stressed young adult to stressed normal adult without actually being able to enjoy life. So I’m scared of a stressful and boring future and regretful of a stressful and boring past, and all the internet advice I find is generally something like “yeah life gets worse after college, but you find some good in it!” which is... incredibly discouraging.

It got better at the end of the school year but at summer I stayed at home nearly all the time. Now with my new school it just got worse. Also my parents know that I've been drunk twice because I wanted to feel happy for a few hours but I almost died.

I always get put on the shitty jobs (part of being ugly) and there’s times I get stared at because I’m ugly. I don’t ever wanna leave the house for it. Just last week I was at work at that stadium job and a girl and her dad was dating drinking the girl looked at me with a blank stare (I only stared back because I thought she needed help with something as that’s wha I’m there for) and she looked back up to her dad with a disgusted look on her face going ‘ewwwwww he’s’ but I didn’t hear the rest.

&amp;#x200B;

After I saw my mom and my former best friend Liam doing it witch each other at his house, I left without looking back, because I was so shocked and felt betrayad to the core. It's been a few days since I saw them and I did not talk about it with dad or anyone else, it's such a shame, our whole family and all relatives would be so disgusted by mom's actions. I really felt for her when dad used to hit her, fight with her and argue with her all the time, their marriage since the summer of 94 has pretty much been negative so far, but they still managed to keep their marriage and not divorce, that's why people like us from the Middle East don't divorce so much like the western world and especially here in The United States.

But early today dad got furious all of a sudden, he wanted mom to come back now, I told him that she is on a trip with her cousins and she would be back soon, he got angrier and started to scream and shout out loud. I finally got him to relax and told him that mom would be home very soon, he finally let it go. I am lucky that he hasn't suspected anything yet. But after what I saw and dad's reaction I decided that I had to go right now to Liam's house and talk to mom, to bring her back home, because it started to be serious and dangerous now.

I got to the house and when I knocked, Abigail came out the door and began to look at me negatively, and wondered what I was doing here in a very unpleasant way. I told her that I wasn't here to fight or argue, I just want to talk to my mom and bring her home, I explained to Abigail about dad and that he will find out if mom doesn't come home, she started screaming at me and telling me to piss off and that she doesn't care about dad and what he will do, etc.... I told her to stop screaming at me and that she and her brother doesn't have the right to keep my mom at their house, she then told me that they are protecting her from me and dad and from our ''abuse'', that mom is happy here with them and they won't let her go. I got so angry that I literally said ""Yeah, by letting your filthy, disgusting, infidel brother sleeping with my mom."" She stared at me and said that it doesn't matter, that mom wants Liam and he wants her and that Liam are at least treating my mom good and taking care of her, we got into a loud fight together then mom came to the door and told me to get inside, Abigail tried to protest but mom told her to stay away.

I got in and I saw Liam sitting there, I felt like he wanted to laugh at me, make jokes about my family and how messed up we are, but he said nothing, because if he would, me and him would hurt each other. Anyway, I started to talk with mom, she made it very clear that he don't want to come back home yet, that she will be in Liam's and Abigail's house for at least two more weeks, I told her that I couldn't wait because of dad, and explained to her the situation, but mom didn't care and told me to keep him distracted, to lie to him, those words made me very sad and I almost broke down.

Mom told me then that after the two weeks are done, she will come back and give dad one last chance, but if he hurts her again, she will leave forever and come back here to Liam's house. I told her that it's fine whatever she decides, but to please come back home, she said that she would after two weeks. I then talked with her about her sleeping with Liam and their sexual itnercourse together, I saw that she got a little bit surprised but then to her defence, she said that she was very emotionally, mentally and physically weak after dad's treatment of her, and that she needed to let go of those feelings and that she wanted to forget, and the best way according to mom was to sleep with Liam. I told her that it is very strange and when she comes back, how will I be looking at her the same again and that it just wouldn't feel right, she told me to accept her decisions and that she do not regret making love to Liam.

Abigail and Liam tried to keep mom at their house, without giving dad another chance and Abigal said that Liam loves her and will create a serious bond/relationship with mom, and that she will be better of with him. But mom told her that she would give her husband, (dad), a last chance. I stood up and hugged mom, I told her to walk me to the door, she did. Before I left the house I told her that I couldn't stand the feeling about Liam doing it with her, she didn't show any regret or sad experssion, she told me that she really wanted to and that they both lusted after each other. I asked why she did it and why she ruined my friendship with Liam and almost her marriage, she said that her time with Liam, (which will be almost a month after these two weeks), was just like something refreshing, something that could calm her down and get her to enjoy, mom said I would see it as a vacation she was on and that she would come home again after this period. She kissed me on the cheek and said goodbye, Abigail came to the door and would close, before she closed I saw mom and Liam holding each other's hands and walking up the stairs, I got the feeling that they would do something together.

&amp;#x200B;

So I ask you now what do you think about the situation? How will my relationship be with my mother when she comes back home after two weeks? How should it look?

&amp;#x200B;

Did my mom do a good thing by leaving the house and living for almost a month and having sexual intercourse with Liam during her time away from the house? Isn't this a betrayal from Liam but also my mom? Abigail and Liam did something bad to me and my family, they didn't help me, do you agree?

&amp;#x200B;

Should I tell dad about any of this? Because if I do, then the marriage and their relationship together will for sure be over and they might hurt each other. Should I be quiet and start over, a fresh start? Is it better to not tell dad about any of that and just accept that my mom slept with my friend and now she is back and will live like before and everything will be normal again, should I?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to see Liam again, should I cut him out completely? Do his sister Abigail have something to do with all of this and was she wrong by allowing my mom and her brother to sleep with each other?

Before buying, I specifically called the pro shop and asked the course assistant professional if there were any restrictions on the carts (gas, electric, etc.). He said as long as it doesn't have big mud-ripping tires, I should be fine and that gas/electric doesn't matter.

It stopped for a year and came back when I was 13 for a few days but never happened a month after so I had went to the doctors. The doctor told me I’m most likely going to get my period when I turn 14 because that’s when my mom got hers. It’s true, I did get my period again when I turned 14 but only a month after. After that, never again. Then maybe a few months after I had turned 15 I got my period once again. Few months after that, another time. I turned 16 a few months ago and maybe gotten my period once or twice since then, I’ve lost track because I don’t want to get my hopes up. For the past two days it seems like my period came back and as happy as I am, I’m worried as well. For maybe over a year I’ve been asking my mom to take me to the doctors because this isn’t normal and she kept brushing it off. Next Wednesday I’m finally going to the doctors and going to mention it to her. Last time they made me take a pregnancy test even when I told them I wasn’t sexually actively, understandable I guess? But right now I’m just afraid there might actually be something wrong with me. I’ve mentioned this to a few of my friends and some of them joke and say “you’re lucky that you don’t have your period, it’s painful.” I mean, I guess it makes sense but you need to think of the possibilities of the future.

688,"I burn out really fast when dealing with people. I feel like I'm obligated to help or continue talking which results in me getting tired and then disappearing for days/months (especially online). Makes it worse that I'm often approached to deal with kids since I get along with kids pretty well.

The huge problem is, I really enjoy helping/talking. It's validation for me and, in my mind, doing nothing in a household/community is the same as being rudely stagnant; I'd rather burn myself out than to be rude or useless. In the end, I get tired and moody leading to withdrawal for days or even months

691,"Basically title. I've been struggling with anxiety and inadequacy issues throughout my whole adolescent life. I've been dealing very slowly with that especially because in the meantime I've been put through some situations that would have been stressful either way, but because I was already dealing with those issues, were made almost unbereable. At worst, for several months I was a neurotic wreck, pretty much permanently one step away from a breakdown, which led to being depressed and suicidal. Even when the worst passed, I was still a total mess for a lot longer. While it's been a slow crawl to the surface I've made enough progress, especially recently that I can call myself a functional member of society for the first time, maybe ever.

I know it's not exactly my fault but I feel like I've painted myself (or got painted, whichever perspective is better) into a corner. I could have spent those years so much better and it feels like I've wasted the best opportunities to create relationships. I didn't do as well in college as I could have done, I barely worked because all I could handle were random one or couple day jobs because it was too anxiety inducing, but the most I've fucked up is in relationships. I was way to apathetic to pursue anything and even if I would've just felt like a burden. I spent so much time in this mode of thinking that I have to get myself functional before I even think about getting close to someone that I'm not sure how to pull that switch, especially since it's the reason I have no experience in it whatsoever. Feeling like I've had the last couple years stolen from me, the last thing I want is for it to keep slowing me down, but I can't escape the feeling like it's some sort of baggage on my back.

I've always just took all the suck in my life for granted and life at its fullest was something that just happened to other people, but not me. Now at least I don't feel like that anymore but I feel way behind. It's kind of weird to start feeling better about everything only to feel like I'm having to put out fires not to fall even harder. One day I feel like it's all going to fall into place and going to be all right, the next that it will keep fucking me over.

Don't get me wrong, I would much rather take the struggle and worry than absolute misery and depression, I just didn't expect it to be such a rude awakening. It's a different kind of struggle than the one I'm used to and it's making me somewhat volatile emotionally, which I'm not used to. Even when I was depressed as fuck I didn't cry, I just wanted to crawl into a hole and die, unlike the last couple of weeks.

I (female, 24) have been with my boyfriend (31) for three years. We live in Austria. He is from the Middle East (can't specify for privacy reasons). We want to spend the rest of our lives together and still act like we are freshly in love. The problem is that there's a war in his home country and he had to get his mother of the country. She is also battling a chronic illness that got worse lately. Other parts of his family live in Germany.

He helped her start her asylum process in this country and it looks like she will stay. Now, my boyfriend told me that she is going to live with him and because we wanted to move in together, the three of us would live all together eventually, permanently. 

I am not sure I can do this. For the time being, sure, especially since she is ill but for the rest of my life? I wanted to travel with him, work in different cities, explore... Now I feel like I am being sucked into another life...

I added the information about her being from elsewhere because it makes it extra hard. Our cultures are a little different, there are parts of my family that will maybe never accept him and that is without the infomation that I will live with his mother.

So, today during class, I just happened to be sitting by this guy (who i’ll call T) who everyone knows, and he knows everyone. 

[A bit of a backstory!]
This all happened when my friend was on FaceTime with one of her other friends, and she had mentioned T, and I blurted out “Oh he’s handsome!” Not meaning I like him or anything, but that he has a nice face? 

Then for the next few months of my junior year and continuing in my senior year, most of my friends would associate me with him. I denied everything from people thinking we were together to thinking we ever broke up. 

My best friend says that I could do better, and I agree. . to some extent.

[Present Day]
My teacher suggested that we work with some people who were near us on some work. T isn’t the sharpest tool in the box. In fact, he’s a troubled kid. He isn’t friends with the best people, and he usually causes trouble. But I still had the urge to help him, because I know he could do really well in class. I started to get disgusted by the fact that no one had faith in him, and when no one was deciding to pair up with him, I do. 

He struggled a lot with the work but when he finally got the idea of it, it was a great feeling. I never felt so excited for someone! 

Okay so back to what I was trying to figure out. 
I know that today, I knew I was a bit infatuated with him. I know the feeling of when I like someone. 

The thing is, I don’t know if I am ready to even like him, like, i’ve told all of my friends I don’t like him, but if I do it’s gonna get out to the school pretty fast, and that’s only about liking him! (Forget about a relationship!)

So, this isn't my problem although I'm close to one of the victims and I'm struggling to find how to deal with it and what's the best course of action, because right now it's hard not to just kick the guys teeth in really 

So the story is (and I'll tell this from my friends perspective) she was going out with this guy and he would send her messages of him cutting himself and threatening to kill himself if she didn't do sexual acts for him, as a girlfriend at the time and not wanting for him to kill himself she agreed. I don't remember the timings of things but they broke up and he got another girlfriend which the same thing happened to her about it. She spoke to the school about it which then my friend did aswell, obviously like ""oh, it happened to her aswell"" and she was too embarrassed to speak up until then.

 The school obviously has to deal with this expecially with 2 girls both saying the same guy. The thing is though, this boy is the golden boy, top grades, flagship and all that. So the school say that he is a top student so they can't really do anything because he has good grades. No joke, they said that and the following 2 weeks he got given an award as a role model and great attitude while knowing of these two incidents. The school offered to involve the police although scared, the girls said no as there was no evidence really, for the police to have and they were also scared because obviously the police. 


So with 2 girls unbelievably upset since they were exploited, the school say they can't do a thing because he has good grades and they justified it by saying ""but he has a hard time at home"". 


2 years on and particularly the girl I know is still upset since there was no conclusion to her being forced Into sexual acts and her parents not believing her, which I can't really imagine the stress and annoyance that would cause. 


The school still let this boy into our college, knowing what he had done and promising the girls they will take it seriously. 



2 weeks ago his now ex girlfriend came into school saying she was raped by him in a tent outside, he left her frozen in fear inside of the tent after the rape and scared to go near him. She got told by the school to not say a thing about him because she has no evidence and that the school can't do anything because it happened outside of school. So the message they sent is that we can rape anyone and they won't do anything about it. 



So there's a girl raped with 2 girls forced into sexual acts and God knows how many others scared to speak up, and this guy is being protected by teachers and not taking the claims of rape by scared girls seriously because this boy will give our school good grades and because it was done outside of school. This guy walks around school like the dogs bollocks smiling at the girls he's raped and winking. He's also allowed to run for head boy and anyone that says anything to the school gets punished for slander.

Uh I hope this additional info helps but I kinda wanted them to tell me directly about what they will do before they do it especially when they want to do something that is fully related to me (changing, deleting, bla bla). I mean it's not just consent because it is a group work, if majority doesn't like it or if it is not correct, I'm fine with rewriting. But they don't respect my ""something"". God, I'm so upset at my inability to come up with the word. What is that feeling? What is this thing that they violate?

Fun fact: I also didn't know when I was humilated in the public. I just know I don't like something and I have negative feelings about it. However, if my thoughts, my reaction, my emotions about the event can be helped to identify these things, let me know so I will add more info.

Thank you,

705,"I am starting a new job in less than 2 weeks in a different state that is a 3 hour drive away. I am still working on finding a living situation and would need to quickly move out of my apartment after I find one. I have jury duty this Monday and if I am selected for it, this would heavily interfere with my ability to find a new apartment and move out of my current one.

This is very terrible timing, and I’m really stressing out that I’ll be selected to serve, in which case I sincerely doubt I’ll have enough time to figure out my living situation and move before my start date.

707,"So basically I asked out this girl 2 weeks ago and she said hell yea! Then a week later after it going so well and probably one of my happier weeks in general, she decided to breakup with me because she wasnt over her ex but said she still loved me and had feelings for me but her heart and mind weren't on the same page. Now I have been in love with this girl for a couple of months now and have no clue what I'm supposed to do. I gave her some space to see maybe if that's what she needed and time but my anxiety was acting up and i wanted to ask if she still had feelings for me. She said to be honest no. It felt like my whole world came crashing down and it made me really sad because it felt that whole week and everything she said was fake or had no meaning. Then when we saw each other again she apologized and said sorry for being a bitch and broke up with you and I said it's fine I'll be a supportive friend anyway even if we weren't together. I told her that maybe one day we could try again if shes ever over her ex. And she said yeah maybe one day we can. Now I want to be there for her but I also dont want to come off as obsessive. I want to know what I should do and how should I approach this situation.

711,"It's Friday afternoon, Grandma's apartment, the end of a week of mourning following Grandma's passing, an event which greatly shook them all. Mom (60), Dad (63), Son (35) and Son's family (wife and 3 year-old boy) are about to leave the apartment and go to their respective (parents' and Son's) homes. They're all tired and spent and just want to get out of there and go home. Dad is feeling physically ill with stomach pains. Son's family heads out first and goes down the elevator to the ground floor. There are a lot of things to take, enough that it looks like it's going to require two trips down to the car to bring everything. Mom and Dad each takes a load of bags and start heading out. Son takes things too and starts saying he thinks he can take everything else down himself in one trip, so parents don't have to come back up again.  Mom cuts him off saying ""forget it, we'll make two trips, it's no big deal."" He tries again to explain that he can help avoid the extra trip, but parents don't even listen to him and ignore him completely.  Son raises his voice demanding to be heard and not ignored.  Mom and Dad yell at Son to stop yelling. Son tries to explain that he wasn't yelling, just raising his voice a little so they would stop ignoring him.  Mom keeps yelling at son, and every time Son tries to explain himself Dad stops him by shouting ""Quiet! Quiet! Quiet!"" Son shouts ""Don't silence me like that!""More simultaneous yelling back and forth, Mom is already in the elevator, Dad rushes in while Mom repeatedly says ""You're insufferable!"" and quickly presses the button for the ground floor. This elevator closes its door as soon as the button is pressed (it always does and Dad knows it), so the door closes on Son while he is holding many heavy bags and hurts him before he backs out and it closes again. Mom keeps yelling ""He's insufferable!"" inside the elevator, which Son can hear on the third floor as well as Son's family on the ground floor (unbeknownst to them).

717,"Sick of zero hour jobs, getting 1 shift a week, feel less of a person. What to do?

Years ago I had a job at Toys R Us, where I didn’t know what my shifts were every week and I used to get scraps every week and felt useless and unimportant while the higher postions were there almost every day/doing night shifts. 

I moved house in February and two months ago I got a job at my local cinema as an Usher, I have the nicest colleagues and managers but it’s the same case where I’m getting scraps (low hours) every week, sometimes 1 shift a week. I’m lucky to live with my mum but it’s still a struggle. The cinema seem to want to invest in me as they are talking about training me to become a projectionist, I am also flexible and practically live across the road from them and available anytime they need me. 

I’ve even covered sick peoples shifts, and I told them I’m committed and want this long term, but after all of this and saying yes to the projector offer, nothing is getting better and I’m not being rewarded with more shifts for my work and commitment to them. I’m still getting one shift a week, how do they expect me to live off that? 

This is what makes me feel unimportant and a bit of a pushover, saying ‘yes’ to rubbish 5 hour shift a week, and with this projector stuff, I feel like they are just training me so I can turn up on emergencies, no real full hours. 

I’m now looking at a PE Teacher/Sports Coach Apprenticeship in my area where I’ll get more money a month and I’ll be busy 5 days a week, and get a qualification in something I’ve always had aspirations in doing. My dream is to either become a teacher or a football coach. A part of me wants to do this and hand in my notice to the cinema.

I have not had conversation with my neighbors about it as I figured it might boil into something else. So, I asked the HOA if it violated any laws. They said “No”, but they offered to speak to them anonymously. Afterward, they informed me that they got a “nasty” response, and that was the extent of the HOA intervention.

Posting the builder’s name and build date might violate the post rules, but I’ll gladly provide if it helps me.

I’ve spent a few hundred dollars on materials trying to mitigate the smoke intrusion with very little improvement (sealed wall outlets, light fixtures, foam sealed areas under the staircase, etc). The smoke doesn’t intrude the entryway doors or windows at all as long as they are closed. It’s been strictly through the shared walls.

I’m concerned that the smoke is damaging my home not to mention my health.

Can I do anything legally to prevent any damage to my home?

726,"I (22 F) have had a lot of issues within myself and my personal identity- Who am I? What is my purpose in life? Blah blah blah. Starting in second grade, I would completely disassociate from my past self. I wanted to move schools to be a new person, I wanted to ghost people to make new friends and have another go at an identity I liked more. In elementary school, I moved schools every two years. When it wasn't due to my parents divorce, it was because I asked them if I could change schools and sometimes I would lie and say the kids were mean to me and so they would eventually always let me switch. 

Fast forward to now and I feel like I have absolutely no identity. It is hard for me to form opinions without wondering if I am conforming to someone else's ideals. I can't stick to a hobby or interest for more than a couple days at a time because I eventually begin to believe I'm doing it for someone but myself- even if I really enjoy the hobby. I can't remember being 17 years old, or 14, or 9 or any age in the past because of how bluntly I would disconnect from any past me. It seems like everyone has a Tumblr or Twitter or Instagram or Snapchat they can scroll back to 2013 on and see what was going on in their lives and spark some sort of memory of what they liked or who they were. After every year I would delete my social media and start fresh, so I can't look back on those to get a taste of who I was. I just have no sense of identity and when I try to form one for myself, I instinctively feel like I'm conforming or doing it for someone else and it makes me hate myself and I become unmotivated and remain the same soul-less person. 

My boyfriend on the other hand is the most based person I have ever met. All of his (super cool) interests that he has been passionate about since his childhood are more prominent than ever. When I first met him (About 1 year and 1 month ago) he was just getting into shooting VHS. We met at a house show of a mutual friend. He made an Instagram account to post all of these videos to and he has just been skyrocketing from there. He is so happy because the things that he has an absolute gut passion for are allowing him to do amazing things. Tonight he was invited to a show in LA to film on stage... I am so fucking proud of him but I would be lying if I said it didn't make me sad that I am watching his Instagram stories of being places that I used to be invited to but now I have too much social and internal anxiety to go to. Plus I have a job and I'm so broke. 

I know if I had a sense of self, something to bring to the table, I'd feel better. However, it just makes me sad and I have to force a smile to tell him I am proud of him and excited for his adventures.

737,"Hey, 

I was wondering if anyone has any advice for me :)

I recently ended my netball season, I was playing in two teams which included training twice a week. Once the season ended I began getting really concentrated dizziness wherever I went, no cause of it. I went to my GP several times and was recommended a medication for epilepsy/migraines. My mum has been acting like the dizziness is in my head, like I can control it. She thinks it's all anxiety and panic. I struggle because it really affects me when she makes these statements.

As soon as the season was over mum and dad wanted me to find a sport to play over Summer. I struggled because all of my friends weren't doing one and I didn't like any of the offered sports. I considered not doing a sport over Summer as it wouldn't change anything. I'm a healthy weight and take time to exercise at school, walk home, run around the block. 

I feel pressured all the time when the topic is addressed and I have to decide soon. I personally love art and do my very best at school to achieve good grades so if I continued that maybe it would be okay. I have this feeling that my parents are going to bring me down with comments about how I chose not to do a sport over Summer. The options of the sports aren't even close to what i'd normally choose.

If anyone has advice it would be absolutely appreciated, this is really affecting my health with the pressure but i'm dealing with it.

Thanks guys xx",04Oct2019,1

It seems like a jackass move in some ways, but I really don't care. Like, money is money and I can start applying for things around early-November so the transition is easier.

747,"Hey, so I've (20, M) made a previous post some time ago and today, same issue. I have next to no sex life. I have learned to accept it but I think I'm almost at breaking point. I hear of so many couples and friend fucking and having sex and having a great time while I sit here at 20, not getting any. I'm frustrated! I'm nearly always horny and when I do see my girlfriend (19, F), she wants nothing to do with it. When she senses I become disappointed and therefore talk less, she sometimes puts more effort into trying it.

We went through a time where it would hurt her whenever we did it because of some stupid fucking birth control pill that didnt affect her emotionally but physically this time. I feel its scarred her and shes great but I feel as time has gone on, I've become predictably resentful. 

I don't mean to and I don't want to hurt feelings but I've been in this relationship coming up 2.5 years from late 17 to mid 20s. I look at other girls, I almost fucking salivate, it could be seen as disgusting. I'm fucking mad dude. Whenever I talk to her about it she just gets upset, tells me how shit she is and all this stuff.

I want experimentation with sex. I wanna get lowkey freaky. If we do it, it's missionary and checking the fucking condom every two seconds to ease her mind it hasnt split (bare in mind I havent climaxed). It's so fucking unsexy and I'm super confused, angry, disappointed! In myself! In her too but with no conscious intention on feeling this way towards her. 

Please. Advice. I would love some.
Questions welcome!

TLDR;
Sex life is dead. Without meaning to, I look elsewhere and gawp, salivate and wanna fuck almost any girl that looks cute. Been in my relationship since 17, am now 20. I love her but as time has passed, I'm slowly becoming resentful and sometimes snap at her or just flat out ignore her when one day she decides not to message me. I am always the one who messages first btw and when I dont she gets a little worried ""i dont love her anymore"". Ugh. Too young for this shit.

edit: in our relationship, I, a male (specifying just in case) am the typical needy, clingy one and SHE is the typical boy of idc, lets go. Help.",04Oct2019,1

He never acknowledges to his friends that I am in a serious relationship and always makes jokes about his friends finding his daughters husbands. I hate to talk badly about them but I think they have a problem with him because he is Asian and is not a macho type guy.

Since then, this person has been more uncommunicative than usual. Today I had the longest conversation with them yet. I asked for a job code to make an expense report, and instead of just giving the code they said ""it's the same as every other week."" I just said, okay, I have never known it and still don't know it. I didn't know I was supposed to report this type of expense under this job code. I still don't know it."" They said that they shared the information with me in our first meeting (many months ago) and if I haven't kept it or kept track of it, they could send it to me again. In a moment of rebellion I said ""That would be great. Thanks for your help. :) I'd like to make this expense report today, so if you . could send it before you step out that would be really helpful.""

Because of complicated issues, my university refused to grant me some much needed credits last year. I am now taking 22 credits (6 classes) in order to still graduate on time and I am utterly miserable. 

Every week I’m extremely unhappy and miserable because I’m constantly doing work and never really have time to rest. Taking a break or gap year is completely out of the question because I MUST graduate on time for various reasons I don’t want to go into. 

I have little to no family support (including extended family). I grew up with narcissistic parents and all extended family side with them over me. I also have few friends (none at my university, so nobody in person) and my constant misery and unhappiness is straining my relationship with my boyfriend, and it is breaking my heart.

I suffer from serious depression and anxiety and this semester has already made it flare up so bad. I am almost always anxious and it is debilitating and affecting me greatly. I see a school therapist but it is only once every 2 weeks and I can’t make it more frequent. My college is in a small town without adequate mental health support so it’s hard to seek help outside of my school.

771,"I’m at a loss, I need some outside perspective right now. Gonna be long, and I’m on phone, sorry.
I (25F) moved away from my hometown in march after not being able to find a job in my field (biology). I moved to the capital of my country, where I never really wanted to move. Got a job, rented a room, but it was far from perfect. There is no real possibility for advancing from my position at work and even though I really like my job, it’s very consuming. I get payed little, and have barely any free time, so I haven’t been able to find new friends in this city. Because of all of this I never really considered this job a long term one. I was planning on looking for a new one in january. 

Meanwhile the room I rented became worse and worse. Last drop was when my landlord moved in a girl into my room without asking me, so I randomly got a new roommate even though I payed for the entire room. Legally I found out I got screwd over and there is nothing I can do so I decided to move away. Due to the sh.tty contract they duped me with, I have to stay/pay for 3 months after notifying my landlord about wanting to move out. I gave notice on 31st of august so I’m supposed to stay here (or at least pay ) until 31st of november. 

So my housing issues are pretty bad, but I really started being upset with my job also, since my boss decided to fire 5 colleagues and give me the projects of 2. I’ve been doing the work of 3 people alone with no help for the last 1,5 months. I’ve reached breaking point today and cryed for hours. 

I wanna give up this life and move back to my city try find something in a place where I’m not alone and actually have a support system.
On the other hand if I do that I will feel like I failed. I’m strong enough to pull through, find a new apartment and apply for a job next year but is it really worth it? All the effort and heartache when I’m not even sure I’m on the right path?

- My estranged father died. We weren’t close but it hit hard for some reason. I guess it brought up a lot of feelings of guilt and past neglect.
- Had a breakdown in which none of my friends where there for me. My closest friend got a girlfriend and subsequently dropped me (for the second time). Another showed my private messages to someone else. 
- A legal battle over inheritance then ensued. My father’s family tried to con me into handing over the money by sending me a letter to sign. They scribbled out their address so I wouldn’t be able to contact them but began to post lies about me on Facebook to my dad’s significantly younger fiancée (sorry to be petty, just salty). 
- I then almost got grabbed into this guy’s car which made me nervous to go out and caused mild-ish agoraphobia.

Basically if I feel like I get too close to someone I become so disgusted by them that I find it hard to he around them. 

In 6th grade I only had one friend bc my whole friend group fell apart, and one day after spending so much time with her bc I had no one else, I got that feeling of disdain and repulsion, so I picked a fight with her, we didn't speak for a day or two and the disgust went away.

Later that year my class did a play and I had to play the part of a wife of some kid in my class. After a few rehearsals I felt that same disgust but this time I couldn't do anything about it bc this was a big play, so it made the rehearsals painful and uncomfortable to say the least.

A few years later some guy confessed and said he liked me. I didn't know him well, but just the idea of us possibly getting close brought that repulsion back so all I could do was just avoid him until we were let out for summer.

That same summer I had a sleepover with my best friend, and although it was a fun night, we talked about everything, I still, after that night, felt repulsed even though I love her sm. Luckily we don't see each other often anymore because we go to different schools, so the repulsion has worn off.

These are some of the ones I remember, but I know there were more instances.

Anyways, idk what's going on with me here? These were all sweet people that I never had anything against? And it's going to ruin me bc dating, or getting married is out of the question, since no doubt I will feel that repulsion. I just don't understand it, please help?

Personally I wouldn’t buy a dog from a pet store because I’m a big believer in getting a dog from a shelter but I get that some people want a specific dog and color and that can be hard to get at a rescue. 

I can’t find any concrete evidence that their dogs are unhealthy or that they come from bad places. All I have found are some old articles scrutinizing them and some online accusations but no actual evidence really.  Their customer reviews are good and the dogs looked good when I was there but should I be hesitant to work here? I really need the money ..  Thoughts ?",04Oct2019,2

786,"This is my second account, as I want to appear unknown to friends and family who might see this.
I need to tell a tiny bit of background about me, so you understand what I am dealing with.
I am in my early twenties, I am around 180cm and weight about 50kg. I an not joking and I hate it myself. I have always been very thin and light weight, so no one have really worried about my weight that much. I myself hate weighting this little, and wish I can gain more weight. But fat and muscles are a pain for me to gain.

I don’t have any “normal” eating disorders. But if you break down the work eating disorder, then I do have one. You see, I have trouble swallowing some kind of food, and get very nauseous sometimes. Thick soup, bread, dry meat and some other things I can’t quite remember. That problem come and goes, and it is not that big anymore, but it’s still there.

But one thing is troubling me a lot. And that is I don’t eat. Not because I don’t want to. Maybe I’m just lazy. I am not sure, for if you give me food, and place it infront of me, will I eat it.
But I started to eat less than normal. Like today I only ate two pieces of toasted bread with butter, a hotdog, and dinner, which was a small plate of pasta and meat sauce, because I didn’t have energy to eat more. It’s an evil circle, because when I finish eating I get nauseous, and is not full yet. And then I don’t eat for hours. And then I feel the hunger whisper in my ear, but I ignore it without knowing.

Anyway, what advice I ask for, if anyone had some good ideas for me to keep eating, what small snacks would be easy for me to carry around and eat. Meanwhile also be easy not to prepare, like cutting fruits and all. I have thought of carrying bananas with me, but sometimes I forget the, and then they get all brown.

&amp;#x200B;

Through my life I have struggled to put this to words. 

When I was around 5 years old, I was raped by my Uncle.

I'm not looking for pity, or sympathy, I just want my story heard. I know I am not alone, and others stand remain silent.

&amp;#x200B;

My father was a drunk, who could blame him. He worked 12 hours a day, if not more, and spent weeks away from my brothers and I. He fought, and nearly killed his own brother for his disgusting crime.

My mother, became a narcissist, obsessed with keeping everything perfect, or at least the illusion of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

For many years, I struggled with hazy memories lurking in the back of my skull, sometimes flashing before my eyes, which frightened me. I didn't know if what I was seeing, or remembering was real. 

Nobody told me, or attempted to, I figured it out myself after many years, at the age of sixteen and questioned my parents in a desperate way. My brother, and girlfriend was the only other in the world, who knew what I struggled with.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked my mother. She confirmed this. My feelings of rage, and burning inside haven't stopped. I vividly see this man's death at my hands. For why? Not what he has done to me. But to my family, and to my brother. 

He ruined our family, they never healed from that emotional scar. My parents and I fought, for many years. Have struggled with anger for many years, still do, getting better. 

I don't like to be dramatic, but I tend to explode. I've hurt people in my life, and I make no excuses.

&amp;#x200B;

I've gotten addicted to THC to cope with these angry feelings, and kept my friend circle very small. Only around, two people.

My closest friend, is my best friend from sixth grade. We've had many years of ups and downs, he had problems with cocaine and I eventually got involved with the -sale- of it. 

He quit, and I quit selling it, don't feel proud, or great about it. 

A friend of mine OD'd and died from using cocaine, nearly around the same time my grandfather died. I felt more for my friend, who I only sparsely knew, than my distant grandfather. 

&amp;#x200B;

Regular work is problematic, my moods shift throughout the day, and my focus is varying. I did several manual labor jobs, but nearly every single time, end up with vivid daydreams of my own death. I suffer from some sort of agoraphobia, intertwined with a very paranoid nature.

&amp;#x200B;

Almost certain it's a form of PTSD. Onto the next point, of my girlfriend. 

I love her with all of my heart, she tries her hardest. My girlfriend lived a rough life, was homeless in her teens, and basically her entire family struggles with cocaine/pill addictions.

Mostly anti-social, and so is she. People are hard to deal with, I find it hard to compare, or relate to most. Normal problems sometimes make my eyes roll, and I don't know how to 'turn that off'.

She is the only one who doesn't use hard drugs, and her sister managed to have 5 kids, as a single mother. 

&amp;#x200B;

These kids eventually ended up with at her father's house, along with her sister. They smoked crack, and cooked it while the babies and kids were there. From ages 0-8.

The CAS got involved, and took the kids. Now, my girlfriend wants to take in a newborn baby. I was nervous. I didn't want the responsibility. 

&amp;#x200B;

But when I seen his little face, and he got here. I.. I couldn't help but want to help give him a better life. My parents failed me, and my girlfriends' did for her, her sister failed those kids.

I want to do my best. I'm not sure how, but I just wanted to say it aloud. Despite the medium, in the modern world, this is my 'yelling to the heavens'.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice is welcome, not really expecting 'help', or to be 'fixed'. I'm aware therapy would help, and I'm unwilling to medicate myself, because of the addictive nature I have.",04Oct2019,1
791,"I have a huge problem with perfectionism. When I do something I want to do it 100%, if I do any less or make mistakes then I become unmotivated, ashamed, I feel worthless. After I make a mistake it just seems like the walls close in on me and I'm just spiraling down the abyss of self-doubt and loathing.

I was doing good for about two weeks. I was getting up at 4 AM to go for a morning jog, trying really hard to do my best at work, eating 3 healthy meals a day, staying off of social media as much as possible, learning new things, lifting weights in the afternoon, showered and in bed by 8 PM to do it all over again the next day. I FELT FUCKING GREAT.

Then I slowly slipped, I cut corners, I let things go. Now I've ruined that schedule all together. All that structure and hard working and shit is out the window. And I hate myself for it. I hate how lazy I am, how I can't just be strong and keep going no matter what. I don't have the determination or the focus I need. It's crippling.

I want to get over this. I have a problem with failing. For some reason I have this narcissistic notion that I'm destined for better than other people and somehow when I fail it knocks me back down a notch for a second. I feel like I've hit rock bottom, that's when I start telling myself I'm better than others but I just don't try hard enough but I have more potential than everyone else and somehow even though I feel like fucking shit I feel a little better. Because in someway I'm truly better than everyone else, smarter, faster, more cunning, what the fuck ever. That's the disgustingly narcissistic shit I tell myself and I hate myself for being such a prick.

I don't know how to reconcile my flaws and accept myself for just being another human being. I can't, if I'm not the fucking chosen one and I'm destined to be just like everyone else then what the fuck am I doing here? I'm some stupid fucking 20 year old with his head far up his ass. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing, I'm scared and I'm tired of not accomplishing my goals or even putting forth the effort to even try and obtain them. I give up too fucking fast.

I don't want to be a loser forever, I don't wanna be stuck stagnate like this. Constantly going through the cycle of trying and failing and trying and failing over and fucking over. I feel like I haven't made any real progress.

Any advice? Please, I really don't know what to do anymore. I'm tired of my life going this direction, if anyone has anything please let me know.",04Oct2019,1

These past 3 years haven't been so great.. I went through high school with few friends i lost most for personal reasons. 

I have less than a handful of friends from 6 to none. I feel like a let down i lost a valuable friendship i guess maybe something i tried making it last that's that.

 I had a job i was making money after high school ended. I ended up quitting because i thought i was going to get this one job from a friend i was wrong... lied to so i lost it.

 I have no job i sti at home 18 while my parents work my siblings are in school i push them to be better i got them all pre-ap classes both of them are doing great i'm proud only sentimental things i have are for my family.

I don't feel happy, i don't feel confident, i feel all opposite of anything that's positive, i wish i was better i can't have a real job because i'm undocumented and no criminal record for 15 years here.

My parents support me they care but lately i have been throwing my life away i play grindy video games which consume my time and make me feel satisfied, complete, accomplished.

I can't keep this up any longer i can't do this forever but my only goal in my life is to see my siblings through and succeeded.

I have had ADHD as a kid and it's to this day still affecting me it doesn't make it any easier.

All i know is that i'm a letdown with no friends, no goals in life... just nothing...

I have had some small relationships but nothing serious unfortunately. One is my fault for it not working it out i wish i couldve made it work but my insecurities ruined it etc.

793,"So last night I (23f) got into a huge fight with my boyfriend J. I left the house cause it got very heated until I contacted a friend (G) and went to his to cool down. While I was off J contacted my best friend (since I'm 12 -U). She text me to say he tried to add her on snapchat as i was talking to her about us arguing. It was late and she was in bed and said I could go to hers but i didn't wanna bother her as J and I have been arguing a lot latley.

After a bit I went home to J where the argument just got worse and he turned to me to say I've been talking to 4 of yer friends that say ""yer not worth the time, yer like yer mother, ye have anger issues and all this."" I dont actually have 4 close friends I have 2, G and U. This is gonna be long cause im basically gonna give everything that was said to see am I crazy and need to apologise or am i right in feeling absolutely hurt.

So I wrote to U straight away saying:

Me - Hey did you talk to J and tell him I'm like my mother and that's just me to go off and all this ?

U  - No he asked me where you were hours ago I said the hyper when you when to G

Me - He said he was talking to 4 people about me tonight. I know two people like. Hes literally trying to make shit

She sent a message saying I thought he was leaving and I just sent back like why would he say it. I didn't hear from her for the rest of the night

First thing in the morning I wake up to 

U - Look i was speaking to him he was venting saying he loves and cares for you and doesn't want you to turn into your mother

Me - Wtf and you lied to me about it at first, Did you say to him i have anger issue too cause thats what made him leave saying even my friends think im not worth the time

U - Look ""me"" I'm not getting involved that's all he said, I didn't wanna deal with it last night before I went to sleep

Me - But you did cause he lost it when i got home over whatever you spoke about saying all this stuff to me that my friends said. That fucking hurts that ye would talk about me like that then lie to me about it. Like you can talk to him like that but if i spoke to (her ex) ye said you wouldnt talk to me for a long time like how is that fair

U - Cop the fuck on OK no one lied to ye, (her ex) has nothing to do with this stop acting like a victim

Me - I asked ye last night did ye talk to him about that you straight up said no

U - I didn't wanna fucking deal with it before bed I told you now no one's lieing to ye

Me - Thats literally no excuse to lie to me. I was literally up all night thinking who was he talking to about me like that that wouldnt say it to my face

U - Look i don't know wtf your talking I wasn't talking about you last night I literally told you just there stop trying it into something


Me - I understand ye didnt wanna deal with it thats why i went out to G instead of you and that. But you didnt have to lie about the situation last night to tell me first thing in the morning. Now all i can think is wow what does she actually think of me as a friends cause what J said he spoke to on the phone about me wasn't nice, and he said it wasn't just him saying shit. Yeah things with J are shit but i literally helped you turn yer life around for the better and he's making it out like you were talking about me in a bad light when ive never fought with you or anything (She was in a toxic relationship that i helped her see wasn't healthy, got her a job basically)

U - I don't give a fuck what J says if want me to still be your friend shut the fuck up now

Me - Fair enough but can ya not see where im coming from. Do you wanna meet to talk later

U - I don't have the time today I'm flat out , I don't wanna talk about it anymore so I don't want to be involved

Me - But you did get involved and jamie is using what you spoke about against me. Im not even mad he's gone I'm upset that you spoke to him and he's using that

U - I never fucking asked to be involved with anything OK there's nothing more to talk about with me alright

Me - Ok can i ask ya one thing the well drop it

U - No you can't you may drop it now I've fucking had enough

Me - Look if you didnt wanna get involved why would ya accept him as a friend and talk to him and get involved when if it was the other way round you'd ask me not to talk to him. I've never actually fought with you about anything and i am trying to wrap my head around this. Ive been up all night thinking about it like. I don't wanna be arguing with you and him but i just wanna fucking know why like, and if you wanna stop being friends just cause i wanna ask thats up to you but i am there and have been there  for everything that happened to you

I just wanna make this clear, she has no idea who J is as a person other than through me. She's full on told me never to talk to her fella about arguments when they were still together and not to contact him. I am not talking to U or J currently.",04Oct2019,1

[Present day]

I am sitting near this student in my class, let’s call him T, and the teacher wants us to work on a quick project with another person! The thing is, things are a bit weird between T and me. . or maybe it’s just me who’s being a paranoid weirdo.

[Backstory]

One day, my friend was face-timing another friend of her’s and they just happened to mention T and I blurted out “Oh! I think he’s pretty handsome!” Not because I liked him, but because his face looked. . nice?

My friends took it the wrong way and have since been associating me with T. I didn’t think anything of it, considering that this was our little inside joke.  
(But i’m starting to think more of our little joke.)

My best friend says I could do better and I sort of agree. .

[Present Day]

So, no one else is pairing up with T, that’s probably due to his reputation. He’s a troubled kid, and he hangs with the wrong people. (We’re polar opposites.) I don’t think anything of it, considering he tries his best in class.

I got disgusted by the fact that everyone somehow avoids him, so I pair up with him. I can’t tell you how excited we both were when he finally got the concept of each formula (we’re in chemistry btw).

I hate to admit it, but I felt sort of infatuated with him. The only reason why I hate to admit that, is because I went against my word, of not liking him!

So how do I get rid of this feeling!? Anything will do!",04Oct2019,1

My dad hears the convo and acts pretty apathetic about it. 7 miles later we get home and the cops shortly arrive after and arrest him for assault.

Am I wrong for doing that? He's like 50 years old so I would feel bad for smearing his record with an assault charge which might prevent him from getting apartments or jobs.

I've been living in my boyfriend's grandparents house since August and have been working a rather shitty car wash job that only pays $8 and a second FWS job that pays $7.25. I go to school full time time so I have very little free time and don't have a lot of income coming in. I make about $400 a paycheck so about $800 a month.

I am currently driving my BF's car while he is completing his military training in Mississippi, however he gets back in December and I need a car by then because he'll be busy all day at work and I can't ask for rides everywhere.

As to why I'm thinking of dropping out, I'm so busy, tired, and depressed all the time. I work and go to school all day, I stay up till 12/1 am trying to get school work done, and I'm failing a few classes because I don't have any time to properly study for them. I make almost no money and spend it as soon as I get it paying for my living expenses and such. I've lost motivation to go to school because I'm so tired and stressed all the time.

So it's either drop my hours and make a lot less causing me to have to ask people for money or drop out of school. A lot of my scholarships require me to be a full time student so I would lose them if I drop to part time. And I know that if I tell the grandparents and such that I want to drop out they'll tell me that's stupid and to just lessen my hours. Even if I get a better paying job, I'll have to drop my hours to work with my school schedule.

TL;DR thinking of dropping out of school because I make enough money to afford school and living expenses since my mom kicked me out. And I'm just generally tired and depressed all the time.",04Oct2019,1

809,So my mom has always been a hardass when it came to my grades and I just fucked up big time. I got a 75 on my science test and I don’t know how I am supposed to approach telling her this. Things between her and I have been tense lately also because of other stuff at school and I feel like this will make her super mad. It was some really stupid mistakes I made to get the question wrong and she won’t just “understand”. What should I do?,04Oct2019,2

5 years ago my crush liked me and now she’s messaged me on Facebook (I don’t have a pic of me on there) and I’m scared she won’t like me now when she liked me first 5 years ago :/

811,"So about three months ago I broke up with my ex by blocking her and essentially never speaking to her again. I did this because she was hanging out with a guy (who I know likes her) and I got mad. She said that he didn’t like her anymore so it wasn’t a big deal and that she doesn’t want me to try to break up her male friendships. This was all through text, mind you. Anyway, she seemed to forget about it and asked me how was I, being casual and such. I ignored her and just blocked her the next day. The thing is everyone is saying I was too harsh and she deserves a second chance, but I feel like I was justified. Like how would you feel? So yea I just want like a more general consensus.",04Oct2019,6
812,"We’ve been best friends for going on 10 years. We were in the same class together and just clicked. I love her and I want them best for her but she’s becoming toxic. Everyone has bad or qualities we don’t agree with, and hers are pride, and “holier than thou”. Me and her friendship kind of ended a few years ago for a reason unbeknownst to me even to this day. A year after, I noticed she was alone and being abused so I became her friend again. Encouraged her to leave the abusive and cheating husband and now her life is flourishing and I’m so happy for her. I’m always supportive no matter the circumstance. 

Specifics on toxicity, 

1. She doesn’t like my bf and constantly encourages me to break up with him...only when she’s single 

2. Despite knowing I cannot afford anything since constantly invited me to places that are particularly expensive at that. 

3. She enables her sister who is extremely judgmental and problematic. 

4. Extremely prideful and wont admit when she’s wrong.

5. Thinks everyone owes her an apology

6. Guilts me into doing things with her I don’t want to or can’t afford to do

I normally I try to redirect her from these behaviors but as of late, it’s affecting my life negatively.

There are two specific situations in the past week that have really impacted me.

The first, my daughter had her first birthday party to which she attended. There was a girl who went who she hates. Her and her sister, sitting near her, talked crap about her and her bf. So much so, that the girl went home crying. This girl drove 40 minutes just come to the party and left in just 30 minutes. I felt terrible. When confronting my friend and her sister, they denied it.

The second, they invited me to woods of terror. It’s 30 bucks for a ticket and as I said, I have no money. She offered to pay, guilted me into it saying it was her one weekend off and that it’s a girls night and not everybody whose going will have the same day off again, and I made sure she was really okay with paying for me. She said she was. Wednesday, my old boss gave me a $20 (unrelated to my struggles she’s just the best boss in existence). It wasn’t a lot but I offered to give it my best friend for the ticket. She then said they were going out to eat before AND after woods of terror and to save it for that. 

Today, she texted me saying she was shocked that both our tickets was 60 despite telling me at the beginning of the week, one ticket was 30. Hellooo math. She got the tickets anyway and texted me that I was to pay her back when I had the money. 

I don’t even want to go anymore! I haven’t responded because I don’t even know what to say. It’s not that I have to pay, it’s the fact that I don’t have money nor any income, and she basically spent money for me I don’t have. She should not have offered to pay, and then change her mind after purchasing the tickets. 
I have a daughter and I’m genuinely struggling, I cannot afford that 33.50 after tax. I just can’t. I also can’t afford to go out to eat 2 freaking times. Knowing her and her sister, probably expensive places too. 

She’s payed for me in the past and I always get the cheapest option or I’ll just decline and say I’m good and I always say that when I get the chance or if I come into money, I’ll make sure to treat her to food and a pedicure and a shopping spree if I can really afford it.

Does she think since I said someone gave me money, that I lied the whole time, had the money and was trying to get her to pay? If that’s the case, why would she buy the tickets THEN tell me I owe her.

Typing it out it doesn’t feel like a big deal, but for some reason I feel a little betrayed this week. There’s been other situations but this one just feels so manipulative.",04Oct2019,2
