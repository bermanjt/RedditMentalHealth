0,"Hey so I am a member of an 
 organization at my university where I ran for president, and lost. I have a position regardless, which is something I will enjoy doing, but I am utterly heartbroken. 

This year I was given a leadership award for my hours in the organization and helping expand our community outreach footprint. The former president said I did more work than any other board member including herself.

So I ran for president. When I began telling other board members my intentions, friends of the person running against me seemed surprised, but I was confident and wanted to give it a go. 

Last night, following the elections, we were chatting and a current board member made a comment asserting that I would not win/ didn't have a chance. I left the conversation shortly after because I was uncomfortable.  

Today, I told the results and was disappointed. I know I would have been regardless, but the comment from last night just made it hurt more. Then, I was contacted by other members that they would still like a chance to vote. I told them the votes were tallied, and they said they would have voted for me if they could have, which made the loss hurt even more. 

There were only 10 people at the voting meeting out of our normal 24. I have a lot of feelings right now, most negative. And I don't know what to do. I have goals for the position I was elected for, and look forward to the work, but I feel cheated of a chance I had. 

There's basically nothing I can do now (at least that I can think of), but that doesn't make me feel any better. Any advice?",17Apr2019,1
2,"Please be harsh. Give me your reactions, thoughts, criticisms.

 

Joseph Stalin, the former dictator of the Soviet Union, once famously said “The death of one man is a tragedy. The death of millions is a statistic.” That single quote certainly applies to WW1, the most destructive war in human history- for in total, about 16 million human lives were lost over the course of 3 years (Thistle). Every single number, in that statistic of death, is a human with hopes, dreams, and a family. The story thread that will be discussed in this essay is on “Individual vs Statistic”. This thread evolves into becoming a story theme through three stages: the civilian view, the soldiers view, and and the overseers view.

The civilian view is how civilians view the war and how they dehumanize casualties to justify their nationalism. An example of the civilian view is when the civilian headmaster is discussing the ongoing war: “Now shove ahead a bit out there with your everlasting trench warfare- smash through the Johnnies and then there will be peace.” (Remarque 167). The quote shows how the civilian nationalistic ideals dehumanize individuals; this is explained by the fact that the headmaster oversimplifies trench warfare as everlasting, demonstrating the apathy of civilians towards the hellish trenches of WW1, and by oversimplifying WW1 offensives as “smashing” through enemy lines, completely ignoring how many casualties that would cost. Civilians, like the headmaster, only believe in nationalism, not individualism.

The Soldiers view is how soldiers view the war and how they dehumanize themselves. An example of the soldiers view is how Paul describes charging enemy soldiers: The column marches on, straight ahead, the figures resolve themselves into a block, individuals are no longer recognizable, a column, not men at all”. The phrase “a column, not men at all” shows dehumanization by showing that, in Paul's mind, the soldiers are no longer individuals with unique thoughts, they were just a charging mass that needed to be shot. To cope with death and killing, soldiers like Paul dehumanize enemy soldiers as masses of emotionless flesh to make it easier for them to kill.

The overseers view is how the generals and leaders of nations view the war and how they dehumanize civilians and soldiers. An example of the overseers view is when the Paul and the other soldiers are discussing reasons for WW1: “Now just why would a French blacksmith or a French shoemaker want to attack us? No, it is merely the rulers…. every full-grown emperor requires at least one war, otherwise he would not become famous.” (Remarque 205). This quote shows that even though regular civilians on opposing sides of war do not hate each other, opposing leaders push war for their own interests. Leaders of nations use soldiers and civilians as disposable pawns, meant to be thrown away, to pursue wars for the supposed glory. They are too blinded by promises of fame and nationalism that they do not care about casualties or destruction.

This thread of “Individual vs Statistic” evolves into a story theme through three stages: the civilian view, the soldiers view, and and the overseers view. Paul Baumer, the protagonist, first views the war through civilian lens, dehumanizing others for the sake of nationalism, then through the soldiers lens, dehumanizing opposing soldiers to cope with killing , and then finally realizing how wars are created on behalf of rulers by seeing the overseers view. Erich Maria Remarque, the author, is demonstrating that statistics is a type of dehumanization. Remarque shows that people want to dehumanize others to justify war and to cope with knowing how wrong death is.",17Apr2019,1
3,"Kind of a simple one really.

My friend, who I am living with next year, is having a birthday party later this month. Not only was I invited, but I was also asked to DJ.

Today, however, I was asked if I wanted to DJ at a completely different event, a local festival in a different city. Completely forgetting about the party, I said yes.

My memory of the party was only re-jogged moments ago. Now I'm thinking, while it'd be great to DJ at hers, I'd kind of prefer to play at the festival. I'm really keen to branch out into festivals / clubs and am kinda bored of just playing house parties. But then again, I am living with her next year and wonder if it'd be assholish to duck out of being there / providing entertainment for her party in favour of a gig in a different city that I'd accepted after the fact.

I'm trying to work out which decision would cause me the least regret. Would I be the asshole if I just took the gig?",17Apr2019,1
4,"I (18 F) find that I get jealous of my friends whenever they're in relationships and often dont want them to be. I also get very jealous when they mention other friends to me. Whenever my boyfriend hangs out with friends or goes off on his own (he rides his bike in the woods and plays skyrim), I get upset, jealous, and often feel a little abandoned, but I dont say anything and try not to even hint at the fact I'm upset because I know it's a toxic trait. I seem to always be paranoid that my friends hate me or that my boyfriend is cheating on me, despite the fact that my friends frequently reach out to me and my boyfriend is very loving. Overall I feel like I want to control everyone around me, I try my hardest to ignore these feelings but how do I lessen them? It makes me feel like a bad person, which adds to the upset feelings and jealousy I feel already.",17Apr2019,1
6,"Do you know how frustrating it is to live with homophobic and antisemetic parents?

Ever since I was a kid, all I heard was: Gays are bad! They’re going to hell for their sin, Jews are all evil and want to destroy us! Christians are our sworn enemies! I hear this garbage all the time. Not just from my parents, but also the people around me. Back when I was still going to school, 90% of my classmates and students held similar if not the same views. Now that I’m a legal adult, I still hear the same shit.

Whenever I try to argue with my parents, and convince them that what they’re saying is nonsense, you know what they tell me? I’m to young to understand or lecture them. That I don’t know what I’m saying. In the end I turn out to be the asshole, because how dare I call Homophobia, Antisemetics and all that petty nonsense. Maybe It wouldn’t bother me so much, If I didn’t have to hear stuff like this every day. Perhaps, not from them always, but most of the people around me. I have none to talk to. When I try to talk to my parents about these serious topics, they just ignore me or stubbornly push their idiotic propaganda. I try to use logic and common reason, but they just dismiss it. And call me: ‘’An Immature child, that has no idea how the world works’’.

What should I do? I know that I can’t really change their minds, but I also can’t really just hold my tongue when they say shit like that. If I’m not gonna stand up to them, who will?",17Apr2019,1
7,"Basically... I was pretty dumb. My friend started doing acrylics, and since I had never had them before I decided I'd go to her. Since she's still training, they looked nice and weren't amazing or anything, I would have definitely kept them on if they were shorter! When she asked me what length I wanted, the length she showed me looked great, but once I got home I realised they totally weren't practical and made me not be able to do so much since it was my first time.

&amp;#x200B;

I watched some Youtube videos about how to take them off, tried them and... nope. I cut them down, tried again and... nothing. I have no clue how to take these things off they look horrible since I cut them. What should I do?

8,"Bit of a long post, sorry! 

Hi, I’m A, and I don’t know where else to turn. I don’t know how to talk to my therapist about this, and a post is pretty much the only way that I can collect my thoughts. 

Before I go on, I think it’s worth it to note that I have bad anxiety, issues with depression, and really struggle with self-esteem. I always put others’ happiness above my own, and am so dangerously, irrationally empathetic that I’m an emotional sponge. And I need constant external motivation and validation to do anything. 

It seems that all of my relationships end horribly. Arguing, tears, just general toxicity. I’ve only been in three serious relationships, and two of those were exclusively online. One was a polyamorous group, which, I think, ended the worst of them all. The last breakup I had, my partner told me they don’t even want to talk to me anymore (to make a long story short on that one - this was over Instagram. We were both part of a roleplay community, and I’d been roleplaying with other accounts that played the same character), and then told me that they had to go, but would reply to me later. I said ‘don’t bother. I know you don’t want to.’ 

Now, I’m really impulsive when I type, so it didn’t strike me at the time how that sounded. When they got back, they said that they don’t like being guilt tripped, and that I’m ALWAYS like that. It didn’t strike me as being emotionally manipulative until it was pointed out. Then, I realized that I frequently resort to the guilt trip if I’m scared that someone will leave me, or even when I’m just really hurt. I don’t know why. Maybe it’s because of the sort of detached way I was raised, or my need for external validation. 

But I recognize that this is a toxic behavior, and I don’t want to be a toxic person. Do you all have any advice?",17Apr2019,2

16,"Hi. This is kind of hard for me to speak about, but I’m anonymous. So let’s begin.

I used to go to high school with a girl that I know. We didn’t really talk or hangout, but I had a crush on her. A couple of months ago she messaged me out of the blue, and wanted to hangout. So reluctantly, I agreed. Everything went good, and we had a really good relationship. I’d always make her laugh and listened when she needed someone to talk too. And a couple of weeks ago, she said she liked me. I was really excited, and told her I liked her back. Now, after this things got fun. We were talking on the phone every night, and overall led to having a good connection. Then, we were talking one day, and she said, “Well if you like me, then you’d ask me to be your girlfriend”. And I was really happy. So I immediately asked her to be my girlfriend, and she acted weird.., but I brushed it off. I knew She said she was in a relationship before where she still is hurt, and she doesn’t know how to recover. And that just showed me she didn’t want to rush into anything. I told her I’d be there for anything if she ever needed anyone to talk too (mind you we’ve already talked about a lot of things), and then everything was good. But a couple days after, she ended up flirting, and we ended up sexting. She sent me pictures and vice versa, and a couple days after we phone sexted. We both enjoyed it, and we slept. Next afternoon, I asked her if she wanted to talk about anything, she can come to me if she wants (and I reluctantly said “we can talk about anything, but we can also sex talk”. Then she just said she didn’t want a relationship again. You know I can kind of get not wanting one when you’re still hurt over your ex, but why the phone sexting? I don’t believe she’s playing with my feelings, but I told her that phone sexting meant something to me, and she just threw my heart away. If she didn’t want to have a relationship, then why message me to phone sex, and flirt with me before the “If you liked me, then why don’t you ask me to be your girlfriend” question got brought up? I don’t know. I fell in love and now I’m literally being fucked in the ass. Shit hurts. I literally can’t sleep at night because I keep thinking about her, about what we could’ve been.

19,"I got hired by a hotel to help with renovations, the job started as a simple odd job, I was only helping for a couple of days to help unload new furniture from Trucks for a bit of cash but things changed when they asked If I could fill out an application if I wanted a job. I did fill out an application and have become one of their employees. I noticed things were sketchy when they had me work on the clock for the first half of the week and then they would pay me in cash the rest of the week. My job of unloading furniture eventually evolved into helping with demolition, I was expecting to get a maitnence position with the buisness when I filled out my application, instead ive been working demolition with a 10 dollar per hour salary that is the maitnence position salary.
 Ive not only been working demolition for cheap but ive been doing it alone, ive been promised that id be working with other people but the fulltime maitnence employees barely ever help and only the hotel mananger (who is the person that hired me) and his family has helped me with the demolition a couple of days. I like the manager he is hands on and has been very understanding with schedule when I cant make it. But I feel I am being taken advantage of, doing hard work and being underpaid. The Manager who hired me is not the owner of the hotel and I have a feeling that when he pays me in cash he is paying me out of his own pocket. Im in a difficult spot here because I am backed up in bills even though my pay is not what it should, I still desperately need that money and cant afford a job search at the moment or else I can risk being homeless.
The Owner of the hotel clearly wants this work done for cheaper than it should be. I also fear if I ask for better compensation theyll just pick up some other idiot for the same price im currently working for. I thought I was going to get a full time maitnence position but I havent, They even left me without work for a couple of weeks when they were transitioning to the next rooms they were going to demolish and only called me in for work when there was more demolition to do. 
I know Im being underpaid and taken advantage of Im also afraid theres no work for me once the demolition is over and they will just leave me out to dry like they did those two weeks. I feel like a damn fool for having agreed to help with the demolition, hoping it would get me a fulltime position in hotel maitnence. I dont know how to have this conversation with the hotel manager whos paying me, sometimes it feels like my only solution is to suck it up and keep looking for a better job while I bust my ass for that hotel because I really do need the money right now, I feel trapped man.",17Apr2019,1

So on Friday night, when I was working, I get a text message from this guy that I haven't talked to in a while. He said, ""Ayeee bro."" I left him on read because I was at work. He immediately saw that I left him on read and said ""How's it going?"" On my break, I responded with a simple ""Hey man. What's up?"" He says nothing much and then says ""I heard you were having a party."" I was having a graduation party the next day where only a few friends and family got invited. I responded by saying ""Oh yeah only a couple of people are invited."" He responds immediately ""ok ok"" and I said ""yeah.""

The next day, it was my graduation party. Everything was fun and normal, but then I glanced at one of my friend's phone and the guy who texted me the night before was on my friend's Snapchat. I asked her how she knew him and she said, ""I don't. He added me this morning and started asking me where I was 5 minutes ago."" Later at the party, I told my other friends about this and some of them said that it happened to them too. I felt eery after I received a text from the guy asking what I was doing. I just said ""chilling.""

Quick flashback. In middle school I used to play soccer with this guy. He wasn't good at it, so I would help him out after school and teach him some tricks and stuff. He suddenly got attached to me a bit, but honestly I didn't care. He would follow me around during practice but not like a creepy following around, just like a puppy kind of following around. You know what I mean? Anyway, after I went on to high school, I didn't see him again. That was until my junior year when someone came from behind me in the hallway and out their arm around me in a friendly way and asked, ""what's up?"" We had a short conversation, but that was it. 

I asked one of my friends if he knew him and he said yes so I told him about the whole situation. He said that he was different. I wasn't sure what he meant by that so I asked, ""what do you mean?"" He said, ""he just does that."" I'm still confused and feel a bit uncomfortable. The guy texted me a day ago asking if I wanted to hang out with him and I told him I couldn't.",17Apr2019,2

38,"Hello community, I’m afraid I’m rather new to reddit as a while so I ask that you bear with me through any newbie mistake I make on this subreddit. 

Anyways on to my issue. Currently I Georgia resident who is currently considering two colleges, Georgia Tech(GT) and Samford University(SU). I am currently looking at entering the business school at either college. For those who don’t know anything about the two schools I’d like to explain a bit more about why I’m considering both as they are really polar opposites of each other. GT is definitely more well known as it has a national reputation. In addition to that, I love having the opportunity both recreationally and career wise that come with being in a big city like Atlanta. GT is a technical institution so obviously the education is more STEM based and as a person who has struggled with math for the longest time, it’s a bit intimidating to consider going there. However I will point out that I’ve recently started to develop a love of science, something that was inspired by my current chemistry professor. To summarize for GT, I love the opportunities I would have if I go there, but the high level of rigor and focus on STEM courses are rather intimidating and I’m not sure I’ll be able to stack up. 
Now for SU, it is the opposite in many ways. While it is not nationally known like GT, it is considered the #1 university in Alabama (yes lol Alabama haha). It is a liberal arts college which is quite frankly where my skills lie. However recently I’ve been a bit unsure of if I want to just continue with language arts based stuff as I’m starting to want more tangible skills/maybe a career. Now that said, I love the campus there it is absolutely gorgeous, the people are super nice and the professor are all very invested in their students. One thing that has really been great about SU is that all the professor, administrators, and students, genuinely care about you as a person which is something that I think is pretty rare. 

So all that said, thank you to anyone who bothered to read all about my dilemma. I’d appreciate any advice anyone whether it’s just general advice, advice from someone who knows about the school, or even current students if you manage to find this thread. So thank you again and I look foreword to discussing this with you all.",17Apr2019,1
39,"I (19M) live with my mom and her boyfriend. There’s two pets in the house, but the one that’s causing concern is my 15-year-old German Shepherd Husky mix, Banjo.

We’ve had Banjo since I was five years old, and he’s been an essential to my life. Recently he developed hip displaysia and he’s struggling to stand / support himself on longer walks or sometimes when he stands after a rest. Mom and I have been thinking about putting him down as he had a really bad episode the other night on a walkwhere we had to roll his big ass onto a rug and drag him down the sidewalk all the way back to our place because he couldn’t stand up.

(Other symptoms include: Bumps on body, skin-bump on snout, floor licking, bloating, gas issues)

The talk of putting him down makes my mom and I sad, but we know that at some point it’s necessary before he gets into absurd pain or suffering. We have reason to believe he’s already in significant pain, as he keeps licking the floor and he seems to refrain from general activity unless it has to do with going to the bathroom.

Her boyfriend gets disgusted with the idea. He very much believes we should get him checked out and at least try to get some medicine / treatment. I agree with this sentiment for the most part, but he’s mainly suggesting this because he is religiously against the idea of euthanasia and would rather we pay out the wazoo for meds/treatments than relieve him of his suffering. (We’re fairly broke and already are going to have to lend money just to be able to put him down, let alone the mobile vet coming).

He keeps guilt tripping her and they keep arguing about it. Mom’s in a weird position because if she does put him down, then she’ll never hear the end of it from him and he’s going to make her feel guilty. If she doesn’t put him down, then he stays in his current condition and things get worse. I walked in on her almost crying while making dinner, and I feel like I’m stuck in the middle here.

As for the controversial topic of euthanasia, I feel indifferent. On one end I want him to pass peacefully before he’s worse, but on one end I want him to be able to live. It’s.. hard. And I’m stuck between them.

I want to talk to her boyfriend and ask him to maybe support her/our decision, or maybe help if he wants him to get medicine. I don’t know",17Apr2019,2

And all the memories were still there, in my head. I haven’t even seen her in years, it’s been over for years.. and logically I know that those memories were all things that really happened, but, it just doesn’t feel like it. That wasn’t me. I’m just in the body that remembers it. 

And then I looked at a picture from prom, just this last weekend. It was fun, my memory knows that. And I have all these friends, a loving SO, even something of a family. I have memories of them too, from over the past few years. But I feel like an imposter. I live moment to moment and interact as needed, but they all love who they think I am. They can’t see what’s really in my head, they don’t know me at all. Not even my SO.. even though I’ve told them everything I could think to tell them, I just feel so disconnected.

All of this is getting to me. The cloud of confusion that blinds my day to day life, the mixed-up memories and constant lack of focus. Lack of motivation, feeling, desire to live even. I just want to feel real.

45,"Basically, I was walking my dog in my neighborhood apartment complex thing, and there was this guy slowly approaching me. I didn't think too much of it at first. But he would stop and start moving forward again. Stop and go again. Inching towards me. 

It is now worth mentioning that I have severe PTSD. My dog is my service dog in training. Men scare me. I'm ridiculously paranoid. I don't like men coming close. I think everyone is following me. I've been doing better with is, because I know I'm mistaken most of the time. 

This dude stops me and my dog. He says something along the lines of ""Hey, I just wanted to say you're cute. I'm new around here."" (God, now I'm just thinking of John Mulaney's new in town thing.) There's really nothing harmful in that. My predisposition to be uncomfortable and my PTSD does not mean he had any sort of malicious intent. I understand that. 

He basically goes on to keep talking to me, even though I'm trying to go. I'm uncomfortable, I'm shaking, I'm starting to stutter. My dog is doing a cover and being a good good boy. Guy asks, ""What excuse can I have to see you?"" I say I don't know, nervously, shakily. He says that doesn't help him at all. 

Another dog comes out of nowhere. The owner, a rather intimidating man, is now slowly coming towards me. I feel trapped. The owner won't get his dog. I can barely ask him to get his dog to leave mine alone. I keep telling the first dude that I need to go, I have to go home now, I need to go. The second dude finally gets his dog, and I'm walking quickly away, because I am breaking down. 

The first dude follows me. He's following me, saying I was giving him my number. I was doing no such thing. But I thought he would keep following me unless I gave it to him, so I stupidly did. I finally sped away, crying and heaving, my dog thankfully pulling me back home.

Then a third guy in a Jeep stops by me. I'm a fucking mess now. And he asks if that first dude was bothering me. He said his girlfriend had called him and that first dude had stopped her, too. I stupidly said no, I have a problem with men, and I need to go home. He said okay and drove off. 

Finally made it home, cried a lot, took a couple of puffs of my inhaler. Dog was concerned. Boyfriend was also concerned. 

As I was breaking down, the first dude texted me. ""[His name]. Save the number."" 

My question now is should I respond? Should I just ignore him? Should I block him? Should I tell him how he made me feel? Should I just send a weird meme? Should I say I'm gay? 

What now? I kinda wanna let him know like ""Hey, I was freaking out. Please don't follow people."" especially since he stopped that other girl and made me cry. 

Again, I know it wasn't intended to be malicious, but it was still harmful. So ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I could also totally be overreacting, but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",17Apr2019,2
46,"I was friends with a guy I go to school with. I abruptly ended the friendship a while ago, and I just found out today that he led a group of our classmates to believe that the friendship ended because I came onto him and he rejected me. The truth for why I ended the friendship is twofold. One, I have severe social anxiety, and he was very bad for my mental health. Two, I am friends with his girlfriend, and he was inappropriately flirting with me. I wanted nothing more than friendship. I wanted to feel included in the group of our classmates, and he made me feel like I was included with everyone else, which helped with my social anxiety, as feeling excluded is a major trigger for me. Just before I ended the friendship, he was very insensitive to my social anxiety and triggered an episode for me, which was the catalyst to me cutting him off. He never approached me or contacted me to ask what happened with our friendship. He also didn't bother to ask if I was okay, which I clearly wasn't, as the episode I was in brought me to the brink of suicide. He simply didn't care. I thought that was all it was, but I found out today that not only did he not care that I wasn't okay, he also talked about me behind my back to our classmates purely to make me look like the bad guy. 

It really bothers me to know that our group of classmates now think that I am a pathetic and desperate loser who was pining after my friend's boyfriend when that is simply not the case. I am worried now that everyone thinks I am a pathetic loser and a terrible friend. 

I do not know what I should do about what he led everyone to believe. While–at least to my knowledge–he did not *outright* tell anyone that I came onto him and that he rejected me, he led people to believe that was the case and did not deny it when someone asked. I also do not know if I should tell my friend (his girlfriend) that he acted inappropriately toward me. My other friend says I should, but I do not want to hurt his girlfriend, even if I think she deserves a guy who will treat her with the respect she deserves, and I am worried she will believe him over me or that he will just refute everything I say to her as a lie.

50,"I'm basically nocturnal. 

On a good day I'll go to bed around 5am, although currently it's been around 9am, during really bad phases I've gone days without sleep. 

I can't remember a time since school when I went to bed at a normal time routinely - sometimes with early starts at work or with new partners I'd sleep at normal times, but when left to my own devices I can't maintain a normal sleep routine. I've even spent time abroad in a different time zone, which should have meant I'd sleep/wake at normal times...yet still found I slipped back into my old habits of not sleeping until 3-5am. 

I don't have problems actually getting to sleep - although sure if I'm used to going to bed at 5am and try to sleep at midnight I'd struggle - the problem is purely with maintaining routine. 

Sleep hygiene tips like 'avoid your smartphone before bed' don't work. When I try to say 'I'll go to bed at X time tonight' I not only fail but find I get anxious when the time comes, I end up getting distracted...then distracted some more. I'm like a little kid trying to avoid going to bed.

Of course sorting out my sleep pattern will mean early starts, making things like day trips easier during the summer, but changing my sleep routine also means changing my entire routine.

eg. In my current 'routine' I may not get on my laptop until 11pm, and stay on for 7 hours. While if I sleep/wake earlier I'd still not be going on my laptop until 11pm and then I'd only be getting a few hours on my laptop. See what I mean? 

I'm just not sure how I'm supposed to change.",17Apr2019,7
51,"Sorry for the long post, Tl;Dr at bottom

I would love other peoples thoughts on this: I work as a manager in a certain brick and mortar store chain. They offer a rewards services, somewhat similar to speedway gas stations: you earn coupons when you purchase items that you can use for services. Its relatively harmless, no spam emails, etc. It is free to sign up, I need to emphasize that there is no negative consequences whether customers sign up or not.

We are being tracked in each department. How many rewards signups you do. My department has been expected to sign up 7 new people each day. My department does a majority or regular traffic. We don't talk to many new people, and the ones we do talk to generally aren't interested. 

Today we had a conference call, where all of our chains department heads discuss things. Our district manager decided to pop in, which is unusual. He ripped into us for underperforming, and made this statement:

""From now on, here is what you do. Since you have to get the customer's information anyway (true), you say, 'I have taken the liberty of signing you up for our rewards program.' If anyone has any problems doing that, talk to me, and I will happily explain to you why you will be doing that."" He did go on to explain that if the customer gets upset, to not sign them up, but we basically have to go through with it until they say no.

Now never mind his thinly veiled threat, because I'm taking that over his head already, my concern is that it feels to me to be wildly unethical to just sign people up without explicit consent. I want to talk to HR about it, and frankly, I'm restarting my job search, which sucks because I've only been there a month, and I know that will look horrid on my resume.

Tl;Dr: a higher up in my company told us to basically sign people up for a rewards program against their will. I'm thinking about talking to HR and quitting. What do?",17Apr2019,2

When she told me that I thought it was really weird. I let it go. She purposefully became less talkative around him because it kinda creeped her out.

Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

Posted this in r/relationship_advice but am still looking for a lil more adice 

I just want a little bit of advice. I love my fiance, he's absolutely amazing and we have everything going for us. We absolutely adore each other and always try to make each other feel better. We support eachother through everything and we truly do have each others back. I'm very supportive and hands on, I like to be there for him and support him in every way possible as he does to me.

When hes not feeling great (either mentally and/or physically), I sometimes don't take it well. He will out of nowhere become super distant and quiet when hes usually loud, bubbly and funny. He will sometimes have a short fuse and will escalate things out of nowhere. Sometimes he also will say hurtful things (not meaning it) but wont have empathy when I get upset and am hurt.

I snapped last night because of it and I regretted it instantly. I know he hasnt been alright mentally; feeling a little out of sorts, and yet I got really narky and snapped at him. I was pretty overtired and really just wanted to be close to him - but I ended up chucking a huge tantrum and really showed my age. I'm a little embarrassed.

He asked me to be patient and understand that he's just feeling out of sorts, and now I feel like the biggest dick in the world.

I guess what I'm asking is, how do I go about being a bit more understanding when hes feeling out of sorts and says things he doesnt mean?

Thanks in advance and sorry if this doesnt make sense.

PS - I feel like this makes me sound like a horrible person. I dont mean to be so I hope this doesnt portray me in a bad light.",17Apr2019,1
60,"Bit of backstory: I (M19) have been planning a trip to the US for a couple years now after visiting some years prior. My tourist visa is still up so all I had to do was arranging the plane tickets, as I already had a place to stay due to my godmother living there. I also have wanted to go through the legal process of immigrating into the US for several years for two main reasons: 1. I grew up being very overprotected, and through therapy (2010-present) reached a point where I could be confident enough to free myself from that, but not fully. Putting some serious distance did the trick before but the effects were reversed as soon as I came back. 2. I am most familiar with U.S. culture and history out of any other country, and as such I felt very much at home when I was there years ago. I should point out that trip years ago was technically a vacation, but much of the experience was living in a suburban home and kinda just being there. No cruise ships or crazy tourist attractions or the like

&amp;#x200B;

I was going to be staying at her house with her husband of... several years (I was definitely too young when she divorced my godfather and married her new husband). The plane tickets were expensive but I was able to save up enough money before leaving, and I'd get a small income from my parents to be able to afford food and basic needs. So in March I scheduled my flights to be leaving for the US in June and returning home in November, a 5 month trip with the idea of having a solid experience of living there on a pretty small budget but with a safety net (Living in a relative's house, she could easily afford to feed me for a few months if some kind of tragedy happened that my parents couldn't afford it). I would spend those 5 months working on myself, by myself, without interference from my toxic family, to then return home and be able to make a good decision on what I want for my future. Things like meeting new people, getting in shape, learning everything I could and trying to manage on my own. I am young and could afford it so I decided not to waste any time getting that plan started.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today, I've been sick for a week. When I thought I was getting out of it, it seems my defenses were low enough that I caught something else. Needless to say I have been pretty miserable and low on energy, but still very much positive and looking forward to the trip in a few months. However this morning I learned my godmother is getting a divorce. It's most likely she will have to move out to her daughter's house which can only really accommodate her. It would not be right for me to even suggest staying there because I know it's not something they could do without compromising some things. This leaves me with a 5 month trip with (almost certainly) no place to stay unless I can somehow afford to pay for a room or something. That's basically a no-go, which means I'm probably not going to travel, and just lose the money I spent on the tickets. Not to mention I have nothing to do where I'm at. My only idea of what I can do if I don't travel is getting a minimum wage job and grinding that until I can afford to travel again. It might take some time but it'd be the most efficient course of action I believe. I'm heartbroken however. I've been saving the money for the tickets for 4 years. I have only paid the first month of it. I haven't had the energy to call up and see if it can be refunded, rescheduled or what my options are, but truly I also don't have the emotional energy to hear a ""There's nothing that can be done"" from the other side of the phone. So here I am, stuck. I'm sick, I've got no support from anyone in my family, I'm probably the person who is doing better among my friends so it would be a dick move to come to them with my problems, and even my therapist is on vacation so I don't have access to that.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the facts, though.

• I know this is not life-threatening. My parents have jobs, I would still be able to have the same life I have right now. It'd be more of a plateau than a nosedive

• I know there is a chance I will be able to stay at the house my godmother is currently living in - I don't have the details but it's likely a tiny chance. Still a chance

• I don't know how hard it is going to hit me mentally if this plan goes towards its worst case scenario. I've wanted this for so long, that seeing it disappear almost as soon as I reach it, it's killing me inside

• If I can reschedule the flights, I could either make the 5 month trip later on, giving me time to save up more money, or make it shorter, making it easier to afford lodging. Making it shorter is not my favorite idea though. But it's better than not going, because I REALLY need at least some time for myself.

• It hasn't yet hit me that my godmother's getting a divorce. I mean, I know the news, I just haven't felt that unavoidable emotional pain that comes with it. I don't know how much it will affect me, as I really did like her husband, he seemed like a great, chill guy.

&amp;#x200B;

 I suppose based on what I say it sounds like I have things pretty much under control. I'm just not sure how to explain it though. It's been my long term goal since the last time I was there. Life has had its downs but this was always my big up that was about to come, and now it feels like it's about to tell me to eat dirt. I expect family to start going with their ""I told you so"" speeches once they start to find out. I'm in a position right now where I can't do anything but wait. I can't bring myself to call in and see if something can be done about the flights, but that's the least of my worries. It's money. People lose money sometimes and it's a big hit. But they recover. It's just that they normally recover thanks to the help of their closest people, and I definitely don't have that help.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what kind of advice I am asking for, perhaps I just needed to get this off my chest before the tsunami hits.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 18 Y.O Male who's been going through a tough time. My freshmen year of high school was good, sophomore was amazing, junior was ok, this year is terrible. I've lost all of my friends, or at least people who I thought were my friends. We used to hang out all the time and I would be invited to things, but then learned they didn't actually like me and talked a lot about me and just overall hated me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a girlfriend, but if I'm honest I'm unhappy with her sexually. She's a sweet, honest, amazing girl, but we haven't done things for about 4 months now. Most people would tell me dating shouldn't be about sex, and it isn't, but it's something that I need every once in a while. Last summer I cheated on her. I kissed two girls during a party, and I'm not going to sit here and say how sorry you guys should feel for me about this. This was my fault. No one knows about this except my old best friend, and you guys. People tell me to just break up with her, some people tell me to not let it get to me and it's just me overthinking sex.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to have a best friend, we were close. We could talk about musicals all day, I literally trusted her with everything. Then we got into an argument, I tried to apologize and get her to be friend again but it didn't work out. She despises me and she literally hates me now, and she tells everyone how much of a bad friend I am and all the ""bad things"" I did (Such as talking about others). Leaving out all the good things we both did, or that she was also talking about others to me. So ultimately everyone sees me as the bad guy because she's only telling what she wants to tell. I haven't said a single bad thing about her to anyone and it just feels like the whole friendship was bs.

&amp;#x200B;

I got rejected for a musical theater major in the college I wanted. I'm going to still go there for normal theater, but it isn't particularly what I wanted. I feel that I lack a lot of skills for singing, and I keep trying to improve but I still feel awful at it. I have a vocal coach, but she doesn't help for my life. I'm binded by a contract with her though until the middle of summer. It's draining my money, my confidence in singing, and just overall it upsets me. I'm currently in a production for into the woods playing the role of Jack, but I feel so alone there. I only talk to a few people there, and I just honestly don't know how to socialize with others without making it awkward. I don't know what to say or questions to ask or conversations to bring up. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like none of my friends enjoying hanging out with me mainly because how quiet/awkward I usually am. A majority of my ""friends"" at school hate me due to either them just despising me or because of what my old best friend said. My other friends from shows I've done invite me to hang out and stuff but even then I feel happy for those few hours until I leave, and after it's back to being alone and sad.

&amp;#x200B;

My relationship with my parents are the greatest, due to my busy schedule with working 8 AM-4 PM, going to rehearsal 6:30PM - 9:30PM, and them working or being extremely busy by the time I get home. Most of our conversations are arguments, and they don't know most of my problems because I've never really talked to them about these kind of things. 

&amp;#x200B;

Speaking of work, I completely hate my job. I received it being told it was an IT job, but it's nothing of the sort. I use power tools, bend pipes, cut pipes, use grinders and sanders, and do everything I wasn't taught to do. I was taught to use a computer, build computers, and program. Not do machining. But ok, that isn't that the big problem. They treat me horribly there, any small mistake I do I will get a lecture about it, and they will throw a scene over. But recently, I noticed my mentor forgot to do something on one of our orders, and when I told the response I got was ""mistakes happen, we can't do anything now"". They treat me terribly because I'm not full time, and blame me for everything. The environment there is also extremely toxic and stressful, with no one there except me knowing how to control there anger. If one of them is upset, the whole shop gets upset because they take it out on each other. I usually just stay quiet.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm here. Almost no friends. Issues with my girlfriend (non-existent sex life). My old best friend completely hates me and tells everyone how bad of a person I am, so they hate me as well. My dreams for pursuing a Musical Theater major have been shut down for at least the first year, and my vocal teacher isn't really teaching me anything.  Due to this, it's making me feel like I'll never be able to pursue a career in music. When I do get invited to hang out with friends, It's fun for those hours, but after it's back to being sad and alone. Sometimes even with them it just feels like they want me gone. My job completely makes me feel like garbage and it is nothing close to what I want to do for a future.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess what I'm asking is what do I do. How should I handle this. What are your thoughts on how I should handle some/all of these problems. If anything, I'm just glad I got to get this off my chest. I' have no one else to tell this too and even just typing this feels like I've taken some weight off my shoulders.

I'm so confused in my life and I don't understand what I'm doing or have or anything really. My whole life I've been introverted, but I've always been able to make friends. I have a great group of close friends who I have an incredible bond with. I also have a girlfriend of 5 months. I have great relationships with my family. I've always been told I was a really nice kid.

What really bothers me and just fills me with disappointment and so many other emotions is when people tell me to talk more or stuff around those lines. I can converse fantastically with my friends, girlfriend, and mom, but for whatever god-forsaken reason I can't talk to my dad well, or my grandparents or literally anyone else for that matter. I guess I just don't know how to talk. My girlfriend says I don't know how to talk to girls, and tells me I don't know how to have a girlfriend (this is my first relationship and is very true, im trying my best). Before this relationship, people assumed I was gay or asexual, I only found out after I started dating her. This filled me with rage since people don't know who I am, and my best friends don't even understand me apperantly. 

Also, we had a dance today at school and I was having a great time with my girlfriend, but I couldn't bring myself to dance. It was fun and all, but I physically or mentally could not do it. I believe this mad her pretty sad and I'm beyond disappointed in myself for disappointing her but I just cannot be that person you know.

74,"So I will try to be brief and clear about what happened here. So I am a long haired male who wears his hair in a loose bun sort of thing on my head. I don't style my hair for fashion. I grow it out and then donate it for people with cancer. The only part that is relevant here is that I have long hair. Also I am studying to be in a computer related field. 

Well we were doing an install today, mine was taking a while and he started up an install on the screen for people to see him do it. Then he starts friendly joking about his going faster, whats wrong with mine etc. No big deal, I usually get along with this instructor and can have a friendly joke or two with him. Never anything personal, until today.

Well it continued, I made a couple comments about how the hardware is the problem, we should get better computers here etc. Well the next time he said his was nearly done, I just mentioned to a few people around me that ""my kid always does this, says I win I win, but you never knew it was a race to begin with"". Well he sort of walked away for a minute then came back, saw mine again and mentioned it being slow, then he proceeded to say ""Its because I'm more handsome than you, Its slow because you have a ponytail"". Mind you this was in front of the entire class, people laughing at his comment, I was not really laughing at this point as I had been before.

So besides it just being a strange ass comment to make, I just found it kind of offensive. I don't appreciate comments about peoples appearances, nor do I think its fair to judge anyone just based on how they look. I came to college to learn and get a degree, not be made fun of by the instructors... Am I crazy? Am I being overly sensitive? Not sure what the best approach is here. I could just confront him directly about it, but who knows how he reacts or if he cares. Did I provoke this by saying the thing about my kid?

77,"TL;DR: my manager made me feel guilty about leaving home early after throwing up. I ended up at urgent care with a fever and stomach flu. I’ve been shitting for two days. Give me a break. 

I haven’t been feeling good the past couple of days but it wasn’t really anything I thought I would need time off from work. Over the weekend I started to feel what I thought was bad allergies. Yesterday when I went to work I was sneezing a lot, had a really bad headache for most of the day, and didn’t really feel so good. I eat pretty healthy and I work out, so I honestly thought nothing of it yesterday. (However I have felt pretty sick over the past three months related to an issue I have during menstruation). This morning I woke up, didn’t feel too good but got ready for work. I purchased DayQuil and pepto to help with whatever it may be that I was feeling. 4 hours into my shift I am burning up and run to the bathroom to throw up. I already had multiple bowel movements in the past couple of days so my radar is like “bitch you’re getting sick”. I let a “manager” know. I quote that because they’re not really a manager, they’re kind of like a supervisor but they’re not. I see she texts my managers in a group chat that I wanted to leave. No other explanation. At this point I’m feeling extremely light headed, I can feel as though I’m about to pass out and in desperate need of water. It was hot in my work area (to me at least). This “manager” tells me okay you can go but your manager (actual manager) wants to see you before you leave. I’ve never had this issue before that I have to walk all the way down to the office before leaving sick. I explain well I don’t feel so good for that walk??? But whatever I do it. 

Basically the conversation went along the lines that I’m always sick. That I always leave home early and that even though I’m in the union and we can leave after two hours, I can still be written up for leaving “multiple” times. Our company is going through renovations and going home early had been an option for many of us. I did a couple of times to help my department save money and hours. I explained that to them. Health related issues in Jan/February I did have to leave because the medics at my job recommended that I did. (Low blood pressure/heart rate) etc., she told me she believes that I’m not able to manage 5 days a week as a full timer and that I should go down to 4. She told me to think about this because a busy time of year is coming up for us (hospitality industry) and that I need to be there. Yes, as any job employees need to be responsible. I have to be responsible. But life happens to us and some of us get sick. I explained that to her and I was given attitude. I truly did not like the way she talked to me and I felt myself get emotional. I told her that it wasn’t fair to be guilt tripped for leaving early after I threw up because that’s what she did. She made me go to her office, explain a write up, tell me it’s okay to leave, think about my schedule, but that now she has to “scramble” to cover a break for someone. That I’m leaving my fellow associate alone for 8 hours when I literally work 8 hours by myself the majority of the time. She turned her back to me after I told her that how she was talking to me was rude and unfair because she would rather me be stuck working sick and commenting that I’m always sick. I told her it wasn’t right to make me feel bad about leaving home sick. I explained to the other “manager” who walked by and had tears running down my face that I was going to go to HR because I didn’t feel that it was right. I explained I’m sick I’m not leaving because I’m bored or tired. I’m leaving because I threw up and I won’t do this in front of my guest. 

Basically I went to HR and they’re not much help they just said make an appointment and we can discuss this. I basically told the head of HR that I just felt like I was guilt tripped and if there was something I could do to cover my ass because I do not want to lose my job. She suggested I fill out an FMLA form but my condition doesn’t fall under it. 

I went to urgent care immediately and was told I have a fever. Had some shit shoved up my nose, test ran, etc., the doctor ruled a stomach flu but also believes that if my fever gets any higher and I feel more pain in my stomach it could be my gallbladder. Basically I’m sick and I’m getting medicated. 

I guess I’m here because of how I left things with my manager. I contacted the union and explained my situation to them after HR and they weren’t too happy. I don’t want to get this manager in trouble but I really felt like it wasn’t the time for her to tell me what she said in the manner that she did. Imagine if I would of thrown up in her office ? Fainted ? Shitted myself ? Because I have diarrhea. I just didn’t understand how insensitive she was being and I get that managers have to be strong characters and not be emotional in their decision making or when they’re reprimanding their employees but I did what any person would do. And that was leave work. After asking if I could. It being approved. 

I don’t know if I should talk to her when I return to work in a couple of days. I want to apologize for arguing but more importantly because I know she’s just telling me what she has to say. However, i do feel guilt tripped. Is that wrong of me to feel this way? Should I just talk to her and see if she can understand where I’m coming from ?

81,"TL;DR: Friend of almost 20 years is in prison for child pornography and I only just learned why. How can I remain their friend?

*Serious answers only, please. I've changed the names, dates and locations on this message and my account is a throwaway.* 

Back in the very early 2000s I befriended a great guy, whom we'll call Simon. We met online in the (relatively) early days of the internet as we had a lot of in common. In fact, having the same interests was exactly how we got talking and joking on the same forum for particular types of vehicles. The private messages on the forum progressed to emails and then messaging on ICQ, and calls on Skype.

We were just about the same age and both enjoyed the same sorts of car modifications and shared our vehicle mods, while making heaps of jokes about each other's lives and states. Just two regular teenage guys mocking each other for fun. As we moved around the country and changed jobs and met women, we kept in touch. I mean, let's be honest, for many guys, real friends aren't easy to come by in this online age and we had so much in common.

Recently he confided in me that he was undergoing serious legal trouble and declined to say what it was about. Knowing his character, I assumed it would all be sorted out quickly, although I was concerned. Simon sent me pictures of his home, his wife and daughter. It looked like an idyllic family. I wished him the best, and told him to stay positive.

Months progress and I hadn't heard from him, so I emailed him. Days later, his wife responded that he was presently incarcerated in a federal prison and declined to say why. She would prefer that he talked to me in his own words. This shocked me, and I assumed he must have hit someone with his car or perhaps he defrauded someone. I thought the worst, but I knew Simon's character. She asked if I wanted to email him, to which I naturally said, ""Yes, of course.""

Prison email is monitored, and Simon was coy about sharing specific details of his situation, and what he did tell me was intentionally vague. I put that down to the monitoring of our conversations and that his case must be complicated. I tried to be supportive and hoped that whatever it is can be sorted out and that you can go home to be with your daughter and wife soon and just get back to work. He was still the same upbeat man, and our emails continued in a friendly, upbeat manner for some months, via the ""Corrlinks"" correctional email service. 

All that changed about three hours ago and it's been occupying my mind to the point I began to write this, which is becoming much longer than I thought. Anyway, I was explaining to my wife the latest email I sent to Simon this morning, wishing him the best. I wondered about posting him some photos of my new car, seeing as email attachments weren't possible. She asked where the prison was, to which I explained. She began to google it, learning that it's a federal prison. She became curious and googled his name, which has unique spelling. I hadn't googled it, because I got the impression he'd be out soon and things would all be fine. 

Well, that turns out to not be the case. We found an article from his part of the country, in his local newspaper, showing that Simon was caught with child pornography on his computer - and a substantial amount. More googling and checking the dates, wording of his emails and his wife's email revealed that it is absolutely the same man as the man in that local news site without a shadow of a doubt. He plead guilty in court and is a convicted pedophile.

It's been about three hours now and the wind is still out of me. I must have taken heavy, deep sighing breaths two hundred times. I really, truly don't know what to do. 
Do I give up on a friend who's laughed with me, yelled at my terrible choices with women, and supported me when I needed it? The easy (or lazy) answer is ""Yes!"". And I hear you. In fact, my first response was to cut all contact because he's tarnished and I don't want to be associated with such people. 

BUT...

I want you to try to imagine you were genuinely in my shoes. No, really. Take a moment. Imagine that one of *your* friends - pick one (such as the last person you shared a coffee with, or a beer with on the weekend just gone). Now, imagine THEY did what my friend did. You've been friends for almost two decades to someone who did what my friend did, by all accounts only in the last two years. Change Simon's name for theirs, and imagine *their* partner sending you the same kind of email I received. 

So, Peter or Kate or Dave or Jeff or *whoever* your friend's name is, did this terrible, terrible thing. Can you throw away their friendship. Especially when they need it the most. If the answer is yes, then it seems I've lost a friend and they did it to themselves. If the answer is no, then *how do I keep a friendship with such a human being?*

His prison emails are still full of humor and jokes. It's the same old Simon. But it's not.

There's a lot of made-up nonsense on the internet, written by teenagers with nothing better to do, but I don't have time for such nonsense. I'm early 40s and in a real pickle. I truly have no idea what to do and I'll be reading your answers with interest. Please, save the jokes for another day.",17Apr2019,2

For the past few months, the supervisors have been not super nice to him, making it hard for him to do his job.  He got screwed over for something, which they fixed after the fact.  He was unhappy, stressed and wanted to leave for months.  Last week he gave notice and quit.  

I was promoted a few months ago, to a job that will likely fast track my pursuit of my career goal. Worked two years to get the promotion and a normal day schedule which is extremely needed for our kids. They have both been falling apart at home.

Therefore, I would need to leave in about 30 minutes if I were to walk and in just over an hour if she were to drive me. I do not have a drivers' licence. In the past, she has refused to take me places because she is angry at us, so I asked her if she will take me to the appointment. She refuses to answer.

94,"Hello reddit, I really need some advice.
I think I may have recovered a completely repressed sexual trauma from my childhood. This is what happened: 
I had sex for the first time tonight, full intercourse. I love my partner very much  and it was all good until I started to recognize the feeling of being penetrated. I had protested doing this for a long time until tonight, when I finally felt ready. But as soon as it happened, I felt a pang of instant terror and recognized this sensation I had thought I never experienced. Of course, we stopped, I calmed down, and it ended up okay. But this “physical” memory really upset me.

I have a lot of unexplained symptoms tied to PTSD, (not actually diagnosed, but align symptom wise, according to my psych). My childhood is completely foggy (but this could be due to the fact it was very unstable), I dissociate frequently, and I have very specific triggers like smells and songs.

I don’t know where to start here. I will tell my therapist but until then I don’t know how to handle this on my own. The thing that’s tearing me up is that I have absolutely no memory of sexual abuse or trauma. Only that “physical” memory. I have vague ideas about who/what happened, but I can’t bring myself to even mark anyone in my life/past as a potential abuser with no legitimate memory. 

If you know anything or even understand this feeling I’d really appreciate any input. I’m feeling really lost.",17Apr2019,1

My mom freaked out, the guy came out and we exchanged information. He did not want my phone number but simply insurance and said about 3 times how this is a bad parking lot. He left and after I calmed down went home. there was maybe 2 small (under 2 inches long) on his wheel well.

116,"Hey all,

So I had a job interview for a role that's 1 step ahead in my career today. It was with the manager I would be reporting to. 

The interview started off great, casual but still serious. He started off with describing the company and the position. I quickly realized how similar it is to my current role and pointed that out when my time came. 

Once I explained my current role and how I thought I would be a great fit for the role, his face had lit up. I was completing his sentences. We use the same tools. My experience lined up perfectly for the job, my downfalls were that this is a team lead role and I've never had any management experience. We spoke about it and we mutually came to a conclusion that I'm at a point where my next level would be a more managerial role.  Also, the job description requires 5 years of experiences, I had 2.5

1 slight mistake I made is that I only asked 3 questions, although he said one of them was a great question. 

All in all I thought everything was going well so far. But then all of a sudden it was like thank you for your time, take care good bye. It wasn't rushed or anything it just seemed like he was done taking to me. No salary talk, no availability talk. He just told me that HR will be in contact with me as he walked me out.

The HR professional that did the phone interview already asked about salary expectations and availability but I was concerned that the hiring manager did not.

We disconnected in the summer but she kinda barged back into my life and that type of stuff resumed and mutual friends of ours told me she liked me. I had feelings for her and about 2 months ago i asked her out and i was rejected. I was confused about this and when people asked me about it i said i thought she liked me. Around 5 weeks ago she sent me a big paragraph on why im a terrible toxic person for spreading rumors. I decided from there she wasnt worth my time if she was going to escalate the situation to way more than it was. I apologized and stated it wouldnt happen again and i completely left her in the dust to avoid unnecessary arguing. This went on to about a week ago when she suddenly texted me she was sorry and missed our friendship. I initially declined but she wouldnt stop so i reluctantly agreed to a friendship. Not 3 days in and i hear about her insulting me behind my back for no reason. At this point we have had no face to face conversation up until today when she followed me from my class and gave me a short conversation asking how i was etc. This has shaken me and she lacks a motive as she didnt contact me at all until last week and im afraid of trusting her at all.

He came in the room with a belt and started to come after me, telling me to shut up and that I tak to much and that i'm annoying. After he finished telling at me he slapped me on the leg with the belt and walked away. 

To be clear, the slap didn't hurt as much as it could have. It only stung for a little bit but it wasn't anything to horribly bad.

I have been working in this establishment for about 2 years and things were normal at first but now everything is getting out of hand. My manager has stopped putting small transactions through the register making us positive $50-$60 at the end of the day. She then puts the extra money in a cash box under the till and other workers and I think she may be pocketing it. One of the reasons for this is that one day we were positive $65 one day and she put it in the cash box under the till. The next day she was not working and we were negative $20. She then said that we HAD to make it up the next day by doing her sketchy method of not putting small purchases through the till. (I don't do this because I do not agree with it and think it may be illegal). What should I do about this?

Another problem is that our Manager refuses to hire new people. Instead we will have workers that have left for college/university in another city still on the schedule for months even though they are not being scheduled. We have 7 active employees in our place of work and the other 4 are away for college. I am not sure if this is allowed and it makes it very hard to get time off.  I had booked off my birthday 7 months in advance because I had a concert I was going to and the week before my birthday she had noticed that it was requested off. She then denied it and scheduled me anyways because she never bothered to check to see what days her employees had requested off.

The interesting part is, i think i know who stole it and i see them walk by my house almost every day. I also know he likes to hang out with a guy i dont know about 3 houses down.

130,"I'm a firm believer in some good old-fashioned street justice. Especially when it comes to standing up for someone who can't stand up for themselves, like this one autistic boy in my class. He is constantly harassed by the other students, and they even go as far as throwing stuff at him and threatening him with physical violence. The boy reacts in a drastic way every time and no matter how much I tell him to just not give them what they want, he continues to be stubborn. 

Today it got completely out of control when him and this other kid, we'll call him Ray, were going back and forth because the autistic kid, let's just call him Bruce, was trying to make a joke or a reference to Neo from the matrix and Ray was interrupting him with obnoxious noises and was just being an asshole, but the rest of the class was pretty much backing Ray up and harrasing Bruce with him. Of course, he gives them a reaction and calls them annoying and immature but they just keep going, so I called Ramon out. 

""You know you're making fun of someone with a mental illness, right? That makes you less than trash""

He did not like this. I tried talking to him at lunch, telling him that wasn't cool because he can't help if he acts strangely and that it's super low and petty to be doing that. On our way back to lunch, I get rocks chucked at me by them and I lose my shit and pick up a big rock and go to hit him in the face with it but luckily my girlfriend held me back and told me it wasn't worth getting expelled. 

I was taken out of class after that because I had gotten so angry I punched a hole in the wall. I got sent home ""before I seriously hurt somebody.""

My question is, should I just walk up to this kid in class while he's doing his work and beat the shit out of him? I know that's obviously a very serious and probably idiotic way of dealing with it but I'm tired of teachers just standing by and watching and not doing anything to stop them from harrasing this poor kid. I'm so tired of seeing this every day and I feel like Ray needs a little wake up call, and the final straw was throwing rocks at me because I was the only kid in that class with the audacity to say that it was wrong. Of course I want to report him and get him suspended, but he'll just come back and do the same thing. He needs to learn.

What are y'alls opinions on this?",17Apr2019,1
131,"Sorry in advance, I'm on mobile. 

A little backstory- I am a 19 year old girl and I've always had a bad relationship with food. When I was younger I had a bad body image and would go days without eating, but eventually hrew out of that and started eating normally. 

When I met my boyfriend I went on birth control- first pills, but then I realized it was hard for me to remember to take pills every day and decided to go for the depo shot. This was definitely a lot easier for me. 

After doing that though, I gained probably 25 pounds in like 2 weeks, and now I'm a little bit chubby. My metabolism is a lot lower too. But I also cant stop eating. I've tried to go on diets to try to lose some of this weight but I cant go like an hour without going for food, especially food with a lot of carbs or fat or sugar. I read somewhere that the shot does make you hungry all the time and cause cravings, though this may not be true. 

Either way, I'm still gaining weight because of my lack of self control and all of my cravings. How do I stop this? How do I go on a successful diet? I still live with my parents, so they have quite a bit of fattening food, so just not buying it isnt really an option. Also, this birth control is what works for me, and if going off of it is the only option, I'll just keep it. But any advice is really appreciated.",17Apr2019,0

133,"Back story: Was experiencing anxiety, racing thoughts &amp;amp; depression from the beginning of January-end of February/beginning of March. Realized I wasn’t generally happy, left all social media (except Reddit) to be more present. Definitely helped but am now back on IG because I want to find healthy, positive inspiration (travel, health, etc). Since then, I’ve been about 70-80% better; focusing on work, watching travel influencers, saving money to travel, connecting with my family more. Boyfriend has definitely been a HUGE support.

For the past few weeks, I’ve been having these thoughts of sadness of how I would feel if my family members/boyfriend were gone/passed away. Not thinking specifically about how they pass away.. But thinking of what I would go through, what it would be like without them. Ofc I try to focus on the positives, I look at travel photos, scenery, etc and think how amazing it would be.. Then my mind goes to thinking that it would be an amazing last scene to see before I passed. I don’t know what it is or why I’m thinking like this... am I afraid to die? Yes. Do I want to be so afraid that I forget to live in the now? No. It’s not racing thoughts like I used to have back at the beginning of the year. I’ve tried focusing on not judging my thoughts but I guess I need to strengthen that again so I don’t let these thoughts linger &amp;amp; cause me anxiety..

Is there anyone that can relate? If yes, is there anything you’ve done to help you feel better and think more positive? What other advice can you give me to not focus on the inevitable future?

134,"It's really making me depressed because she makes me so happy, but she's afraid of hurting me and said that it  would hurt less now than in the future.

She honestly means the world to me, and right now my biggest fear is losing her.

&amp;#x200B;

We met through class, and currently she's working on dropping out of the class (can't blame her tbh) because of the teacher, which sucks for a number of reasons, the biggest one being that she's the only reason I haven't dropped out yet, and without her in the class I'm not sure how long I can handle it.

Like yesterday I could tell that she was having a hard time, upon asking her what was going on, she would just give me the generic ""I'm fine"" response. This morning she told me that she was having a mental breakdown yesterday...

She's done so much for me and has made me so happy, I just don't know what to do, because just the thought of losing her is just too much pain to bare.

138,"Hi, my first time posting here. English is not my first language so I apologize in advance for any error.

I've heard that Reddit is the best community when it comes to giving advice so here goes.

I've been in a toxic relationship with my so-called best friend for 4 years now. At first, everything was fine, we got along very well, I tried everything I could to be a good friend, I tried to be understanding, I tried to blend in, everything and every effort imaginable, but after a while, she turned out to be very mean and hungry for attention. She would use me for money and rides ( I had not realized all of these until my mother told me that she might just be using me instead of being a genuinely good friend). Oh, I forgot to mention that we hang out in a group of six and we're the only two girls. Back to the story, whenever I achieve something worth being proud of, she would do anything to draw the attention back to her. For instance there was this one time when I won third place in a regional foreign-language contest, I told my group of friends. They congratulated me and offer to buy me breakfast or coffee as a gesture of congratulating, she pulled all the attention back to her and say that she lost her purse. Later that day she made a post on tumblr making a comparison of me winning third place in the contest and her losing her purse and kind of subtlely blaming me and how I got all the attention from the boys in the group and no one paid attention to her loss which made her sad. I felt bad after seeing that post, partially because I felt like I somehow made her sad, partially because I worked so hard for that position in the contest and I broke my good news to everyone first, she came in later and told everyone about her lost purse and she just made such an irrelevant comparison. And through high school years, I had a crush on one of the boys in the group and told her all about it, but then she ended up dating him which affected me not so little. She would send me all the pictures of them traveling together and I would reply just to be polite because it’s sad enough seeing them together, and when I do she would never reply and always leaves me on ""read"" or ""seen"". In our country and traditions, losing virginity is something very important. Guess what, she told me about her having sex with the dude for the first time. She also described how painful it was. Imagine hearing someone describe having sex with someone you like, isn't that also painful? Also, she is a childish and juvenile person, she's very demanding towards her boyfriend (aka my ex-crush) and always be unreasonable towards everything. She wants everything done her way and it drives everyone in the group crazy. She would act like she's mad at him and turns off all of her social media platforms and asks me to go talk to her boyfriend and kind of try to mend things for them by hinting him what he did wrong to her (which in my opinion, the dude did nothing wrong). She would always get jealous when I hang out with other people when in fact she has a lot of friends that she always goes out with, even more friends than me. I'm not a saint in this relationship, of course, I made some mistakes too, but those were nothing like the things she did to me, because I know I was trying my best to fix this relationship in every way possible. But we all know one person trying in a relationship is never enough.

Everything was very bad, but then I left my home country and moved to another country for a year. So it became less awkward. But I'm coming back home soon, and I don't really want to face her because after a while living abroad, I've realized that someone like her is very toxic and unhealthy for me. But the problem is that I still want to hang with the other boys in the group so I give in every time I try to cut off my relationship with her because I don't want things to be awkward when I hang with the boys having her around. So I really need your help on this.

Thank you, everyone, for making it all the way down here, I know it's one hell of a long post. I really look forward to seeing your advice and I'm sorry if this post is in the wrong format.",17Apr2019,2
139,"TL;DR) Brother steals and acts entitled and never receives the consequences. I could get the police involved due to underage drug usage to knock some sense into him, but I want to know if there's a better, more peaceful, solution.

   My brother just takes things in the house we leave unattended, even when we tell him not to. He takes the expensive candles my mom puts on the counter, eats the marzipan, chocolates, and treats my mom buys for holidays without permission, practically raids the matches for various reasons (one I'll mention later), and steals other various things. My mom even saw him raiding the fridge in HER ROOM, and I once saw him snooping around my desk.
   He asks for money, acts like I'm the selfish one when I refuse, and when I accept with an agreement that he'll pay me back, he never does. He also asks for money from my parents, and acts all annoyed when they say he has to earn it. 
   He acts like he did nothing wrong when confronted and even gets angry that my parents are mad.

   Now, why haven't my parents done anything? My mom's metal health is not ready to deal with it and she'd rather complain than act, and my dad gets way too angry and tries to ignore the issue. Which leaves me, the stupid fourteen-year-old with no power.

   I do have one idea as to what I could do, but it has some unfavorable side affects. I said that he was raiding the matches, for candles yes, but also for smoking. Now, in Colorado smoking weed is legal.... for people above 21. He's 16. I could attempt to build a case against him (take pictures/video of him smoking, locate where he hides his pot, and record audio of my parents talking to him about it), and report him to the proper authorities. The issue is that my mother knows about it and is fine with him using it which I think could (I'm no lawyer) fall under the ""Contributing to the Delinquency of a Minor"" law due to her inaction. Contributing to his habit could result in a class four felony. (Not asking for legal advice, it's just a possibility I'm explaining my reasoning on)

   What should I do? I don't want to report it because my family is already stressed enough and I don't wanna break it, and it just seems disproportional. 
   If there's ANYTHING I can do besides that, please tell me! I can barely stand the way my parents act when he does something to tick them off, they don't have qualms with projecting their stress onto each other and onto me, my little sister, and little brother. 
   I can't be in the same room as them for too long because when they're stressed, NOBODY can be happy. 

   What can I do? Like I'm said, I'm 14 so it's not like I could hire a family therapist. Thank you for taking the time to read this. 
  Any advice or suggestions on what I could do would be awesome!",17Apr2019,1

142,"So basically my girlfriend has been begging me to get an apartment with her. She really wants to get away from her parents which that’s a whole other story. I’m 19 and she’s 18, I’m in college she’s a senior in high school. We want to get one this summer we’ve been talking about it for a while now. We’ve been dating for two years and we love each other, I gave her a promise ring so I guess you could say we are wanting to get serious. Anyways, my parents are super uptight about leaving them and moving out. They love my girlfriend don’t get me wrong but they despise the idea of being with a girl on my own. I go to a community college near home only about 15 minutes away so it’s not a hassle to travel back and forth. My job is also in the same city as the college so I’m over there a lot. So getting an apartment near there wouldn’t be a waste I would be closer to work and school while also still being close to family. We both have jobs and agreed we would split rent. Considering we both work part time for about $10 an hour. That’s another thing that worries me, I don’t know if we are financially able to own a apartment. We live in the Midwest so things aren’t crazy expensive out here. However on a good month we bring about $1600 combined. She has a nice car paid by her parents and phone and the insurance too. I however have a run down car that I pay insurance for and I also pay for my own cellphone bill. I’ve finally saved up enough to pay for one year of college and I’ve been saving to eventually get a new car cause I really need one. I told my girlfriend to wait one more year because I will be able to get a job in the career I’m pursuing more than likely making way more than I am now which would get rid of the financial situation but she said she can’t wait that long. But what I’m really worried about is my parents, I don’t want them to disown me or think badly of me what should I do?",17Apr2019,1

So I answer his questions and then towards the end he tells me that he thinks I'd be a good fit here, that I'm a nice person, have a nice smile and that we should keep this relationship strictly business.

So tonight I opened up to a friend/coworker (friend a) about it, told him how I was feeling and who it was. He gave me some advice that I took to heart and it made me feel a bit better. 

Fast forward to the end of the night, I mention it to another coworker (friend b) and explain what’s going on and who I have the crush on. Friend b tells me that friend a said he was going to try to sleep with the girl I told him about.

I feel slighted, like I was stabbed in the back by friend a. On the other hand though, I’m in a committed relationship. Nothing is ever going to happen between that girl and I, so I shouldn’t care what her or friend a do.

146,"Hello everyone. This is a throw away for obvious reasons especially because this is embarrassing lol. 

Anyway my boyfriend (19M) and I (19F) have been dating for more than 3 years now and recently many problems have come up. I’d say ever since september 2018 I started to take my anger out on him because of personal problems. I would get mad at him for being 2 minutes late and have a whole argument over it or I would argue over him not texting me back after a few minutes then spam him. Basically i made an argument over a lot of things but i was in a bad situation in my life but this isn’t an excuse of course.

My boyfriend had been depressed from when we met but the first 2 years he was usually happy because of me and there wasn’t all of this fighting. He tells me sometimes he feels like he doesn’t know who he is. From october till now with all of the arguments and me being rude to him, we haven’t had sex since then. I remember asking him 2 months ago why he doesn’t feel the need to and he said he feels he isn’t “connected” with me like before since I’m always rude to him and it made his depression worse which also causes a low sex drive. He explained to me that I had to change if we want to have a healthy sex life and I have been working on it and it’s gotten way better. 

I’m not as rude to him as i was before but i know i still have a lot to work on but when i bring up why i’m angry we communicate normal. I know that to see a change I have to continue being this way for longer because I have only managed to fix this problem for a week now. My problem that i have to fix now is trying not to be bothered by so many little things he does and not bring it up unless it’s important. I explained to him that not being able to have sex with him for so many months makes my life stressful and he said he understands that it’s hard and he can just try to do it but i said no because i would only want to if he wants to. I am working on my problems either way but I honestly don’t know if me fixing them will result in him suddenly having a normal sex drive and having sex again. I asked him to clarify if me completing changing and working on our many problems in our relationship is successful does he think that we’ll go back to our normal sex life and he said “yes i think so”. I then asked him what if it doesn’t and he said there’s always a small percent chance for that to happen to matter what and that would mean we would have to break up. I got really emotional and said you should “know so”  (that we’ll get better) not think so” and he said that no one knows if their relationship will last forever.


With all this being said, Does anyone have any advice on how I can help him with his depression? I told him to see a counsellor but he said he doesn’t think a counsellor would help.  Also do you agree that it is impossible to “know” that your relationship will last forever and not just “think so”?

147,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years and moved in together when I had trouble with my parents. My boyfriend bought a house and everything was great. My boyfriends brother and mom moved in with us from out the country and I don’t feel comfortable living here. The plan originally was that they would get their own place but they’ve had trouble finding it as the brother doesn’t really care about any goals and just works in retail. I’ve tried to help him get a better job but he doesn’t care. The mom also hasn’t had much luck because she’s older and gets tired easily that she now only relies on driving Uber. 

I think because my boyfriend makes the most amount of money in the house that they rely on him a lot if they can’t afford something. It gets me upset but it’s his family so I don’t want to interfere. I’m the only one that gets the groceries and keeps the place tidy while they dirty the house within a day. To help them save up for a place I’ve offered I cook food for them so they don’t eat out but they choose to eat out 3 times a day for all meals instead. 

I have social anxiety also so when they’re home I just stay in the bedroom. I never want to leave my room to do what I want because it’s too much anxiety unless they’re not home. I rarely get alone time to myself because the mom does Uber at night while I am home during the day. Plus the brother makes me angry with his comments of “we don’t have groceries” even though I’m the only one buying them and another day he’ll show off new Jordan’s he bought. I can’t sleep some nights because they’ll be loud playing music or videos. The brother also had a girlfriend months ago that he broke up with which caused a lot of stress because they’d argue inside often and she dropped off his stuff in front of the house. 

I rather stay in the bedroom all day outside of work and being with friends. I can’t cook as much as I would like as they criticize I make “too much Asian food and the house stinks.” My boyfriend told me if we stay just a few more years then he’s thinking of giving the house to his mom and getting a new place for us that’s better. I know I don’t have a say in what he does with his money or his family, but I really just don’t feel comfortable especially with my anxiety. I’ve been looking at apartments and found one I really like. I’m not sure if I’m overreacting or if I should save my money since I’m paying for school out of pocket at the same time. I can afford paying for school and an apartment, but I’d just have to budget. Should I just try to bare with it a little longer? Every day I just feel more anxious and sad being here. 

TL;DR my boyfriends family moved in and as someone with social anxiety I don’t feel comfortable and they always make rude comments so I’d like to have an apartment on my own.",17Apr2019,1
148,"A little background. I used to be morbidly obese. At 5'10 I was ~320 pounds and very very little muscle. I was a fucking mess. This was 2 years ago. Since then, I have brought myself down to 200 even but that was done through not entirely healthy methods (see: eating disorders)

I never purged like bulimia, but I would routinely obsess over my eating and frequently ate fewer calories than I would burn on the elliptical that day. That may be a symptom of anorexia, though I am not sure. I am also quite sure that I have binge eating disorder, as I do hit all of those symptoms.
 
I have an appointment with a doctor for the first time in years tomorrow. I know that adderall works to succesfully treat my BED (I have acquired it through friends and taken it on several occasions). Which is why I really want to get a presciption, but I also really really really really (did I say really?) do not want my parents to find out about the eating disorders. That is why I would rather frame this as ADHD (after all, pre occupying thoughts of food harm my efficiency at work nearly every day) than an eating disorder. 

Here are my questions:

1) Is it possible to just lie to my doctor and say that I have the symptoms of ADHD and get a prescription (please don't get into the ethics of this) 

2) How do I approach the fact that I am 23 years old and just now getting diagnosed with a learning disability

Now lets assume I don't chicken out every time and actually discuss my ED with the doctor.

3) Say I got diagnosed, would he be able to prescribe me something right there on the spot or would I have to go to a mental health professional (something I really want to avoid doing)

4) Do diagnoses like BED affect insurance in any way (current plan or future) - im worried that having this on my 'permanent record' will fuck me up in the long run

I'm not trying to game the system, I am just tired of being fat and the only way I know how to lose weight is extremely unhealthy so I would like to avoid doing it. 

Please don't tell me about stimulant addiction, risk factors, etc. I know all of them. I just really need this prescription, I think it may save my life.

Tl;DR - Need a stimulant (adderall, Vyvanse, etc) presciption to combat my binge eating disorder. How can I broach the subject with my doctor so I can frame it as a treatment for ADHD (which will help my productivity at work, stop me from obsessing about food, and give me energy at the end of the day to go to the gym).

150,"Some background if it helps. I’m 20 and in college, and so is my boyfriend and friend. They have briefly met before and my boyfriend is aware of our friendship. 

To keep this brief. 

I have a boyfriend who I love so much. We’ve been together for almost a year and have had no big problems or anything with our relationship. We rarely argue and when we do we immediately work together to solve the problem. I also have a best and only friend who I’ve known for a long time. I don’t know how to explain how close we are, but we basically grew up together and I’ve never had any friends in high school aside from him. 

He just confessed he has feelings for me which is leaving me a complete mess. I agree that within time we could potentially make a good couple, but I do not reciprocate these feelings and have told him that. I love my boyfriend and things are going really good and I don’t want to leave him. But I also care deeply for my best friend and without him I will have literally no other friends. This is very difficult for me because he’s been the most important person in my life up until my boyfriend so I don’t want to lose him but obviously it’s not fair for anyone to continue the friendship.

I suppose I know what to do logically but it just hurts so much because my friend is so important to me. I guess I need advice on how to deal with all this. Thank you for reading",17Apr2019,2
151,"This is really stressing me out. I’ve always thought that I’m just childish/weird. And I mean this in a serious way, sometimes I just do things that’s just too cringe when I look back. I would also say some random stuff/talk to myself when I’m walking to my workplace. Even sometimes when there’s people around I cant help but to say weird things. When I realised, I pretend that I was just humming to a song lol.

I can’t stop pacing when I’m at home, and worst of all I feel like I often cut people off mid sentence. It’s also hard for me to focus during meetings at work, briefing from my supervisor, or even simply reading an article. My mind literally wanders from minute to minute.

Until recently, my boss told me that he noticed my short attention span and understands ADHD, since his brother has it. I never thought I had ADHD because I know how easy everyone self-diagnose themselves saying they have ADHD. But after working for a few weeks, I started to think that my inability to focus might really affect my career.

So now I have a couple of questions:
1. How likely is it for me to have ADHD as an adult?
2. If you think I’m just childish/no ADHD, can you recommend me some ways to improve myself?
3. Is there any over the counter medicine that helps focus?

153,"My landlord is smart about cameras and surveillance.  His boyfriend, my 13 yr. Old son's Dad, just got out of prison. 

He called me about spending time with our son. During the conversation, he told me that I sleep all day and leave the house around 2pm. Furthermore, he was upset that I didn't answer the door yesterday. My car wasn't in the driveway although I was home. Somehow, he knew I was home.

I need advice about what to do without spoiling a half-assed relationship with my son and his Dad.

I mentioned in another conversation the next day, that I was under servailance by my landlord and he made it seem like I was crazy.
I can't live in fear and don't know how to find cameras . Should I approach my landlord and ask him to get rid of the cameras? I know he will deny cameras are planted in or outside the house.

How else could my landlord know when I sleep? I am recovering from a stroke and have to rest. Plus i am very productive in my bed using my laptop.

I plan on moving the end of the month if i can afford  it. But, can he be a pedaphile? Watching my 13 year old son?

How do I get proof without money available to pay someone.

I need serious advice. I cant ask friends because they will worry about themselves under surveillance .

154,"Throwaway because, clearly. 

Backstory: I am a 34 yr old happily married woman living my life as well as I can despite the crap I went through growing up. (not getting too deep into it, you’d need a tl;dr for the tl;dr) I’m pretty damn mentally and emotionally healthy despite the undisclosed, but I do have my weaknesses like anybody else. 

My therapist has told to me that based on my descriptions of her, my mother is likely a narcissist with borderline personality disorder, and my birth father is probably also narcissistic, though his situation swings more into the self-pity helplessness side of things, while mom’s is more anger and aggression, so I have spent a lot of time kinda just figuring out how to exist with/around/between/without them, depending on whatever situation I find myself in, and it can get exhausting. Growing up around narcissistic personalities is turbulent and the need to pivot your responses and moods to respond to others’ extreme mood shifts can be a difficult thing to learn to navigate, but I’ve gotten pretty good at it with people who matter to me. (Aka people I know well) As a result I’m kinda prone to letting people use me, I don’t like being disagreeable or letting people down. I have a hard time saying “no”, basically. I have spent my life trying to sidestep unforeseen fights and pettiness, so I swing really hard toward placating people. As a result I tend to give far too much of myself, or so my therapist tells me. 

I’ll never be good at saying “no” so I’m trying to find a balance where I care for myself enough to decline some things while showing up for others. It’s all about checking in with myself and weighing how I feel in the moment against how I know I’ll feel later on, once I’ve done whatever it is that I’m being asked to do for someone.

I’m getting better at finding this balance but I’m kinda stuck at the moment so I thought I’d ask a bunch of strangers.

My dad and I have a strained relationship to put it lightly. I love him but I don’t really respect him and he loves being helpless, and he needs to be pitied, so it’s hard to be around him because I find him especially draining. He believes the world has made him a victim and I just can’t, so I have gone very low contact with him to meet that balance I’m trying to find that I mentioned earlier. We tend not to talk unless I’ve got energy reserves (not often) or when it’s looking like something serious has happened. There’s been no shortage of serious stuff as in the last five or so years he’s had multiple heart attacks as well as several other health issues. The man has said goodbye to me three separate times and has told me how he wants to be buried and all those lovely details. He’s obese, diabetic, with heart problems and recently has had to have one of his legs amputated as a result of all this. His choices have led him to a very unhappy old age and while my heart aches for him, I can only be around so much anger and self pity for so long before I lose my shit. Therapist advises zero contact but I couldn’t live with myself so here we are.

Well he just contacted me tonight at 10:30 and asked me to drive 45 minutes to his house this Saturday at 9am to help him clean his stuff out of his apartment because he needs to have it fumigated for bed bugs. Did I mention he’s also a hoarder?

Husband is vehemently against my going to help because he thinks my dad only ever contacts me when he needs something (he’s not wrong) because I have such a hard time saying no (also not wrong) and he’s pissed my dad has made the choices that have led him to this situation he’s in (again. Not wrong. I married a smart man.) he also is very against my going because it’s bugs. He doesn’t want to open our home to the possibility that they’d come home with me and I honestly really don’t want that either.

I desperately do not want to go, but I feel I should. The man has one leg for chrissake and he’s wheelchair bound. I don’t believe my two sisters are going but I think my brother-in-law is gonna be there to help. If I don’t go I’ve left an old man with one leg living with bugs. If I do go I’ve upset my husband who really only has my best interest at heart. If I go I’ll hate it. If I don’t I’ll feel awful.

156,"About four months ago I was promoted to assistant director at a child care center I had been working at as a staff. I’ve finally run into my first major conflict and I’m looking for advice about how to proceed. 

We’ve been having problems with staff knowing exactly how many kids they have/ are supposed to have in their groups. Last Friday the director and I sat down one-on-one with each staff to let them know that from there on out having an incorrect count would result in a write up. 

Monday a staff had the wrong count twice in a row when I asked her. First time she told me she had one less kid than she really did and the second time she told me “same count as before” when in fact a kid had been picked up and left. 

I talked to the director and we agreed I should write the staff up. Unfortunately, I had to leave early before I could give the staff the write up. Director gave her the write up after I left and the staff refused to sign it because she claims she did have the right count and I was lying. 

Today director, myself and the staff sit down to rehash. Director had to step out. I’m talking with the staff recounting to her what I remember happening and she’s either looking at her phone or talking over me. Director comes back in and staff accuses me of having an “attitude.” Finally, staff admits to having her count wrong once and therefore signs the write up. 

Director wants us all to sit down again tomorrow because there’s obviously animosity now. Director has backed me so far and agrees that this staff has it out for me. It’s on me that I’d been trying to be the boss and the “friend” before- but now how do I command the respect I should’ve been getting this whole time as her boss?

161,"Hello, I am a Senior in college that should be graduating within a month, but things are being complicated by my lab group in my cancer research class. I have actively contributed to the best of my ability throughout the course of this semester,  however, now my lab mates have decided to tell the instructor that I have not been contributing to our experiments and that I should not get anything for my participation grade (which would be an automatic failure.)

When I asked them why they would do such a thing they told me that they are disturbed by my lack of enthusiasm for the course and that they feel they have done more than me overall. I asked them why they had not come to talk to me sooner instead of going directly to the instructor, especially  so close to the end of our term, but they refused to answer that and just kept repeating that I never showed enough initiative towards the project.

I talked to the lab instructor who told me that they have been reporting me for several weeks, and that he does not know who to believe, but mainly cares that we finish the assignment despite our differences— which I support. The major issue is that they are now lying to him telling him that I won’t communicate with them, that I keep loosing my temper, and that I am harassing them. This arose because I walked out of the lab following one of them yelling at me for “belittling their feelings” by not caving and agreeing that I should fail the lab. What should I do?

Should I maintain my stance that I am innocent of theses accusations, should I ask my instructor to be a more active mediator, or should I go to the department chair and ask him for advice?

163,"Just a bit of context, I am a part of an organization where we hold a weeklong camp for kids whose parents have cancer. Having gone through that quite recently myself, I decided to join their ranks. To be perfectly honest, I want to show my appreciation for them, as I genuinely, wholly admire their positivity, hard work, and all the other positive stuff that they show, not to mention how close they all are. What I want to do is draw some cartoons about their camp names (no real names lol) doing some cool things. I like to draw so that's something I would like doing. This is also the last year for most of the coordinator board (graduating seniors) so there was this whole thing about making these super-personal videos about it. One thing I feel horrid about was that I sort of talked about a couple of the other coordinators in third person and all professional-like while the other non-grads went all super personal and friendly about it. I realized then that I was kind of a piece of shit for it. idk why but I felt shitty.

Here's the catch, however, I was pretty much the quiet, reclusive outsider in the group. While I did talk to others more individually, and I appreciate how kind they all were, I was overall not too involved in the group discussions and stuff like that.. However, being my first year, I would like to show thanks for making me feel (somewhat) welcome in their super tight-knit group (which, not to be negative, was kinda cliquey). My self-doubts are coming up as I feel as though I shouldn't do it because it'll be too little too late, or maybe too much effort and me coming off as a try-hard. I've been struggling with depression because of my father's death so I've been struggling with talking to new people in general.

I hope that I can get some advice on what to do. Should I go ahead and make the cartoons and show it to them or just leave it as it is? I genuinely admire their outgoingness, positivity, and the bond they have with each other. I haven't seen many others this close before, so I would like to show appreciation. However, my typical self-doubts are keeping me from reaching a final decision.",17Apr2019,1

169,"I [18F] grew up in a somewhat-religious Christian household. I never had much of a choice on whether I believed or not, but I never minded. Even from a young age, the idea of abstinence was drilled into me. As I got older, this became a more logical concept. I learned about STDs in health class and heard more than my fair share pregnancy nightmare stories. Eventually, I became firm in my opinion that abstinence until marriage was ultimately the best decision— for practical and religious reason.

Recently, though, I’ve developed a romantic relationship with someone [19M] that has been a good friend of mine for a while. Therefore, I’ve also considered the idea that having sex before marriage isn’t as dangerous and awful as people have always told me.

I feel conflicted. On one hand, I want to have this experience with him. I want to enjoy our relationship to the fullest extent. I don’t want to miss out on a great experience. On the other hand, I feel like I’m betraying everything I’ve ever learned and trusted. I don’t want to become pregnant or catch any kind of STD. I don’t want to disappoint anyone who might find out.

We may have rushed into the relationship. I asked her to be my girlfriend in a way I never thought I'd ask someone, and not the way I had originally planned, nevertheless, it worked, she apparently felt the same way and said yes.

But ever since the the day after she said yes, it's never felt like she's actually liked me more than a friend. She is short when she replies to me, one moment she seems happy to talk to me and then the next it's like she hates me and has had enough of me. I know not everybody in life is romantic or the best at relationships hence why this never really bothered me before, until now because it just keeps happening and it's disheartening.

I'm always telling her how much I appreciate her being in my life, or how much I like her, and I don't expect her to say the same things back of course but... it's never said back. She's never told me that she's missed me without me having to say it first, heck, I don't think she's ever said it before. I feel like I'm always the first one to make plans and try and put the effort into the relationship.

If i felt one ounce of reciprocation then all of this wouldn't be a problem, but I just don't feel like she likes me at all, and I don't know if it's just all in my head or not.

She also insults me a lot. Now her and I have great banter which I think is one of the reasons why I believe we work well together. But it's getting to the point where I say something genuinely nice and she just... insults me... constantly. And then laughs.

174,"I need advice on how to get through to my brother on red flags he should be seeing, patience for not rushing into marriage.

My little brother is 21 (22 tomorrow- happy birthday 🤷🏻‍♀️) and just got back from a Mormon mission a little over a year ago. Typically a lot of guys in the Mormon culture come off their mission a little marriage and family obsessed. I’m Mormon as well, but I was never obsessed with marrying crazy young right out of high school, college, or a mission. With that being said,  I just got married a little less than a year ago to a guy I dated for 2 1/2 years, so we felt like we weren’t rushing into anything for the sake of just getting married young.  I’m 26 and he’s 27 and both in our careers. 
My little brother has been on maybe a handful of dates ever. He has never exclusively dated anyone. Has never been on more than 2 dates with the same person.
Right now he lives with my parents out of state and going to community college. Has never lived alone or had to pay rent on his own or have more than a part time job needed because he had bills.
My little brother is so paranoid about not finding someone to marry... at only age 21. He has so much life to live and experience and things he wants to accomplish in life... and this is his biggest worry in his life right now. 
Months ago, my little brother matched with a 27 year old girl on a dating app called Mutual (it’s directed at single Mormons). My little has not been texting her and FaceTiming her a couple times a week since around October. Now he is at the point where he bought a ticket to Peru in June. He has NEVER travelled out of the country and he plans on going alone. When my sister asked him why he can’t wait until she comes to the US to meet, because he said she plans on moving here, he said because “it’s not that easy”. He then told her that if things go well the 2 weeks he is down there, he can propose and it will be easier for her to come to the US if he brings her.... When asked why he doesn’t at least try dating around before wanting to rush into marriage with a girl HE HAS NEVER MET. He just says no because if he has a good thing going now he would rather get married to her then be single and miserable with dating for a few years. All of these ideas of getting engaged and bringing her here so they can get married and she get a green card she told to him, they weren’t his ideas. I feel sick worrying about this. When people try to talk to him about it, it’s like talking to a brick wall. He sees no problem with 1- traveling internationally alone for the first time ever while staying in an Airbnb in a non- tourist area
2- getting engaged to a girl he will only have spent 2 weeks with
3- getting engaged to someone because he worries dating will not work out for him when he is only 21
4- no red flags that he is being coerced into a green card marriage with a older woman who again, he has never met
My sister and I have told him he has no idea how hard marriage is and should never be rushed into even when you don’t have all of these other concerns of green card/ international anything and having absolutely NO relationship experience.
I need advice because I know if he goes to Peru, either it will be a bad trip with who knows what could happen, or come back engaged to someone he doesn’t know and throw his dreams away.

175,"So I'll start by saying this.

I'm completely clueless and I'm very fragile right now. I will also preface by saying that yes, I can get a bit needy and clingy like other guys can but I don't think that's what contributed to my problems below.

I'm one of the more sensitive kinds of guys out there in the world, I have a very high EQ rating, and I'm good at fixing and relating to people. But this is driving me to my wits and I don't honestly know what it means.  


So I started dating this girl off of tinder a few weeks ago. We'll call her May for anonymity's sake.  
Well, things were going fairly well at the start. We started talking, getting to know each other after a few days (I think like 4 or 5) and then decided to start dating.  
Well, I went over to her house and saw her very frequently. Like..the first time I stayed at her house, she convinced her mom to let me stay for like 3 days.

Afterwards, she started treating me..differently.  A little cold..and maybe a week and a half into our relationship, she told me that she wasn't completely over her ex boyfriend and that she was a little fucked up and emotionally screwed up. She assured me that it wasn't -me-, but that she just wasn't ready for one at the time with anybody in general and that she needs to focus on herself and her life for the time being. She also reiterated to me that she still likes me, and that I like her too, and that there's a chance for us in the future to be together again when she's ready for it. I tried to talk to her about what was on her mind about her ex but she essentially shrugged it off by saying that it's something she has to deal with.  
 I'm a very understanding guy and I tried to help her comes to terms with it, but she told me that she just needs to essentially figure things out. I told her that I could go at her pace, and that I was fine with that. Naturally, I'm a bit hurt because this means that I just got broken up with when I thought I was doing everything right. I mean, I went out of my way for this girl on so many occasions in such a short span of time. She genuinely seemed to make me believe that she was having a good time with me, which still blows my mind to this day.

She asked me if I was okay with being friends with benefits.  
Me, taking the short end of the stick, and not wanting to leave her life or get too hurt over the new situation, said sure.  
And even more recently (like, last friday)..she asked me to go over to her house again and do jello shots with her. Which we did. The night passed and nothing happened. But then the next morning, we had sex. I don't know what it meant, or anything like that, but it happened. I guess she wanted intimacy but without the feeling of being in a relationship? Either way, it happened..  


But then today, she sent me a message saying that she doesn't even want to be friends with benefits anymore and that there's basically no chance of us having that or any sort of relationship in the future, essentially killing all hope I had.  
She said she thinks we'd be better off as -just- friends and would rather have a good friend that lasts a long time than a boyfriend for a month or a year.

&amp;#x200B;

Naturally, I'm a bit hurt even more. It feels like I'm literally getting pegged down so many notches and I'm honestly just a lost mess right now. I don't know what I did wrong or why she's treating me this way.  
Why even start a relationship if you're just gunna waste my time like this? I don't know what my options are, or what to do. I've tried to be there for her, always tried to be a shoulder she can figuratively cry on, someone she can talk to, etc.  


I've never been very good at making friends or talking to people, let alone getting things off of my chest but I just had to spit this out. I'm at a loss. If anyone has any idea of what this means or what she's trying to do, I'm all ears. Should I leave? Should I try and preserve the friendship? Do girls ever know what they want when they say stuff like that? Should I give up or wait it out?

So when I asked I was told no, it's a 4 hour minimum now and he's been turning down 6 hr requests for me. Honestly, I'm stressing because we're all young and affording 4 hours plus 20% gratuity is hard, and after the initial excitement I'm regretting agreeing to spend that much. Any advice on what to do?

i don’t even bother to see them during breaks because i get ignored when i choose to spend time with the main group. i probably get invited to the table once a year for an annual gift exchange.

the two that i hang out with are considerably prettier but terribly entitled. their families are better off than mine and they can be inconsiderate. at times, they’ve made jabs about my clothing and weight, things that i can’t change overnight. to them, it’s all in good fun but i can’t help but be irritated and fire back with my own remarks as a shitty defense mechanism.

when i split with my partner, i went to them for advice and was told that i was giving them a headache and i should leave them alone. i get it—not everyone is emotionally available at all times, but i can’t help but feel bitter that i was left to deal with a breakup by myself. 

furthermore i’ve done favors upon favors for those two. i’ve been nothing but a good friend and yet they treat me like they’re entitled to it. i’ve never received a birthday gift from these friends in the years i’ve known them.

The issue is, I have been only ever been invited to one party (a Halloween party), and I have never hosted a party before.  While I sort-of have an idea of what kinds of food and drink to supply, I do not know what kind of music to play.   I've started googling ""party"" songs, but I do not know how effective that will prove.

For some context, all of my classmates are art students.  I'm a fairly mellow kind of person, and I do not know generally what kinds of music are acceptable at parties.  I also do not know how best to play the music; my bet is to just stream it off of my laptop, but something about that does not sit well with me.

**Problem:** The job that I have now is a really big change for me. I moved to another province (I'm from Canada) for this job which pays decently considering I have no post secondary education but I am capped for very little hours. I have a contract for my rent for a year and I spent over $2000 just to move. Rent each month + transportation and other living expenses costs me $1000 so I am barely able to save up any money at all.

199,"So first off, I guess I should say I have nothing against dogs. I honestly think they're very intelligent and fun animals. That being said, I can't really be around them because I have an extremely bad dog allergy. I have a lot of allergies, but aside from the life-threatening nut variety, my allergy to dogs has to be the absolute worst. It's not an exaggeration to say I can only be around one for a few minutes before my allergies start acting up, and when they do, it's bad and doesn't stop for hours even after I'm away from one. Allergy medicine neither helps to prevent or lessen the reaction either. If I'm around a dog, it's gonna start and it won't be stopping for awhile.

I'm talking every reaction in the book too. My eyes get very very irritated and red, occasionally swelling too. Tonight my eyes were getting so watery every few seconds I couldn't even see cause they were burning so bad. My throat and ears get so itchy that I can't concentrate on anything other than trying to get rid of the sensation. My sinuses get extremely congested and runny to the point where I can't breathe through my nose at all and I'm having to get up and blow it every couple minutes to prevent snot from running down my face. And breathing through my mouth becomes difficult too because it severely fucks with my Asthma, which is usually mild but goes into overdrive when I'm experiencing dog-related agitation.

This has become a big problem at college because for the last few weeks, an RA in my dorm building has had her dog living with her and lets him walk around the building. Now my dorm has a strict NO PETS rule. Only goldfish are allowed. Initially, I thought maybe the dog was just visiting sometimes but now I see it every day and hear it howling from her room so I know it's living here. She even brings him into the building's communal lounge and he sits and walks all over the furniture we use every day. Naturally, this has fucked up my allergies bad. I feel like I've been perpetually sick for the last two and a half weeks with my allergy symptoms and it's made life absolutely miserable. My throat is sore, my eyes are always burning, and it's basically just discomfort and agitation all the time.

One of my friends apparently asked another RA why the dog was allowed here when no other student is allowed pets, and he stated that she needs him as an ""emotional support animal"". Now this could just be me being biased and judgemental, but I don't think that's actually the case. I think the RA just wants her dog to live with her and came up with some reason to justify it to housing. I could be totally off-base there and fully admit I might be, but even so, I'm not the only student allergic to dogs in the building either. While emotional support is important, I feel like other students' physical health should also matter when it comes to stuff like this. That's the whole reason most dorms are pet-free. However, since this is apparently cleared with Housing (at least I'm assuming), I don't know if there's anything that can actually be done about it. What do you guys think?",17Apr2019,2

At the party my love came up to me once I got back and told me he wanted to talk to me when we got home, but unfortunately we didn’t talk because I needed to go to bed for work very early in the morning. 
(Going back to the conversation with him on the patio) 
He didn’t want to talk to me about that night anymore and I kinda got upset because just a few days ago at the party he told me he wanted to cry/talk to me about it. 
I told him I understood he wasn’t ready to talk to me because he had to tell his dad at his own birthday party that his mom needed help and it wasn’t fair to his dad.
When we were kinda upset together, I told him I cared about him and I don’t think he should bottle up his feelings because in our past when he did our relationship would get rocky and I would get scared of losing him. 
My love told me that I shouldn’t feel scared of losing him and I understand.
I am hurt by it because in my life I have been kinda traumatized with people I love and care about leaving me.

204,"Me and Alex have been friend since 5th grade, but we only became close at the end of 7th grade, I'm in 9th grade now.
Let me tell you that in 7th and 8th grade we got along well, very well. However not that we're in 9th grade, with the new kids (and I think this might me important) and stuff, we don't get along as well anymore. What will also be important is that I'm classified as a smart kid.

Before tests she asks me to explain everything to her because she refuses to learn anything (formulas, rules, etc.) and she obviously doesn't understand. I explain them to her as best as I can and she says she understands. Ok, nice.

During test she's always on my shoulder like ""What do I do, I don't know anything,"" and she's always such a grump about it too. When I either say that I have things of my own to do or I don't know how to resolve her problem or that I don't WANT to, she starts getting mad, insists that I do know how to do her problems/exercises. In the end I end up doing her problems for her cause I have no spine.

During break she doesn't even hang out with me anymore because she goes to hang out with other new kids (and some old friends from middle school). I don't say anything about it, of course, because I think it might be for the better. 

Other instances that make me, as a generally calm person I think, get angry is that she touches my boobs without my permission and when I slap her hands away or push her away she always got something to say about it. ""The hell is wrong with you, shouldn't you like this?"" (Cause aparently being gay should somehow influence the fact that I don't like people touching my boobs.), ""Other girls let me do this, why don't you?"", ""Come oooon, it's not even that bad."" And then I end up barking at her on how stupid that is and how I don't like it.

Now there's also a boy in the equation. Jason is like the sun to her moon and shit like that. She completely obsessed with him and even though he's already told her he doesn't like her, she keeps on going. She cries when he gets mad at her, she gets angry when other girls touch him and stuff like this. THEN she comes crawling to me how she wishes she could kill those girls and how he doesn't care about her and all that.
I've dealt with stuff like this with her in the past. It's been 8 months since we met him. I've tried so desperately to help her and tell her it's not worth it, but she continues. 

She's also the most childish edgelord I've ever met. She makes jokes about death and hopes that teachers she doesn't like would die and over all of these she makes stupid (morbid) jokes about animals. 

Every time she makes stupid remarks, jokes or racist comments I call her out on it and she gets offended. She hurts her best friends without remorse (I still have 2 people who have been hurt by her.) She puts me down so often.

So, what do you think? I might have left out details about how I comfort her and help her sometimes, but that's just cause of the world limit. Sorry.",17Apr2019,1
205,"So basically my grandparents are attempting to force me to apply to this one college that I don't want to go to, they said they'd pay for it but even if I get accepted I probably won't be going to it. Should I do it just to make them get off my back about it or what?",17Apr2019,1
206,"Here's a little background info. I'm in my mid-twenties working a dead-end minimum wage position, part-time. I've been working here for a long time and while it's decent to have some extra money while in college and to save for a new car, it's putting a massive burden on my mental health. I hate my coworkers, I hate the customers, and its legitimately slave labor that I could make more doing elsewhere. With all that said, I'm still worried about putting my 2weeks in. I have no other job lined up, but my plan was to focus entirely on school so I can just finish up instead of going part time. I have extreme social anxiety so doing new things like attending college full-time and maybe even trying new jobs later on would really push me out of my comfort zone but I think that's what I need. 

To add to all of this, in general I believe I'm developmentally delayed and probably on the spectrum. I don't know much about being an adult due to the carelessness of my parents and them just accepting the fact their child is a loser. I  just dont know what to do next and I can't afford to waste anymore time. Do I focus on improving my mental health/self and trying something new or continue slaving away part-time in school and this job I'm familiar with but hate?

207,"So I don't know if this will be taken down because it sounds like I'm looking for medical advice but I just want to know if anyone else has had these problems before and what they have because my doctors are at a loss and are trying to send my two hours away to another hospital when we already drive 1 hour to get to this place. I know Reddit isn't the best place to go but maybe searching here will give me answers.

Let me start here: I have been diagnosed with diabetes (type 1), arthritis, EOE, I'm also really low on iron. Its been since I was 7 and its been a shit show since. I wanted to say that my gastrologist said I had gastritis but I had 2 of the symptoms and she put me on more meds that didn't help. I also want to point out that EOE can cause abdominal pain but my doctors even know that it shouldn't be making it this bad.

So about September 2017, I started getting weird abdominal pain that would come and go. We thought it was gas because I would feel it move around from my sides to my lower stomach then about where my esophagus is. December got bad, I had keytone acidosis and spent Christmas in the hospital on pain meds and a saline IV. Anyway, it was pain all the time, in and out of the hospital. They did exploratory surgery on me and found nothing again, lots of scopes and blood tests and scans later I was in the hospital for a month and one day and went home with no answers but on steroids because my bloating was only happening because of swelling in my tummy. You can't stay on steroids forever but they helped the pain so much. The doctors thought it would go away even if I wasn't on the steroids...It came back... I don't remember a lot but staying in bed and being a recluse and not being able to go out with friends because I couldn't walk very far. 

This year they put me on steroids again because my arthritis was acting up and I have a really weird bruise on my foot that was super swollen and hurt to walk on. And they hoped it would all go away but its been worse since. Bit of a TMI but it hurts to pee? I've figured out that I'm constantly clutching my stomach because it hurts if I don't so I need to relax to pee and it causes SO MUCH PAIN. Not like down there but right between my ribs where my esophagus is. I can't sleep through the night because when you sleep you relax so I'm crying in my sleep and have to sleep in my grandparent's room because I don't like being alone while I'm in pain. I'm not allowed to take IBprophen or Tylenol because it interacts with my other meds and my doctors wont give me anything else and just keep insisting that this medicine or this one will make it stop but some times I do when it gets real bad. Even drinking water makes me hurl over in pain and I'm barely eating. I can barely walk to the bathroom and you better forget walking to the kitchen unless I'm feeling okay. We just dont know what to do and its so scary because even professional doctors at a pretty nice hospital cant figure anything out.

If you know any of the symtoms or have something like this please share advice. I need help please.",17Apr2019,1

Hello, I am currently a Junior is High School and I've basically done nothing with my life in high school. I am now realizing that something needs to change. I have no idea what to do. I have no friends, and I talk to no one at school. I'm very insecure and absolutely hate talking about myself. I basically just come home from school and play video games for 6 hours, do my homework then go to bed.

212,"I live with my little brother in a house and while our parents take care of the house payment. I take care of everything else when it comes to bills. Light, water, gas, internet, food. You name it.

This isn't the first time I've had this problem with my younger sibling where I feel like I'm shouldering all the burdens of the house. All he does, because I ask, is cook and take out the trash.

I feel like I'm providing everything and I shouldn't have to remind him what little chores he has to do. His defense could be ""I gotta study for classes"" but I'm a college student as well with the same major as he, but he's full time and I had to cut down to part time with a full time job to keep up with expenses.

Sometimes I lose my temper when I ask him to do certain things like taking out the trash because it's starting to smell and his response is ""maybe tomorrow"" and it drags. Cooking, I feel like his cooking is super sloppy, he just wants to cook as fast as possible with little effort and to combat this, sometimes I step in make the food myself because it's that god awful sometimes (opinion, biased of course).

I honestly don't know what more to even add, really because right now I admit I'm not in the right state of mind and I'm just running on pure anger and frustration (after a long flight, I ended up paying almost 100 bucks for a cab and I guess to pat myself on the back, my excuse is, well younger sibling can drive, he could've picked me up and saved myself the money.)

Right now the ultimatum I have in mind is, I'm telling my parents straight up that I'm no longer supporting my little brother (im not lending him my CC, he's not using my internet etc) and that they can support him again, unless some miracle happens and he changes his attitude/chore ethics or whatever we can call this.

Basically my question is, am I taking things too far or what should I do?

214,"Hi there. My name is dan. I am 19 and in college, and I think I hate my life.

I am incredibly privileged. My family is paying for me to attend college  (which is two hours away from home), I have some friends that go out with my roommate and I every other weekend, and I have made some different friends in different groups over this freshman year. I have a part time job which sometimes eats up weekends, but usually has good hours and is flexible. I am also in a community orchestra which meets once a week, where I play violin. I say all of this because I am extremely grateful for everyone and everything that is apart of my life. Despise all of this, I hate myself and want everything to end.

Every day there is something that I mess up or forget to do, which either affect my grades or how people perceive me. I can't tell if it is anxiety or not, but every time I find myself in a social situation it feels like everyone has such contempt for me, and it destroys my self confidence, and basically my entire day. I let small comments about me tank my day, I don't regularly hang out with anyone, and my grades are pretty, pretty bad. I am not failing anything, but there was a stint where I got especially depressed, barely leaving my room and shutting people out. I slept through a lot of classes during this time, and my sleep pattern was crazy. I also smoked marijuana daily, just to get through the day, which I know was not helpful in the slightest. My self pity was so great I thought it was helping, but I learned that it was basically substance abuse. I have since stopped smoking daily, but I think I need to quit entirely, even socially. I do not allow myself to keep any weed on me, because I know I do not have the self control to stop myself. I am also addicted to vaping when I did not need to get off cigarettes or any tobacco. This is probably the worst one out of any, but it is the most hard to drop. My major currently is Information Technology, which I think is interesting, but have been told by my older brother that if I do not have a passion for, I need to switch. He is a computer science major with a well paying job, so he has some credibility. This part time checker job also sucks the ever living soul out of me, and while most of my coworkers are friendly, I feel like most find me extremely annoying, so I keep to myself. On top of all this self pity, I have to try and sign a lease for the summer and figure out how to get instate tuition, and I do not know the first steps in that process. 

The issue is, I don't know if I am depressed, manic, or simply lazy. I do not eat the healthiest, and my sleep schedule has been a little whack mostly due to the midnight shifts this job has put me on because of my class schedule. I have never really been able to sleep super well though. I would quit this job, but I need a certain amount of taxable income for instate, I THINK. 

I just need to know how to have drive in life. I am crying writing this last line. I have no idea how to manage anything, I might have to retake a math course over the summer if I do not do well on this quiz tomorrow (which my place of work would not schedule me around, allowing me to leave at 6:15 to make a quiz that starts at 6:30). Once my parents realize I am retaking a math class they will be absolutely furious with me, rightfully so. The worst part is I can not tell if I am just being a whiny bitch or not. If I can't handle this stuff, I don't know how I'll get a job, a house, a family, or anything. I am not quite sure what suicidal thoughts are, but I have imagined killing myself every day for a long time. I have never set a plan or anything similar. My brother lost a close friend to suicide, and while I don't think I have any best friends like he had, I wouldn't put anyone through that. I have tried to get help before, but my mom shut the idea down very quickly. 

tldr: I need advice on how to get some anxious kid's life back on track. Ever since I got to college I feel like everything is out of my control, and I am just a failure. I need to be asleep, but I figured I would give this subreddit a try. Thanks for reading &lt;3",17Apr2019,1

216,"So, last Tuesday I bought a 2003 vw v6 AWD Passat from a guy on Letgo app. I asked him if the engine and transmission are good and all and he said yes, and said that the check engine light are only on because it needs oil change and he’s a mechanic as well and the owner of the car that I bought from is from his gf. He said that they r selling the car cuz the car is from her dad’s crazy ex and they no longer want anything to do with it so I thought that would explain the reduced price. Her dad also is a mechanic and used to own a mechanic shop. I took it out on a test drive, everything ran pretty well so I bought it plus since both of them are mechanics so I trust them. Now here’s what happened next day... as I was happily driving my “new” car, the car suddenly jerked front and back I was like wtf? I went to autozone for their check engine light service and the man comes back with 2 pages of what’s wrong with the car, far more than just a oil change and possibly need to needs cam intake actuator or wiring, which actually can fuck up the engine since it move stuff inside the engine or so I’ve been told by the autozone guy. Now I’m stuck with a car that I can’t drive due to it being a road risk nor can I sell it because I don’t want to be like them selling risky vehicle to people and the fact that the both of them are mechanics and they’ve never once used the check engine light arrive at autozone?

217,"The title may be a little confusing, so the whole explanation is going to be long, a TL;DR will be at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother has decided to move to take care of my grandparents in a different state (About 3 hours away). My grandparents own a house in the city we live in currently. My mother grew up in that house, and then she raised my siblings and I there once they moved out of state. So considering that, the house means a lot to everyone in the family. People have been getting in touch with literally everybody who has lived there at some point to try to buy the house from us for years (It's in one of the best neighborhoods and around all of the best schools), but the problem is they all want to tear the house down and rebuild two giant houses there instead, so my grandparents have been hesitant to sell it. 

&amp;#x200B;

In an effort to try to keep it in the family, my grandparents offered to sell it to my boyfriend and I for the estimated value of the house (Instead of taking out a mortgage we are planning on giving them a big lump sum for a down payment and then giving them around $1,200 a month until we pay off the house), and we've been seriously considering it but I have one problem - my mother. She is obviously very attached to the house and she also controls all of my grandparents finances, so I have mainly discussing this with her. When we first talked about it, she said I would possibly have to set up a bedroom for my dad because he was still planning on keeping his job, but he would only be there a day or two out of the month. I have no problem accommodating him, we were going to set up a guest room anyway. The next time we discussed it, she told me she was going to be leaving her cat and a chameleon there too. That bothered me a little bit, because the chameleon was definitely an impulse buy for her and she's been trying to force me into taking it since she bought it, plus we already have pets of our own. But I let that slide too, because I believe that they're better off there and I'm willing to take care of them. I originally stopped by yesterday to finalize things and she brought up a few things that are really making me second guess buying the house.

&amp;#x200B;

She has been very resistant to us changing anything about the house. I would really like to paint everything and fix it up, it's going to be expensive but I'm willing to do the work and spend the money. A door and flooring in the majority of the house is going to have to be replaced because she lets her dog pee everywhere and it's left very noticeable spots on the wood. There are a few little ""aesthetic"" things she has done to the house that I am planning on changing too. I talked her into most of it, but she is dead set against me painting what is now her bedroom in case she wants to come back. I was pretty shocked that she made that demand, and now I'm genuinely worried she will barge her way back into that house. She doesn't want to move and has already made tons of comments about how she won't last long living in the middle of nowhere with my grandparents. She's planning on using the basement to store some of her things and she's really pushing to leave the majority of her furniture there too. I feel like her telling me I'm straight up not allowed to paint that room specifically and not getting rid of her stuff is her already planning on coming back at some point, and I don't want to pay $1,200 a month to live with my mother. 

&amp;#x200B;

With all of the requests she's made and all of the work we're going to be doing to fix the house, and the possibility of her coming back looming over my head is making me seriously consider not buying our house. It's a great deal, and there is no way we could afford a house that size, let alone in that neighborhood otherwise. But I don't see a way to tell her I don't want her living there without it starting a fight when we already have butted heads during this entire process. Should I just suck it up and let her come back when she will undoubtedly will want too? How am I supposed to tell her that I'm not going to be welcoming her with open arms when she does? I've already written a ton but there are a bunch of other small issues that will either lead to problems with her or reasons she will come back.

218,"Thanks for taking the time to hear my situation, really need some advice here. 


Im 19 years old and I’ve been through a lot of shit already in my life, from drug addiction to family issues , depression, anxiety, Prescription meds to help “fix” my problems. I developed a condition where I trouble relaxing my muscles in my lower region, (pelvic floor dysfunction) causing pain or discomfort pretty much constantly throughout the day and making it near impossible to take a poop without forcing It with laxatives.. also have trouble urinating and pain after sex. 


When Im standing for long periods of time my legs feel weak and I get a lot of pain in my pelvic area and lower back. Because of this, I feel it’s pretty impossible to have a traditional job where Im standing on my feet the entire day. Sitting down is fine. But I don’t have much job experienced mostly because of my depression, anxiety, self esteem issues which makes me quit my job very quickly because I can’t take the extra stress. I do food delivery now, I have a car my parents gave me thank god for them doing that. It pays my bills but Im barely getting by. I have no insurance so I can’t go to specialists to fix or get any progress on my issue. 


My car is high in miles and doesn’t have a ton of life in it. Done a few repairs where I had to spend lots of money to try and fix but more problems keep arising and don’t have the money. I feel like a lost cause, I can’t work physically, it’s hell mentally, but I need money so I can actually live.

220,"\*\*tl;dr\*\* Lots of melodrama. Lonely and unemployed. Don't want to be.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*First point\*\* I have already seen several psychologists, and I have found one that keeps the worst feelings at bay. But they are not capable of fully addressing all my needs, especially within the timeframe provided. They are excellent for crisis aversion but not much beyond that.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Second point\*\* My clinical diagnoses: are severe anxiety, severe depression, pronounced ADHD (possibly exacerbated by depression and anxiety). I am also still suffering a lot from PTSD like symptoms after my fiance left me for my best friend, and all my friends chose to keep them instead of me.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Third point\*\* I am finishing my 4 year technical degree in science after 10 years (basically electrical engineering). My weighted average is approximately 46%, i.e. a fail average. This is due to subjects I did not withdraw from because I repeatedly deluded myself into believing that I could ""catch up"" despite never applying myself.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Including this part because it's relevant to achieving real tangible goals. \*\* I had my intelligence (including working memory, verbal intelligence, mathematical reasoning, spatial reasoning, classification and logical reasoning) tested extensively by a professional (actually a group of 3). I was not looking for an IQ test, just a functional capacity or highlighted limitations. The results were given back to me as ""highly intelligent with unstable aspects"". The key point they raised was that I have exceptional difficulty with maintaining focus, and that my working memory (holding chunks of information) was essentially non-existent. If I am not looking at the instructions or details then I can't solve even basic problems. However, if I take the time to memorise each component, into long term memory, then I can manipulate and reason with them at exceptionally high levels.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Where do I want to get to?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

1. I want to be the kind of person other wished was around at parties, game nights, events in general. Where my presence would be missed. I don't want the spot light, just to be wanted at all.
2. I want to be reliable. If someone asks me to do something, I want to be able to not forget it, be able to motivate myself to undertake the task, and if I have problems with it, explain ahead of time how I will solve those problems.
3. I want to be employed in a stable job that I feel I'm actually capable of doing. Where I wouldn't be a constant disappointment to my employers, colleagues and myself. 
4. I want to be able to live my life without needing to prepare myself for the most basic tasks. Need to have a shower? No, I need to start the shower, think, make sure I have a towel, think, remember I started the shower, take my clothes of and put them in my basket, not get distracted by needing to do the laundry, wash myself, get distracted, wash myself again, debate if I've washed myself or not, do it a third time just in case, dry myself, get dressed. Then forget to do the washing for another 3 days.
5. I want friends. People who think of me when something happens, and they want to tell me about it. Or ask me about it. Or play games, talk, see movies etc. Just people who enjoy considering me as a part of their life. Because at the moment, outside of my family, no one does.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Biggest barriers\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

1. I'm self important narcissist. I don't want to be, but I know I do it. I am always putting everything I hear in terms of me, things I know etc. I can actively listen, but it's not my habit. My habit is to be a self-absorbed asshole.
2. I'm objectively not very attractive. I am losing weight, getting back in shape. But I'm fat, balding and nearly 30, where everyone else around me is under 22 (I live on campus finishing my degree).
3. I'm so depressed and anxious that it takes me quite a huge amount of effort to bring myself out of my own head when someone interacts with me. I seem like a brooding asshole and it is exhausting for people who used to care for me, it is one of the explicit reasons my ex cheated on me.
4. I can't access a psychiatrist for medication (SRIs for depression and/or Vyvanse for ADHD) for at least 6 months, due to overcrowding and my inability to pay for a private specialist.
5. I have absolutely no belief or hope left in me to suggest that there is a legitimate reason to continue living. I'm essentially doing my due diligence for my family. I don't want to hurt them, but at this point I have no intention of turning 30.",17Apr2019,1

228,"My boss will be pursuing another career in a little while, so there is a job opening for his position.

But before I send in my resume to HR, I would like to have a talk with him personally about the  job. There are a few concerns/questions I am having.

My main reason why I want to ask him directly is because I want his opinion on the future of the position. There is a lot going on in the company and I don't want to be laid off in a couple of years and be forced to find a job somewhere else.
I also really want to know the job contents, we rarely see him so we don't really know how much and what he does.

Another possible difficulty could be that I am in fact the youngest of the team, by far (~10yrs). 

How do I go about this? Do I just send him an email ""hey, I'm interested in your job and I have some questions""? 
It is possible that we would have to have this conversation over the phone or skype because, like I mentioned earlier, he's not around that much.

She's very self centered, feels sorry for herself all the time, complains all the time, and has no desire to change anything. 

I've suggested she try a therapist... She's been there done that. Said it didn't help. Multiple people have told her she needs to move out of her house... A lot of her depression stems from her mom. She says she can't move out for emotional reasons. I've even offered to let her stay at my house a few days (I live close by so she could be ""close"" to get mom but get some relief), and she isn't interested. 

She just wants someone to feel sorry for her but not do anything... And I'm moving soon so when I leave there won't be anyone else to help her.

231,"I’ll say outright: I don’t have much experience with dating/flirting since I didn’t put much attention  or effort into it until last year, so  I might be missing some flags here (please tell me which ones, if any)

[Context:]

In my first year in high school I was in the same class as a girl who’d been held back years before. We got talking despite my initial dislike for her (she came across to me as somewhat superficial and a bit slutty). 
We got closer, and she told me about her past; bullying by her previous year, and how she was nearly raped by a classmate a couple years back. 
(He transferred a while ago due to poor performance).
In general, I felt compassionate towards her, as I’d faced similar issues as well

I didn’t get along with her two “friends” (one of them in particular, who is the manipulative kind) and brought the subject up to her constantly. 
Word got out and I learned she also fed our conversations to others, despite telling me she thought the same way. 
As a result shut myself away from everyone, as I was tired of the constant stress it caused me at the time.
I apologized profusely out of remorse, knowing badmouthing them was a mistake, and she seemed to feel guilty about what happened later on.  

Eventually she DM’d me she hadn’t liked distancing herself from me and would want me to trust her again, and so on. 
She proceeded to try rebuild the friendship, to which I’d agreed at first, but I wasn’t able to stand her presence for very long because I still felt deeply betrayed. (One day I even,deleted all my conversations with her, IG and Whattsapp).

Fast forward a year and things have calmed down, and I’ve grown out of my gloomy-all-around mindset.
She’s changed ever since, and has become  a shadow of her two friends; careless in general, fully engulfed in drinking and started vaping recently; also will likely not pass this year. 
She doesn’t seem to resent me for what happened  nor shows any issues talking to me, despite her friends (who’ve since warmed up to me a bit).

[Situation:]

We talk a few times per week, sometimes without me having to say anything to her, as she’ll comment /ask about whatever I’m doing/saying/ is happening in the moment, and it’ll go on from there. 

(&gt; It became more apparent during a school trip recently. I even caught her looking at me from a distance sometimes, though nothing outstanding.

&gt; The most notable thing would be what I overheard from her and another classmate.
She was asked  something involving me,  to which she answered “Yeah” without hesitation.
The classmate’s “Oh my” hinted at something surprising/unexpected.  (wether she likes me/she thinks I like her?))

Sometimes she’ll even tell me what bothers her (being nervous before a dance show, for example), but won’t be fully open about more delicate stuff (despite what I know about her past, I get why she wouldn’t ). 
*Recently she’s gone silent out of the blue, but that doesn’t seem like a big deal.

I’m not sure how to interpret this as a whole, as I get mixed feelings from her behavior. I’ve talked about it with other friends, and been told that she could be trying to reconnect with “an old friend” (which I’m perfectly fine with).
The other side of me tells me however, she might just be playing nice  to get me to help her with stuff out as I am the “diligent” kind when it comes to school stuff. (which I don’t mind too much unless she takes it further and tries to manipulate me into doing stuff).

I'm moving to a different country for my master's this September and I want to be better there, explore, go out often, be a better student. That sort of thing. 
 
I didn't do that here because (1) convincing my dad to let me go out was such An Effort I always decided against it (2) every plan included The City that made me very anxious and I'd rather not (3) my university sucked pretty badly and had next to no events for the most part of my time there (4) the crowd at my university was quite bad as well (5) The only good time I had there was the year we had this one professor who knew what he was doing and with him, I grew so much as a student. 

I'm not as much worried about the student life, because under the right guidance I thrive as one. But I /am/ worried about not being able to go out, not being able to live life, explore and travel. I am not able to do that at my place because I live with my parents and being a girl, they can be over protective. But will I be able to change my behavior when I'm in a different country? Will I be able to go out and do things? Or will this present personality follow me there? 

I am not saying I am not willing to change, I am. I would love to go out and try things.

We never had any issue ever in all this years, until around February when my mom started talking on a daily basis about how she thinks someone is breaking in the house and the car daily as well as people following her.


At the very beginning I believed her because it's the person who raised me and I trusted her deeply. Later on she started talking about how some stuff around the house is broken and honestly now I don't know if I should believe her. A bunch of stuff she says it's been broken I just know has always been like that no matter how many times she says it wasn't, I even have pictures of very few of them proving it, some are just loose screws. But of course I don't know if everything around the house has always been like that or not, I just don't pay attention to that kind of stuff. So giving the benefit of the doubt she may be right, but knowing that she was wrong on many other occasion I get suspicious.


Anyways fast forward to last month, she starts accusing me of breaking all the stuff and even helping my dad and her previous boyfriend (who I probably met like 5 times) do so. Every day she goes on and on about how she knows it's me and everyone she asks an opinion to thinks the same.

245,"I’m 20, almost 21, living in Australia. I’m in my first year of Bachelor of Nursing. I have never felt passionate about nursing, but I’ve always thought that it’s not bad. I’ve always been very passionate about science, particularly environmental science and biology. However, I decided to go with nursing because there aren’t many good job prospects in the science areas I’m interested in, meanwhile there is a big shortage of nurses and the shortages continue to grow. The fact that I’d be able to get a job basically anywhere in the country immediately was what was most appealing about it when I chose it. 

I’m feeling very uncertain about it, however. This isn’t the first time either. I did one trimester last year and then decided to defer because I was miserable and uncertain about whether I really want to be a nurse. I decided to go back, although I wasn’t really 100% sure about it. In retrospect, a lot of it was probably due to family pressure, not my own desire to go back. 

I work in aged care as a catering assistant, so I see lots of nurses at my job and I honestly can’t see myself doing it. I can’t see myself working in a hospital either. A nursing job is either very boring and routine or too much stress and responsibility for me. 

On the other hand, I don’t know if I’d completely hate it. Realistically, it would probably be an okay job and it’d bring decent money and have good security. I think I would be a good nurse. I am a very caring person and people find it very easy to be comfortable around me.

I really don’t know how I’d survive three years of this course though. I am finding it very uninteresting overall. I hate going to the classes, the lectures are beyond boring and I’ve stopped attending those. The one subject I absolutely love and look forward to is Anatomy and Physiology. I actually attend all the labs and lectures for that subject. I dread everything else, especially the one where we do things most pertinent to nursing. This is what got me thinking that maybe I should have went with my heart and done science. 

I’d appreciate any sort of advice, whether it’s based on your personal experience, experience of others, or just your thoughts.",17Apr2019,1
247,"Hey all... first, I'm gonna apologize for the monster of a post I wrote... I didn't expect it to be this long!

Anyways, I (18 f) started college this year. After dealing with depression and anxiety for the last 4 years, I figured that this would be a nice change and I was really excited to finally move on from the regular high school bs. Well, I think I can pretty confidently say that it hasn't really worked out that way and that things are getting... worse.

As a way to save money and to avoid the discomfort of staying in the dorms, I decided to stay at home, as I'm relatively close to the school that I (thoughtlessly) chose. Things weren't really that bad during my first semester, though, I made some acquaintances in my classes (no lasting friendships) and I genuinely enjoyed most of my classes. I didn't join any clubs, though (yeah, I know, BIG mistake).

On to winter break, where my friend (who goes to college about 4 hours away) introduces me to a really nice guy who he goes to school with. I start dating him after texting for a month or so and then finally meeting in person. I really fell hard because he was just about everything I never encountered in people that I'd dated in the past - hardworking, kind, supportive and on top of that, he's been able to help me deal with my anxiety and depression. But recently, things just feel... wrong, I guess. He's constantly busy with school and work and everything else, and has been having less time for us to videochat. We talk on the phone at least once a day, but it's usually just a quick update on our days so far, or like a recap on shit that's been happening, and it's so incredibly boring. It makes me question just how much we have in common. Sometimes it makes me feel boring because I've been pretty stuck for the last few months. I also find myself disagreeing with a good amount of his ideas (whether they're political, philosophical, whatever. They always have a twinge of privilege that leaves me reeling). Despite the worries I have, I still kind of want to see where this relationship takes me. I know over the summer we'll have more time to sort things out, but it's hard when it feels so hopeless.

So back to school. Second semester starts (mid-January), and at this point I finally decide to go for a Computer Engineering degree! Exciting! I still have some trepidation about it, but it's better than nothing, I suppose. I find that my commute has really been deterring me from doing anything, along with my anxiety (which skyrockets during winter, same with my depression). Not only that, but every single one of my classes are incredibly stale and uninspiring. I've found even less potential friends in these classes, as 2 of them are online. So I'm at home a lot, with both Tuesdays and Fridays off. I mostly use those days to work or sit at home alone. Good times.

And that leads me to work. I work at a Tarbucks (Target Starbucks). It's just as miserable as it sounds. Management is a complete mess, causing my coworkers to drop like flies, and leaving me to wonder if the $12/hr is actually worth it. It's bad. People aren't being replaced and my hours are being cut despite the lack of employees. Every time I come home from work (especially on weekends) I feel like absolute shit.

Aaaand that's about it. I know that I want to transfer to a different school (the one I'm going to is wayyy too big and I need to get out of my comfort zone), and I've been looking and applying but I don't know where to go! My depression and anxiety have dissolved into a big, empty void inside of me and I feel really shitty and unsatisfied with my life. I've been avoiding schoolwork like crazy (but have been pulling enough out of my ass to get pretty consistent grades). I don't really know what to do with the days leading up to summer or how to keep myself from absolutely losing it.

When we got together I knew nothing about scizophrenia so when he told me he was manic and going through phsycosis I didn't really know what that meant I just knew he was going through a hard time.

At the moment things are so much better I have helped him get to a point were we never drink or do drugs and he's taking his medication (I know he doesn't want to be). He doesn't say paranoid things about me or accuse me of anything because I have really proved to him that I am trustworthy.I just find it really hard to help him because I have no idea what it's like.

When the officer came, he told both of us that I was completely fine to keep riding how I was riding as long as I stayed safe and didn’t endanger pedestrians.

Recently, around 2 weeks ago, as I passed him by, I flipped him off and rode off to his yelling. And now, he began filming me as I ride if he sees me. I confronted him about it, asking him why he was filming me. He deflects the question, instead telling me that it’s his right to film me and that I am breaking the law. I then tell him that last time he called the police, they told me it was fine to continue what I was doing. He continuously interrupted me anytime I tried to explain that fact to him, giving me an ultimatum of “either you are lying or you didn’t listen/misunderstood the police officer last time”. I then told him I would be reporting him to the police and went on my way, as I didn’t want to be late and waste any more time on him.


What should I do in this situation? I plan to talk to the police but I’m really not sure what they can do since technically he isn’t breaking any laws. I really want to stop his harassing and it’s very difficult to change the route I take, so that’s a last resort option.",17Apr2019,2
257,"I know my mom's not a bad person but it's just the way she handles things, like she has bad anger issues, she's shoved my brother into something a couple of times when she was angry and she threatened to knock me upside the head just like she did my brother just from me rolling my eyes at her. She also says mean things to me as she has called me a bitch (and this was when I was 11,)  she called me a whore (I was 13,), and she asked me, ""what's wrong with you!!"" After I accidentally knocked over a plate, and when she gets stressed she takes it out on me and my brother by yelling, hitting, name-calling, but what's the worst part is, is when I told her I was depressed and it was because of the name calling and the yelling, she got all defensive and said ""are you calling me a bad parent!!"" She started crying about how she worked so hard for me, she doesn't deserve this and maybe I was just being over dramatic as usual. And that was kick while I was down and she likes to be intimidating she'll get in your face. And after she called me a bitch all she did was apologize and me personally need time to cool off and be alone to get over it before I can accept it, but all she did was basically force hug me and say I'm sorry it just slipped out and then she got mad at me for hot accepting her apology and she does the same thing after she hits us she'll make us hug her and make us forgive her too. So am I just being over dramatic or are my assumptions correct?",17Apr2019,2
258,"Disclaimer: long walk for a short drink of water, check tl;dr if ya want

Recently, I (20/M) found out that a friend of mine (23/M) has been hiding at least one alternate social media account almost exclusively for posting his white nationalist views &amp; participating in the alt-right online community. We've known each other since we were pretty young, share a primary friend group, and are in quite a few groupchats together.

In one of these chats, we were joking about some funny post his girlfriend made when I noticed a strange account had shared it. It had all the signs (Pepe memes, ""ironic"" racism, etc.) of just another troll, so I made a joke about it in our chat. Didn't look into the account beyond a couple posts. Immediately my friend private messages me. He'd shared the post with the wrong account; he made it private and really wants to be sure I don't tell anyone else about it. I say I won't, and he says he hopes he can talk to me about it. That he didn't mean for any of it to be hurtful. At this point, I'm not sure why he's so worried. We all knew he was an ""edgy"" 4chan user &amp; generally a conservative guy, but our friend group had already decided we were past letting hyperpoliticization ruin our relationships. 

But I couldn't leave it alone, so I went back to the account. He'd changed the name &amp; blocked me, but the account was now back to being public and easy enough to find. After a lot of scrolling, I saw an entire subculture &amp; ideology he was essentially hiding. There were racial slurs, swastikas, coded language (""1488""), and theories of Jewish global domination. All sandwiched between completely ordinary posts reminiscent of his main account. Now I don't feel as comfortable keeping this private. Part of me wants to let it go entirely, just for the selfish sake of not ruining my relationship with him or our many mutual friends.

What should I do?

tl;dr Found a friend's alt account full of racism &amp; memes. He's asked me not to tell our mutual friends, and now idk how to handle the situation without ruining some relationships OR being quiet &amp; feeling uncomfortable hanging out with one of my oldest friends",17Apr2019,1

263,"Many years ago I had an internet friend who I had things in common with. We were 12-15 I guess when we were friends. Whilst we didn't talk continuously for a bit at times, there were times we spent a whole day talking back and forth and we knew some personal things about each other. I never knew how she felt about me but I do know she definitely saw me as a friend. A while later, we lost contact and we haven't spoken in years.

About a year or year and a half ago, I remembered her and thought I would try and look her up - knowing her name, I found her new IG account and followed her. Since my account has no personal information about me, there's no way she knows it's me. I also don't follow it closely so it's whatever.

She has changed quite a lot, in fact she doesn't seem to be the type of person I'd have chemistry with now, on top of the fact that I'm not always good at striking and maintaining conversation. I also don't want to remind her of a period of time in her life she doesn't want to remember. We've both changed and moved on in other words.

Recently however, it occured to me that we were really good friends for a time and that messaging her *could* be nice. I don't want to come off as creepy though as we come from very different places and I had to intentionally look for her in order to get her account. Weird, I don't know what to do.

264,"I'll keep this short and to the point. 3 months ago I left my mother's house after I felt unwanted and I currently live with my dad. He's always been materialistic and quite uncaring so I didn't expect much from him. 

Recently I found out (through my Mother) that he's hiding the child support payments from me. It is 500$ A month. I pay for my transporation (no car since I left my previous house), I pay for my food, make my own money and soon about to recruit to the military (in a few months). 

I did get a letter from 2002 (the year they first divorced) saying my dad has to pay child support until I'm 21 years old, no matter where I live.

I tried confronting him about it after I got evidence and he went super defensive and violent. 

I have 3 options.

1. Rent my own place. (where he'll be forced to pay the child support payments)
2. Go back to my previous house. (again, forced to pay)
3. Stay at his house and practically let him keep the money I desperately need.

On top of all this I'm currently dealing with many personal setbacks such as dropping out of high school (pursuing career), failing the last physical military test I currently took, the constant battle between my parents that usually gets directed to me, a recent breakup and more tiny details that make up the big picture.

267,"Background:  

I live in California and I graduated with a B.S. in electrical/computer engineering last May. The problem is I dislike EE/CE and honestly cannot see myself doing that for a living. I did fairly well in school (cum laude) but did not bother seeking any internships.  

About 2 months before I graduated, I was offered a job from a family friend. This dude had a new business idea and needed what was essentially a computer dude who could also develop mobile apps/programs. This guy is fairly old so he doesn't understand the difference between IT support/SysAdmin/Software Developer - to him it's all computers. He said that I could start right after graduation and would pay me the starting salary for new graduates from my major from my school (65k, EE/CE). He also said that I would be salaried, have extremely flexible working hours, and that a trip abroad once a year would be no issue (this was especially important to me). This all seemed great so I obviously took the offer.  

I graduated and started ""working"". As I said earlier, this is a new business so there was a lot of stuff that was not ready. The first month of ""work"" consisted of me driving 40 minutes to a temporary office location for a 2 hour meeting before getting to go back home. Meetings consisted of me, my boss, his secretary. My only responsibilities at this point were to create a website so after our 2 hour meeting my boss said that I could just go home and work on it whenever. I was paid in full for this month, approximately $5400 before taxes (65k/12).  

After the first month of ""work"", my boss calls my parents and says that he cannot afford to pay me in full until the business actually starts. My boss said that he could pay me 1/2 my salary and that we would only need to meet once a week until the business officially starts. My parents and my boss come from a different country and my parents explained that the reason my boss called them first instead was a cultural thing. Anyways, like I said, this was a new business idea and everything at this point was on paper. There were a bunch of issues that needed to be dealt with internally and I was later informed on these issues so I know they're not just an excuse.  

My boss's original estimate for the ""half salary limbo period"" was 3 months. Long story short, due to issues spawning issues that spawn more issues, I have been on ""half salary limbo"" for the past 9 months. My boss's most current estimate for the business ""officially starting"" is another 4 months, which triggered this post.

Now for the advice...  

I didn't see myself doing EE/CE for a living but I don't think my current situation is sustainable in the long term. The main reason I took this job and disliked an EE/CE career was due to flexibility and vacation time. I've taken biannual trips to Asia (visit family/relax) all my life every 1 or 2 years and wanted to keep this up as much as possible after getting a job. This whole situation has been weighing on my mind really heavily recently and I've been getting increasingly worried.

* If I find a ""real"" EE/CE job I will be paid ""what I'm worth"" but will lose my flexibility and be restricted to a week (or two if I'm lucky) of vacation time per year.
* If I stick with my current ""job"", I could potentially end up with a near ideal job (good pay, flexibility, vacation time).
* If my current ""job"" doesn't pan out, the longer I wait to find a ""real"" EE/CE job the harder it will be.

If I were to stick with my current ""job"" at least until the rest of this year, would it be a good idea to bring up:

* pay - the 65k starting salary was mentioned to be ""pre probation"". I think it's safe to say that after a year I've passed probation. 
* flexibility - exactly what he meant by flexibility and how it would affect things when we actually start
* vacation time - his secretary explained that was no ""real"" vacation policy and only said that a yearly trip abroad would be absolutely fine. Should I ask them to come up with a real vacation policy and get it in writing?

I really don't know which decision to make so any advice/thoughts would be greatly appreciated!",17Apr2019,1
268,"My husband has pulled me up on this a few times but sometimes when I speak to him I have that kind of tone which c**ty. That’s the best way I know how to describe it. If you know, you know. 

I don’t mean to do it. I have chronic pain which infiltrates my whole life. It’s relatively new (2015 after a workplace incident. I’m a nurse) and I’m still learning how to deal with it daily. I feel at times that I’m a burden on everyone. I’m 33 and have resigned myself to the idea that pain is just part of me now.

So please give me advice on how not to come across like a c**t when I’m in a lot of pain. I love my husband so much and he doesn’t deserve that. I’m always hyper aware of how I come across but I still find it comes out terribly. Strategies are appreciated x",17Apr2019,1
269,"I’ve always been the type to have a number of friends in a circle and thats it. In junior high, socialization was not a problem since i came from a small town. Even then I kept to myself. In senior high i also had a fixed group of people and they were pretty much who i had then. But now after a fallout with one of my shs friends it’s like theres an extra set of barriers from me and other people. I’m naturally guarded as a person but wow nowadays it’s like im extra cautious of others. 

This girl tried to talk to me and i didnt paricularly liked how she joked about me when we werent close at all lol. And so after that i tried to avoid her because i wasnt fond of her. Shes relatively nice im just not into her humor. She told me i was too sensitive. And theres some truth to that. My mom once joked about something, i forgot what, but i got pissy and didnt talk after that. She told me im too serious. There was even an argument where this came up and told me that why cant i be like my cousin who’s always laughing and smiling. Saying that didnt get her desired effect because i only became more guarded.

My seatmate in physics lecture, xavier, joked about something. The prof was late and someone was blasting music. We were singing along and he joked suddenly, “why r u copying me”. I didnt know how to react so i just shut up. I sensed that he was uncomfortable when he noticed i stopped singing. Hes a nice guy, but sometimes i cant tell when people are joking or just being rude or mean to me. And it’s frustrating because the people around here banter with humor like that, and so i dont really talk to them much. Sometimes people r rude to me and i dont notice it until when the moment’s gone.

Heres another thing, sometimes i try to react to their jokes, but they end up thinking im too affected when i feel nothing. Like im saying these stuff, im just trying to react. Im not actually offended. But the way my awkward actions translate, it becomes like im really affected.

I can list more but honestly it’s all the same story. Im trying to piece together why i react this way. But all i can remember is in sixth grade, i got boobs early. And i was the only one in my class who had them. The boys taunted me to no end, especially in PE class. And i just smiled it off and didnt realize i was being bullied. Some tried to hug me when i was just walking, i karate chopped his neck but that was it. Their humor was also poking fun at my acne, which back then i had some, also because of early puberty. I didnt know how to react then and i still have those memories in my heart and i want that to not happen again so maybe thats why im like this.

I know it already sound awful.

Years passed and I still was madly ""in love"" with her but last year I stopped trying to contact her or anyone related to her and I kinda stopped liking her at all.

Now, about a month ago we started talking again, idk why but then I had a dream with her and I started liking her again slowly, but then she stopped replying. I didn't told anyone about my feelings and I acted the same way that got me to talk to her so I have no idea why the sudden change of attitude, she did this before, when it was clear that I liked her but it took me off guard.

What can I do to just get over get?
I know there's no chance to be together or anything like that so I at least want to move on.


I want to clarify just in case that someone got something wrong that even tho I was really obsessed with her I never did something that would be considered creepy and she was always really nice, in fact she's one of not the nicest person I've ever met. It's just that she's never interested in me.

The thing that gets me the most frustrated is that I don't even know if she dislikes me or not, since she says that it's not on purpose and has said that I'm silly for thinking she dislikes me, that she wouldn't be so nice to me if that were the case. But it bugs me that as far as I can tell I'm the only one in our friend group who she forgets to answer or who she lacks interest.

Maybe I just don't want to accept reality and that's why I debate so much over this

My friend/roommate and I were watching a show tonight that they just got me really into, so I've been super pumped to watch it with them but after one episode they said they were finished and wanted to go to their room to work on stuff. (They're a freelancer so they usually get their stuff done at night while I have a day job, so we only really get to hang out in the evenings.) 

The show had just got to an intense part so I was really excited about watching one more episode, but they refused and left. Pretty bummed, I tried watching it by myself but it wasn't nearly as enjoyable so I turned it off and went to take a shower to head to bed. 

A little later I was scrolling through twitter and saw a bunch of tweets from them and their other friend being excited to watch this same exact show tonight, then more tweets of their reaction to it and how much fun they were having. I shot my friend a few dm's and got ignored, but the tweets about the show kept going. I hate to admit it but it really hurt. I don't wanna seem clingy or jealous or anything aka I don't wanna say anything like ""So you'd rather watch with them than me?"", but my first instinct is to not ask to watch the show with them in the future if they'd prefer to watch it with their other friend instead.

I met my now fiance but also go used and abused by the people I thought were my friends. By the time my fiance and I got away from my now ex friends we were broke, had nothing but the clothes on our backs and were in debt which we're still paying off now. My fiance and I since then have been homeless 5 times and have been unable to keep a roof over our heads due to low income and ending up in houses that are on the edge of falling down. We are due to move into our 6th house in 4 years tomorrow. We can barely afford rent without groceries, bills and medical expenses as well.

I have bipolar disorder and attention problems (psychiatrist is still working on what kind, either way he's treating it with medication that helps.) With the bipolar comes mood swings, I will encounter depressive episodes where I have very little motivation, even to do small things like so the dishes. With the medication and therapy, It's gotten a lot more manageable, though; I can now pull myself out of bed to go to classes and the theater I perform in. They're rare for me, but I also have manic episodes, where I lose a lot of my inhibition. Being the lighthearted person I am, this usually results in spontaneous trips to a theme park, dyeing my hair, inviting everyone to mini golf... All ""youthful"" things. In regards to my attention problems, through self awareness and therapy, I have learned to listen and contribute to a conversation, instead of the classic ADHD curse of just wanting to spit something out. Mostly it presents in my natural way of laterally thinking; ""this reminds me of this which reminds me of-"" and it all happens so fast. Luckily, I've learned to utilize this for humour and carrying on a conversation instead of blurting out nonsquitors as I used to. It was very, VERY hard to do, and to those of you who do that, I totally get it. It's okay; I worked on changing it because I wanted to, not because it's the ""right thing to do.""

All of this also leads to impacting my love life; I'm attractive, funny, and smart, and I know that and have been told that. People constantly ask me why I don't have a significant other, and here's why: people don't generally see me as a romantic or sexual being capable of a healthy adult relationship. I practice and use honestly, communication, and boundaries, in all of my relationships; all friendships now. I confront problems and work as a team to solve them, not be passive aggressive and spiteful. 
It is very rare that I have romantic feelings for someone, and very rare for someone to have them for me. Of course, the outcome is as you'd expect: nothing ever lines up. And from an experience I had in my youth, I will never, never ""settle"" again, no matter how many times I'm told ""just give him a chance! Stop being picky!""

It doesn't help that I'm an only child and am constantly bombarded by my parents trying to do things for me, or even trying to tell me I can't do something. I live in a state half the country away from them. I pay bills and do taxes. 

I'm so tired of being treated like I have no life experience, that my emotions and opinions are not as serious because I'm ""young"" and will ""live and learn"" (I'm talking teens here, I know 24 is still young). (And trust me, I have seen and been through so much shit.)

I don't know how to TL;DR this. If you've read this monster of a post, I greatly appreciate you listening. And god, please help me. I just want to be taken seriously.",17Apr2019,1

Im now living out of my car in a state where not only is it illegal to sleep in your vehicle but the cost just to exist is punitively expensive.

Ive always wanted to move to somewhere more affordable, i feel i have a decently solid resume, an associates degree, and whatever was left in my vacation fund but i have no friends or family in the continental US. The plan was to hopefully land a job and fly out, buy a car and work/sleep out of it until i can save up enough to rent a house and ship my dogs but budget wise a dud car will ruin me.

They talk quite a lot and my bf acts diffrently like he is trying to be a comedian (Meme intended) and it also seems that he and his gf have a sort of more a romantic talk, but when he talks to my gf on the other hand, it seeks he enjoys talking to her. 3.

293,"Hello, 21F here and in need of some advice...

I have a large group of friends at university, and within that I became part of a small group of girls, and for a while the four of us did everything together. For the first time I felt like I had a really solid group of friends, and I've struggling with making friends in the past, especially with other girls.

The three others do the same course and I do a separate one, until one of them changed their course. So often conversations would come up about lectures and work etc, that I just wouldn't understand, but I was fine and didn't think much of it.

We also became friends because all of our partners were in the same larger friend group, and were all close friends too, so we kinda came together to have some time away from our partners - we were all a little too reliant on our boyfriends and wanted to become more independent. However, one by one those relationships ended, and we still stuck by each other and supported each other - I also struggle with Bipolar II and they were the first people, apart from my partner at the time, that I actually opened up to about the struggles.

The problems started when I began seeing someone new. He was in our larger circle of friends, so we decided not to tell many people until some time had passed and we knew things were serious. It was quite close to my breakup, but I spoke with my ex beforehand and had a long talk about seeing other people, ultimately deciding we were okay with it - we're still good friends and when we broke up, although it was painful, we both agreed that we would remain friends no matter what happened. 

My new partner had told a couple close friends about our new relationship, so I decided I would open up to my group. I met up with one of them that day, l'll call her Friend A, and decided I would tell her as I wanted to talk about it in person, rather than just over text. As I was telling her, she told me not to tell one of the girls in our group, Friend B. She said she felt she didn't trust her not to tell anyone as this Friend B's partner was very close to my partner and their friends, so thought that something would be said. Fair enough, I decided I'd talk to my partner first about it. 

However, Friend B found out beforehand from her boyfriend and confronted me about it, saying it was unfair being the last to know anything. I made sure not to throw Friend A under the bus and didn't mention she had adviced me not to say anything. I just apologised and tried to move on. Bearing in mind Friend C also exists, and knew even less than Friend B as she had been away from university quite a bit.

From then on, they started ignoring my messages. I tried to brush it off, saying they were busy or simply had nothing to say, but they would respond to each other in group chats consistently, right up until I said something. We would meet up in person and still I would be ignored by all of them. I tried my hardest to have a good time with them, but every time I would just end up being left behind. Soon they were making plans without me and I wouldn't know about them until I'd see something on social media.

This went on for about a month or so, until I finally decided to confront Friend B about it - I figured we were the only ones who ever had an argument, so maybe this has stemmed from her. I asked her what was going on, and if I had done something wrong all I wanted to do was apologise and move on, and try and repair the friendship. I loved my friends, and I'd had so many great memories with them. I really wanted to repair whatever damage I had done.

It got left on seen, and they're all ignoring me completely. It's like I don't exist to them now.

What should I do from here? Should I keep trying to get an answer or just leave it and move on?

TL:DR - My group of close friends have cut me off after I confronted them over how they had been treating me differently and I wanted to try and repair things. I don't know what to do from here.",17Apr2019,1
294,"Hello, I'm 16M and my sister is 35F because she is my half sister we are very connected and I consider her as my mom..

All this started months ago, when she was diagnosed with breast cancer stage 2, I was shocked.. I couldn't believe but i didn't understood it fully until she started taking chemotherapies and just seeing her being in pain alone made me feel so horrible that I can't help her, one day in my school I just had panic attack for the first time in my life and I couldn't breathe I couldn't move my hands. I was lost.. teacher just told me to breathe but I couldn't I always seen her in my eyes in front of me dying slowly and I wasn't there to support her. Everyday of my life, I would've come and see her in my bed feeling down, I would've just hug her and tell her that I love her so much.. this time is different.. she finished and removed her both breasts and it impacted on our lives, I can't say that I was happy that she doesn't feel beautiful anymore, but I was making sure she does. I remember making custom box with cancer survivors badge and many more gifts and wrote emotional letter when her bday was, to let her know that I love her more than myself honestly. 

Today, i heard from my mom she came in my room crying and saying ""Sister has to go on chemotherapy again, she has three cancers in her neck that are stage three"", I'm very smart child in my family and I know a lot about cancer and I have so many books to become an  oncologist. I just stunned there losing my words.. I didnt wanted to cry but then my mom said ""If something happens to me, please protect your sister and referring to my brother too who's my sister's  age"".. I hold my tears and when she left, i just turned and cried my eyes out trying to understand why her again? Why it isn't me? Why ? 

Today, I heard doctor on call with my and sister over Skype and she said, its battle between life and death because she already have big scars and impact on her body, and chemotherapy will possible destroy everything that she has currently good in her body. 

I live In Bosnia and Herzegovina, we don't have that much of equipment for proper patient we barely treat cancer, considering my mom has to pay things and my parents doesn't even work, and I tried finding a job but I can't as my country doesn't let me as I'm only 16.. 

Please how do I cope with this? I can hope, I know that but let's be real here, we all know how cancer takes people away, why can't we just stop cancer and not let this happen  to anyone anymore..  I just, tears falling won't stop this for me, but I'm lost in my head.

295,"On the phone, you know the drill.

So before I begin, I guess I should provide some context. I'm an 18 year old girl who recently joined the gym, doing so allowed me to meet 'P' who was a personal trainer for this gym. I am also someone who is very shy and doesn't speak up very often and I know I did something stupid. So don't call me out for it 😭

So in February, P came up to me as I was doing some general exercises and he introduced himself, stating that he always did with new members. I was fine with it and we chatted about why I was coming here and what I wanted with my membership - all that jazz. Now with this gym,  signing up came with 2 free sessions of personal training with anyone and so P invited me to try it out with him. I accepted.

Now this was fine, I went to each session and came out very sore but I did see some changes in only 2 weeks. And so, P pulled me into the office and sat down with me to discuss if I wanted to keep training with him. Now I was all for it, I was seeing results in just 2 weeks and I couldn't imagine what I would see in 2 months. So when he asked if I wanted to continue, I said yes and he pulled out a contract.

This should have been my first warning. None of the other personal trainers (who my brother and some of my friends have gone with) never had to sign a contract. I thought it would be a pay as you go kinda thing so I was confused. He explains to me that it's a 6 month contract for a minimum of once a week, and if I need to cancel a session then I need to provide a doctors certificate and give 24 hours notice. At this point I was with a friend and dead set I looked at her as if to say ""wtf is this?"". When he finishes explaining it to me, he then goes on about how if I want to see results then I need to come twice a week. He was very pushy about it and demandind, when I was saying I wasn't too sure because of my lack of time and money he was like"" no worries, we can sign you up and you can see how you go""

You know what my dumb ass did. I signed it, because I felt bad and didn't want to say no. I am an actual dead set dick head because holy shit this has been the worst 2 months of my life so far. I wish I was exaggerating.

Because little did I know, each session was $50. HE MADE ME SIGN UP FOR TWICE A WEEK - THAT IS ONE HUNDRED FUCKING DOLLARS A WEEK. I state again, I am an 18 YEAR OLD, UNIVERSITY STUDENT. I can't even afford the weekly gym fee let alone another $100 on top. Yall I tried to get out of it straight away, although I did have actual excuses. Work was lacking on shifts meaning I was barely getting paid $200 a week and after a whole month of begging him (even though he told me face to face that I could ALWAYS drop down to one session a week) he let me 'try out' one session a week.

He is constantly degrading me, saying that I need to 'get my act together' and ask for more shifts at work - as if I'm not already doing that asshole - and has the audacity to say that I'm breaking the contract by doing one session a week instead of two. He also had the audacity to tell me to stop giving my mum board money (which pays for my phone and helps with bills) to pay him?? 

I just want some advice because the contract was weird, he told me a 6 month contract needs a minimum of one visit a week which is what I'm doing!? And he was the one that pressured me into doing two?

I'm dead set close to faking my own death so I don't have to go anymore. I don't have fucking time for it nor the money and he literally doesn't give a shit despite telling me ""his customers' financial stability is the most important thing to him"".

300,"I live with my bf and his parents, and we have three other tenants. Recently one of the tenants moved out so my bf’s parents advertised the room and this new lady moved in. She uses the bathroom for long periods of time but I never hear her doing anything. No running water, brushing teeth. General bathroom sounds. 

We have a room just for the toilet, and the bathroom only has a sink and the bath, mirrors and my cat’s litter box. She has a large mirror in her own room so not sure what she’s doing in there for a good half an hour. But recently I’ve started hearing the litter in the box moving, even though my cat is in my room with me.

I could hear the lady go into the bathroom and pull the door to, and then hear the litter being moved - I wondered if my cat had used the box and she thought she’d quickly scoop the mess - but I didn’t hear her then go to the toilet to flush it (flushable litter).

This sound can go on for a good five minutes, never hear her flush it, or bag it, and then she’ll go back to her room or go downstairs to make herself food. When I’ve checked the litter box there’s been no mess, and the scoop is always as clean as I’ve left it. If anything it’s looking like litter is... going missing? 

We have a dog and she rarely goes upstairs, and never goes in the bathroom, so she won’t get to the box and eat it - but I’m genuinely thinking this lady is eating my cat’s litter, or playing with it.

I’ve mentioned it to my bf and he just said “maybe she likes litter in her cereal,” but what if she’s actually playing with the litter or, even worse, eating it? Everyone in the house speaks Polish, bf is fluent in English and Polish and his parents speak little English - so I can’t talk to the lady directly.

Should I bring it up at all, or allow this lady to keep doing whatever it is she’s doing with my cat’s litter box?",17Apr2019,125

307,"The short version is : my boyfriend's brother ruined a concert I was looking forward to, and showed no remorse for it.

Now for the long version:
Four years ago I found out that a singer that I've liked since I was little was going to do a concert in my city. I was ecstatic. My city is not usually included in major tours and I didn't have enough money to fly to another one for a concert. So when I found out, I actually did a little happy dance. The tickets were going on sale at 12pm the next day. At 12:00 and 30 seconds I already had them reserved.
I told my father how excited I was for the concert amd he asked me what the venue will be. When I told him, he said he knew the manager of it, and that he could call in a favor and get us some tickets. Free tickets? Of course I was interested, those weren't cheap. 

The day of the concert came, and my father calls me to say that guy actually brought one extra access bracelet (I originally asked for two, for me and my boyftien). So if I wanted to, I could get another friend to join. This was three hours before the access gates opened, so time was a bit tight to find someone. But it was a free ticket, so how difficult could it be?

I thought I will ask my boyfriend's brother to join us. The relationship was still pretty new, so I didn't have a chance to spend much time with his brother. Figured it was a pretty good opportunity. I asked my boyfriend to call him, and he accepted. Told him to be there before the access gates opened so we will be able to get good spots. Again, it was the concert I've looked forward to most. Ever. 

My boyfriend and I got there 2 hours before the gates opened. We were pretty far ahead in line.  Time passed, amd the brother didn't show up. The time for the gates to be opened came, and he still wasn't there. Thankfully, the gates opened 30 minutes late. However, he still wasn't there. We got in, figured we will get some good spots and then one of us will meet with the brother outside to give him his bracelet. 30 more minutes passed. Finally, the phone rang. He was outside. An hour late. 

My boyfriend left to give him his bracelet. 5 minutes later, I get a call. They wouldn't let him back in to the area in front of the stage. I went to see what was going on and when I got to the gates, I was forcibly pulled outside by a volunteer. Turns out there were other people who got what I found out to be volunteer bracelets and they stopped letting them in to the area in front of the stage. 

First, I tried bargaining. Maybe they will let us go back. They wouldn't. Security told us they were doing us a favor even by not kicking us out. Then, I got angry. Then, I got sad. We spent the first quarter of the concert trying yo find a solution to get back in. We were only allowed to stay at the gates, in the far back. 
The next quarter of the concert I spent trying not to cry. 

This wouldn't jave been that bad though. It was a missed concert because I tried to save some money. But what really angered me what the brother's reaction. Again, he got there an hour late and he was the reason why we hat to go outside and we weren't let back in. His answer?

 ""Well, you should be thankful, you wouldn't have been able to find someone who wanted to go on such a short notice.""

He also never said thank you for the invite, or for the free ticket.

I was fuming. Even now, when I remember that night my blood boils. He never said sorry, or thank you, or anything along those lines. For half a year I avoided him at all cost, I was afraid I will start a fight with him. 
Now we are on talking terms, but I can't say we are exactly friends (not because of that night though, he just is a pretty difficult person).

After so long, I had hoped I would be able to let things go, but I can't. When I hear those singer's songs I remember that concert and my mood sours.

308,"My boyfriend and I have been together for a few years now. We called last night, and my entire perspective on him changed since that call.

When we called I told him I would have to be going in a bit because my mom wanted to talk to me. He asked me why I couldn’t talk to her sooner, and I said I don’t know. He said “your mom is probably hoeing around and getting fucked” and then he laughed about it for about 5 minutes. He started talking about my moms ass too.. 

I was silent at first, mostly because I was shocked and didn’t know how to respond. He’s never said anything like that about my mom. Some guys at my school have talked sexually about my mom because she’s younger and pretty. 

I told him I felt uncomfortable and that what he said was highly disrespectful. He told me it was only a joke. I know it was a joke, but I just don’t see how it’s funny in my opinion. Thinking about my mom in that way and hearing that from my own boyfriend just disgusts me. Our argument went on for about 30 minutes, and I was getting tired of it so I told him I had to go. No matter what I told him, he said he didn’t care about how I felt because it was only a joke. He told me I was overreacting.

I honestly don’t even want to talk to him at this point. This would be a really stupid reason to break up, but he hasn’t apologized or even considered how I felt uncomfortable. I’m not putting up with it.

I dont want to get too much into detail but i had a lot of trauma, and i find it hard to be 'normal' i guess. Having connections with people, school etc, keeping jobs etc. So I've changed my direction. I want to go into a dental assisting course through collage, instead of an type of arts degree at uni. There is an easter promotion that is giving $500 off if I sign up tomorrow. But I'm scared. If I sign up now it's still 2500 that I cant get back and my mental health is so bad right now. Should I just do it or wait until I'm ready? What if I wait too long and just dint ever find the motivation? What if I start it and fail and then I am $2500 in debt to my parents who I already owe money to. There's also the factor that I could be trained on the job at a dental clinic.. but chances are slim as they are hard to find in my very small city.",17Apr2019,1

And Thurs. for example, and then my final failed strategy is working on 2 different courses each day but all week with a minimal of 4 assignments completed in a day. I try, and I try but no matter what these failed strategies leave me frustrated, and overwhelmed. But I've got a new strategy that might just work but I'm not sure yet.

318,"Hello, I’ve just turned 14 years old and I’m in year 9 in highschool. I am really really insecure about my teeth. My bottom teeth are fine and straight, but my top teeth stick out far (but my lip still barely covers them) and I have rather large gaps between my two front teeth and the ones next to them.

This has become a really big problem for me, my sibling all have perfect teeth which is so annoying because they make fun of mine. That alone has made my self confidence go from a 3.5 to a -18.

I’m so insecure, I barely talk to anyone. I have a few friends, but that’s it! I’m the quiet one in the group, and it’s annoying because people (in my school) always ask me “wHy DoN’T yOu EVer TaLk” and I’m not sure how to reply so I just shrug and smile it off. 

Baring mind that, I NEVER smile with my teeth showing, and I look stupid smiling with just my lips.

(Irrelevant story, you can skip if you want)||

When I was in year 6 (before highschool,  10/11 years old) I went to the orthodontics, and I had this old man as a dentist, he gave me this retainer to stretch my jaw out. I would almost all the time wear it, but I hated it. When I would go to school because I’m so quiet and I never contribute in class, teachers would always pick on me to answer a question when I don’t have my hand up. With those retainers in I was just a slobbery mess, I could not speak at all, and before the class started I even gave the teacher a note to ask her not to pick on me as I cannot talk properly. Anyways she picked on me, I had a big lisp, and the whole class laughed. That wasn’t the only problem, when I would have to wear them, I would have to clean them often, and they smelled so bad, I was gagging when I put them back into my mouth after eating, I washed them and they still smelled bad! 

(Back to what I was saying) ||

So I stopped going to that orthodontist because I was scared of him, he would ALWAYS shout at me, and I was a good girl so I didn’t like getting scolded from anyone other than my parents. So I’m recently going to this new orthodontist, I was put on the waiting list for a year, but apparently they (the dentist) forgot to put me on the waiting list, and now I have to wait another 9 months, by that time I’ll be in year 10, I will be forced to speak more for presentations, and I’m so worried.

320,"My father had been cheating on my mother since I was 16. Me and my sister both knew about this back then because they had a fight in front of us. However, we brushed it off at the moment and pretended it stopped. Now my sister had found out (I don't know how) that it's happening again and told me during a phone call. She is affected by it greatly. 

Back then, I was a fat ugly teen and my father was worried I'll never find a boyfriend or be liked by anyone. So, he tricked me to go to an appointment with a woman that was very makeup savvy and who gave me advice on being ""sexy"". They told me to not tell my mother but she found out and got mad. I saw this woman three times in total and I've learnt about her that she has a child with my father's ex boss. I know my father is in touch with her for work related stuff, but I suspect she is the mistress (he had too much of a good opinion over her appearance and makeup to the point where I felt weird about her). 

My sister does not want to see our father ever again. My mom knows but pretends nothing happened - ""men are just like that"". I'm sure if I confronted my father he would tell me something along the lines of ""men are like that"". 

I refuse to think men are like that (my bf comes from a single parent household and he would never do anything like that). And even if many of them were, that won't make it any better. I can pretend nothing happens and leave my parents do their ""traditional"" marriage thing, but I can't erase my sister's memory. Easter is coming and I have no idea how we will have a family meal if we cannot talk to each other anymore.

He is retiring and wants to groom his successor over the next five years.  He reached out and expressed a desire to hire me with the expectation that I'd work under him, learn and eventually take over the company.  We are having further discussions in a few weeks but he indicated he'd pay me significantly more then I'm currently making as he felt my skillset is a good match.  I was very surprised by the offer and my gut tells me to go for it.

My reservations are that I work with my in-laws and don't want them to think I bailed on them.  It will also require an hour and ten minute commute as it's in the town I grew up in and not where I live.  My kids are school age and I don't feel comfortable moving them...is this commute doable?

I guess I really feel guilty about leaving my inlaws but at the same time I know I'm down the food chain there and think this opportunity doesn't come along very often.  What kind of set me on the path of leaving was when I had been approached by a client to gauge my interest in joining their in-house department.  My father in law commented why would the ask me and not his daughter, he thought it was weird.  In a way I took it as as though he thought she deserved it more then I.

327,"I’m going to try to condense this story as much as possible, I would really appreciate any and all advice. 

For reference I’m a single mom (25) to a wonderful 5 year old son who is the light of my life. I’m not an unfit mother in any way, and up until recently I’ve been the sole support for the both of us. I had my proverbial shit together for the longest until I made a bold move, quit my well paying job to pursue my dream career. Have I taken a severe financial hit? Yes. Has it affected my ability to parent? Not in the slightest. 
Last August when I quit my social work job, I found another job in a completely different city and decided to move there with my son. We moved in with some of my biological family members and they ended up being rather abusive towards me, and I had to get out of that situation fast. I contacted who I’m going to refer to as A, about moving back to where we originally came from and her possibly keeping my son for a little while until I got back on my feet (found a job, a place for us to live, etc ). She suggested that we just move in with her and we live as a family. A watched my son for 2 years while I worked basically, I had initially hired her as my baby sitter but with my weird shift work hours, it ended up that my son stayed the night at her place a lot, so we operated like a family already. It made sense and up until last night things have been ok. We have a really good system that works for us, her and her husband and their daughter really are like family to my son and I. We rely on each other for so much it really does take all 3 of us parents to make it work. All three of us work and contribute to the household in some form or fashion. 
Last night a conversation kind of took an unusual turn. A said she wants to adopt my son. Didn’t give a real reason. When she asked, I immediately said no. I explained that in the event that I get married again, the man I marry may very well want to adopt my son and I want to keep that option available. She said “you know you’re never gonna get married again, you’re not that type.” I have several problems with that statement, but I’m pretty sure that’s a power play for her to try to get her way. I reiterated no, I’m not ok with it but she kept pushing. 
This whole situation truthfully makes me really uncomfortable and it irks me to high hell that she won’t take no for an answer. This is MY son. How do I approach this situation from now on? I don’t want to ruin the relationship I have with A, but this is something that could make me pack my bags and leave.

330,"Okay to begin with and give this some context, my girlfriend and her mom have both recently moved out and are enjoying their apartment. My girlfriend makes nearly double what I make because she’s 18 being able to work 39 hours at a higher pay rate. I make around $200 most weeks. (Generally work 23 hours a week) I am also 17 and i genuinely am interested in finances and have been and have been educating myself as far as how to be smart with my money. With that being said I’ve come to the realization that her mom isn’t particularly the best with money either, she’s a paralegal, (two years experience) but then I’m told she doesn’t make $20 an hour however I’ve found that the average base pay is $41k a year for a family law paralegal who is starting out, however the math doesn’t seem to workout because she normally works 40 hour weeks and it simply doesn’t quite add up to $41k at $19 an hour. The rent is $1300 a month plus utilities I’m sure, of course other expenses such as food and her insurance and gas need to be accounted for. However my girlfriend is paying almost $900 of that rent this month, and has to make another $180 payment for insurance and phone. $1080 out of $1600 without even taking gas into the equation there’s $520 a month for her to put gas in her car and try and save. the issue at hand is the rent was originally told to my girlfriend $500 a month, then went up to $600 plus her $180 a month which is reasonable. The first month bill is due soon and she’s being expected to pay again $900 of the $1300 rent. Is it that they moved into a place they simply cannot afford or is my girlfriend being taken advantage of? And if so how would I go about approaching her to figure something out? Or both?

332,"For simplicity we'll name my friend ""Tree""

Tree and I haven't known each other for too long, however we've grown really close over the past couple months to the point where she opened up and told me that her parents; Primarily her step-mother (which we'll name Fee); is abusive. I am a naturally sceptical person so I was unsure what fell under her umbrella of abusive and didn't pursue further for specifics. For what I presume to be her fear of her controlling parents, Tree was very adamant that they her parents couldn't find out that we were seeing each other. 

So there are two times I've encountered her.

The first time I saw her is when we were at a parent-teacher interviews. Tree and I were relaxing on the school grounds for a couple hours whilst it was going on. Anyway, Tree gets a call from Fee and demands to know where she is, which in response she tells Fee that shes at parent-teacher interviews. Tree offers Fee to come down and join her at parent teacher interview out of fear that shes onto her. Once Fee arrives, Tree distances herself from me and her entire attitude changes. Tree becomes very submissive and quiet as Fee goes around literally interrogating her friends, to which they note Fee as being ""terrifying"" and ""scary"". I didn't get to talk to Tree again that day.

The second encounter was today. I went to go see Tree after she got off work where we'd hang out for a while at a nearby park, which is what we'd usually do. These times are often short and brief considering the amount of time it took to get to her work, but its worth seeing her. However unlike the other times, Fee emerges from the corner and confronts Tree and I. It was at that moment when I felt everything spiral out of control. I introduced myself in a friendly manner, but Fee goes on about how their trust in Tree was broken. I was stupid and challenged her (calmly of course) trust and how Fee never had trust in Tree in the first place. I turned to Tree to ensure I'm not fucking everything up, and that's when I notice it. The extent of her abuse. I was wrong to doubt her. She had turned white pale, I've never seen anything like it. Maybe it was the fear, but when I asked if I could talk with Tree, she wouldn't talk to me. 

The last thing Tree said before she left was, ""Ill see you on Tuesday"". But judging from the gentle(?) tone in her voice, she'll likely be punished tonight. I just don't know what to do to fix things. Tree says she's willing to run away, but shes afraid of what her father will do. There were so many things I could have done to make things go smoother, so many things to make it go smoother.

So I ask Reddit, what can I do to help Tree?",17Apr2019,408
333,"So I’m (17F) a junior in high school and I’m wondering whether neuroscience is a good field to major in. My parents heard from their friends that neuroscience is essentially similar to biology, where most jobs are spent doing research in a lab with mediocre pay. For them, biomedical engineering is the way to go. I tried doing my research online but I can’t seem to find anything that successfully proves the fast growth of neuroscience. 

TL;DR: Unless I’m to become a doctor, my parents believe that neuroscience would be a useless degree to have. What they want me to do, though, is to major in something like biomedical engineering that is “sure to be in high demand.”

I was 17/18 I cant remember but it was in that area So about 5 ago my younger brother was playing a online game, this game had a online community on a Facebook page. There was one user who became almost a ""cult hero"". I will refer to him as X. X definitely was on the autistic spectrum as well as some other disability's probably mild downs and Asperger's. X was also deaf, the reason I bring this up is because my brother in an attempt to annoy me gave X my number. 

X called me on video chat and proceeded to make funny faces and sounds, he would keep doing this everyday for a few weeks. It was quite entertaining and I'm sure he enjoyed winding me up.

Fast forward a few more weeks and X has posted a explicit picture of himself in his bathroom. This post was made on his Facebook feed so anyone who was X's friend could see it &amp; depending on his privacy settings anyone could have seen it. 

I know of this because my brother 14Yr at the time sent it to me. Now the context to which that picture was shared was not sexual in anyway, it was purely suppose to be somewhat funny.

I proceeded to take a screenshot of said picture and send it to my friends in a Facebook group chat who also knew of X and ""prank calls"". Again this was suppose to be one of those shock images for a quick laugh.

It has only dawned on me recently how bad this was. I have never committed a crime before in my life, (No parking violations, no speeding, nothing.)

So S was like “ok do you want to bet a dollar how long H and The Kid will last?” And I was like “I don’t have a dollar” and S was like “Fine a quarter”.

To some extent it's true, but I do not feel fear as much as confusion and frustration. I don't know exactly how I feel actually.

343,"Hello! So I have been interning for a big company (an MNC) for around 1 month now and I don't know how I'll survive the next 5 months (6 month internship).

I'm overworked and overloaded on a daily basis, but I'm unsure if I should tell my supervisor about this. The reason being that they already are giving me the ""easier"" tasks to do, but I still think it's way too much for me to handle. It doesn't help that when I ask questions, they seem to be more annoyed than actually willing to help.

This started happening on the second week, they just suddenly flooded me with things to do. I don't even have the time to go to the toilet.

344,"Tl;dr  -  I don’t know what subjects to take to ensure I have a stable future with a decent amount of career options and I need help deciding 


I will not disclose my age but I have no idea what I would want to take up as a career, therefore I am not sure what courses/subjects I should take. 

I like the creative aspects such as art, design and creative writing - but I don’t want to pursue it as the job stability isn’t very good. I am slightly above average in the core subjects such as maths, science and english, but I dislike them all (I am in an extended group at school - but we are not that different from mainstream so I wouldn’t call myself “smart” or “special”)

I want to take a wide variety of subjects so I can guarantee that I end up with a good future with a lot of options. I will definitely be taking maths, but I am unsure about the other subjects I should take. I’ve been told that doing at least one of the sciences (bio, chem, phys) is essential and that english literature is important (over english language - creative writing). I might take up business, but I’m not sure. Doing at least one creative subject would be nice.

Also, I’m definitely not going to do any social sciences such as geography or history because I do not see myself doing anything of that field in the future. 

We are allowed to choose 5 subjects. If for some reason this is important in anyway, I am doing CIE (Cambridge International Examinations).

350,"Sorry for the long post, TLDR at the bottom. 


To give context; I’m a 19yr old male and my mom is 55. Over the last 10 years she has had a number of different low level jobs. She is working in a call centre now, 9-5 and making minimum wage. It is simply not enough money. 


We live in an okay enough area, not great but not the worst in a pretty shitty apartment, we are both miserable living here. She doesn’t own a car (last one got written off and she can’t afford a new one). She is also in debt from bank loans and owns family members money (all up probably 3-4k). 


I buy all my own food and personal necessities and also sometimes household necessities (washing detergent, soap etc) because if I don’t then these things won’t be replaced. She often eats some of the food I buy, because I tell her to since I would rather have it come out of my own pocket and have her not eat noodles and eggs everyday


This creates a cycle that is hard to break as some of you may know. She has been trying to get a new, higher paying job for months but she has low confidence in herself, she doesn’t even apply to simple jobs such as reception because she believes she is not qualified. In the last few months she has been having on average an interview a week but never gets the job, which I know is because she doesn’t sell herself highly enough. This doesn’t make sense to me because she has worked in multiple industries in the past including reception (receptionist jobs are pretty common here and most pay more than what she gets now). 


I have tried many times in many different ways to encourage her that she is good enough to get a better job and tried to relate to her situation with the ‘fake it til you make it’ approach as I have done to get jobs before. But I do this to no effect. 


It is extremely frustrating for me to see her be at such a low point where the only way to go is up yet stagnate and go nowhere. It impacts me greatly because for starters I just want her to be financially secure and happy which will in turn make me happy. Also she is usually in a down mood (She is not actually depressed, we both know this for fact) after work and says things like “life sucks” etc which really makes me angry because 95% of jobs pay better than what she has now and don’t require experience or very little experience and would improve her quality of life in many aspects. 


I am fine with paying for my own food (I eat a lot due to lots of exercise/training) but feel as if I shouldn’t have to be paying for things such as washing detergent, hand soap, tissues, toilet paper etc. I don’t make much as a poor uni student so it’s not easy for me. 


Our lease runs out in a couple months and we are going to have to move into somewhere worse and in a more difficult area (travel wise) which is going to suck. My timetable this semester was shit but i will be working as soon as I finish which is about 6-7 weeks so I would be willing to pay board to live somewhere a bit better. 

Sorry for the long write up and incontinuity my brain is fried right now. If anyone has some advice on what I could do to help her help herself in this situation I would greatly appreciate it, thanks.

I'm a 19 year old guy in my second semester in college and I'm beyond lost. Not like, a little lost. Just completely and utterly clueless. I grew up pretty poor, so I knew since I was a kid I wanted to make a lot of money. I realize it sounds shallow but I've known for years how nasty it is to go to bed hungry. In high school I got lucky and managed to get an internship at a certain company that paid me pretty nicely, and I used that money to go to real estate school on top of my college classes. I'm not scared of working hard but I just have no idea what I want to do. I thought for a long time I wanted to enter the world of finance but the cutthroat and competitive nature of it didn't jive with me. I don't want to compete with my coworkers, I want to help people. I thought about switching to computer science because it pays well and the job is secure, working with logic sounds fun and all that, but I don't know if I'd enjoy it because I frankly don't have enough experience with it. I thought about engineering because building things also sounds badass, but the obvious difficulty that comes with it could make me lose my scholarship and mean I couldn't keep going to college.

I still live with my family (I’m 22) and when I work morning shifts (8-4) I have to get up early and shower before my brother gets up so as to avoid clashing heads and getting in each other’s way. Well this morning my stomach was bugging me super bad, but I went ahead and left for work because my brother was in the bathroom. Bad idea. I made it onto the interstate, and there are 3 exit ramps that you can get off of to get back into my town from the interstate, and I normally get on the interstate on the one in the middle. Stomach is still bothering me. I make it past the third one and realize there is a problem, my stomach is burning and I have to make it to a bathroom NOW. So I panicked, knowing there was an emergency vehicle u-turn ahead, I get over slow down, but the person behind me isn’t slowing and is on my ass. I turn anyway, they almost hit me. And I ran off the road into the u-turn and almost hit the posts on the other side of the road. Immediately panic mode. Back up and get on the interstate, get off at the exit and head home. But I turned around because in the adrenaline rush, my stomach stopped. I was going to get on the interstate and head back to work, but called my boyfriend freaking out. 
As I come up to the overpass that would have the on ramp I need, I see a cop coming off of the off ramp that I had used to get off and terror sets in. I pass by, don’t get on the interstate and keep driving. He’s behind me, following me and follows for a while. But I get to an intersection, turn and he goes the other way. So my dumb ass loops around to go BACK onto the interstate and I get on at my usual on ramp. Make it to the third and decide maybe it would be better if I just head home. Pass 3 more cops on the way, call my work tell them Im not coming in. Call my dad and freak out, he tells me to just go home. I call my boyfriend and apologize. Now I’m paranoid I’m going to have a cop knocking on the door to serve me a court warning or something. I’m sitting here and I know 100% how stupid I am, and that I shouldn’t have done it. I know I’m stupid, I just want someone to tell me what I should do if I do have one show up at my door? And you can tell me how stupid I am.

I am attending a community college for a two year degree. Everyone in this degree is required to be in a club that goes with the nature of the program and it’s just the people in it that are involved. 

There are officers, we’re supposed to hold meetings (never do), basic club stuff. 

However, our program director, who runs the club, keeps bringing up fees that I have never had to pay in a college club. I have a bachelors degree from another school and this seems... off. I was in several clubs there and it seemed like if we needed money, the officers would ask or request it from a faculty student association. Something like that. 

So, our director (we’ll call her M), asked the girls when they were at the state conference to pay club dues. I haven’t ever paid club dues for a college club, and our tuition breakdown says they’re included. That’s the idea, right? So, they didn’t pay. 

Now she’s trying to get us to pay AGAIN. Our club dues are $60. And, like I said, supposedly covered by tuition. We looked in our handbook and where it talks about the club, there is no mention of us needing to pay dues. 

M has tried several times to get us to pay for things that we never were supposed to. The second year class has a dinner for graduation. The first years are allowed to attend with their plate being free, any guest plates costing $25. That was what we were told in August. And November. And January. Now that the dinner is close, M says everyone has to pay $35 for their own plate. 

We have no idea where this money is going as M also won’t hold a meeting with the officers so we can’t figure out where our budget is being spent. 

I’m not sure if it actually is fishy or if my previous experiences were just different. We also don’t know what to do if this isn’t right. Thanks!",17Apr2019,4

We love each other, have a very healthy relationship and everything is great. But, apparently my brain can't cope with happiness and I'm constantly thinking about what cloud go wrong.

I trust my boyfriend with my life and we have so much in common, but I can't get out of my mind the idea that we're going to find something where we have completely different opinions. And I know it's nearly impossible, because we've talked about everything: politics, religion, ideals, future plans, kids, social issues... It's not like I'm about to find out that he is secretly a nazi. And whenever I take this out of my mind I start worrying about sickness and accidents, like ""we're not going to have a happy ever after because one of us is going to die in a car crash/of cancer"".

Lately I've started to worry about work too. I'm about to finish my studies in a couple of months, and we're planning to move in together after that. I'm a makeup artist so being relatively new to the industry and living in a small city doesn't give me plenty of job opportunities in my field. I know that probably I'll end up working at Sephora (or any other makeup brand) and I don't dislike it. I've work for makeup brands before, and it's not a bad job, but right now I'm panicking about the schedule because my boyfriend works too and I don't like the idea of having incompatible schedules and barely seeing each other. And I can't help but to think that this might get on the way of our relationship.

This insane worrying got absurd yesterday when I got a text from an old college telling me that a friend of hers was getting married and needed a makeup artist. So, it was basically a job opportunity. And I was all about it, cause I love doing makeup for brides, but soon after I started getting anxious. And I even dreamed about it tonight. I worry about compromising with a bride to do her makeup seven months from now and not being able to get a day off at work... In a job that I don't even have right now and won't have for the next two/three months.

370,"So i'm just gonna lay out the whole story:  


So about 2 1/2 months ago my neighbor managed to convince his cousin and his cousin's girlfriend/fiance to move in with them. The cousin and gf lived in an area of our state (WI) that doesnt have a lot of job opportunities and my area has a decent number of jobs that pay enough to get by with 1 income or be pretty comfortable with 2. So the cousin and gf move into my neighbors house. Now, this neighbor and I both rent units out of a quadplex.

  
When the cousin moved in he and the gf were allowed to sleep on the floor of the living room bc neighbor has kids. The house is disgustngly dirty, cousin and gf couldnt shower for weeks because dirty laundry was piled in the bathtub/shower, cousin finally got a job on second shift and was expected to be silent when he got home, and the kids were free to play and make noise during the day, so he got very little sleep. They were forced to use all of their food stamps to fill the house with food, which wasnt a problem until neighbor made a shopping list that included steaks and such, so cousin and gf wouldnt be able to eat much for the month. Shortly after moving in cousin got into a car accident and needed a new radiator to get to work.  


Here is where I come in. My wife is friends with neighbor's gf and smokes, so she quickly made friends with cousin and cousin's gf because they also smoke. She offered my help to fix their car. I helped pull some parts from the car and helped source a radiator. In the few days that the radiator was shipping my wife was made aware of the living situation next door. cousin and his gf found out they were pregnant (conceived before move) and they were at their wits end. They said that while cousin was at work, his gf was treated rudely by everyone in the house.  


My wife brought them over and asked me if they could stay with us. We have kids, its not a big house, i wasnt thrlled. She reminded me that just 2 years ago we were living in a motel, no money, broken cars, sleeping on a floor, and how the generosity of others helped us get to where we are today. So i caved.   


So they moved in. We had an extra bed, and things were okay at first. Its been 4-5 weeks now. Twice they paid us $50 on a payday, nothing we asked for. We put the money into an envelope and set it aside, ran into a slight money issue two weeks ago and used it to pay for gas. Since then cousin has gotten a garnishment for child support and cant pay us any more, thats fine by us. We figured it would only take a few weeks to get into an apartment and originally planned for a soft limit of may or june.  


Things have not been going well. Cousin is fine. He goes to work, he comes home, he sleeps, he goes back to work. Thats about it. Cousin's gf is another story. Now when they moved in there was a ton of drama in the house because neighbor and his gf were mad, and everyone started talking shit about everyone. My wife jumped in the middle and tried to fix it, but shes a nosey nellie and didnt really help the situation. What she did shouldnt have hurt the situation either, but as we now know it made cousin and his gf not trust her because she got into their business. Jump to this week. Things have been tense, its pretty clear that cousin's gf doesnt really like my wife. My wife sends her listings of apartments to try and help them look, and has been met with resistance or the cold shoulder. This week she did three things that set off cousin's gf:  


\-She asked how much money they had saved for an apartment in hoped of getting a timeline or an idea of how things are going.  


\-She told them that she was planning a slumber party for our two daughters who both share a birthday month and would need the room on may 4th. She suggested they get a hotel, said if money was a problem she would help pay for it, or suggested they stay with Another cousin (our mutual friend and neighbor's sister) for the night so we could use the room.  


\-When a few days had passed and no progress had been made on a plan for the slumber party she approached our mutual friend and asked if them staying with her would be an option. Mutual friend sent a text to cousin's gf to talk about it and now cousin's gf felt like my wife went behind her back, and made an issue because she hadnt even talked to cousin about it yet.  


It blew up about 2 days ago. Wife asked if cousin's gf had a second because she wanted to give her a gift (a black carseat over baby cover, its easier than carting around a blanket and keeps baby dry and warm in bad weather.) Cousin's gf said yeah sure and gave her some additude, then explained she was mad that my wife went behind her back to talk to mutual friend. Shes mad that my wife is butting into their business with asking how much they have saved and mad that she asked if we could have the room on the 4th ""in a demanding way.""  


They argued, cousin and I didnt say much, what i did say was pointed at my wife where i told her she should try to relax and not get into their stuff so much. They left for a bit. Wife and I talked and she was upset, she feels like the villain in her own house.  


The next day things were tense. Now I forgot to put in that things between mutual friend and my wife havent been great either. Mutual friend is upset that my wife talks to neighbor's gf. Neighbor and mutual friend (siblings) have a bad relationship. Mutual friend came over to pick up her daughter (we watch her before and after school so she can go to work) and stepped onto our patio with cousin's gf to talk. My wife went out to have a cigarette and was asked to go back inside or somewhere else so they could talk (asked by cousin's gf).   


My wife was upset and cried to me. She feels like a prisoner in her own home. Now I can see a lot of their side, but to me it seems like the things my wife has done should have been addressed sooner or talked about so boundaries could be set. Instead it was all held in and blew up.  


Now My wife has asked me if I can tell them that we need them out by the weekend. She is worried though because cousin's gf received mail at our house (i have no clue how or why? I never gave my consent.) They arent on a lease, it was clear that they were guests until they had enough for an apartment.   


What should I do? What should I say? Ive noticed the poor treatment starting to be moved onto me as well. I'm not around a ton, and when I am im usually cleaning, cooking or trying to accomodate them as much as I can. Im tired and frustrated, I dont understand why cousin's gf is so upset, and it feels like she is actively ruining things with mutual friend who is essentially my only non spousal friend in my state.

I know that it's because last summer, during a rainy and windy night, a large tree fell on our home. The damage to the home was fairly minimal, we needed a new roof for messed up shingles but no structural damage, needed new front siding, windows, porch. Our two vehicles were totaled. 

The night of, I was in the living room with my husband, and our kids were in bed. Thankfully, no one was hurt, indoors only damage was windows and glass.  I had a bit of anxiety then and for a few days (weeks?) because I kept thinking, if that tree was a bit longer, we could have been crushed. Also anxiety because we were just hanging out and relaxing one minute, and next, this big tree falls.

378,"First, some background:

&amp;#x200B;

My (27m) brother (28m) recently got engaged to his girlfriend (22f) of 3 years. He was planning on proposing this spring, but she kept telling her that if she isn't engaged by X time then she's gonna be pissed. So he proposed. I think this had to do with her best friend also trying to get engaged around the same time, so it turned into some competition, because that's how love works. 

Since then, she has become a FUCKING BRIDEZILLA. They are getting married in May 2020. She had everyone take fake photos for a post looking surprised when she asked her (like 3 weeks later...). She had her maid of honor already plan her bachelorette party in March of 2020. She had everyone go try on bridesmaids dresses a few weeks ago (1st week of April), and then told everyone that she wants them ordered by June. For a wedding 11 months later. So rather than keeping that due date, she has now asked everyone to order them before May. 13 months early.... Now, we all know that women's bodies can change multiple times throughout a year, so this seems crazy to me. There's more, but I don't have the time lol. 

The problem is, my wife and I are trying to get pregnant, unbeknownst to our families. So if we get pregnant today, we will have a baby in January. However, we probably won't get pregnant today, so it could very easily be that my wife is pregnant at the wedding. 

My wife talked to her about this the other day. My future SIL was complaining that her best friend (mentioned above) was complaining about getting the dresses early, as her wedding is in October of this year and will be trying to get pregnant shortly thereafter, so she will likely be pregnant during the wedding. My wife asked her ""What if \_\_\_ gets pregnant?"", to which my future SIL responded ""If anyone is pregnant during my wedding, then fuck them.... well, except you"". Reassuring, right??

So this morning, one of my brother's old (female) friends from an old job in high school commented on one of his FB statuses about how proud he is of his fiancee. His fiancee went off on this woman (who is also engaged), saying that you will NEVER be invited to our wedding, etc etc just going off on this woman for commenting on his status ""pretending"" that they're friends. So the comment got deleted by the time I was typing this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Before any of this happened, she has always been bitchy like this. She hates (literally) any woman she meets that isn't her friend. She talks shit about all women. She literally told my brother she didn't want his mixed friend in the wedding party because it will throw off the color balance of the photos... She has come at my wife sideways, then got over herself, so that has been fine for a few years. But we have a strong feeling those actions are going to resurface in short order. All around, she's just showing her true colors and that she never really grew up from when we first met her. Between the bitchiness, the inflated sense of self-importance, and the not-so-subtle racism, my wife and I are just stuck wondering what to do. How can we get along with someone who acts like this? Should I talk to my brother about this? Should we let it go for now and see if it gets any worse before saying anything? The only thing I am sure of with this situation is that if she gets pissy with us for getting pregnant, I will lose my FUCKING MIND. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Brother's fiancee has been getting bitchier and bitchier. Has made several off-color comments, which make us question who she is as a person. Will get mad if one of her bridesmaids is pregnant in 13 months during their wedding, and my wife and I are trying to get pregnant currently. Not sure how to handle the situation as it is family and very touchy.",17Apr2019,3

This isn’t the first time it has happened, but I found out my husband has been cheating on me for the past two years. We have been married for nearly 6 years and together for 10. We also share a 2 1/2 year old son as well. 

I found out of his infidelity when the woman came to our house and was trying to get into his car. She couldn’t because it was locked and instead left pictures and some gifts of vape juice and coils on the hood of his car, along with two notes. My husband works night shift and was asleep at the time so I went out to see what it was. Immediately, I confronted him with the pictures. He didn’t deny anything. He told me he had started talking to her two years ago and had seen her six times in the past two years. The last time he says he spoke to her was two months ago to cut things off.  He also said he never was intimate with her and just wanted someone to talk to. I’m not sure if I believe the intimacy thing or the cutting off the affair part. I feel incredibly stupid for not learning my lesson the first time, but that was before we had a child together. What hurts me the most is he does not take the time to really bond with his son - who thinks the world of him- but he can be close to this other woman’s son of the same age. 

I have started to pack my things to stay with my family for a while and told him that I need a few days to think about what I want to do. He is fully aware that I am contemplating divorce. However, my thoughts keep going back to my child. Most of my family is trying to sway me to just getting it over with and moving on, and then others are saying that my husband and I have great potential if we just worked at it. I desperately wish for my child to have both parents present in his life as a single family unit- my husband and I come from a place where neither of us had both of our parents growing up. 

Needless to say, I’m conflicted. My husband seems to want to work things out, but I’m in a place where I’m terrified it will all just happen again and feel like I should just chalk it up to a lesson learned kind of thing.... and at the same time I want things to work. But while I want it to work, I know that I deserve much better than someone who will run to someone else when times are hard instead of talking to me. I understand that my child would eventually understand the “why” if I did split with my husband. I’m just conflicted and don’t know how to approach this.",17Apr2019,1

We now both have decent jobs and can pay the bills no problem and should be able to build our savings decently. However he can’t save a dime... he has a Tax free savings account set up with a certain amount to go in each pay check yet he only has $600 in it- he spends all his money on fast food - like a ridiculous amount - he spent $160 last week between fast food &amp; variety stores meanwhile I always buy groceries and have stuff for lunches and he either won’t make a lunch because he is to lazy or he will make lunch eat it and also go out to eat. 

I have tried giving him $20 a week for lunch so he can eat out one day a week,  that didn’t work out as he kept just taking money out of savings. I changed his card so that he couldn’t transfer from our shared savings into checking online but if he calls the bank over the phone they can switch money around since his name is on both account so that is what he does. I can’t leave money in our house as he takes it- even money that was given to me for my birthday.

I have had the same conversation with him over and over I have showed him graphs of how much goes out on bills &amp; how much he is spending on other items. I feel like I have tried everything and explained in every way of how important it is to save and manage money. I’ve told him how important it is to me and to himself- yet no change.

I understand money is always going to be a worry- but when I know we can make simple changes to make our futures better and it’s not happening I get super upset.

I'm going to try and avoid any non-necessary details but bear with me if I go off track a little.

The situation: I plan on moving out as soon as I can. Due to deteriorating relationships, I won't have financial, or emotional, support from my parents. Both of these are things I can live with assuming I can get my financial situation under control. I am 19 years old. I currently do not have a job but am looking very hard into getting one.

Hi everyone,

I am seeking advice on the best way to say no to my roommate without creating a toxic home environment. I have my worries that he is a manipulator, and possibly trying to groom me, but one issue at a time.

Background: I have a roommate who is 27, I myself am 23, but his name is Rob. He has no car, or no desire to own one. He doesn't even have a license. Basically, I am the first roommate he has ever had since he has up to this point lived at home, where his mom drove him everywhere he needed to go. We don't live in an area where no having a car is normal, in my town you need it to get around. He is basically a bum. No desire to go to school, or moving up at his current minimum wage job. I moved in with him since I was desperate to not become homeless.

What is going on:

We work at the same place, but I am in a higher role than he is. But even though we aren't in the same position, we tend to get scheduled at the same time. If we don't, he switches his shifts to match mine so I can drive him to and from work. He says that taking a public bus or an uber isn't expensive but he lies to people at work to get his weekend shifts covered so he doesn't have to pay for those on those days. But he will gladly pay the uber on a Saturday night to take him to and from work to see people, but not to work? Anyway, he told the scheduling manager to schedule him and I together, without asking me if that was okay all for rides to work. Before he asked her to do this, we had a conversation about the ride thing, and I told him to stop assuming it was okay to think he can just bum a ride and that I wanted him to at least ask. I don't want him to pay me, because to me that tells him as long as he's paying me I owe him a ride. I don't want to drive him at all but I don't know the right way to tell him to stop being dependent on me and grow up. I don't want to be a bitch, but I also hate driving around a man-child.

The way the interview process is set up is by having a one on one interview and then getting into a group into with 4 other people who want to get hired.So, during the one on one interviewer A is asking me regular interview questions then starts to ask me questions like where I live and if I live alone and if not then who. So I answer his questions and then towards the end he tells me that he thinks I'd be a good fit here, that I'm a nice person, have a nice smile and that we should keep this relationship strictly business. At first I was like ok because I didnt really think anything about it but then I realized what he meant but I never not once flirted with him.Then after that interview I had to join a group with four other people. Interviewer B went around the group to ask people questions then he finally got to me. After I was finished talking he say's I'm a nice person and proceeds to ask me about my sign. He then talks about one girl who was the same sign as him who broke his heart. The reason why he asked me though because he thought we shared the same sign. So my question is, after all that should I accept the job offer?",17Apr2019,1

404,"(Sorry for poor formatting, I'm on mobile)

As stated in the title, I'm going on a trip to Europe this summer. It's a ten day trip with my school. We are flying to Germany, then taking a train to several locations in Poland and Czech Republic before flying home from Prague. 

Naturally, I'm a little nervous. I have never left the country (US) before for any reason. My main concern is being prepared and having everything I need. 

So far, I have a new passport (so it won't expire) and a money belt (so I won't be pick pocketed). I also have a new medium size Away suitcase, but I also have hear that it's better to just bring a carry on, so I might bail on the suitcase. I am pretty low maintenance, so I think I could do it if I really tried. I cleaned out my phone, so I have room for pictures, and I will bring an old camera too, just in case. I'm going to buy a power converter to charge my phone. 

I do not know if my service provider serves those areas yet. I have Verizon. My other concern is money. I do not know exactly what currency they use in each location or the best way to pay for things. Should I just exchange my US money for their cash when I get there? Is it better to bring a debit card? 

Sorry this is long, just looking for some extra help from experienced travelers. I really appreciate any advice.",17Apr2019,1
405,"Hello all,

I need your help. I'm trying to figure out what to do next (because I feel as if time is against me).

I'm currently 26 years old, and I teach English in China after working/graduating from college in the US. I have some IT consulting experience post graduation, but it wasn't for me so I went to China to do somewhat of a gap year/save up money. After working in China, I feel this pressure to get a masters degree because I have much more free time on my hands, but I'm struggling on if it's the right thing to do because its a considerable time (and money investment). 

I already know that I will not go back to the US to do it because I refuse to be even more indebted in student loans (and for personal other reasons that will make people mad; I don't want to go back unless absolutely necessary). I'd prefer to move somewhere to live permanently and, ultimately, gain citizenship.

I'm just not sure where to go/what to do: do I apply to schools in Europe/Australia after saving up money in China (working a couple more years here) or do I change my visa type in China and study for my masters in China so that I can automatically start looking for jobs in Europe/Australia upon its completion. The price would be cheaper in China, but I'd miss out on the connections in Europe/Australia since I am not actually in the country (I'm running into this issue now--completely disregarding educational decisions). Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",17Apr2019,1
407,"Hi I’m (19, M) in my freshman year of college. At the beginning of the year I felt like I had made a lot of friends with a group of people from my floor. However this semester things have all kinda changed for the worse. One of the girls who I had started seeing for a large part of the first semester dumped me the night before birthday and a few weeks later started dating a different guy on our floor. I was able to kinda act like I didn’t really care but deep down I know it did a bit. 

I also had two really close guy friends in the group who I thought were pretty good guys. We planned on all living together  next year but the day before we had to pick our rooms they decided that they wanted to kick me out of the group. They most likely did it because they wanted to get into the nicer building which only had doubles but I was left screwed with no one to room with.

415,"18 years ago, when I was five, my father passed away. I didn’t know him well, he was absent for the majority of those five years, save the first one or two. He was shot in an altercation pertaining to drug dealing he was involved in at the time, and my mother cut ties with that side of the family since the funeral. 


To cut to the chase, one of my two half brothers from my fathers side is trying to contact me over Facebook. The message has been left in requests since November of last year. Naturally I feel a calling to meet and celebrate my blood, as I have a need to know my father and those he was involved with, given that I did not know him at all. If anything, just to come face to face with another entity that is of his existence. The last trace I outside of myself I guess.. Its not a joke to me. I really can’t shake this need to just.. feel my brothers presence. He is of the man I needed most even today. But this side of my family has been gang affiliated since the 80’s and some of them are still in their ways. Living in a certain part of town, nobody knows what kind of life they are living, so meeting these people is a gamble, truly. My uncles mugshots are up online - never met him. No plan to either.. I have NO knowledge as to whether or not this brother is gang affiliated.


My mom told me she really thinks I shouldn’t, as she doesn’t want me to end up involved in anything I didn’t want to be involved in (needing to borrow money, a place to stay) basically attempting to avoid what she sees as a potential slippery slope that she remembers dealing with when my father was alive. However, I feel awful as my now adult brother is trying to contact me over Facebook and he’s one of those guys that posts superheroes as his Facebook profile picture amongst like one awkward pic of himself so I’m like, how gang affiliated can this guy really be? But it’s not just about him. It’s about what could result from reconnecting with that side of the family in general. I don’t know if what they’re up to is any good for my life, how could I?

416,"I’ll start by saying that I am a recovering cocaine addict.

I honestly thought I was going to die. Eventually my best friend did die from an overdose, and it was a major wake up call for me. Fast forward 3 years, and I’ve been clean pretty much ever since with a few small relapses that were stomped out by my support system.

Now a man (let’s call him Will) was hired as a server not too long ago. Will has his own cocaine addiction, and has been using at work with increasing frequency. Additionally, a fellow line cook has began using at work on a daily basis. Obviously this is an issue for me. It makes me feel shitty about myself when I get offered cocaine on a regular basis.

I am not sure what he meant by this but it’s of note that he doesn’t know about my previous addiction problems. The owner has been so good to me that I feel like I owe it to him to stay. I also love cooking food. On the other hand, I feel like I owe it to my support system to keep myself away from a situation like this.

Some background to get the story rolling. I (17F) wasn't on track to graduate. I was truant and failing everything due to depression and lack of motivation. I went to alternative military style schooling and excelled. I graduated a year and a half early from high school, I now work at a place I love and pays very well for having no prior experience, and I have my own place. 

And that's where we will start our story. It's not technically my place it's in my mom's name, being as I'm only 17 and can't legally rent a place in my name. (But my landlord knows I live here, and I am almost 18) My mom (51F) is a narcissist, but of course if you ask her she isn't. And she also has a very weird way of thinking 

*Backstory of my relationship with my mom and I, not very good. She abused me as a child physically and emotionally. As I got older and I was able to stand up for myself, the physical abuse lessened but not the emotional. It eventually turned into her getting on anger management pills and just becoming depressed and never leaving her room*

Back to her weird way of thinking, this morning, she thought it would be okay to come over unannounced to bring me some paper toweling. While yes I appreciate it, I don't appreciate the way she did it. 

Or there's this, she showed up at my workplace unannounced and bought me a new microwave. The one I had was in the apartment before I moved in. It stopped working once and my mom told me I needed a new one. The old one was white and fit in very nicely, but this one is solver and black.

We bought a big, two story house in a regal part of town. We moved in with her boyfriend who had a minimum wage job and she wasn't happy with.

I caught her sleeping next to her now-bf while still in the relationship. 

I always thought of her as someone who couldn't do any harm. But there she was, cheating, smoking (something she'd stopped a long time ago), and drinking a lot.

Eventually we had to sell the house or we'd be foreclosed on. 

Things were getting tight on money, so I, the spoiled brat who had never felt hunger in my life, had looked through the pantry one day to discover I would have to rely on school lunches for a week. That was fine with me, I wanted to be skinnier anyways.

So the weekends become days I'm hungry and looking forward to Monday. Every time I get some food, he takes it from me. I've told my mom how upset this makes me and she laughed in my face. I see it as him not caring enough to respect something as simple as eating all the food we have stocked up SPECIFICALLY FOR HIM. He eats mine instead, fully knowing how much it affects me.

But it turns out that I snore louder than we both remember. It's pretty bad.

I briefly dated a guy for about a month, but we were friends for about three months prior to that. I am 20F and he’s 20M. We had sort of a mutual interest in each other prior to us dating, but he had a girlfriend at the time so we did not act upon these feelings. Things changed after his relationship ended and we kissed for the first time. Before the kiss, he was very nice and sweet, and he was basically the “perfect gentleman”. Afterwards, though, he started to invite me over all the time and I could barely make it through the door without him putting his hands on me and attempting to make out. This I did not have a problem with. 
The problem came when we would be making out and I would start to feel him pressing against my thighs and crotch. I am someone that doesn’t feel comfortable with having sex without knowing the person first and I let him know this, so when I would feel him on me, I’d push him away and tell him that that’s enough. He’d get off of me and relax for a bit, but then 5 minutes later he’d do the same thing, only this time he might put his hand up my bra or right in between my legs. I’d let him do his thing for a minute or two, but then I’d remind him that I wasn’t ready to go further yet and again, he’d back away. Repeat this process about 5-6 times (with him getting increasingly more bold, like removing my shirt and bra) and that was a typical night for us. 
By the end of the night, I’d tell him that I was going to go home, and he’d be a bit sad about it but understanding. Then he would get up and stand behind me so that I could feel his erection on my shoulder or back. I’d get up and the whole way to the door, he’d be pulling me back, kissing me, touching me, etc. He never tried to force me to stay or anything, though. Cue this happening for multiple nights over about a three week period until I finally decided to sleep with him. He would also do this when his friends were around, although they were asleep, which made me uncomfortable. 
I thought that I was overreacting until multiple people (including one of his friends) told me that that doesn’t sound right and I should probably consider talking to someone about it. I’m also a CSA victim so my perspective on sexual assault is a bit skewed and I’m willing to accept things that others may not.

440,"So, I’m graduating next month, and need to make a decision about college. I got into two schools. The first is an art school about 45 minutes away from where I currently live. It’s my first choice school, but in order to go there, my dad says I have to still live with him and his wife and commute to school. The commute isn’t really a problem, I live 5 minutes from a train line that drops me off near campus. The problem with this option is that my dad and stepmom are emotionally and verbally abusive. I’m constantly belittled, accused of being lazy, and blamed the fact I’m disabled. (I have a heart condition which prevents most physical activity, and I’m on the autism spectrum.) According to my dad, I’m too disabled to live in a dorm.

 Then we come to option #2, a school 3 hours away that my dad  bullied me into applying to. (The ultimatum was ‘apply here, or no college at all’). The reason my dad wants me to go there is it has a disability program. I’d be constantly watched, forced to attend weekly social meetings, and be barred from certain classes. On top of that, it costs an extra $3000 and I can’t opt out of it. Reports will continually be sent to my dad, and he’s trying to get me an aide to follow me around.

It’s my only chance to live away from home, but it also severely restricts what I can do, and I’m worried I’m going to end up somewhere I don’t want if I go there.

okay, so for some context, i (20F) am currently in college while also working in a restaurant. idk if i’m an academic masochist or i just love it, but i’m double majoring and trying to tack on a minor as well (gotta get that bread while on a full ride yknow, bc i would never be able to afford college otherwise so this is my ONLY chance really). my mom is basically my only family across the country, and i feel like i can’t talk to my friends, because it always seems to turn out to be a pissing contest, so i don’t want to bother anymore. they don’t even hang out with me- all they wanna do is complain in the group chat. so essentially, my only support is my mom and my bf, one of which is very far away. 

but the thing is- i feel okay? like, i feel like i’m doing fine until it just HITS, and then it fucks me up down and sideways all week, and i can’t even manage a whole week of perfect attendance in my classes without collapsing the next week. i’ve never missed work, but i’m so fucking burned out from it. i hate the people there, i hate the absolute disregard for my availability (i’ve had to leave class early before), the servers are incredibly unprofessional and petty, like, SCREAMING in front of CUSTOMERS petty, and they literally keep scheduling me doubles over the weekend even though i’m available during the week and we have multiple other people in my position. it’s like my weekends are robbed from me, but although i get sunday’s off (after much scheduling battling), i just can’t manage to bring myself to do my work for monday or anything, so my mornings are filled with cramming and stress. it’s my own fault but i just CANNOT do it. i don’t know what’s wrong with me. i’ve tried all the classic college tricks- coffee, red bull, adderall, tea, fucking b12, anything to give me energy/motivation but i cant. i can’t do my work ahead of time and i can’t bring myself to have consistent attendance. i can’t go to bed at a reasonable time, sleeping is a fucking nightmare for me. i have to be talking the entire time until i pass out or have something playing in the background, music or a video, because i just can’t sleep with my thoughts. i just think “i’m not sleeping yet i’m not sleeping yet i’m only getting X hours i’m not sleeping yet” and it just makes me lose my shit. 

 it’s not like i want to die- i used to have TERRIBLE depression and suicidal tendencies up to a year ago, but i’ve been doing much better since i made drastic changes to my life. but it’s still haunting me- i feel fine so often, but i can never actually relax (don’t really know how to), i can’t drag myself out of my apt that’s incredibly far from campus to walk 30+ minutes to class (involuntarily relocated there after a dorm fiasco that had our dorm shut down), i just can’t be prepared for class, i have surprisingly phenomenal grades (80/90/100), but i just. can’t. i can’t fuckjng do this. next week is the last week of classes and i fly home for the summer &amp; move out in early may, but i already feel like a walking corpse, a dirtbag student, but i don’t feel SAD and i don’t want to die so i don’t know if i’m still depressed?? i don’t know where else to go. 

i’m really scared that i’m like, subconsciously faking it, but my bf says that isn’t a thing. like what if i’m just a massive pile of shit and i’m not actually depressed or anything? i just feel stressed 24/7, i’ve been stressed for years, and i can’t seek out treatment because im uninsured, so i haven’t even gotten a diagnosis. so teCHNICALLY, i have no idea what’s wrong with me. for all i know, college has just made me into a huge irredeemable pile of hot trash and i’m going to be a failure and bum unless i get my shit together and stop whining. i don’t know. i don’t fuckjng know and i feel like every day is a shitty hallucination. 

what do i do? what’s wrong with me? am i just fucking dumb?? i don’t know how to possibly help myself, i’m a strong gal, but jesus christ. how do i get a grip? how do i get control of myself? 

TL;DR- i don’t know if something is wrong with me (ie depression again), but i have intense motivational and stress problems that i don’t know what to do about",17Apr2019,1

So i’m (18f) in my first year of college right now. About to finish up at a really great art school. I’m in the process of trying to transfer schools for next year as this current school is too expensive. My thing is, I desperately want to take a year off. I struggle a lot mentally and have been dealing with a lot of depression this last year. I feel like i have no direction. I’m still living at home with my parents, who cause me more stress than anything. I’m always trying to live up to their standards and make them proud of me but it’s never enough.
I want to take a year off, be able to work really hard at a few full / part time jobs and save up enough to be able to move out on my own. I want to travel and desperately want to get out of the state i’m living in currently. 
My boyfriend is considering the possibility of moving out west in a year or so and we’ve talked about me maybe going with him. We’ve been together for a few months now and know we’d be fine living together. This is the most appealing option- moving out in a few months, maybe going back to school over there and getting away from my parents and being on my own.
The thing is, there’s no way my parents would be okay with this. Even the thought of me taking a year off of school makes them go crazy. They track my phone and have such a strong grasp on my life. I feel so suffocated. 
I don’t know how to bring up the fact that I just need to take a break from school. They would be so mad. I don’t know what I want. I have a lot of options right now and yet i can’t help but feel so stuck and trapped. 
It feels like it’s either stay here and go along with the life my parents have for me and become extremely depressed or go somewhere else and hope that they don’t completely cut me out of the family. 
I just need advice from anyone who’s been in a similar situation. Im so tired of feeling like i’m not getting anywhere in life because of my parents.

First of all, english is not my native language, so I apologize in advance if there are any mistakes.

And I don't know if this is the right sub to post this in.

Alright so, I am 17F and my boyfriend is 19M

My boyfriend is a great guy overall, but still I get extreme anxiety over little things.

We've been dating for almost 1 year now, but I feel like I'm ruining the relationship because I'm always overthinking everything and I just can't deal with myself anymore. It's getting extremely tiring.

&amp;#x200B;

When we're together, everything is fine. But when we're not together, I am just NOT okay. He doesn't text me all day and then he texts me at like 7PM. I just feel really anxious when he doesn't message me and I get scared he doesn't like me anymore and I'm constantly checking my phone, waiting for that one break-up message. I get really happy when he does message me and I ask how his day has been and stuff, he replies to my questions but doesn't seem to show any interest in me (asking me stuff about my day or something) and that kind of upsets me. And then he won't reply for the rest of the evening and when I say goodnight he will suddenly say stuff like ""goodnight I love you baby&lt;3"" Like what? You barely talked to me all day. (We see eachother in real life about 2 times per week)

&amp;#x200B;

He barely shows affection through texts, though I do. 

When I try to talk about my feelings, wanting him to text me a little more, give me a little more affection, he will say something like ""aw"" or ""yes"" and that's it. And mid-convo he will just ignore me while I'm talking about why I'm upset . I just feel a little ignored and thats where the anxiety kicks in.

I start to panic thinking that i've upset him, and I immediately start to apologize. I'm always afraid to talk about my feelings because I'm so so so scared he will get mad or will break up with me. I know it's entirely my fault and I feel like I'm always overreacting. But this anxiety is killing me. I cry almost every day because I'm always afraid of screwing up, and thats why I feel like I always need some sort of confirmation that he still loves me.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to ruin this relationship, I really love him. But when I'm panicking like that, I just am so scared that i've screwed up and by messaging him during a panic attack I screw up even more because I'll get all clingy and stuff, and then I realize I'm being clingy and then I start to panic more because I'm realizing I'm messing everything up and -- Yeah, it's an endless loop thats slowly killing this relationship I feel like.

My flatmate (Sandra) and I want to live together next year, we've been saying this for months so it feels set in stone. She isn't the best person even to share a student flat with so I know that sharing a house (and sharing a bathroom) will create some issues, this will become relevant once I've explained the rest. My other friend (Jack) also wants to live with us, Jack is someone who I hang out with almost on a daily basis, we have the same course so we're always at uni together etc. By far my closest friend both at uni and halls. I'm close with Sandra as well, we hang out less often because shes at a different school but still one of the closest people to me at halls.

Anyway. 

Jack wants to live with us, and Sandra doesn't want that to happen. and I haven't got a clue what to do. I've asked why and her reasoning is that she thinks he would be 'annoying' to live with, and I don't think that's a good enough excuse especially since she knows she doesn't have the best living habits so it goes both ways. I feel like I'm trapped because I've figured out my options here...

  1. We all live together, although not sure that is possible or would be quite awkward since he knows she doesn’t want him there. 

2. I find somewhere with Jack and some others instead, which would upset Sandra since I’ve as good as promised her that we’ll live together. 

3. I live with neither of them to avoid being the bad guy, get a house-share with strangers. 

4. I live with Sandra and let Jack find somewhere else, which would most likely cause tension and possibly fuck up our friendship.",17Apr2019,1

462,"Long story short, my Old Boss had a relationship with a subordinate in our department of like 11 people.

The relationship ended badly, administration was notified, lawyers were involved. Subordinate did not return, but my Old Boss was allowed to return to a lower position where he has no one working under him. He's on the same level as me organizationally now.

While Old Boss was gone, another employee left and I started to pick up that employee's responsibilities and was told that I'd be ""taken care of"" compensation wise.

Well guess who was given that position? My Old Boss. Meaning the job I've been doing (and enjoying) will now go to him and I've yet to hear anymore about compensation for my time.

My Current Boss (who used to be under Old Boss) is not happy about Old Boss returning and is looking for any opportunity to get rid of him. This includes telling my colleagues and I to report any requests Old Boss makes to us.

I just went on a walk with Old Boss to catch up, nothing work related. As soon as I returned Current Boss was asking me ""What did Old Boss want?"" ""What did Old Boss need you for?"" and when I answered we just went for a walk, Current Boss gave me a ""I can't tell if you're lying"" raise eyebrow look.

I really used to look up to my Old Boss both professionally an personally. I'd use to seek him out for advice. Needless to say it is now awkward as shit.

465,"I have gone through pro's/cons and I still can't make up my mind. 

Smaller University 

Cons: (less opportunities to network/clubs I'm interested in aren't there.) About an hour commute each way. They offer the degree program I'm interested in but I hear the teachers have high turnover, and it's one of those ""give sports kids As"", and otherwise it's not a very serious education, bad reputation etc.

Pros: I can still live at home, and commute. I won't need to take out a lot in loans. Overall a lot cheaper. 

Bigger University:

Cons: I'll need to stay in a dorm or relocate. I'll once again be in a LDR, after living with my bf for 4 years. I'll need to take out loans. 

Pros: Clubs I'd like to join, better quality of education, research opportunities, large University with small teacher/student ratios in my concentration. 

Overall, I'm afraid of taking out student loans, and living away from my bf again. We have been long distance before, but after living together for several years it would be an adjustment. I'm 24, and dorm life isn't something I'd like to do so I'm leaning more towards getting a single dorm to myself, or renting apartment (more $$$).

I’ve just started up my own business so this isn’t something that I’m brilliant at. My business name is titles something, I posted adverts everywhere, someone designed a logo for me, I got a domain and a website etc etc. 

Today I received a comment to say there is already someone in the area with that name...I had a little stalk on the person she tagged and although we have the same part of half of her name it isn’t actually the same. For example my name is:    ‘Betty boos clothing’ and he name is ‘Betty boos clothing by Veronica’ 
..... (this isn’t my business name or hers, neither are the businesses anything related but you get the idea). 

Now I think this comment is pretty rude and she should have just messaged me privately although I understand it’s a dog eat dog world. She publicly outed me saying she’s had a business for X amount of years and although it’s hard to come up with names I should rebrand because it’s confusing. 

As I’ve said I know nothing about this...but the names are different, if she wanted to be called JUST Betty boos clothing then name yourself that...the names are different and it’s not Ltd’d.

469,"the other day i (16f) had sex with my friend (16m) -- big mistake. while we were doing it we kept laughing and stuff. it was really awkward and a lot was going wrong, but we laughed through it. but when we were done he just switched. he started insulting me back to back. once i started crying he became nice again. he held me and wanted to know what was wrong, but i didn't say.

later on that night we were playing around and he punched me in the face, restrained me, and was taking things from me. after he punched me, i got a bloody nose and a busted lip. he hugged me for a while and said sorry a lot. i said i was okay, but he didn't stop hugging me and saying sorry.

nobody knows what goes on when they aren't around. some people from the shelter we live at happened to drive by and saw me laying on a bench with him on top of me. it looked completely wrong. he was taking things from me and we were playing around, but i can see why they thought wrong.

the next day, i started feeling really sore from everything. i told him about it and why i was sad after we had sex. he told me i should be fine in a day or two and talked to me about sex. he was sometimes saying nice things but he was also saying mean things. i felt like i was receiving mixed signals. i didn't know if he genuinely felt bad for what he had done or if he was blaming me. i blocked him on snapchat, but when he talked to me in person i always talked back.

yesterday morning we were playing around again. he wanted to set a paper towel on fire. i asked for the paper towel and tried to get it but he said no and was moving so i wouldn't get it. i thought we were both joking because he was smiling and laughing. but then i snatched it out of his hand and he got kind of serious. he told me, ""you deserve what I'm about to do to you.""

i got scared and gave it back but it was too late. he started grabbing me by my arms but i was blocking him from touching me. others were around this time and didn't see it how it really was. they told us to stop playing. he seemed okay after that though. he talked to me at school whenever he saw me.

but after school i was looking for him. this was before i finally talked to someone about everything he has been doing and found out he is bipolar. my friend told him i was looking for him and he asked about it. i told him it was okay and that i was no longer looking for him. he had an attitude the whole time. i was throwing a snack wrapper away and he picked the trash can up and held it towards me. i threw it away and literally looked at him for one second before he was like ""what?"" but he did it in this whining/mad tone. i don't know. he didn't talk to me for the rest of the night.

this morning when we walked to the bus stop, i heard him saying something and asked what he said. i thought he was talking to me, but he said he was talking to himself. again, with attitude. i just said okay and just looked at the ground. he then said, ""get up."" but i didn't get up. he said, ""get up, the bus is coming."" but he sounded annoyed so i got up.

on the bus he was acting weird too. he didn't sit by me, but before we got anywhere near the school he moved up to the seat next to me but never said anything. but when i talked to another friend he started talking to that friend as well. nothing serious happened after that.

i don't know what i did wrong but i'm really confused about how he is acting. i get that he's bipolar but now he's just being rude. we have had a few similar incidents before and he has hurt other parts of my body. it just wasn't as serious as the punch. i don't plan on talking to him first, but i don't know what i should do if he talks to me again.

i posted about him the other day and was told to confront him about his behavior or leave. i chose to confront him, he said he was kidding and things went back to normal.

should i try asking him what's wrong if he talks to me again?

So here I am, fucked outta proportion, moving into a new apartment because the house didn't come through during finals, dealing with anger and mistreatment from my sibling, making my mother fail her own class (Because she's doing online classes as well, and dealing with my brother made her fall behind, I wasn't able to help her as much as I needed to, and therefore she didn't finish her course.)

Here's the thing, I'm doing an entire semester worth of coursework in one. month. I cannot keep up.  At this point, I'm submitting bullshit, even though I'm trying my absolute best. I'm about to get fired from my job, I feel so much guilt about my mom's class, I'm working with an external client for one of my classes, I'm just lost. 

Here's the thing, I already took a semester off of college, and my mom calls me a 'dropout' whenever we argue, and she also throws the fact that I didn't help her get into another college some years back. I mean she's always throwing it in my face, and I feel that because I made my mom fail her class, that I shouldn't continue my own because it's essentially saying, ""Hey, I'm selfish and I chose my own classes over yours."" Plus, I can already feel that this is going to be fodder for a future argument. Even worse, I feel like I can't catch up, I'm so exhausted Reddit both physically and mentally. I'm up all times of the night because of homework, I'm the sole driver of the house, I am trying to pack to move, and I still have 7 essays due, a client project, and a final project due on top of that before May 6th. I feel like I'm just letting everyone around me down, I feel like I'm not good enough, I can't even maintain daily basic contact because it's so overwhelming, I'm always on the verge of an anxiety attack, I'm depressed, and can't even perform basic functions without fucking them up. Plus, it doesn't help that I'm so negative that my only real family member doesn't even want to talk to me. I'm so negative, I don't see hope, and I can't even maintain a basic conversation.

If I withdraw, then I'll have to pretty much redo my first semester of junior year all over again, and I don't know if I can keep the classes I've already registered for fall. Even worse, I need another job and I feel like I can't even work while going to school.  I'm somewhat displeased with my major because I just realized I lost some of my credits, so I'm reconsidering if I should just take something else altogether so that I can keep those credits, and also not jeopardize my GPA. 

Please, I need your support Reddit. Help me.",17Apr2019,1

475,"I know its not a huge deal, but it kind of sucks that I didnt hear from them at all. We're all in our 20's and have lives, but a quick text would have been nice. Should I confront them, or leave it be?",17Apr2019,1
476,"Basically I need your advice? 

It all started when I decided to report (now as an adult) a pedophile I lost my virginity too at 15. I started speaking to him on the phone through one of my girl mates boyfriend (it was unplanned). I was 14 and he was 22, in the army. This man is not from the same town/city as me, if you’re think oh maybe we bumped into each other and hit it off/ age is just a number etc etc. No we are from two different countries. Truth me told how I got talking to this guy was because my friend met his friend at this party she should’ve been at and I was fed up of this guy hogging my friend so I took the phone off her and say can you please give my friend back. Then someone in the background piped up, so I asked who the loud mouth was..... and that is how it began. We chatted for a while he asked for my number and rang me an hour later. 
I remember feel so cool that I had a proper man and an army one at that wanting to speak to me. As the call got longer, the subject turned to age. He told me he was 22. In turn I told him my age... 14. I was nervous to tell him, but as a child I was a big abnormal. You know the ones who never put a foot wrong and never consider lying. I said I would understand if he wanted to stop talking, you know because I was 14. He told me age is just a number and I seem mature for my age.... he really likes me. The phone call went on for weeks, after school he would ring me and we would talk about how our days went.. the calls would last hours. 
Then it hit that stage where he said he wanted to meet me, he thought he was already falling for me and couldn’t wait to meet me in person. He drive 4 hrs from his army base to pick up a 14 yr old guy, who hadn’t even started her period, had practically mosquito bites for boobs and straight hips (I’m mixed race, my hips, boobs and ass did eventually come in years later). When we met I jumped in his car and we hung out on some park swings and he did the big standard thing gave me his jacket. We did kiss. I thought I was in love already. I couldn’t believe a mature man, with a car and a job had travelled all this way just for me!
So fast forward we are in a relationship... then it gets to that point where you can put it off any longer, I’m the woman I should cater to my boyfriends needs.... but I was so scared... would it really hurt. He calmed me when I would panic at the thought of doing the deed. He was so sensitive, patient and understanding. Telling me we will do it when I’m ready and.... he was basically a virgin too, because his ex girlfriend was a rape victim and they tried to have sex once but she booted him off, as she had a ptsd flash back. So they technically never proper did it. From that I thought this man is perfect, he’s patient with me and he stayed with this girl for months after that happened, even though they didn’t have sex.
After that performance, I felt even more like I needed to please him... be a proper girlfriend and give him a sexual relationship for the first time. 
So on the weekends when he would travel to see me we would stay in premier inn hotels at different locations each time. Where I would try to have sex, but it was too painful. This happened for about 2 months. Over that time he started changing, he started getting more and more angry at me. Raising his voice and getting frustrated. He made me feel I was a failure as a woman and I had failed him. But I couldn’t help it, my body was so tense and it was soooo painful each time I tried. 
Then one night he picked me up and was taking me to stay at his parents with him for the night (yes he even introduced me to his family). But on the motorway his car broke down, it was around 2am. We were stuck. Luckily his mum came to pick us up. 
When I got to their home and we climbed into bed, I just turned to him and said do it now because I’m so exhausted my body has no choice but to be relaxed. That was the first time we were successful in have sex. That is how I lost my virginity... it wasn’t a special moment like I thought it would be... I did it because I was so tired I know my body couldn’t fight. 
From then on he obviously got more relaxed looking back now... he let slip the ex before me who suffered with ptsd was also 15 and I was better than her in bed... over time he started mentioning other girls he had slept with.. all young.
Skipping to the end, he started becoming unstable, having ago at me.. always depressed. So I ended it because I couldn’t take anymore. Never spoke to him again.
Fast forward to today at 27 yrs old, I’ve started replying and piecing things together. The lies he told to trick me into bed and I was clearly a long string of girls he had used the same tactic with too... I don’t know get their virginity’s for sport? It turns my stomach, because when you’re an adult you see things through different eyes. Me at 22 would never look st a 14 yr old like that, let alone if they told me their age. 

The purpose of my long winded essay is to give you a background. I decided recently to report this. What I wasn’t prepared for was my family. They didn’t react supportively, they said basically it was my fault. Why did I have a relationship with him? Why did I continue to see him? Well it was consensual?
I know these questions are natural to ask... but it’s normally later after the ‘Awww love, are you ok?’. I had no of that, I had ‘have you thought about us and our health?’, ‘what about your mum she can’t cope with this’ (forgot to say this mostly came from my grandparents/ young grandparents), ‘this will be in the papers, haven’t you put us through enough with you mental breakdowns the last couple of years’, ‘well if he’s still doing it let someone else report it!’, I was floored with this golden nugget...’have you thought about the fact he could have a family and children now? And the effect it would have on his life?’.
At this point I should mention my family knew at the time I was going out with a 22 army man. One person I particular, I shall not name names.... actually waved me off in the car when he first came down to meet me. They knew my age and his age, they knew we had never met. They all knew and to that they counteract....’well we trusted you, we put you on a pedestal’.
So again it was all my fault. Not once was the mention of the reason I came forward... I cannot stand the thought after only now figuring it out... that he could still be doing this..... and then these girls will one day have it hit them all of a sudden when they’re older.... 
... after I figure it all out... it made me feel sick... it still does... how could I have fallen for it... I gave him my first ever experience of everything sexual... that is irreplaceable. He clearly was well versed in what to say and get you to trust him. 
I wish I had met a boy my age just as inexperienced and we both goofily tried to figure out how to actually have sex! Even though it would probably be terrible, it would be a sweet, innocent and how it should be experience.

I tried explaining this to my family why I I made the decision to report this now. It’s to prevent him from doing this to other girls. I didn’t do it for closer. I cannot I’m good conscience not speak up and let these girls figure it out later in life like me.

So reporting it was the hard part like I thought, it was the devastating, lack of support of my family. When it came down to it I was (read between the lines) told I have to drop the case or they soundly forgive me.

Am I on a parallel universe? Or is this wrong? Should they proud that I had the courage to speak out and I have the care/ thought to protect others?

Instead I feel crucified for trying to do the right thing.

So I’ve been thinking..., should I reopen the case on my own. Not tell them or involve them and get this guy to face up to what his has done/ see how wrong it is or was? Do I dare defy my family behind their backs and go with what my heart says?

477,"I am in a bridal party where the brides family is extremely cheap. The maid of honor is the brides daughter who is 18 and very bratty. The bridesmaids are me and my coworker and a young girl. The maid of honor has us all in a group chat. She was saying how we need to plan the shower at her grandmothers house,we talked about food, decor theme and I said I can buy the floral arrangements, decorations and make the party favors( buying 20 potted plants and wrapping them in theme colored paper). Probably would cost around $200. We talked about catering and it would cost around $300. I asked who would pay for it and she said "" Its tradition that the bridemaids pay for everything"". I told her thats not true and the brides mother also contributes , especially since she is one of the hosts, she told me no that her grandmother wont give money because she is letting us use the house and the younger bridesmaid doesnt have money either so its up to me and my coworker to pay for everything. She said the most she can do is make egg salad and put it in bread and said it would be $36 and we can all split that cost 3 ways. This girl is driving me crazy, she expects this lavish elegant shower funded by two people. I feel really bad for my friend who is getting married that no one in her family wants to contribute but its not right that me and my coworker are being guilted into paying for everything, because we have jobs. I am already contributing a lot. I dont understand how the brides family cant contribute. My coworker is also contributing for decor and she offered to make a tray of something. The maid of honor works ,she can contribute more than $12. I also had a similar situation with the engagement party, her daughter told me and my coworker that we had to pay for it. We said no so it ended up we went to a restaurant and everyone payed for themselves and we pitched in to pay for the couple and I brought the cake which had a cutting fee and was told by her daughter ""can you handle that?"". How do I handle this, I really think my friend who is getting married has no idea how her daughter is acting, or am I over reacting ? I honestly didnt see this coming when I agreed to be a bridesmaid.",17Apr2019,1
478,"I'm in my early 30s and will be moving in with my new girlfriend in a few months. Logistically, it won't make sense for me to keep my current job, as her place, the place I'd be moving to, is an hour more away from my workplace. Plus, I just don't enjoy anything about working at my current job.

So, I'd like to try my hand at creative writing and self-publishing. And here is where my problem comes in. I have a habit of watching YouTube videos and surfing the web. I've made goals to sit down and write, but YouTube and other sites are just a click away, as I use Google docs to write with. By the time I'm home from work and ready to write, my willpower is sapped from the long, miserable day, and I just watch videos.

I feel I have a lot of potential and a decent chance at success or at least learning how to succeed if I did it, but habit takes over. How do I avoid distractions, when those distractions are attached to the tools I use to write (Google and Google Docs)?",17Apr2019,1
480,"I work from home and my only friend in real life is my 5 year old daughter. I've been with her dad for almost a decade and he's still not ready to get married, not sure if we ever will.

This week he's just having a bad week and every convo we have is how I'm a piece of shit for not doing this and that and this and that. What about all the things I do :( ? Will they ever be appreciated? All the food, home care, child care, full-time job things I do are a big deal to me. 

I'm lonely :( my kiddo loves me and tells me how much she appreciates the things I do. I want to do things mutually with someone, sometimes playing with your kiddo is something you do for them not with them, I'm working on that. But maybe it would also be nice to do something with a person my age? At work functions I tend to throw up all the words and talk non stop, overly animated, overly emotional - I think that's coz the situation is rare, maybe I overdo it to compensate.

I haven't really been talking to anyone else IRL besides my kiddo last couple of weeks. I have conversations with my guy but this week they all end in me at fault for something. It's really bringing me down. My mom and I chat on the phone but she has been busy lately and I've been seeing less of both my parents. 

I've noticed I'm extending conversations on the phone at work, just to hear a little bit more about someone's day, try and make their day easier/happier/more productive. 

Im feeling low and I'll probably fall into a bit of a quiet sad phase and climb out in a few months. Last time I asked my parents to babysit I went to chill at an AA meeting, maybe I'll do that again. There were a few real life people there but we we're kind of all doing homework.

481,"the situation is our (late twenties guy and girl couple) roommate (late twenties man) is not on the lease but lives with us. we are naive and understand this was a bad idea but we all had plans to room together.

we reminded him a week before our appt to view the apartment and he agreed he'd be available. the day before we check again and he says he forgot he's covering someone. so me and gf go and see the place, love it, and apply right there.

so he's not on the lease. his fault.

but he had a job that he quit to get 20k from his parents to do flight school. flight school means he flies a couple times a week (if that) and is home all the rest of the time.

at first he kept leaving the door unlocked at night. we told him to lock it because the wind blows it open. he wouldn't listen and i woke up at 4am to find the door ajar (we live on a fucking busy street corner). we told him repeatedly to stop this.

he left it unlocked 4 times already. he brings over girls we don't know and never tells us. yesterday i got a 3 hour break so i went home and, lo and behold, he has a girl over that we don't know and he makes them food and they retire to his bedroom (he pays 1/2 we do for same amount of space because we were nice). i leave our bedroom to find the front door unlocked. it was the last straw for me and my gf because he is not on the lease and we told him to lock it EVERY TIME, day or night. we don't want the landlord finding out he is there all the time (which he wouldnt be if he hadnt quit his job) and evict us for having someone else live there on the lease.

he's done shit like repeatedly use and not wash and cure our skillet correctly multiple times and we're done.

we are kicking him out today. any advice? he does not seem like the type to ruin our lives or explode but we do not think he understands how much risk he's putting us at.

i'd like to add that we did NOT know he was going to quit his full time day job to go back to school and be home all the time, putting us at further risk of eviction if the landlord saw him (and girls) coming and going. he did not mention this before moving in.",17Apr2019,1

490,"So I was part of the same friend group at my college for years. It consisted of 4 girls, two of the girls in the group had been in a romantic relationship for about 5 years.

We've been hanging out with one of them, we'll call her Allie, but the other has been avoiding us?

For weeks after they broke up, Sam and I have been inviting Allie to stuff like we normally do, but she keeps giving us the run around. Eventually, Allie hung out with me alone and she apologized for avoiding me. She said that Sam and I remind her too much of her ex because we were all friends together. But she hugged me and said things would go back to normal. I told her she should reach out to Sam as well and she said she would.

I believed her but now she's still ignoring both of us? I sent her a snapchat like 5 days ago and she hasn't looked at it. She knows I can see that. I still remember enjoying hanging out with her, we've made lots of memories together and now she's acting like I don't exist after apologizing for doing just that. I wish that she would at least be honest with me and say goodbye so I can have closure instead of stringing me along like this. I feel like she knows that I still want us to be friends like we used to. We also work together in retail so it's gonna be awkward when we see each other there.

This is an express bus, so it's all business-type people heading to/from work on a long commute -- no riff raff, better quality bus, etc. This particular man seems to be lacking in hygiene, so badly that he &amp; his clothes smell horrid. Honestly, they smell like he doesn't wash them ever, but, rather, he somehow recycles them, after having worked out, and leaves them in a pile where he picks them up a few days later for the next wear. And definitely no showering or hair washing. Just plain awful. And he always chooses to sit a seat or two in front of me. No matter the distance, though, I can smell him.

500,"Disclaimer: the text got a bit long, I am sorry.
Throw-away, because a friend of mine recently figured out my Reddit name. And sorry for any grammar fauxpas, english is not my mother tongue. First things first I recently got 20 years old and a big (really big) hobby of mine is playing video games, mostly competitive shooter on PC.
I built my first PC about two and a half years ago(before I only played cod on PlayStation).
I quickly got into csgo, later into pubg, Overwatch, apex and co.
At first my aim was really crap, but over time I got better and better. At the same time I built my first PC I went to a university about 2 hours away from my parents and I got my first own apartment there aswell. It was the first time I was living on my own and that I had the freedom to do what I want. The first semester was pretty fun I found a lot of new friends and the classes I had to take were interesting, after we had all our classes we sometimes went to party's, the cinema, u name it. And if we weren't I would went home and play cs. I was slowly getting better and better (mainly because I put a lot of effort and hours into the game). None of my friends who I went to university together were into gaming (or only consoleros), so I had to find people online to play with. And I did, I met so many great people online and some of them are my closet to this day.
Long story short: I started playing more on the computer and went less out with irl friends.
In my second semester I went less to the classes, because I put all of my time in gaming.
I got a lot better, for some references: I was global in cs and lvl 6 on faceit, master in ow and top 5% in pubg. At some point I joined a Semi-Professional csgo team.
In my third semester I went to none of my classes, not only because of my hobby, I felt less and less interested in the things I had to study. 
I stopped studying and went back to my parents house, im a got a really good job, which starts in August and shortly after I will have my own apartment again aswell. And now I am worried that I am gonna ruin that aswell. I am would not say I am addicted to gaming, I just that I will have some much more fun playing then doing something else.

On that note: what are some ETF’s or stocks you would recommend investing for either high dividend yield, long term growth, or just in general. Thanks!!",17Apr2019,1
503,"I'm 5'7"" and my average weight always fluctuated between 128-135lbs. My weight of preference due to my body type was always between 135-140 (I liked having curves in the right places). Anyway, I'm very self aware and considered myself a beautiful woman, gorgeous even..on my best days and on my worst days a little above average. Now, due to medication I must take, I have gainedalmist 70lbs about 8 months. 

I know I can diet. I know I can work out. But because of this drastic increase of weight I've become extremely insecure. Depressed. Depression had a snowball effect causing me to barely leave the house. Not take care of my hygiene like I used to. None of my clothes fit me and I refuse to throw them out because I had an adorable wardrobe. I've even started popping pimples and picking at them from anxiety/depression. I literally only went out and bought 3 black yoga type pants and a couple large/xl tops. And have a few hoodies that fit me. WORST part of my weight gain, is I've gained weight in my face. Other than that most of the weight on my body went to the right places (butt, breasts, thick thighs, big hips). Of course some went to my stomach but my stomach could be worse. 

Until I diet, etc...I'm wondering if anyone can help give me tips on how to embrace my body and become comfortable in my own skin. Summer is coming. I love swimming. But I've always worn cute bikinis....now I have no idea what to wear to the beach or if I should even show up there anymore. I'd like to suck it up and shop for clothes that fit me. But I don't know how. 

Any tips on how to sort of switch from having what I considered a lovely body to being over weight? 135-200 is a big difference. Like I actually struggle to reach around to wipe my butt now!!! This happened very fast. I have seen SO MANY GORGEOUS overweight women and I wonder if I can embrace my body like they do and get my confidence back. Please help!",17Apr2019,0

Hi,

I recently met up with BMG in New York and was offered an exclusivity contract with them. I'll read over more of the details later, but it seems that I would be exclusively represented by them for 18 months.

I just wanted to know how common practice this is, and if people have further knowledge, how is BMG as a talent agency? I'm looking to model and act, with acting being the long term goal. I'd be exclusive with this agency for 3 years if this is the case and don't really know how they stack up.",17Apr2019,1
508,"The night before my grandpas funeral I found a recording that he made one night when he couldn't sleep. The song is amazing, the lyrics are amazing. My family, and especially my grandpa, are all very musical and it was something that brought everyone together so I feel like everyone needs to hear this recording.

However, there are some sensitive lyrics in one verse in it that involve a younger woman he may or may not have had an affair type relationship with. The woman definitely took advantage of him years back and my large family fucking hates her and everyone has different thoughts and feelings about the situation. Half of my family is very sensitive and dramatic and loves to blow things out if proportion, so I decided that I should hold on to the tape while I decided what to do with it. 

Well I waited so long (several years) that now I feel like an asshole who took something that wasn't his and withheld it from the people who need to hear it. So on top of digging up all these old memories, and possibly confirming the relationship between my grandpa and this woman, I've also secretly been keeping this tape from everyone.

510,"I'm currently a high school senior and I'm trying to choose what college to attend next year. I got into a bunch of out of states (Colorado State, Arizona State, Virginia Tech, Purdue) and two in-state colleges (UC Riverside, SJSU). I know for sure I'm not going to the out of states because of the cost so I'm picking between my in states and community college. I didn't really like the UC Riverside campus because of the small engineering program and just a gut feeling that I didn't really like it. It was not my first choice and I don't want to go to a school I don't really like/?? My parents are saying that they don't want me to go to cc because they think I'll slack off for two years and fail like I did in high school. (I didn't fail, I have a 3.786 UWGPA and a 4.12 WGPA). I'd rather just do CC for two years and transfer into a college I actually like. The UC system has a transfer admission guarantee that is totally doable for me. Also, I'm not sure if I really want to pursue the major I got in for (BME) so I feel like CC would be a good place to explore that instead of struggling to switch majors. Do you guys think that what I'm doing is justified? Should I just go to UCR or should I go to CC? How do I convince my parents that CC is a good idea?  Feel free to ask any follow-ups.",17Apr2019,1
511,"We have a very tight knit friend group, where most of them are in high school and a few of us just entered college this year. After I left high school (still in the area for community college) the younger ones made a new friend who started a DND group with them. I thought I had made it pretty clear that I had always wanted to play DND and that there were just never any other people who wanted to play, but my friends didn't invite any of the college people. At first I was fine with it cause I thought eh, they know this kid better than I do, but it became so that every time we would get together they would be discussing DND while me and the other two college kids were left wondering what they were talking about. 
Eventually I asked one of them in private if they could ask the DM if I could join, since I didn't know him at all and didn't have any way to contact him, and the response was they had already asked and he said there were too many people. Okay I thought, that's perfectly fine. 

Come later, and someone new joins their group without anyone batting an eye, at this point their group was insanely large (9 players, although they almost never could get together at once). I felt a little bit like I was being left behind, until someone suggested I be added to their group DND chat (not to the game itself, just to the discord server). The only person who had access to add someone though started making excuses why he couldn't add me, and I just changed the subject because I didn't want to make things awkward. I haven't confronted him about it yet because I don't want to look like I'm trying to force the issue, but honestly it really hurt. 

Instead, later I suggested maybe we could make a smaller DND group for over the summer, and it turns out that they already moved their dedicated DND sessions to Saturdays, which are the only days we can meet over the summer because of work.

So now it feels like they've effectively pushed me out of the group and are just waiting for the summer to come so they don't have to deal with me at all, and I'm at a loss. We used to be very good friends, and I just don't know what I did to make them hate me. I don't really know what to do, it feels like if I make a wrong move everyone is going to abandon me, but also if I don't do anything then we'll just drift apart.",17Apr2019,1

513,"Hey, guys.

So, I just submitted an application to withdraw from college.

I’m 21, I work all the time because I am 100% self sufficient in all aspects of my life including insurance, medical, etc.

It was just too much. I’m overweight but not obese, I work 30-40 hours on the weekends, my car is about to go up in smoke, typical 20’s stuff.

I have a career path in mind with all sorts of potential, but it requires some things that I just don’t have at the moment.

For now, I am going to withdraw and stop taking out loans for school. It’s just too damned much. I’m disappointing my parents and grandparents but I don’t fucking care anymore. I’m not happy at all, and I’m going through way too much on my own.

I have to take care of my sister because my parents are mid crisis between each other because my dad cheated after losing a battle with PTSD. My mom is becoming an alcoholic and my poor little sister is the most innocent child ever. My brother tried to beat my dad and was arrested but moved away. We haven’t seen him in years, and he’s only 19.

I just need some guidance. I’m working on being disciplined and from the outside NOBODY would EVER be able to tell just what in the fuck has been going on. I had the BEST home life and childhood growing up and thus I was never exposed to ANY of these problems or taught what to do.

I just need help guys.

I have somewhat good health, I have a great job in a restaurant that pays well enough but I don’t want to be stuck.

I was thinking just work and save up, I’m moving home with my parents to take care of my sister and monitor them as well. I won’t be paying rent so there’s an extra $550 in my pocket a month.

I’m thinking about serving in the Armed Forces, or doing something better for my community and forgetting about myself for a while.

I just don’t know y’all. I’m at wits end, and I’m all alone. People have known me to be cool and collected and so not-give-a-fuck, and both my family and my coworkers put a lot on to me. They don’t realize it of course, but I’m the type of guy that always wants to help others. I guess it’s getting to me.

In the end I just want financial security and to provide only for myself for a while and make sure my sister gets what she needs, and has a childhood she’ll want to remember like I had.

Thanks for reading if you’ve made it this far!

TL;DR
I just dropped out of college. I want to be a police officer, but am not fit enough and do not meet some requirements. I am thinking about the Armed Forces. I want to provide for myself and be secure, and take care of my sister. I want to be happy but I’m so afraid. Any advice would be awesome, and thank you.",17Apr2019,1

I’m always questioning what would happen if I lost my job, what would happen if I have to start again from nothing.

517,"To start it off I live by myself (with the exception of a cute kitten).

So, I'm not that popular, I would say I have 3 close friends, which I would see maybe once a month, if that. So, I don't know where to go to with this problem of mine.

Just over a couple months ago I went to a car meet with one of those friends, when I got there I didn't know anyone, as my friend hadn't turned up yet, and I was speaking to a guy there, and this girl came over. Immediately I noticed her and I liked her straight away, so i took her out in my car (as she really liked it). Then we started talking a couple weeks after, I ended up picking her up and talking to her all night and then ended up kissing her. After that, I mentioned that I'm looking for a relationship as i don't do the whole fling thing. She said at that point that she's had bad previous relationships and that she's not sure what she wants, but said she really liked me and would something to happen.
A week goes by with us meeting, and she ends up coming over to mine and we engage in what adults do, twice, and we spend the night holding each other and cuddling each other. Which was great. But then an ex of hers showed up to her work (which she said wasn't nice as he did a lot of bad things), she then proceeded to tell me that him being there brought all the bad feelings she had about relationships and such, and asked if we could just be friends, I replied by saying that as I liked her too much I didn't think that was a good idea, so we've stopped talking. But I just can't get her out of my head, and every time I go to sleep I think about her and how upset I am.

I don't know what to do, i can't go out as i don't like going out by myself and there's not much night life where I live, and I can't see friends as they're always busy. I'm just running myself into the ground and I keep looking at my phone thinking she's going to message me saying she wants me but I know that's never going to happen.

I told him i ain't everytime he said that but everytime idiot was like it's okay i consider u so.... I was meh whatever... Then all the shit happened

He ruined a one of my other friendships with similar kind of guy who is more or less the same.
Comes and tells me that this guy said this behind ur back blah blah.... Gets angry if i don't hang out with him and always calls and msgs me alot even though i tell him i have other work and I'm hanging out with other friends(dosent bother and still calls me multiple times)he has this weird tendency to be more friends with me tries to kick out other ppl so that him and i could hang out.

He once threatened to kill himself once just coz i told we should maintain a dist.... Cries when i told him to stop being friends with me....

I tried blocking on insta and WhatsApp he pestered on why i blocked him what wrong have i done..... told every one of my school friends i have blocked him and went around crying abt it.

The worst part is a few ppl think I'm the bad person coz i choose to avoid these physco ppl they just don't know and tell stuff like he spends so much money on u bro....he is a true honest friend... he is a good person.... travels 15 km just to see you... why are u Behaving like this....fuckin idiots then i have to tell them a big ass story of all the shit he does. Still some assholes support him.

Calls or msgs me every fucking week. He also uses multiple nos or his frnds nos to call me..
I tried multiple methods ignore them, being emotionally dead, cutting calls all of them but the damm fellow travles very far and lands at my door just to talk to me.. And i tried avoiding irl.
I've tried multiple methods over the past 4 months i don't have a Fuckin clue on what to do.

The problem is this phsyco uses opportunities like this and talks to me and continue the same shit cycle again

Should i really continue being friends with any of my schlmates ?? I hate dogeing or giving ppl dumb shit man ? Tf do i do.

I also feel a little bit bad coz like 2 ppl are pretty goof ppl and I'm also behaving really badly to them also. But those assholes decided to hang out with these toxic ppl in the grp.

533,"So I just recently got out of the hospital for a spontaneous pneumothorax. For this reason I was staying with my grandmother and older brother. (They live together). Everything was fine until my mother showed up to pick up my little sister. My sister was staying with me so we could get our nails done and stuff. My sister shows signs of anxiety and ocd but my parents are the type to dismiss it because they don’t believe in mental illness. A little backstory so the whole confrontation makes sense. My dad is an abusive narcissistic alcoholic. He drinks everyday but only trips on us occasionally. But when he does it’s hell. He hits my mom, he’s hit me, choked my little brother, he’s thrown my older brother down stairs, busted his lip by throwing a phone at his face.. etc etc. my mother never stopped these things. She just cries and says she’s sorry for it. My relationship with her has always been estranged. It’s hard to explain but the best I can say is that it felt like she’s hated me my entire life. And as the years have gone by she’s become more cold. She acts like my father without realizing it and generally just doesn’t care about anyone but herself and my dad. And we have NEVER been allowed to express our feelings to them without being yelled at or put down. If we ask to just walk away , they follow us and scream and sometimes get physical. It’s like they can’t handle someone telling them no or walking away from them. I’m the only one among my siblings that has stood up to them. And I really think that’s why they hate me so much. But I’m grown now. I should be allowed to say whatever and walk away from situations that make me uncomfortable.  But anyways.....

my mom said something to my little sister and it was rude in my opinion. Just calling her annoying among other stuff and literally just looking at her like she was a piece of shit. Everyone in my family is constantly calling her annoying and dramatic and don’t even realize how it hurts her. But I can see it. So I followed her outside and just hugged her and told her “I don’t think you’re annoying, I love you and you’re not a drama queen like everyone says.” Because she truly isn’t. She started breaking down crying because it does hurt her when people treat her like that. She looks for attention because no one gives it to her(she’s homeschooled now and my mom takes her nowhere) and my family is just so careless in how they respond to her. I can’t go into detail about how she’s treated because it would take up this entire column. But anyways, my mom walks out of the house, notices I’m hugging her and immediately is going “Don’t baby her, yadayadayada.” And I calmly tell her as I’m making my way back inside that “it’s not about that”. My mom immediately gets aggressive and starts coming towards me “Then what’s it about??” . Again I look at her and say more irritated “it’s not about that”. So she starts getting all defensive and is still coming towards me saying whatever (I can’t remember). So I tell her in a firm voice , “don’t fucking start with me.” At this point I was already near the door to the house and she proceeds to yank me back and starts screaming in my face. I’m sure I said something back but it’s all a blur so I can’t remember everything that was said between the two of us. She then shoved me so I shoved her back and told her to stop. She then slapped me in the face. A 40 year old woman may I add. So I hit her back or I think I did.  At that point my husband grabs me and my brother grabs her. She gets a death grip on my hair and so I do the same to her. Neither of us could really get anymore hits in since we were restrained but she was trying so hard. Like I could feel the hate and it honestly shocked me. After we’re released from each other , I just start screaming insults and she’s screaming insults. I felt betrayed, hurt, and angry. Angry that she would do that in front of kids and my one year old especially. My whole life she’s treated me like shit. She’s never been a good mother in my opinion and never quite nurtured me like she did my brothers. My own father told me she would pick fights with me when I was a child because of how jealous she was of me and my dads relationship. Which now that I think about it, her doing that might be why me and my dad never connected. She didn’t want us too. As a teen her and my dad would blame me for our lack of connection saying I never wanted to spend time with them. But our whole lives, all they would do is sit in their rooms ALL day long and then tell us to get out as soon as we tried to come in there and hang out with them. Anyhoo. my mom was arrested for assault and family violence that night because it was confirmed by multiple witnesses that she initiated it. and the very next day my dad is messaging me off my little sisters kid messenger saying I’m a piece of shit and that I better not ever reach out to his family again. Threatening to catch me on the streets and saying my day to get my ass whooped  is coming. Cps was called on them and they blamed me even though they were told it was because of the assault charge. They told my little siblings it was me also which was so shitty of them to do. They also took my car that I’ve been making payments on and insurance just because it was co signed under my dads name. My issue with the whole situation is that I’m being treated like the bad guy by everyone in my family. Even my little siblings want nothing to do with me. My older siblings are acting that way too. But they were all there and saw what happened. Witnesses from across the street even told the police that she started it. My grandma hugged me and said “I can’t believe she would do that” but now everyone is treating her like the victim and me like the bad guy. I’m not allowed to speak to my little sister or brothers and they mean everything to me. They need me if they’re gonna be raised in that house. (Technically they’re my cousins but my mom has had them since they were little because their parents are drug addicts). I’m just wondering how this situation looks to you guys? Like was she in the wrong or was I? And I’d also like to know what happens in court in these types of situations? I have to come to her court date on May 6th and testify or something and I’m just nervous and tired of the whole situation.

535,"Okay , first post on Reddit and I’m kinda lost so sorry for any mistakes 


I’m a pretty lonely guy , I’ve Been with only 1 girl , and that ended ugly , she cheated . I don’t have any friends , don’t go out that much . 

So as I was lonely and sad , I did what  every man in need of human connection would do , install tinder . As I swipe , I realize that I just match with a friend of my sis[f20] . We saw each other a few times before that but nothing really relèvent and as lonely as I was , we started to chat , a LOT , we saw each other for a drink 2 times , and I started to develop feelings , we kissed , once , was amazing , so we decided that if we go further , we should tel my sis , witch I did (only that we had drink , not the romance part , wanted to go slow ). Long story short she is angry , telling me that her friend shouldn’t have drink with me , that she hates me for entering her friends group ect ... what do I do ? Do I let this go and never talk to my crush ? I’m lost 


TLDR : had the  beginning of a love story with my sister s friend , told her , she’s mad and it reap my crush and me",17Apr2019,1
536,"Hi everyone! Here's a little bit of background for the situation:

My sister (30F) has been married to this guy (36M) for almost six years now (they dated for four years before that) and they have two children (a three-year-old boy and one-year-old girl) together. Before having children, my sister brought in the majority of the income. However, since having children she's become a stay-at-home mom.

Her husband is a talk therapist and only chooses to work three days a week. In addition to this, he's trying to 'make a name' for himself over social media and travels all over the US and goes to expensive events trying to promote his 'brand'. Part of his 'brand' is vegan, oil-free foods, which he spends a ridiculous amount of money on. All of this is causing them severe financial issues to the point where my sister has very little to eat.

Additionally, he absolutely refuses to help with the kids in any way whatsoever. He won't parent them, watch them, feed them, clothe them, change their diapers, care for them when they're sick, nothing. The only thing he really does is passively play for them with a few minutes a day.

On top of all of this, the week their youngest child was born, he brought home his young, pretty 'social media manager', who he then proceeded to go on a ton on fancy 'business trips' with. All this while my sister was at home caring for a two-year-old and an infant. He doesn't even sleep in the same bed as my sister because he ""doesn't want his sleep disturbed when she wakes up to feed the baby"".

I've tried to reach out to my sister several times about the manner, but she keeps insisting that she'll pull through in the end, even though its clear that she's miserable. I think she wants to stay in the relationship for the kids' sake (they had their second child to 'save the marriage' so to speak). This upsets me, because its the same thing our parents did, and it ended up badly traumatizing me as a result.

I'm so worried for both my sister and her kids and I have no idea how to help her. Its frustrating since she insists she'll be okay and she doesn't want or need any help, even though she's clearly suffering. I can't stand to see her go through such awful things and be so thoroughly exploited by her selfish husband. For now I've let her know that her situation isn't fair and that I'm always there for her when she needs me.

Thank you so much!",17Apr2019,1
537,"I am in my early 20s but have known about being adopted for since I was 11. My parents have always been open with me about the adoption but did not know my birth parents. The wonder of who they are has remained in the back of my head for years until recently when I had a friend run my dna.

538,"I was with a guy last night and I made it clear that I didn’t want to have sex, but instead we did a lot of foreplay. The first time he came we were laying on the bed and it got on my hands and in the sheets. I wasn’t wearing panties but I was laying really close to him and my hands touched my vulva. Afterwards he was rubbing it against me, but never put it in. The second time he came he rubbed it against me again but this time I had my clothes back on. We were dry humping most of the time and he didn’t wear a condom. Though I had a good time, I was panicky because I was afraid of getting pregnant, so I immediately ran to the store and got a Plan B.

540,"The issue here is my college counsellor suggested that the only way they could help me was to see a psychiatrist (in addition to them) I think. I feel like this is out of the ordinary because I have seen a different counsellor in the past without having to see a psychiatrist. Something is up and I don't like it. Shouldn't counsellors alone be able to help me? Is that not sufficient? I felt very uncomfortable when they told me this. It was only our second appointment. I don't understand why seeing a psychiatrist is necessary. Is my counsellor making fun of me by suggesting a psychiatrist? Does my counsellor assume I'm lying to them? What if the psychiatrist sabotages my career? I don't understand why my counsellor is not giving me the solutions to my problems. I believe that they have the sufficient amount of knowledge to help me. I don't understand why they were so emphatic on seeing a psychiatrist; they said it 3 times or so. Seeing a psychiatrist is just a label of shame I think. In addition, if I choose to go to the psychiatrist, that would be admitting defeat. I don't want them to win.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm ambivalent because I feel like the counsellor only told me this to make fun of me and that the psychiatrist may be dubious, but I feel desperately sad and anxious, so maybe going there would help. But I'm not sure. I feel sort of capable handling my own problems, but it's been years now and my problems haven't gone away so I'm not sure. I feel like if I just got motivated enough, I could do it. I think I can do it myself; I don't think I need help. I feel really stupid for writing this post. Sorry.",17Apr2019,0
541,"So I’m in this decently big sized group of friends. The kind of group where we can hang in any combination and it’s fun.

542,"Forgive me for formatting or any of that jazz, been lurking for a little but this is my first post (on a fresh account without my name). 

I'm also adding this paragraph after writing this post, realizing that it's a pretty generic question. If this has already been done I apologize, but I do think that any advice sent to my corner will help me relate on a more personal level.

I'm a 5th year (23M) student, riddled with anxiety and depression  (classic). This is a burden I've held onto for years - but the last 6 months have taken a huge toll on my life, and the future of it.

If you want to skip another sob story, my question is: 

What is your drive? What gets you out of bed in the morning? I feel as though the perspectives directly around me correlate too closely to my own path, and I'd love to hear the motivation of strangers.

However, jumping into the thick of it I guess my situation now is this:
Self-loathing is a feeling I have not been able to shake for years, just like countless others. I continue to spend my university career feeling empty and meaningless, and the lack of purpose really hit me hard. Financial situation doesn't help at all - I rarely eat - if I do, its fast food, plain pasta, or rice and veggies. 
But I know there are alternatives and I know there's something to help me with every aspect of my troubles. 
The problem is, I just don't want to help myself. I cannot find a reason to help myself, and truthfully the only reason I'm here is because there are so many other people in my life I am letting down.
This year I will be failing out of school. I have 9 days to move out and find a new place with a friend who is only partially aware of my circumstances. I have parents who have worked tirelessly to help me with an opportunity I have completely massacred. I had a quality job offer for after I graduate, which would set me up for the rest of my life. This is also out the window.

I have been wasting away, fantasizing about my death every second of the day. 

But I know that's selfish. I know it's unreasonable. But with exponentially growing numbness to those feelings, how do you find the courage to get out of bed? What makes you want to work tirelessly knowing that, in the grand scheme of things, your pain and suffering is meaningless? Working through the lows to enjoy the highs is a nice thought, but what makes the highs worth it?

I just spent a few hours writing and rambling, getting a visual of my thoughts. I figured I got a little off track. So below are a few notes I decided to leave, if you're looking for a little more information or back story. Really looking forward to anything and everything someone has to offer. Thanks guys.

---------------------------------

The ""inevitability of death"" has a huge weight to it. I am completely aware that it shouldn't be something to focus on, but being in the situation I'm in I just can't find the will to be my best anymore. Before I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression in early March, this felt like ""lazy"". And I hate that notion. But I was embarrassed of myself, my accomplishments.
Relationships with close friends have diminished, and being the guy that ""exudes confidence"" helped me come to realize faking a smile is one of the most exhausting things to do - and I believe it has finally caught up with me. 

I had, and continue to have, an incredibly difficult time asking questions. I fear inadequacy, and I fear the people will realize my inadequacy. My university career really took a hit from this - however I was still managing to squeak by. 
However the harder the courses got, the more I isolated myself. I dont look at people in the eye anymore. I panic in public. My very existence is a burden to those around me. And even though the rational thinker in me can say ""that's bullshit,"" the thought is always drowned out by selfdoubt. 

I also want to emphasize that my outlook on life and the factors as to why I believe I feel like this have been a cultivation of those last 6 months. I've spent countless hours wanting nothing more than to rot, and in turn its given me lots of time to think about why I feel like I do.

A few steps I've taken to try and have a better outlook on life:
- Apart from the last month or so, I worked out regularly. 3-4 times a week in the gym
- I'm a huge tobacco junkie, dipping tobacco for 7 years and smoking for 2 after. In December I went cold turkey, (getting absolutely smacked with withdrawal), and for a full 2 months I didn't touch anything. I have since picked it back up
- I reached out to people close to me, some friends and my parents. 
- I've deleted the video games I hide in
- after years of reluctance, I saw a doctor

I've been told multiple times that counseling will make a big difference, and that's the next step I'll try and take in the summer.",17Apr2019,3
543," 

So I grew up in a very conservative family and in a very conservative church. Our church and cultural background are very strict on not being sexually active until marriage.

Anyways a long time ago, roughly 8 -9 years ago I had my boss make a sexual advancement towards me and I let it happen. It wasn't sexual intercourse, but was a sexual act. There were a few times where I stated I was uncomfortable with the situation but again still let it occur. This happened more than once. I was young and in my early 20's. I have never had any sexual activity since that point and did not have any prior to that.

Like I said I come from a very conservative church with a religious background. Talking about this to anyone is very difficult to do as it can have a big mark on my reputation in the community and is looked at very negatively. Mentioning this will make it difficult for me to date anyone within my community.

For other reasons it's also affected my ability to have a relationship with a significant other in the community. The main reason being is I am unsure if just not mentioning this and leaving it in the past is a form of lying to them. For obvious reasons I want to be straight and honest with the person that I may end up marrying, but also think and feel as though it is best to not mention this and leave it in the past. I have been asked if I ever had sex before and truthfully answered no as I haven't but decided to not mention that this event occurred.

Anyways I just wanted to seek advice on the best way to move on from this. If anyone has been or is in a similar situation, how do you cope with this and not let it affect and potentially ruin my life. I don't think its a good idea to bring old baggage like this into a new relationship.

Thanks in advance for everyone's responses.",17Apr2019,1
544,"I have this issue which pissed me off to the point I had to create a Reddit account. I work at burger king and basically I went to work one day and I forgot my hat. One of the assistant managers ask me why I don't have one and I told them I forgot it. Honest mistake right?

Apparently to them it is not. I was then called into the office by the manager who told me off. They read out a letter saying that they will open up a investigation about why I didn't have a hat. When I read the letter, they made it seem like I was going to court. I am not over exaggerating. In the letter it says I could bring any documents, witnesses and other form of evidence to my hearing.

Ok so fast forward to the meeting. They got in another employee as a witness. They read out statements and made me comfirm if is true or not. Then they made the witness write everything we said. After I have said my reasoning, which I thought was a good. They told me it was not good enough so I have to have a disciplinary hearing with the actual manager. 

I told this story to a couple of other people and they said I should complain about how much of a big time waste it is and even quit and find another job. Should I? I like working there, the people are nice, I get good pay for a part time teenager. What should I do? 

I haven't had my hearing yet and I want to know what I should do. Tell them it is stupid and quit? I want it hear what they say first. I never got in trouble by them before. I will update when I had my hearing.",17Apr2019,1

547,"So I bought a pretty expensive ticket for an event this weekend (an NHL playoff game), and created a new account on Stubhub to do so.

548,"I'm in a masters program and needed to take a foundations accounting class. The class is hard and in my opinion way too much work for the amount of credits.

Anytime I bring up a guy, he gets irrationally angry. Telling me I 'dont know them' (especially if they are from the internet). They could be dangerous, using me, etc. He also would demand that I give him their social media if I know them (I only did once, the 1st time) then if he found them he'd tell me how dumb they seemed and not worth my time, despite not knowing practically anything about them. We end up fighting about it everytime, to the point I don't tell him about any guy I talk to anymore. I have tried telling him that I know how to be safe talking on the internet, and have been for longer than he has. Another point is he has met almost all his friends off of Xbox, but if I do I'm 'putting myself in danger'. I told him and another friend in a group chat that one guy was asking for nudes but I had explicitly said no, then blocked the guy after he insisted. My best friend texted me privately and called me a wh*re, despite not sending any pictures. He, on the other hand boasts about his gf sending nudes. Some other important points: I'm bi, and he doesn't care if I talk about a girl. He also has very bad anger issues that he's working on. I need advice on how to handle this.

564,"I don't know what *exactly* he's taking, but it's honestly reached a point I'm seriously concerned.

Last year, he went to a doctor specifically to be prescribed pills to ""help him concentrate"". I don't know what specifically he's on, but I noticed an immediate change in his mood. He was certainly more focused, but he also became a *lot* less tolerant of things that ""get in his way"" at work.

Admittedly, he has a lot of work on his plate, which I imagine translates to quite a bit of stress. Our company basically *created* a management position for him, and he's been trying to excel.

Since he started taking these pills, though, he basically doesn't have an ""off"" switch. He works all day, gets home and either goes to play basketball, starts doing projects around the house, or starts working from home. And he's almost *always* up until like 1am doing work.

I was put on medication for ADD when I was a child, I reacted extremely negatively to it, so I've always been skeptical of those prescriptions. Similarly, an old coworker of mine used to take something to ""help concentrate"", and found he would suffer withdrawals when his prescription ran out.

We've both tried to voice caution to my friend, but he's always immediately dismissive. He pretends like he hears our concerns, but always rebuts with ""some people just genuinely *need* this stuff, I'm hyperactive without it, it's like it removes all the 'fog' from my head"".

It's clear he doesn't *want* to stop taking whatever he's taking.

Well, I've noticed he's been taking it a *lot* more lately. The past few days, I'd almost describe his mood as almost erratic. I was on the other side of the house yesterday, and out of nowhere heard him *YELLING* at a hockey game... which he was watching by himself.

And today, he's been in a shitty mood (I know because he has a lot on his plate), I tell him I have a quick question whenever he has like 5 minutes, and I see him go over and take another pill.

I've talked to his wife about it before, she was initially upset when she found out he was taking whatever pill he's on, but he apparently assuaged her concerns. He straight-up doesn't care what I think on the subject, and I'm really not sure his wife realizes how much he's taking, or how serious the effects *can* be.

My personal feeling is, if your job *demands* you're taking some kind of substance to meet the demands of your job, then your job has completely unreasonable demands. The fact that is seems to affect his mood has me more than a little concerned, and it's getting to a point it feels like he's just pissed off with everybody the moment he runs into any sort of a speedbump.

I'm debating with myself if I should ask his wife to sit down and talk for a minute the next time he's out (we're also roommates), and just try to express that I *really* think she needs to talk to him.

But then I worry she'd approach him like ""Well *jcorb said* you're taking too many pills..."", and either not thing it's a big deal, get him pissed off at me, or both.

I dunno. Should I just leave it alone?",17Apr2019,2

I am freaking out because I don’t want to be that new dumb hostess who doesn’t know anything and messes up rotation. I get that you seat people to whatever order the servers came in. But I don’t understand who is in what section! Or how to constantly be able to check on which tables have left and which tables need to be bussed. Especially since some sections are out of my view. It’s all just a lot more than I would have expected. I’m so overwhelmed with anxiety and fear....
ANY advice I can get would be great. I need the work but my anxiety is so bad it’s all I can think about on my day off! The rest of this week I will be working. I’m freaking out. I know hostessing is “easy” once you get to it and it’s a “learning process” but I am honestly terrified.",17Apr2019,1

568,"This is a long story so bear with me. 

Before I tell my story (that is happening rn), it needs a little context. I live in a third world country, that haves a bad economy. So everytime I talk about money. I'm going to use the real currency of the US dollar. But, the more accurate way to think about this is a 1 to 5 ratio. So if I say 10 bucks in my economy it meant 50 bucks in your economy. For reference, a good meal here cost 2 dollars and from what I knew a good meal there cost 10 bucks. Now let's go to the story.

Cast: me - me or L, my friend - F

Me and F are friends since we were at preschool. We are friends through our church community, so I met him at most twice a week. 

Since I was at the fourth grade, I knew he was kinda off on some ways. I have a Nintendo ds growing up and I knew the only reason he was friends with me is because I have that Nintendo ds. Also had a friend that has a psp growing up and the only reason F is friends with him is because he had that psp. Anywho, I have my concerns but at the core, he was a nice guy (also I was a kid, so my judgment is not the best). With the passing of time, I thought his behavior would change within time. 

When I was at the 5th to 6th grade, my behavior started to change. from an entitled bratty kid that cries at the littlest things to a half decent person. Because when I was at the 5th grade, I was shoved to a bigger public school from a small school that haves 10 pupils a class. Also, I was bullied a lot. That changed me as a person (that is why IMHO bullying is okay for the right things, it'll push you to a better version of yourself). Long story short, I changed. But, F doesn't.

From that point forward, I realized that he acts like a kid. Even though he is a nice person, he acts childish. He has a mind and body of an adult, but he acts so childish. Ughhh... Even thinking of him rn just angers me. 

He is a master of manipulation, he once manipulate a church councilor to petty him (look I don't have proof that he is lying, but judging by his actions I knew there was something). If he is friends with someone, it is always friends with benefits. 

So you're asking, maybe he has a disorder of some sort? Nope, I don't believe that. I also have to tell that he is very cheap, but kinda not. If he had a lot of money he wouldn't care about buying stuff, but, when he doesn't have a lot of money he would be very hesitant in using his money. In one hand he is very hesitant in using his money, in the other he loves to buy stuff that he wants. His solution, borrowing my money. I told him that he has to manage his money wisely, and he couldn't just borrow money to solve his problems. At that time he just borrowed money to buy some food, so I digress, it is just food. So I lend him 2 bucks and said to me that he would repay me next week.

Next week rolls by and of course he said that he couldn't pay. he said that he would pay me the money when his parents gave him his offering money. I said that, that money should be given to God etc and shouldn't give it to me. He said ok and I said you should have your money in the following week. Looking back, I just felt that it is one of his manipulation techniques to guilt me another week.

The next week rolls by and he had the money, I gladly take it and things went okay. Remember he is still an annoying person, he would force me to do things I don't want to do (nothing to harsh, like play pubg when I was minding my own business, going to a food arcade even though I don't want to or force me to borrow him my motorcycle because he wants to use it). It gone to a place that when I confronted that to him he would just guilt trip me. I gave him another fact about how to fix it, he just stays quiet and made up a ton of excuses. When, I was done. He asked me if I want to play pubg. I gave up, as if he hasn't learned anything from this 

Since then his spending increased from 2 bucks to 3 bucks to 5 bucks. And with each incremental, will take longer and longer time. But, he always pays. A month ago he phoned me saying that he needs 10 bucks, to buy a phone quota, I said that I can't give you money unless you give me down payment. He doesn't want to, but still pushes me to give him money. Okay, I'll give money if only you could repay me next Sunday. If I don't have my money, I would never borrow you money again and will tell his father to give back. My money (that he is very afraid of and he doesn't want his father to know he has been borrowing some money, also kinda forgot we are still highschoolers)

He agreed and I gave him my money. At that time I have a lot extra money, not Rich in any ways, but I have enough to spare.

Sunday rolls by, and he gave me 5 bucks. He said, he took it from his personal savings and will try to give back the rest (another way to guilt trip me. I know he was telling the truth, but, he doesn't need to tell that to me right). Skip weeks of telling him he need to pay his debts and F saying he will pay it next week.

Which leaves me at today, what should I do, rn I'm kinda dry with some dough, that's why some extra money would be helpful. Should I just left him to pay or ask his dad to pay the extra. He is still a nice dude, but I just can't tolerate the bad stuff to look at the good stuff.",17Apr2019,1
569,"Hi everyone so imma try and keep this short as possible! Also I'm on my phone so yeah :/ sorry.

So me and some of my family have a rough history that we have since gotten over. My sister in law is currently pregnant and her baby shower is in a week. I've brought her a nice, expensive (ish) gift that I knew she really wanted, not for any reason other than I knew she wanted it and it meant a lot to contribute. Her family however have been involved in a lot of our drama and they do not like me. Depsite being the scummiest family I've ever met (I will explain further if you don't trust me, but seriously) , they look down on me immensely and are two faced as hell. 

They are attending the baby shower, obviously, but my only issue is there is hardly anyone j know that is attending the event so I know I'll be incredibly awkward there, but I know it would kick off if I did not attend (and of course I want to attend) and I'm helping set everything up so I have no real choice. But it also means that I spend 4+ hours being really uncomfortable around people that I either don't know or who would sooner spit on me then act civil. It makes me sick thinking about it with the history between me and them. 

Whilst me and my family have a good relationship, when her family is around I get pushed to the side and am usually extremely uncomfortable when around them. Any advice on what to do?? I'm dreading it.",17Apr2019,1
570,"Good afternoon AskReddit, my apologies if this post is not appropriate.  Just looking for some advice, really.  As the title says, I'd like to go back to school for a math degree but I really don't know where to start.

Background:  I really enjoyed and was pretty good at math through 7th grade, which was basically a pre-Algebra class.  I ended up taking Algebra in 8th grade and, because of some personal disagreements with the teacher, started disliking it.  I still did fine in the class, passed and whatnot, but I feel like I got behind on some concepts and wouldn't ask for help.  I did fairly well in Geometry as a freshman, then okay in Algebra 2 as a sophomore.  It didn't really feel like it was clicking but I could get through it, right?  I then took Pre-Cal/Trigonometry and then Statistics my junior and senior year respectively and I got As, but mainly because the teacher was in and out all year due to her husband passing away, so we would sometimes spend literal months on one topic (imaginary numbers for example).  Certainly wasn't the most structured program.  I passed an early College Algebra credit so I didn't need to take a math class in college as part of my gen eds, and then I took basic stats after I changed my major to Healthcare Administration.  Beyond that, I've taken a few business courses like accounting, macro/micro, and risk analysis that didn't really require more than Algebra, and these were all a few years ago.

I graduated in 2018 and my last math course was that risk analysis class in 2017.  What I'd ultimately like to do is major in Applied Mathematics with a concentration in Statistics, and then minor in Actuarial Science.  The course listing is all stuff that I feel is way beyond my depth of understanding, as I don't think I'm prepared for even basic Calculus.  What do you think is my best option to prepare if I do ultimately pursue this?  I don't know if I should try Khan Academy, summer or adult ed courses, etc.",17Apr2019,1

576,"i don’t really need advice. i just need a different perspective on the situation, more or less. 

i should start by explaining. so i have a sweet life. go to a good school, have a nice home, get treated well (i’ll elaborate on that later) get whatever i want. 

but, it’s my mom. i’m fairly young. and my mom is very strict and protective with me. and that’s totally understandable. my mom is russian so she’s really protective of me. the russian part will be relevant later. 

anyway, my mom is really interesting. it’s kinda like she has huge anger issues. 

whenever i do something wrong or don’t listen she yells at me. she scolds me all the time. whenever i try to talk to her she starts arguing with me. and threatens me a lot (saying she will hit me take away my phone) 

of course, when i’m super nice to her she’s nice back. but anytime i wanna speak about something and keep the topic going, if she doesn’t like it she doesn’t hesitate to yell at me.

whenever my parents fight she hits him (her bf of many years) and the thing is he never takes sides. he sees her yelling and usually just says nothing or takes her side saying she’s right. i’m sure he’s scared of her too. 

i can never do anything without her yelling at me. my grandma and i were talking about her. my grandma said how she doesn’t really love her and that she needs help. (my mom is actually really mean to my gramma and yells at her too. but my gramma failed as a mom when my mom was little so that may tie into it)

ok. my mom is russian. many russians (or the ones i know) like to be very strict with their kids. my mom sometimes hits me. sometimes. even if i make a silly mistake. i prepare to get yelled at. i’m really scared of her. 

i’ll tell you one story. my mom asked me to walk the dog. i went outside (in shorts and a t-shirt even tho it was kinda cold and my shoes were on the wrong foot but it usually wasn’t a problem. anyway, i get outside and my dog sees a leaf. she starts dragging me to chase the leaf and i come inside bleeding everywhere. in balling my eyes out and my mom yells at me. she slaps me multiple times and says i can’t do anything right. she never apologized and only used the scared excuse. she got me healed up tho. 

one more thing. i obviously have a phone. i got an alert and my mom checked who it was. i said why she always checks my phone, i need some personal space. she then goes on about how i have no personal space and does a whole thorough phone check / look through. 

i do struggle with some self esteem issues and my mom yelled at me for how i was “fat” and how i have to get skinny by the time summer comes around. i was at a play and my mom had to pick me up (we were driving to florida the next day and i still had to pack. it was late but that was my own issue.) she starts texting me saying how she’s gonna leave if i don’t come out soon (the play had around 5-10 min left) she was threatening me a lot. kept spamming me. 

i do struggle with mental health issues because of her. i never got diagnosed because i never wanna tell her about this. i’m not gonna go into it but my mental health is def worse because of her. 

she screams a lot in the car and i always cry a lot when that happens because it’s really bad and she never stops. i’m kinda used to it (it happens A LOT) so i don’t say any word. 

she gets really violent sometimes (as i said before) sometimes in the car she bangs things and hits me and whatnot. 

but i love my mom. as i said before she does a lot of good for me. sometimes i just wish she doesn’t exist. i don’t think she should raise her voice or hit me even if i’m in the wrong. sometimes i’m not even that wrong tbh. 

alright anyway, thanks for reading this whole post. if you did, i’m know this case isn’t awful compared to people that actually are abused. i just want a strangers perspective on how the situation looks. is it abuse? is it just strict parenting? lmk.",17Apr2019,1

My boss knows that I was in a mental health hospital about a year ago, and first started by talking to me about her mental health problems.  She's done this for a while, but last week after a meeting at work, she asked me to stay and talk to her.  I had been out of work for the three previous days as a result of some state school testing that I had to complete.  When everybody else had left the room, my boss told me that I am the only person who understands her, and when I wasn't there the past few days, she couldn't cope.  She pulled up her shirt and showed me some aggressive self-harm marks that she had made on her stomach the night before.  At this point, I was shocked and kind of angry, because she knew that I had dealt with self-harm problems in the past, and seeing someone else's self-harm marks is a huge trigger for a lot of people who self-harm.  I haven't self-harmed in several months, but her actions could have set me back to the beginning, and were still kind of triggering to see.  My boss then said that she couldn't cope when I wasn't at work to help her regulate her emotions, so she decided to schedule me the same hours as her the next week, so that I could talk her through this.  The day after she told me this and showed me her fresh marks, my boss was admitted into the psychiatric hospital, and I felt responsible because, although I tried to remind her that self-harm is not a road she wants to go down, I still couldn't stop her.  I felt guilty and upset, and I dread when she comes back to work on Monday and tries to talk to me about her feelings.  I think our relationship may have crossed appropriate employee-employer boundaries, or even the boundaries of what an adult should be putting on a minor, but I don't know what to do about it, and I'm at a loss for words about how unprofessional it was to me.  I am thinking of asking for a transfer, but I don't want to have to explain it to her boss and have her get in trouble, or to not get the transfer and then have her know that I talked about it with her boss so that she makes my life a living hell.

I am currently in a really difficult situation. 

I have been with my current girlfriend for over 3 years and have always pictured my future with her. We met at school and went to the same university, and now live in the same house with 3 other people, and have about 2 months left of the current uni year.

Next year for my course I have to do a year in industry, and have been given two job offers; one in the city my uni is in and where my gf will be next year (will call job A), and one in my hometown meaning I would be able to move back home for the year (will call job B). I am very stuck as to which job I should take.

Out of the two jobs, I would say I prefer job B, as it is more in the industry that I see myself going into long term, and would rate it as a 7/10, and would rate job A at about 5.5/10.

Job A pays a lot more, but seems very strict, very corporate and quite restrictive. Job B pays less, but has a more relaxed feel, and the work is much more interesting to me, and there is possibility that if I do well in this position that they would take me on permanently.

Having discussed this with my gf, she has said that she would not be able to do long distance, and that the chances are we would not work out. 

I am left with a dilemma, in which I feel like I either have to choose a great job that I would enjoy, but mean losing my girlfriend. Or I have to choose a job that I won’t enjoy so much, but would mean I stayed with my girlfriend.

591," 

I just realized I emotionally shut the door on my wife of 3 years

Background: I'm an INFJ guy, raised by 2 parents still married. She's an ENFJ, raised by 2 parents who are now divorced and remarried. Both stepparents are also divorced and remarried. We live in texas, my family is here, her family is in Denver, CO.

This last year we have been in a great spot financially, I have a good job but my hours are inconsistent and it's hard to find time to spend together. However, I prioritize our time we do have together and ensure we have quality time. Since this job, all of our conversations have been about her being a stay at home mom, buying a house, or things of that nature. She asks me daily when we will buy a house or when she will be a stay at home mom. On the contrary, she will jokingly tell me I don't love her, I want to be with other girls, my parents hate her. I used to have a good relationship with my parents but I've significantly limited my interactions with them because when I get lunch or something with my dad she feels like i'm excluding her. I have told her I would do anything for her. I offered to move back to her hometown jobless, join and hang out with whoever she wants to. I have done my absolute best to give her anything and everything she has asked for.

Now I am exhausted, 2 days ago she called me a fucking retard and said she hated me. she apologized today for her words, but that's not the first time I've been cussed out, screamed at in my face, etc. This week has been different though, it's like emotionally I hit a silent but deadly breaking point. She noticed my changed in emotional energy towards her I believe and now has been repeated at me, ""you want to divorce me, you want to divorce me."" Something switched in me. I told her today I don't know what to do anymore and she replied back, ""I feel like you lost your fight for me."" truthfully I have. I don't know what to say,do, or give her that would make her happy. Ultimately I want her to be happy, but I feel this is near impossible. We briefly talked about divorce and she said that now she wants to die and kill herself. My heart is broken for her but at the same time, I can't explain in-something deep DEEP within me is preserving itself. It's like every line of defense within me has been broken down of trying to keep this thing afloat and now I find myself feeling absolutely emptied of all vision for us together. My strength to continue to persevere has literally been entirely drained. However, simultaneously I love her and I know I always will, it still kills me to see her cry and be miserable-I told her she can have all my the money we have, I will pay off her car, she can have both dogs, and the list goes on. I just want her to be happy. I don't know what to do. I'm married to her, but at the same time, I've lost who I am in all of this and her loneliness, insecurity has only gotten worse, she doesn't trust me either.

That same nervousness goes away when it is in-person.

Also, that nervousness ONLY happens to me when I have to speak formally such as giving presentations. No other aspect of life. I guess I view in-person interviews more as a conversation and phone interviews as a presentation.

I usually prepare for the phone call by spending time the days leading up to it writing down things I would like to highlight on my resume and questions I want to ask about the company. I use the notes during the interview. I thought this would help organize my thoughts during the phone call.

It seems there is no medical solution for nervousness. Online says bs like breathing techniques, visualizing the interview, and accepting the situation lol. I was wondering if anyone has found any weird solutions that helps calm those kind of nerves?",17Apr2019,2
596,"Hi, I'm a high school student and I have a big decision to make. While I don't have to do this immediately, I do need to make this decision sooner rather than later. 

I'm not really asking for places to find this information, I'm more curious for with my skill set and personality, what do you think I would be good at career wise? (Your answers will not be the end of this, I will merely take them into consideration)

Unlike most of my peers I cannot afford to waste college trying to decide what to do, so this is something I must do in high school.

I'm a female in gifted classes. I'm currently taking AP World History, and I signed up for AP Environmental Science and AP English Language. I'm one year ahead in math. English is my weakest subject, and while I'm good at math, I'm not super fast at it. (Concepts do click in my brain but they take longer than my peers). I'm currently taking art and choir, with plans to enter band next year. 

I like drawing and painting, biking, playing the piano, and writing poetry. I'm interested in astronomy, aeronautics, automotives, bikes, and video games. I want to be able to make enough money to financially support myself, but also not be overwhelmed with long work days, tight deadlines, and confined spaces with a lot of people. 

I'm really bad at following verbal instructions, doing things that I don't see the point in, not being burnt out, and taking criticism well. I'm known for being extra and a perfectionist with my work, and I try my best to not procrastinate. I'm an introvert and I'm socially awkward. 

I have several health issues, including depression, anxiety, and chronic ankle/knee pain. All of these are being treated, but all are life long battles. My doctor suspects I might have asd and/or ADHD, and an as of yet unconfirmed spd. Also I have bad eyesight.

With these character traits, what do you think I would be well suited in?",17Apr2019,1

I won't go into too much detail about the act itself, but it wasn't really for me. Afterwards, I cleaned up, put the banana inside a used toilet paper roll and put that inside an empty, resealable candy bag and put the whole package into the trash can in my room. This morning I woke up and decided it was best to take the bag to the dumpster outside just in case.

601,"I’m 22F. My ex and I broke up 6 months ago. We had been dating for 4.5 years and I fully believe he would be the man I was going to marry. I still can’t seem to shake that belief.

I’m in graduate school 8 hours away from where he’s living. I still love him. I’ve reached out to him multiple times. He says he needs some time to figure things out before he’ll be ready to talk to me but it seems like he’s not super interested in keeping in touch or revisiting the relationship.

602,"Background:

&amp;#x200B;

I live in California and I graduated with a B.S. in electrical/computer engineering last May. The problem is I dislike EE/CE and honestly cannot see myself doing that for a living. I did fairly well in school (cum laude) but did not bother seeking any internships.

&amp;#x200B;

About 2 months before I graduated, I was offered a job from a family friend. This dude had a new business idea and needed what was essentially a computer dude who could also develop mobile apps/programs. This guy is fairly old so he doesn't understand the difference between IT support/SysAdmin/Software Developer - to him it's all computers. He said that I could start right after graduation and would pay me the starting salary for new graduates from my major from my school (65k, EE/CE). He also said that I would be salaried, have extremely flexible working hours, and that a trip abroad once a year would be no issue (this was especially important to me). This all seemed great so I obviously took the offer.

&amp;#x200B;

I graduated and started ""working"". As I said earlier, this is a new business so there was a lot of stuff that was not ready. The first month of ""work"" consisted of me driving 40 minutes to a temporary office location for a 2 hour meeting before getting to go back home. Meetings consisted of me, my boss, his secretary. My only responsibilities at this point were to create a website so after our 2 hour meeting my boss said that I could just go home and work on it whenever. I was paid in full for this month, approximately $5400 before taxes (65k/12).

&amp;#x200B;

After the first month of ""work"", my boss calls my parents and says that he cannot afford to pay me in full until the business actually starts. My boss said that he could pay me 1/2 my salary and that we would only need to meet once a week until the business officially starts. My parents and my boss come from a different country and my parents explained that the reason my boss called them first instead was a cultural thing. Anyways, like I said, this was a new business idea and everything at this point was on paper. There were a bunch of issues that needed to be dealt with internally and I was later informed on these issues so I know they're not just an excuse.

&amp;#x200B;

My boss's original estimate for the ""half salary limbo period"" was 3 months. Long story short, due to issues spawning issues that spawn more issues, I have been on ""half salary limbo"" for the past 9 months. My boss's most current estimate for the business ""officially starting"" is another 4 months, which triggered this post.

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the advice...

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't see myself doing EE/CE for a living but I don't think my current situation is sustainable in the long term. The main reason I took this job and disliked an EE/CE career was due to flexibility and vacation time. I've taken biannual trips to Asia (visit family/relax) all my life every 1 or 2 years and wanted to keep this up as much as possible after getting a job. This whole situation has been weighing on my mind really heavily recently and I've been getting increasingly worried.

&amp;#x200B;

\* If I find a ""real"" EE/CE job I will be paid ""what I'm worth"" but will lose my flexibility and be restricted to a week (or two if I'm lucky) of vacation time per year.

\* If I stick with my current ""job"", I could potentially end up with a near ideal job (good pay, flexibility, vacation time).

\* If my current ""job"" doesn't pan out, the longer I wait to find a ""real"" EE/CE job the harder it will be.

&amp;#x200B;

If I were to stick with my current ""job"" at least until the rest of this year, would it be a good idea to bring up:

&amp;#x200B;

\* pay - the 65k starting salary was mentioned to be ""pre probation"". I think it's safe to say that after a year I've passed probation.

\* flexibility - exactly what he meant by flexibility and how it would affect things when we actually start

\* vacation time - his secretary explained that was no ""real"" vacation policy and only said that a yearly trip abroad would be absolutely fine. Should I ask them to come up with a real vacation policy and get it in writing?

The worst of it however only occurs on the first day, occasionally the first 2-3. Painkillers sometimes work sometimes do not. 

Whenever I call in (which is not often, I normally do my best to power through) due to this cursed week I just have said I am sick.

607,"I have a 2013 Chevy Spark. Hubby and I are the second owners, and we purchased it in 2017 with approximately 29k miles. It now has about 48k miles on it. 

Over about the last month or so, I have heard a water sloshing sound coming from the car when starting it up or when idling for an extended period of time. It doesn't ALWAYS do this, but it definitely does it enough to be noticeable. However, I ignored the sound, as Google searches said that could sometimes be normal. 

Now, for about the last two weeks or so, whenever I have ran the heater, the heat will last for about five minutes (note that this is after the car has been moving for a while, so the engine has had plenty of time to warm up), and then it's like the strength of the heat begins to fade. And then eventually, it's blowing cold air, and I end up having to turn the heater off. I can turn it back on again a few minutes later, but again, the heat will only last for anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes, and then go back to blowing cold air.

I checked my coolant just this morning. The reservoir looks completely full, but it's not colored like you would expect it to be. It's completely clear. So I'm wondering if I only have water in my reservoir, and not actually coolant? This is the first time we have ever had this problem with this car (although I did have to replace the spark plugs last year because it was occasionally mis-firing). Also, when I was looking at the reservoir, while it looked completely full, it also looked like there was maybe a little bit of liquid around the outside of the tank, and there was some sort of liquid on other things under the hood. I don't know if this is normal for lubrication of the parts of the car, or if the reservoir is cracked at all. It didn't look like it was, but then, I don't know much about cars, so I don't really know what to look for. As far as I can tell, though, there have been no puddles or liquids under my car, so i don't think it's leaking anything that way.

Should I have it checked? I don't know if the previous owners ever flushed the coolant or not, and I don't know if it's due for a flush since it's at 48k miles or not. Google also said that if the coolant tank is full and you're not getting heat, it could be your water pump.

What do you guys think this could be? And what is typically the average cost to fix it? And how long can I drive it in its present state? I figure since it has no other issues and I won't need the heater anymore come June, it should be fine to wait til fall, but I don't want to risk possibly damaging the car, either.",17Apr2019,1

So first off I'll start off by saying that I have pretty bad anxiety, which is kinda messing up this whole situation. I'm a 15 yr student from a random European country and this year, in the middle of june,i  have an exam that's considered veryy important in my country, it's supposed to assign students to different high schools based on their final grade, and I've been studying really hard since the start of the year, I've also gotten a private tutor for math since my teacher sucked. Now, I've improved a lot but I'm still lacking so much, plus my anxiety just fucks up everything and i tend forget a lot of information thanks to it. 
My issue is that there's this Erasmus project going on in my school and the teachers + principal are really pressuring and insisting on me to go (no one really speaks english here, also mine kinda sucks sorry) but the thing is that the camp thing lasts 10 days, and when I come back i'd only have 2 weeks left until my exam, and one of them is gonna be wasted on just mandatory end of the year celebrations . I'm just afraid of wasting time, disappointing everyone if i get bad results on my exam, i think I'll automatically just blame the fact that i chose the camp over studying if don't get a good grade. My mind just gets blurry when i think about the consequences. This is also my first exam ever. People keep on telling me that I'll never get such an opportunity, to travel overseas for free again, but i just think that I'll also never get to take the exam again. Everyone just tells me that I'm smart and that I should stop worrying, that I'll get in that certain high school anyway, but I'm just very paranoid, they don't know what's going on in my mind and that im not actually that smart.
I know it seems like a stupid problem, but I really need to know what other people would do if they were in my shoes. Once again, I'm sorry for my mediocre english.

And at one point in my teen years he was into me and we had to take a break for a while so he could get over it. For some reason I’m incapable of having male friends. For example, I used to be in a long term relationship, and I made 2 friends in class. As soon as my ex and I broke up, they both tried to go for me. I’ll admit that I did do a few things wrong. I was trying to get over the breakup and ended up having some innocent make out sessions with both of them at separate times and of course this totally ruined the friendship, but they both told me they had the hots for me the entire time and just waited to shoot their shot. This happens to me constantly. Anytime I meet a guy I don’t even know how to befriend them anymore because they take my friendliness as flirting and will always try to ask me out or hookup w me. I’m super tired of it because a lot of my girl friends have plenty of male friends and I’ve even tried to meet them but they will always say things to my friends like “who’s your hot roommate?” Or something along those lines.

622,"I won’t go into major details as those are fairly irrelevant, but in summation: I have a very private discord server with maybe 20 or so close friends. We talk about pretty personal things in there including PTSD and trauma, amongst other mental illness issues, vent, send pictures of ourselves and our pets...like I said, personal things. People share art and writing too, but it’s all a group of people we trust and feel comfortable with. People know each other’s hometowns too. Maybe this seems unwise and it probably is, but no one has ever given us any reason to doubt them. We talk on voice chat and do artistic projects together, as we are part of a fan community. It’s just a nice escape from reality.

But part of that “venting” portion, is that we vent our grievances about other fans (none of which we are friends with and no one who is in this server). A few friends and I share an ethnic/religious background with a character and one artist in particular does a fairly offensive portrayal of them, so we occasionally bring her up (and I mean, extremely occasionally).

Well, someone in there was lying about being “friends” with us and started posting our conversations about that artist in particular. This wouldn’t be a big deal to me quite honestly...I mean, it breaches our privacy, but what does bother me, is that this person has not one, but two “hate” blogs for me, where they post fake screenshots of me saying pretty offensive things. This person has also threatened me with knowledge of my location, framed me for hate speech and is holding the fact they have pictures of me over my head...and they claim it’s justified because we’ve talked poorly about this one particular artist in private.

I really am at a loss right now. I’ve done everything I can to lock the discord server, remove personal information, remove everyone except for close friends (people I’ve known for a long time), etc. The problem is, these anonymous hate blogs are 100% anonymous. I know the people they’re sharing our information with, but even these people don’t claim knowledge of who’s behind it and they have me blocked.

This wouldn’t all be such a big deal to me, except that I like to remain a lot of anonymity online. In fact, I’ve only shared pictures of myself once in October for Halloween and a second time, a few weeks ago. I’m desperate and afraid of people associating my online persona with anything from my personal life. I really and truly don’t know what to do about this.

I left on a pretty bad note and on my way home, he messaged me that he still has my nude photos I sent to him. I ask if it is a threat and he denies it and says he ""deleted"" them. 

I get home only to see that he has messaged my mother saying that I am selling explicit photos online for money and my photos posted on his Twitter with the caption, ""Fuck her! 'I'll never cheat' my ass, so much time wasted, this is why you never chase a bitch, go for the bag instead 💰. She sold her nudes to stangers, don't buy them, here they are for free. Expose this fake ass hoe"". 

Now, I never cheated on him. Ever. He found out after we started to date that I had sent photos once for money, however this was 4 months before we began our relationship. I'm kind of just lost and in shock at this point and I'm not sure what to do. Any advice?",17Apr2019,2

630,"Hey reddit users, 18 year old college student here! 

There's a good trade off in being socially afluent and study oriented. The problem with me is that, i can't seem to let go of relentlessly churning and pondering about my studies. Well.. studying is all i can do, but i want to be able to let go. 

To give a clearer explanation, i would feel disgraced at not getting at least an 'A' grade or not doing as well as my fellow peers. I would get hit by a wave of low self esteem and selfworth if i dont hit an acceptable goal. How do i get out of this psychological hellhole? 

I don't want grades to define who I am as a person, i need some advice on letting go being study oriented. I feel like I'm missing out socially as well.

635,"I hate my current position and I kind of want to die. (Getting help, but I'm not at risk of suicide, just kinda apathetic and ahedonic). I'm working 60 hours most weeks and the work is very stressful. 

Currently making $68,000 with great benefits, but in a little over two years I'd be making $115,000 with up to a $20,000 bonus if I stayed here. 

If I decided to do my own thing, it would be slow for the first year, but I'd be getting paid significantly more on an hourly basis (I'd get around $400/hr in profit). It would be difficult to get to $50,000/yr profit but doable in 2-3 years. It would be realistically impossible to grow past $100,000/yr by myself. 

It would be illegal for me to keep my current job while starting my own business. 

Other jobs are a possibility but the odds are not great l am contacting recruiters and applying for positions though.

636,"We'll call my girlfriend ""Jane"".

Jane (20) and I (23) have been dating for about 10 months now. Originally, she was going to move last month, so we decided that we wouldn't get our family's involved in our relationship because neither of us wanted to do long distance. We felt it would be mean to get know everyone only to say goodbye a short time after. Both of us still live with our parents because we're both going to college and can't work full time.

We just received word that her move will be postponed for at least another year, maybe more. Her family knows she's been dating someone, and most of mine does too (we'll get to mine in a second - - that's the issue). Her family wants to meet me, and since she's Hispanic, that pretty much means EVERYONE wants to meet me. This weekend I'll be going down to a family gathering and meeting the whole family. I'm nervous about that, but overall I'm fine with it and agreed to go. 

Now she also wants to meet mine. I have no problem introducing her to my mom, stepdad and sister, in fact, my sister already knows her personally, and they all knew I was dating her.

My dad and that side of the family is another story entirely.

On my dad's side, my uncle, aunt, grandma and cousin know I'm dating her, and we've all agreed to keep it a secret from my dad and stepmom. I have no problem introducing Jane to my dad's side of the family, but I'm not sure I want my dad and stepmom to know until I'm out of the house. The thing is, I do love my dad and I feel like if he was the last to meet her, it would really hurt him.

So, let me explain why I don't want my dad and stepmom to know about Jane:
1. Stepmom hates me. This is not an exaggeration, she literally does not speak to me unless she's giving me an order or yelling at me for some perceived offense.
 - Now I know this seems exaggerated, but here's the thing; the rest of my dad's side of the family agreed to keep Jane a secret because of my stepmom. They all don't like her either. They've told me she's gone so far as to literally spread lies and rumors about me when we're at family gatherings. Apparently, she also likes to complain about her sex life... to my dad's mom... in detail. So much so, that my aunt had to step in and tell her off. Now my stepmom doesn't speak with my aunt either. 
2. The first and last time I brought a friend over to my dad's place ended in disaster. It was my childhood best friend that I'd known for over a decade, who had many sleepovers at my mom's place growing up with no issues. His dad had just passed away and he wanted to get out of the house, so I told him he could spend the night in our guest room. We were playing Xbox in my room when my dad said we were invite to go out to eat. At the restaurant, my stepmom started asking him questions that resulted in her insulting my friend's dead dad, my friend's long distance girlfriend, and called him a leech because he had no job (the reason he didn't have a job was because he was moving out of country, and spending months at a time with his girlfriend's family in that country - - no job would want that. He was also waiting to propose until he got his residency). So basically, my best friend not only hates my stepmom, but walked out of the restaurant and ubered home. When I tried to apologize on behalf of my stepmom, he basically said don't bother cause he would never go back to my place after that anyways.
3. On my cousins 21st birthday I took her out to get some drinks. She drove over to my dad's and I drove her out to the bar (I was DD). When we got back she was WAY too drunk to drive. So I sent a text to my dad that she was gonna stay in the guest room (it was passed midnight and he was asleep). The next morning my dad and stepmom were vacuuming and my cousin wanted to watch The Avengers. So we closed the door and started watching. At this point my stepmom starts demanding that we keep the door open so ""everything is proper"". Which, for those of you who don't know, is how people act if you and your girlfriend are in your room alone. She was implying I was going to fuck my cousin. So now my cousin also refuses to ever visit. Not to mention the awkward goodbye that day.
...now I can keep going with stories, but at this point I think you all get the picture. I'm two for two on people refusing to ever come back. 

So here's the TL;DR version of my problem:
Jane wants to meet my family, but I don't want my stepmom to fuck it up (which is pretty much a guarantee), but I can't include my dad without including her. I also don't want to hurt my dad by introducing Jane to everyone else except him. What should I do?",17Apr2019,1

And recently he told me that she wants him to take her virginity. I told him obviously not to and threatened to report him if he did (which I entirely stand by). And he got a little defensive until I referenced my backstory and how much I regret everything that happened to me. So he understood mostly after that, however I still get the feeling I did not deter him much. Especially when he said how he has already complied with some of her wishes and begun ""touching"" her. I understand how he thought she ""basically gave consent"" but I simply do not care. I cannot stand any high schooler that is commiting sexual acts with an 11yo.

643,"Like the post says, my gf got scammed online. She was selling her camera and got scammed. Unfortunately, she shipped the camera before receiving the payment. All the info I have is the guys phone number, and the address she shipped it to. Unfortunately, I looked up the address and it's currently not occupied, so all that tells us is the scammers general location.

I contacted him today pretending to be interested in buying the camera, hoping to get more evidence. He replied with a handful of photos he had taken, and was eager to sell it, but would only accept payment in the form of amazon gift cards (probably was going to scam me too). I pushed for a different form of payment and he claimed not to have a bank account or paypal address, and blocked my number when I pushed for any other form of payment.

At this point all I have is his phone number, general location, and plenty of texts showing him both 'buying' the camera and trying to sell it. He was supposed to paypal my gf money, but obviously never did, then blocked her phone number afterwards.

To me it seems like we are shit out of luck here. I've tried tracking down what website he's selling it on, but have had no luck. I'd love to report him to the police, but given the shortage of info it seems like they would be unlikely to help, especially since I'm literally across the country from this scamming p.o.s.

658,"Throwaway because some people know my main account.
I'm a high school kid, nearing the end of my sophomore year. I don't like to brag but I know that if I continue performing at the level I currently am, I'll be applying to some very competitive universities. Gifted, AP courses, good PSATs and all that, that's not the problem. The problem is I need to join a club or add some extracurriculars, and the problem with joining those is that I've got an extremely low processing speed, and I struggle with emotion regulation.
So the way this affects my life practically is that I need good sleep, to help with my emotion regulation, and I need extra time to do my classwork, homework, and to study.
So my schedule currently looks like this:

I get home from school at 3:00 pm. 

I eat, because I don't eat lunch during the day due to the medicine I take, and because I need to be on a full stomach to take my next dose of medicine. The medicine just helps me focus on work.

So I'll take my next dose of medicine at 4:00 pm. I'll wait 30 minutes to an hour to let it kick in, and then I'll start on my homework at 4:30 or 5:00

I'll finish my homework at anywhere from 8:00 to 9:30, and then I'll get ready for bed by 10, and then hang out until I fall asleep.

I need to fit in some extracurriculars into this schedule. 

The obvious thing that comes to mind is to just join something after school, in the 3 pm- 4pm window, just eating and taking my medicine while I'm at the club. I can't do that though because of some dumb rule the nurse's union put into place that says I can't self administer my medicine, and they won't administer it for me after school. This is the problem that came up when I tried to join our school's wrestling team. I would get home too late and be up too late doing homework, and then I would get bad sleep and everything would spiral downwards.

So I quit wrestling. I have hobbies, they're just not scheduled; I do them on my own time. If I don't have much homework, I'll go to the gym, work out and play basketball. When I need to be at home to take medicine, I spend my time from 3pm-4:30pm producing music, doing graphic design, and I'm currently teaching myself some 3d modeling.

My question is do you guys know of any super time-flexible extracurriculars, anything I can put on a college application, whether it's associated with the school, like a club, or something different. Something I can do when time allows it.

Or, do you guys know how i can turn these hobbies, which I like, am decently good at, and can do when I have time to, into something that I can put on a college app.

669,"Alright so here's the scoop.

Last week I bought a 2014 Jeep Patriot to replace my old ass 2000 Oldsmobile. Although the dealership told me everything was fine, I noticed a nasty noise coming from the rear which every one I've shown it to has told me to get it checked out. I made an appointment with the dealership and they had me bring it in today where they gave me a loaner so I could commute to work. (I work in the city over, which is a 50 mile drive.)

This is where things go wrong. I get into the truck for like 4 seconds and can't see out the rearview windshield's super dark (and I don't think legal) tint. Backed right into one a steel trailer they use to transport vehicles. Smashed one of the tail lights and scraped the tailgate a bit. Just kind of dipped. 

I'd normally have no issue paying for this, but right now is the worst possible time. I put almost all the money in bank account as a down payment on the car, I'm paying my mom more than what my paycheck will be this week since I owe her, and the loaner they gave was completely empty on gas so I had to fill that too. I also have no clue if they're going to be charging me for the service on my Jeep. I have probably just enough in my savings account, but tat will render me flat broke. 

I'm thinking of calling them tomorrow and telling them I noticed it when I got out of work and hoping they just think it was a hit and run. I'm just worried they'll notice the shards in the parking lot. I know it's scummy, but I really cannot afford to pay for this right now.

What's a good move here? Thanks in advance. :)",17Apr2019,1

There were also a couple sexist comments here and there.

I have enough experience to get another minimum wage job, I actually have a couple interviews coming up. I can allow  myself be a bit picky as I live wth my parents and have money saved up.

The manager left a voicemail asking me to call her back for the job offer. The way she said it makes me think she wants to hire me. If this is the case, how do I go about turning the offer down? I was thinking of telling her I another job offer but it's only been a day since the interview so I don't know how believable that would be.

I sit there shocked that we can watch the same exact video together and all I hear is some YouTuber with a clickbait title spreading fake news with racial undertones trying to sell MREs and other ""end of the world"" products and he hears ""the truth"".

I know pretty much all of our friends over the past few months have stoped talking to him. I really don't want to cut him off but idk if I can take much more of this.

672,"The short version is : my boyfriend's brother ruined a concert I was looking forward to, and showed no remorse for it.

Now for the long version:
Four years ago I found out that a singer that I've liked since I was little was going to do a concert in my city. I was ecstatic. My city is not usually included in major tours and I didn't have enough money to fly to another one for a concert. So when I found out, I actually did a little happy dance. The tickets were going on sale at 12pm the next day. At 12:00 and 30 seconds I already had them reserved.
I told my father how excited I was for the concert amd he asked me what the venue will be. When I told him, he said he knew the manager of it, and that he could call in a favor and get us some tickets. Free tickets? Of course I was interested, those weren't cheap. 

The day of the concert came, and my father calls me to say that guy actually brought one extra access bracelet (I originally asked for two, for me and my boyftien). So if I wanted to, I could get another friend to join. This was three hours before the access gates opened, so time was a bit tight to find someone. But it was a free ticket, so how difficult could it be?

I thought I will ask my boyfriend's brother to join us. The relationship was still pretty new, so I didn't have a chance to spend much time with his brother. Figured it was a pretty good opportunity. I asked my boyfriend to call him, and he accepted. Told him to be there before the access gates opened so we will be able to get good spots. Again, it was the concert I've looked forward to most. Ever. 

My boyfriend and I got there 2 hours before the gates opened. We were pretty far ahead in line.  Time passed, amd the brother didn't show up. The time for the gates to be opened came, and he still wasn't there. Thankfully, the gates opened 30 minutes late. However, he still wasn't there. We got in, figured we will get some good spots and then one of us will meet with the brother outside to give him his bracelet. 30 more minutes passed. Finally, the phone rang. He was outside. An hour late. 

My boyfriend left to give him his bracelet. 5 minutes later, I get a call. They wouldn't let him back in to the area in front of the stage. I went to see what was going on and when I got to the gates, I was forcibly pulled outside by a volunteer. Turns out there were other people who got what I found out to be volunteer bracelets and they stopped letting them in to the area in front of the stage. 

First, I tried bargaining. Maybe they will let us go back. They wouldn't. Security told us they were doing us a favor even by not kicking us out. Then, I got angry. Then, I got sad. We spent the first quarter of the concert trying to find a solution to get back in. We were only allowed to stay at the gates, in the far back. 
The next quarter of the concert I spent trying not to cry. 

This wouldn't have been that bad though. It was a missed concert because I tried to save some money. But what really angered me what the brother's reaction. Again, he got there an hour late and he was the reason why we had to go outside and we weren't let back in. His answer?

 ""Well, you should be thankful, you wouldn't have been able to find someone who wanted to go on such a short notice.""

He also never said thank you for the invite, or for the free ticket.

I was fuming. Even now, when I remember that night my blood boils. He never said sorry, or thank you, or anything along those lines. For half a year I avoided him at all cost, I was afraid I will start a fight with him. 
Now we are on talking terms, but I can't say we are exactly friends (not because of that night though, he just is a pretty difficult person).

After so long, I had hoped I would be able to let things go, but I can't. When I hear those singer's songs I remember that concert and my mood sours. 

How can I move on?",17Apr2019,1

675,"I’ve checked some other posts about this but it doesn’t directly relate to my situation so I am making my own.

As the titles says I have a fear of needles that seemingly progresses as I’ve gotten older. Growing up my mom would take me to the doctor and have to make up a lie about where we were going. I would always have to be held down by my multiple nurses just to get a vaccine! Screaming and crying, the whole shabang.

Anyway now that I’m in my 20s and live out in the world on my own I have avoided doctors for years now. I need to overcome this so that I can get some blood work done and get a checkup I’m long overdue for. I sometimes lie awake at night haunted by thoughts of getting blood drawn or getting an IV. It’s something that I constantly think about because I know it’s inevitable one day if I’m going to have kids....

When I even begin to think about myself getting blood drawn I feel light headed. I have developed anxiety in the past years so I know I would potentially have a panic attack and pass out in the even of getting blood drawn and that really freaks me out as well.

The problem is with the sticking of the needle, I have an extremely low pain tolerance. I took my roommate the the hospital last year and came seconds form fainting while she was getting blood drawn.

The thing is she told me she was on birth control, but she was supposed to have her period 3 days after but they didn't come. 


1 week after we had sex she took a test and it was positif she went to the hospital and he confirmed she was pregnant with a blood extraction and had a small visual on the vaginal ultra sound.

The thing is she also hooked up with another guy a month before. The exact dates are 5 July hooked up with him got her period 6 August hooked up with me 13 August positive test and small visual on ultra sound.

I immediately felt relief cause I found on the internet an ultra sound visual takes upto 4 weeks. But now the baby is born on the 7th of April and she told me he ressembles me.

I immediately ordered a DNA test.. We just did it. I'm still trying to tell my self I'm not the father that it's not possible..

But I'm not sure and can't help but wonder what to do if I am the father for a little context I'm 21 she is 19 and I'm studying for a master but I'm so locked up since there is doubt I can't do anything but think about it the stress is killing me and I feel like I lost a family member I never felt so stressed and bad.

I just can't marry her I can't be the father of her child I didn't ask for it, I didn't want it.
I want to marry my own wife of choice and make kids when I'm ready for it. I don't know if I should completely block her out of my life and basically abandon her if I'm the father or support her against my will.

But I truly think this will ruin my life and I can kiss my master goodbye and I will be very depressed.

He knows we are in a relationship. We don’t advertise it, but these things get passed on through a grapevine. For a while there my gf said he would be overly friendly to her. He would go out of his way to talk to her. She said one time he even “jokingly” said that she smells good and makes him want to roll around like a puppy. When she told me that I thought it was really weird. I let it go. She purposefully became less talkative around him because it kinda creeped her out. He’s made a couple comments in the last year that he’s been here that kinda put me down, but he said it in a sarcastic tone. I didn’t really give it any attention. He likes to joke around a lot and sometimes bully people without maybe realizing it. I used to be that way too. He’s extremely respectful other times and a good employee. Well my girlfriend stopped being as talkative and he stopped being as talkative. We figured all this was nothing. He became overly weird around her and talkative again this last week. She hurt her back and it hurts her to walk a little bit. Her doctor has told her to remain active because being sedintary could make it worse. We were sorting through some parts together today, my girlfriend included. I asked if she wanted to help out because we had a lot to sort through. He sarcastically made the comment thar “I would have my girlfriend wobble in here and sort parts. Got the whip on her.” I simply looked up and said “It is actually good for her to walk around and move with her injury.” I did not laugh at all. I was serious because I found it kind of disrespectful even if he was joking. She backed me up and said “yeah it is.” He kind of just muttered, “oh, really.” It was kind of awkward in there after that. I didn’t say anything cuz I didn’t wanna give it the time of day. He asked her a couple of stupid questions probably to ease the silence. What the hell is going on? He got fired at his last job because he made a comment to a customer.

690,"Hello all

TLDR at bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

I apologize if there are better places to post this. If anyone knows of more specific subreddits i would much appreciate any referrals, however I wanted to start by posting here because there are several subjects that my situation requires advice on.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, i am looking to attend a masters program in either architecture or fashion design. To keep this somewhat concise, i'll avoid explaining why I am interested in these fields. I graduated (debt free) from college in spring 2018 with a bachelors in liberal studies, and a GPA of 2.72 with a less than impressive transcript to boot. To be honest, I was very lost in college, dealt with pretty severe depression, and wasn't excited to do or study anything. I only graduated by kind of floating through a multitude of menial classes. 

&amp;#x200B;

After working odd jobs for the last year and doing a lot of reflecting, I finally feel as though I have lifted myself out of the depression and am ready to point my life in a new direction. I am interested in pursuing a masters degree in one of these two fields I have interest in (architecture/fashion design). Unfortunately, both fields require portfolios, which i do not have (despite taking art classes in college/high school- lost everything to a broken laptop and frequent moves). I am considering attending a community college to familiarize myself with programs and techniques used in one of these fields as well as create a portfolio, and then applying to a masters program. I am also considering trying to learn the important programs and techniques on my own, and then craft my portfolio from home.

&amp;#x200B;

Though I am debt free now, i only have about 1500 dollars to my name and am currently working as a substitute teacher not really making enough money to pay for school. I am also moving soon with my lovely girlfriend as she will be moving for her career (landscape architecture). Luckily i have a wonderful support system and will not have to worry about rent for the next few years. I also have quite a bit of high end bartending experience and am considering going back to that when my girlfriend and I move, as we are moving to a major city and bartending would be far more lucrative than my current position.

&amp;#x200B;

So I need advice on: what the benefits are for architecture/ fashion design as a career, what steps I should take to develop a portfolio/ what could be beneficial to include in my portfolio, what steps I can take to make up for my poor GPA and transcript,  what steps I can take to look in to an affordable loan/ an affordable university to attend a masters program, and what steps I can take to be more financially secure throughout this process. I am also curious as to whether it would be wise to obtain my associates in one of the fields and then apply to graduate school, or if that would be a waste of my time and money (as a result of being forced to take unnecessary classes).

&amp;#x200B;

I want to include that though I am not in a rush to make this happen for myself, I would hope to be able to finish a masters program before I am 30. If what I'm hoping for is unrealistic, please let me know that too. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks everyone!

692,"(Just a heads up om on mobile so sorry for formatting)

 So basically i have all A's and B's currently and i used to have a C or two, pretty average student. I'm bad a remembering things most the time so about 1 out of every 6 of my assignments is late, i even have adderal to help. My mother thinks i can always do better which sounds nice but she pushes it to far, she always sais, ""C's i can accept but i know you can always do better"", yet she yells at me every time i get a C. 

   I tried to tell her that it puts a lot of pressure on me, it makes me stressed, and that i am always trying my best bit she never listens. Earlier today she grounded me for having 2 late assignments which i got turned in the next day. Not a big deal to me but to my mother she sees that as me getting lazy and not trying. I didn't purposly forget to turn them in but she puts all this pressure on me to do my best, which to her means all A's, and to never forget any assignment. 

   She always says that i can open up about my feelings and tell her anything but if i tell her anything about how she raises me, treats me, or how i feel she always tries to explain why she is right and why am wrong, amd she wonders why i dont trust her. Im male amd ive always been told to keep to myself which is hard enouph but when my parents just get annoyed at me crying when i was younger and treated me like an encumbence. I know what i've said is off topic but  i just want to know how to tell her what i've been feeling amd how to construct my words. For example earlier today she invited me to watch tv with her, i kindly said no and that i wanted to lay down because i wasn't feeling good. She immediately got angry and accused me of always ""not feeling well"" when i get in trouble or grounded. I asked if it was a crime to not want to watch tv amd to lay down. She looked at me with eyes wide and a red face, and said she could have grounded me worse (she took my ps4 and Netflix away) but she was being nice, as i started walking she muttered something under her breath, what? i asked, ""you can go now"" she said in a angry stern voice. 

   She always talks about respect and how she deserves it, but i deserve it to but she always treats me like dirt and never lets me talk openly. I'm pretty quiet on school and i always think my voice is louder than it is when i speak, and she asks me why as if she's not the one who caused that. 

   Sorry for ranting but if you have any advice on how to tell her how i feel then it would be much appreciated.",17Apr2019,1
693,"I know that it is entirely illogical but I feel harshly judged for my physical appearance - despite KNOWING that I look perfectly average. 

It makes me feel really pathetic to admit this but I feel really self conscious of my appearance. My friends are mostly blonde haired, blue eyed, the generic European ideal. I always assumed I looked white European too but I’ve had many people ask me if I am Asian and recently a girl I know said to me ‘YOU LOOK REALLY JEWISH’ and everyone agreed (and I am) but it makes me nervous to think that people would be able to tell without me ever informing them because lots of people have been most horrible about it and it makes me nervous that everyone thinks this and just never says it aloud.

I remember, when I was younger, my school was filled with many horrible people who would say terrible things.

At around age 7, when we learnt about Christmas, a girl said to me that I killed Jesus and I was bad. I remember crying about it because I didn’t understand her. Looking back, she must have learnt something like that from her parents.

I always had people be horrid from a young age until I learnt to never tell anyone unless i had to.

 one thing I will never forget either is being sat in a lesson about the Holocaust and we were shown horrific images and told of the atrocities  and even after that a new boy to our class leaned over to me and said that Hitler was right and started going on a rant about Jewspiracies . Another kid repeated the same sentiment to everyone and when I challenged them on it nobody backed me up - not even the teacher.

All of my 5 years I saw swastika dream everywhere, heard jew used only as an insult and no one saw anything wrong with it. Even today I hear fully grown adults perpetuate stupid tropes and gross stereotypes or else use ‘anti - zionism’ as an excuse to not like Jews.

I also had a group of boys in the year above me find out by chance and they followed me home and threw stones at me (it cut my back and left a few scarrings) whilst shouting horrible things, but when I reported it to my school they said it was my fault.

I don’t consider myself very religious at all. I’m not ashamed but I worry for my safety when I see so many horrible people in the world and many others who do not believe these types of discrimination are problems. it makes me self conscious to think that people would be able to pick me out by my appearance- regardless of my secularity or not. 

I feel guilty for having these fears and I am not sure how to deal with it.  Has anyone else ever had this feeling ? I’m too embarrassed to even speak to anyone I know.",17Apr2019,1
694,"Lately it’s become more and more apparent to me that I look older than I am. I’ve always been told that people think I’m older because of how I “carry” myself and because I’ve had a large chest since I was young. However, since I’ve been in college it has only gotten worse. Because I’ve been under so much mental and physical stress since being in school (severe depression for 2+ years, breast cancer scare, family issues, toxic friendships, etc) I always look tired and drained....being ugly also doesn’t help.

696,"Long story short, I'm a college student and I'll be graduating a year from now. I was recently diagnosed with mononucleosis.

I have an in-person job interview with a local company coming up (meaning I passed the initial online interview) and I'm extremely optimistic about it. Interning here is a perfect fit for my field of interest and would be a great stepping stone into exactly the kind of work I want to do when I graduate.

Where do I go from here? I can't reschedule because I won't be back to normal for several weeks. I've been told that they'd respect me for calling them, letting them know I'm sick, and saying I'd love to do the interview despite my fatigue. I've also been told that they'd undoubtedly cancel the interview if I told them about it and I'd lose this opportunity.

I'm leaning towards not telling them, making no excuses, taking some caffeine and some pseudoephedrine before the interview, and just putting on my best performance. My doctor told me that I'd have to go out of my way to actually infect anyone else as long as I practice basic hygiene and I think this is the way to go.

What do you guys think? Is going in for the interview unethical? Do they have a right to know or, as long as there's no reasonable risk of transmission, is it none of their business?",17Apr2019,1
697,"I lost my last friend last month. I'm a male in my mid 20s and have never been too social. I used to get along easily with a lot of people (specially at uni) but I didn't consider them ""friends"", because I never could build such a relationship. In my free time, instead of going out or doing activities, I stayed at home studying math and watching youtube videos. I live with my dad, and I haven't had time to build any relationships at work, since there are not many people of my age.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought that making a tinder account to find people to be friends with would be a good idea. Surpisingly, I got a lot of matches (mostly guys), but it is really weird speaking to people in there. Also, when you get to know someone and they tell you that they don't have friends, it feels very strange.

698,"I have had a ganglion cyst on my left (dominant) wrist for the last 5 or so years. In the last year or so it became incredibly painful to the point where I spent it learning how to write with my other hand. I’m an avid journaler, birth doula, and musician. I depend on two working hands. 

So I had surgery to remove my cyst on March 14th, understanding that my cyst had a 5-10% chance of coming back in the next few years (as opposed to the almost-guarantee of it coming back quickly if I opted to have it aspirated instead of removed). The operation went well and my incision has healed beautifully. I don’t have my full range of motion back yet, but I know this takes time.  

A couple weeks ago I started noticing a familiar aching in my wrist that was nothing like the healing-pains that I’d been experiencing off and on. It was a little too reminiscent of the pain my cyst caused, and I could feel a lump developing directly underneath my incision. I called my ortho doc and they asked me to come in ASAP. I did, and they confirmed my suspicions that it has returned, 1 month and 1 day later...which is pretty much unheard of, but whatever. 

Now I have a $3,300+ bill (it was originally $6,000 which is fkn nuts but insurance did help me a bit there) for a surgery that didn’t work. I have two options: 1) have surgery again and be even more broke and in debt, but wear a brace for an ungodly amount of time this time around to minimize the risk of it coming back, or 2) have it regularly aspirated at $550-$650 each time and also wear a brace for pretty much forever. 

I can afford neither of these things. Does anyone have any recommendations on how to proceed? Is there any way at all I can get out of paying this? Do I have to get done playing music and give up being a doula or what? I appreciate any and all responses.",17Apr2019,1

Last night was an example of this, I had come home from my sports districts competition with had lasted around 11 hours, I had made plans to hang out with them but i didnt know how long districts were gonna last and they were upset with me for not trying to come back earlier (I had, but i lived an hour away from where it was hosted and uber was too expensive) and basically ruining any of the plans we couldve done. 
I said sorry, but it was out of my control because i took the bus and had no means of coming back.

He began argue with me which in turn began to escalate and them saying that i dont “care about them/put them first.”       This argument lasted for hours (4–5) and i ended up not being able to go to school because i didnt get sleep and i had an emotional breakdown.

They kept asking me throughout periods of the argument to have sex with me and for other sexual stuff (handjobs, making out) and i kept denying it, which he reacted into having a fit in which he would talk about how he was so depressed and him getting really mad in which he kept pushing down or him trying to fake commit suicide just because i wouldnt sleep w him(?? like ???really ??). I told him he wasnt obligated to my body and i dont owe him sex and that i dont like that stuff and he said “well i like it and it makes me feel close to you” and honestly i dont know whatto do he always expects something sexual of me and when i confront him he says “its not my fault im attracted to you” and it stresses me out and im not ready for anything like that and our relationship is straining because of the situation.

701,"How do you deal with feeling like you need to monitor/track and be vigilant about more and more...just stuff? 

Recently I called my bank to get a credit card sent to me. When you call you have to verify your address. I always say my full address and I learned after several calls that the address they had on file was wrong. So I’ve been waiting for this card and they have been saying “you have to wait the full 7-10 business before we send another” but it’s not going to me address. Which is mostly fine because they can fix the address but they haven’t been verifying my information. Anyone could have called and given an address that is kind of close and been talking about my account.

The supervisor told me “our security protocols work this was just a mistake.” Which if I think rationally I know is true but it bothers me a couple hours when stuff like this happens and I feel as if I should just be able to let this stuff go. Nothing crazy like losing temper or rage just a solid....ughhh for a couple hours at most. 

I feel like there are so many of these low grade/moderate annoyances in everyday like that I am overwhelmed some days. What makes it worse is that I know there are no consequences for the way companies treat us. Basically I know my life is my responsibility but I also feel like I’m responsible for so many little things that I am constantly on patrol or just a tiny bit worried something is going to come out of no where and bite me.

He keeps telling me about everything my cousins have accomplished because that’s all they ever talk about when he and his family get together. My dad always compares things I’ve done with what my cousins have done. It’s made my self-esteem hit rock bottom and I’ve been going to therapy to try and break out of this way of thinking. 

To give you an idea of how bad it is, my dad once suddenly stopped speaking to me for an entire week after we had dinner with his family. We didn’t get into any fights and we didn’t have any kind of disagreement beforehand that would’ve caused him to ignore me. During that dinner, however, all he and his family were talking about was how my cousin was studying to become a lawyer and how proud they were of her. At the time I was pursuing a degree in Illustration and I knew my dad wanted me to become a nurse or a doctor instead. It hurt me a lot.

Even now, I’m probably going to end up pursuing nursing even though I don’t want to. I’m only doing it because my dad said I should. But now it’s not enough for him. He’s been saying that I should become a doctor. I just can’t please him no matter what I do, and I also don’t want to live my entire life just to please him. It’s tearing me up inside.

710,"Hey all. The title says it all but I'll (41F) elaborate. My folks are older (76Mom and 80Dad) but still in very good health and are mobile. Neither of them part with things easily... my mom cuz she's sentimental and my dad cuz if, whatever it is, is ""in good condition you should keep it in case you may need it"". Because of this, their huge (5+ bdrm) house is FULL of stuff. Christmas decor, sets of encyclopedias, tools (omg the tools), pictures, furniture, camping equipment, clothing and textiles, cookware (omg the cookware), cabinets full of china and crystal all of which belonged to someone in the family at some point. Trust me, I could go on. Here's where I need to crowd source some advice from you lovely people....

They are both still driving, both still active, both functioning mentally, both healthy. How do I get them to consider downsizing when theres no problem with either of them? I just don't want one of them to take a fall or have a stroke or SOMETHING and then one of them is stuck making decisions about a house full of stuff alone. Does that make sense? Let's be honest, at their age something is going to happen and sooner than later. When it does, I don't want them to be overwhelmed with this while alone or partially incapacitated or grieving.

I have two younger siblings and we are all on great terms with each other and our parents. I want to step in and take, what I feel is the responsibility of the oldest of the family. I want to begin the process of preparing for the old age of my parents. I want to set them up for success when they need to transition into assisted care housing. I want to get ahead of the curve and start to clean and purge while they're both mobile and able to....

When I told my boss that the demand was getting too much to spend several hours for each account on, he told me not to change what I was doing and to keep it up. I stay till 6PM every single day and work through lunch. I don’t mind doing this as long as I am compensated or appreciated for it but I am not.

I have a child with chronic illnesses, back in December our Children’s Hospital recommended we change her care to a new doctor locally to us who had just recently graduated from their residency program.
No issue there. I’ll note here, this is a small town.
Except it’s really difficult to get a call back from her office, which I totally understand, people get busy and they have patients. 

Today was no exception, and my grandmother called me while I was in the process of getting in touch with her nutritionist since I was unable to get ahold of PCP’s nurse. I vented to her how I was a little frustrated and missed our old doctor. This is the end of my involvement in what occurred next, I had NO clue this was going to happen.

I guess my grandmother called her old doctor to see if she was willing to see my daughter again, and mentioned to them I was having difficulty getting ahold of the nurse for important things. They told her they’d ask and call her back.

Instead, old nurse called new nurse and told her I was talking about her behind her back. New nurse proceeded to call me and say “(old doctor’s) nurse called me, saying your grandmother had called to see if they would see (daughter) and that you had called us 6 times with no reply (I had, over the course of a week), I want you to know we all talk and I’d caution you against talking about me to other people.”

733,"I’ve known this guy my whole life (since elementary school). He really is one of my best friends and I expected to be his best man for a long time (if he ever ended up getting married). 

I’m having a hard time ever since he asked me though. He’s dated this girl for roughly 10 years and he has repeatedly cheated on her and not gotten caught. Multiple times I’ve tried to encourage him to stop and reminded him that if the tables were turned he would be absolutely devastated...and he would be. Nothing has really worked because for some reason he can’t resist. I truly believe it’s a confidence/ego boost for him. He doesn’t brag about it, he just can’t turn it down. He’s struggled with this since we were teens.

I’m having a hard time because I don’t really agree with him getting married while acting this way toward her.

734,"So this is my first apartment and I didn’t have help (because I don’t have family or anyone to help within the state) when apartment hunting and wasn’t sure what to look for.

I was quickly reassured it would be fixed by the time I was all moved in. Fast forward almost a month later- it’s nearing summer and we are breaking 80 degrees regularly and I live on the third floor. It’s HOT- still no a/c. Maintenance have been out only three times in almost a month and have been unable to fix it. I overheard one of them on YouTube trying to follow along. I work nights and have to choose between sleeping with my windows open during the day and being woken up by loud noises outside or closing them and waking up with a headache from the heat. I use coconut oil often and it’s now always in liquid form. I can’t even stand to cook because it adds to the heat! I had to tell a friend that her and her baby couldn’t come hang out at my place because I didn’t want it to be too hot for her baby to be comfortable.

736,"I'm having some issues with my housemate and his obsession with these stray cats that linger on our porch all the time. When we first discovered that two stray cats lingering around the outside of the house in the backyard it was cute and funny so we started leaving food out for them on a daily basis. It was the middle of winter at the time they started coming around so we tried to feed them and provide water as regularly as possible. About once or twice a day we would leave a small bowl out or cans etc. After a while that started being problematic as other wild animals were drawn to the bowls and I did not want a herd to form. So the rule was if we saw them we'd leave food out and take the bowl back inside before it got dark out. I am kind of a germaphobe and am aware of the various parasites and diseases stray cats can carry. I told housemate to be as clean as possible and wear gloves or at least some protection on hands when handling their bowls and bringing stuff back in the house. Housemate is not really a clean person and has a habit of not washing his hands and often has a cold. So, of course, I began to get worried when I noticed he has become obsessed with the stray cats and is outside every chance he gets looking for them and constantly refilling their bowl. He wakes up early in the morning to go outside and look for them/feed them and then go straight to the shared kitchen without washing hands and touch all the appliances and our food. The alarm on the house rings every time the door is opened so the constant chiming of the alarm as he goes in and out the door in the evening up to 20 times in just a few hours is very grating on my nerves. He runs home from work to repeat these actions and yes- you guessed it, goes right to the kitchen to prepare dinner afterward. He often forgets to wear something on his hands when picking up their bowl which pretty much is constantly on the ground outside where they defecate and urinate. The living room reeks of cat food because he keeps huge bags of dry cat food in their and doesn't tie them properly. He will also just leave bowls of half eaten cat food right on the floor where they attract bugs.

&amp;#x200B;

The cats have moved to mainly hang out in the front porch and I've noticed an odor, urine stains, and feces directly where we have to walk on the porch. Housemate walks in this and sometimes doesn't take off shoes, spreading the germs all over the floor. Housemate will even leave the door open for a long period of time to look at the cats, making heat escape the house and gas bills come frequently. I am getting frustrated and don't know how else to approach housemate about my concerns. He is a complete recluse and has no friends and does absolutely nothing social besides go to work and come back to look at the cats. When I try to bring up the various diseases they carry and the need to be as clean as possible he gets defensive and shuts me out- as if I am criticizing his children or something. It is very annoying to have to hear the alarm going off and the door opening and shutting early in the morning every day as well as in the evenings when i get home from school.

743,"TLDR: aspiring video editor debating whether or not to create an Instagram and Twitter account to help boost career.

Long version:
Hello! 
I've recently decided to pursue video editing as my career (and screenwriting down the line). I'm self learning now, as well as taking local classes. Most of my friends are telling me to post my videos/scripts online, once I get good enough at it, to not only get constructive criticism, but market myself. Thing is, I only have a Facebook account that I only use for games. It has pics and posts, but I'm not that into it. I don't have any other social media accounts (excluding Reddit? IDK if this counts). And to be honest, they don't really seem that appealing to me. I often read about people need to detox from Social Media and all the negatives of having people judge you and feeling inferior and depressed from being on Instagram and what not all the time. It doesn't sound like something I should invite into my life. 
That being said, I've also seen great success stories about people who were bold and put their art out there and were able to kickstart their careers because someone high up and important saw their work. Especially with video editing. I see tons of jobs posts for social media editing jobs, but you have to have a thriving social media life to show them that you're capable.
I'm wondering if my aversion to social networking is holding me back?
Would it be worth all the effort it seems to take be popular on these sites for the networking prospects?

Quick add: I'm in the middle of my weight loss journey. Lost 40lbs and things are going well. I'm also 24, female and have a pretty face (not bragging. I'm not hot or anything, but I get a lot of compliments). I mention all this because my friends suggest I use my looks as an angle to get more followers (post progress pics, take more selfies, try to look cute). I don't really see the point because
1. I HATE taking selfies. It's a long process of doing make up (which I have 0 skills), posing, finding someone to take some of the pics, taking 100 pics, narrowing down to 5 pics, and editing til my crippling insecurities are half satisfied with 1 pic. It's exhausting just thinking about it
2. It doesn't have anything to do with my videos/writing. I'm trying to sell my skills, not my face

But my friends have pointed out how the good looking popular people on Instagram get a wider audience for their artistic pursuits. 
Does that make it worth it? 
I understand at the end of the day, talent and hard work is most important. But I feel like I'm might be missing out on opportunities by not utilizing social networking. So many people are online, including prospective employers. 
Any constructive advice would be greatly appreciated.",17Apr2019,1
744,"I'm a mom of an almost 4 year old. And for 4 years, I've stayed home to take care of him. He's a bright, happy, truly wonderful little boy that I love more than anything. I feel guilty even saying this, but feel like I've lost myself in the process of shaping my son.

Someone asked me the other day what my favorite song was.

I couldn't answer.

I have no idea.

I haven't listened to music that wasn't: classical, aimed at kids, or disney, since my son was born. My old favorite bands, I'm not too interested in anymore. I used to be all about rap and hard rock. Now, I can't stand most of it.

So...I have no idea what sort of artists I like. Absolutely no clue where to even start. But I can tell you my top 10 favorite disney songs, and my favorite kid's artists.

I realized at that point that there was a problem. So I started asking myself what else I liked. What did I like to do?

Reading, running, and cooking used to be the answer.

Now it isn't. I go on runs all the time, but I always have our son with me. I like it, but it isn't an ""me"" activity anymore.

I read...kids books. I haven't read an adult book cover to cover in over a year.

I cook...with my son. And I like it a lot. We have fun. It makes my heart happy that he enjoys the process of making dinner. But again...not a me activity.

I starting thinking about what I love most, and the answers are all the same. I love taking him to gymnastics. I love taking him to the zoo. I love finding a good book that he loves and listening to him read. 

I can't think of a single thing I like that doesn't involve him. And I'm feeling so sad because of that. I feel like I lost who I was. I lost the person I used to be. I'm not really a person anymore, I'm just a mom.

I've talked, in passing, to my husband about getting a job. But I don't think it's realistic. My son is academically so far ahead of other children his age, that I'm not sure school is the best option for him. 

He turns 4 next month, and he reads beginner chapter books. (Things like Magic School Bus, Magic Tree House, Hey Jack, and Junie B. Jones.) He had mastered adding and subtracting, and is in the beginning stages of memorizing the multiplication table.

We spoke to all three local 4k's, and we were told they wouldn't really be able to work with us. One of them pushed us to put him in 4k anyway, despite the fact that he would be bored to tears with what they're learning. They reasoned that he needs the socialization. But he gets a lot of that in gymnastics, and our playgroup. (We go to playgroup 3x a week, and gymnastics 2x a week. We also do story time at the library, and go to parks. Socially he is well adjusted.)

We've reached out to 4 local elementary schools, and we were told something very similar. They don't move kids up to the higher grades, even if they test out of them. They can't put him in a different classroom. They can try to give him more challenging work, but they can't promise that it will be a regular occurance.

It seems like I would be doing him a disservice by placing him in school. (It's worth mentioning that we live in an area that is well known for not being overly enthusiastic about their schooling programs.) Our doctor actually raised the same concern. We recently changed doctors, and our son was reading through one of the kids books there. He was reading quickly, kind of whizzing through it, and our doctor just asked ""What do you intend to do for school?"" And went on to say that he was unimpressed with the local school systems, and struggled finding a fit for his daughter.

I'm feeling so lost.

I want to be a good mom. I want to make sure my kid gets every opportunity in life. I want to continue to make sure he becomes the best he can. But I've also lost sight of who I am...and it's scary.

I want a life. I want a career. I want to prove my worth as a human by bringing money in. I also want to make sure my son has every chance possible at success, and I'm afraid that will mean me staying home...at least for the next few years while we prepare to move.

I'm open to advice. Has anyone else ever felt they lost themselves in parenting?",17Apr2019,13
745,"This happened while we were dating, towards the beginning of our relationship.

For some background, my ex was/is extremely insecure about himself, specifically regarding his looks. He and my friend were very good friends themselves, best friends on Snapchat, talked all the time, etc. He and I also share the same friend group, so through most of the relationship I went to my friend for advice because I trusted her with everything.

One day he and I got into an argument, and I went to my friend and started tearing him apart first in terms of his actions, then in terms of his looks.

For the record, I do find him extremely attractive AND I did at the time as well, but out of rage I said things like “he’s an ugly fuck” among other statements that I regret. I still wonder why I said these things, as they’re completely untrue and I don’t believe any of them personally either.

My friend responded in a completely understanding manner. Everything went well and a few days later I apologized to her and told her I’d said it out of anger, not truth.

A week later, my ex and I were hanging out and he confessed that she’d screen shotted the entire conversation and sent it to him. It completely destroyed his self-esteem. He didn’t even break up with me over it.

The whole thing crushed me for three reasons:

1) She knew he has issues with his body image and struggled with accepting himself.

2) I trusted her with everything and anything.

3) I couldn’t in any way convince him that I do find him attractive and that what I’d said was stupid and out of anger, not truth.

This is the kind of shit that will be in his head for the rest of his life. We broke up a few months ago, this happened almost a year ago, and I STILL can’t get it out of my head. The guilt is eating away at me, to think such a kind and genuine person has to live with that hanging over them every single day. 

We are currently no contact, but I really want to reach out to him to let him know how untrue it is. Hopefully no longer being in a relationship would make him realize I’m speaking the truth, not just blurting out bs to keep the relationship alive. I really hope that talking to him would resolve some things for both of us, but I’m scared of making it worse or making him think it’s a move to get back together or something.

750,"Is this an age, or generational thing?

I am in between, but it seems if you send a text to someone in their 20's or younger (United States), they never respond.

If you check back (in person or via another text) to make sure they received the text, a variation of ""Yes, I got it.  Why are you bothering me about it, I'll respond when (whatever) is ready/Quit being needy"".

On the other side, those in their 40's+ tend to write mini-novels in return texts: ""I was dropping off the kids at day school when you texted, and... oh, did I mention that yesterday Tim said the weirdest thing!  He said...""

Those in their 30's respond (to me) properly.  They acknowledge the text, and if there is any pertinent info about the said text, they respond succinctly.

I can deal with the mini-novels of the 40+ group; at least I know they got the text.

It is the 20's or younger group that drives me insane.  I do not feel that it is ""needy"" to expect an acknowlegement of a text, *particularly* when relating to work (I work as a financial analyst, and in a 4* restaurant as a server).

A simple ""Ok"", or even just ""K"" would work.

So, my question is this: is this just a California thing (particularly the ""I got your text but didn't respond, why are you asking if I did"" thing)?  Just a USA thing?  Is it just me no longer being in my 20's?

760,"Hi everyone. I [M] have recently made some observations and realizations about life and try suppressing any feelings of hope for people/relationships/career goals. I recently also turned 18 and have had my ups and down with anxiety and alcohol abuse for the past year, and still have.

I feel constantly apathetic about anything and everything that happens. I used to feel such extreme angst and visited therapists but not much helped, now I just feel nothing. I have come to the point where it feels like I’m at the edge of a cliff. I don’t know how to explain it really. Like nothing matters or is “real” and that I am in no way important to anyone and have no significance whatsoever.

TL;DR
Feelings of no worth and like there is no point to anything. 

Question: Why do I feel like this? I don’t understand. What can I do to fix it?",17Apr2019,1
761,"I’m a 20 year old college kid and I have a pretty small (about a button sized) red non ichy rash on the top of my right thigh. I usually let something like this blow over but it’s been about a week and a half since I saw it. I told my mom about it and she said to wait longer but the more I research the more worried I get. She’s always been kinda like “just wait it out” when it comes to going to the doctor, I haven’t been to the doctor in a really long time (haven’t gotten sick either) but this seems like something to me. 

Just asking if it’s normal to go get this looked at or not. Thanks",17Apr2019,1
762,"So I (16F) have kinda liked this guy (15M) for a while but I kinda brushed it off for a while bc I knew he had a girlfriend. We’ve been friends for a couple of years but since the beginning of this school year we’ve gotten wayyyy closer. So for a couple of months I’ve kinda been denying that I like him (mainly bc he has a girlfriend), but today we hung out for the first time and it was amazing. We were laughing so much  and getting along so well and our cheeks hurt from how much we were smiling. I feel like I know him so much better and now like him so much more, but as a have mentioned...he has a girlfriend. 
Now I’ve been texting him a ton outside of school and he tends to come to me with his problems with his girlfriend, and there are a lot of them. They argue all the time over the simplest things and (I’m kinda-friends with his girlfriend too) his girlfriend has told me that she wouldn’t care if they broke up. There are a lot of other incidents but I’ll spare the details.
From what I have heard from the both of them, I kind of think they should break up. Do I just think that because I like him? I’ve heard from their other friends that they also think that so it’s not just me. Do I tell him that I think they should break up? What do I do cuz I’m so lost.",17Apr2019,1
763,"I’m a (17f) I moved away last summer and I stopped hanging out with my old friends because I moved pretty far. I’m also home schooled now, I’m in my senior year of high school. I do t have any new friends. So I kept in contact with my old ones. I stopped talking to two of them because they caused a lot of unnecessary problems within’ my life even though I’m not physically around them. They found ways to make me feel uncomfortable being their friend. I have one more and I think I just grew out of being friends with her. She’s (18f). We used to be close but eventually she started dating some kid, dropped out of high school and she’s been a bit strange ever since. She’s very loopy and not responsible at all. She’s not a very reliant friend. She invited me outside recently and I don’t want to necessarily hang out because I have a gut feeling something will happen. I just don’t want to continue this friendship but I hate confrontation. I don’t want to cause a big issue when it’s not even an issue at all. What should I do?",17Apr2019,1
764,"I  have been diagnosed with depression since age 7. I didn't know what cutting was when they found out,  I just did it.  I don't know why my brain is so fucked.  I want to die every second and I hate it.  Its something I have never been able to help.  I've been in and out of psych wards and they help for a day and that's it.  I've been on 12 different antidepressants. None work long term.  What do I do?  I just want this to stop.  The only way I can escape for real is killing me so I see no point.  I'm gonna die anyway I might as well get it over with.",17Apr2019,2
765,"i have liked this girl for a while now, and have texted her for a while. i felt like i was putting way more effort into it than she was, i started the conversation almost every time, and she didn’t really seem to care. later i found out she allegedly has said bad things about me but when i confronted her she denied it. a few weeks ago she took a couple days to respond to one of my texts and i thought if she doesn’t care then i’ll just stop texting her and it’s been a couple of weeks since she last texted me, i haven’t opened her message yet. but i kind of miss texting her.. i care a lot about her but she doesn’t seem to care, what should i do? should i text her?",17Apr2019,1

768,"I work in the medical field, just recently got a job with some of the nicest people. I've never worked with people this nice, they're very caring and friendly and just good people overall. They all mostly get along too which is very rare. When I interviewed for the job I asked what they were looking for and they said ""someone who gets along with everyone, even more so than someone who knows what they're doing."" On one hand I thought, what?! On the other I thought, well that's nice. I'm still kind of weirded out by it to be honest.


So the problem is I've never been a people person or a team player. I'm always nice and friendly, I just prefer to work on my own. I am most efficient when I work independently, other people slow me down and I don't think as well when I have to collaborate. This office values team efforts and respecting everyone's position, maybe even more so than getting things done. We do get things done, but it always has to be this certain way where several people are involved and are in the know about it. This drives me insane. And I just don't know how to do it the way they do. I know how to get shit done, they've been impressed by how fast and efficient I am. But I don't know how to ask for help and never have. These are a bunch of people who want to feel needed and helpful which is great but I don't need the help! How do I slow down and figure out where i can involve others and make them feel more valuable?",17Apr2019,1

771,"I broke up with my ex over mental health issues because I didn't want to drag him down with me if I did something. I'm officially stuck. We still talk sometimes since he wanted to remain friends incase I wanted him back, which I do, but now he doesn't want me. I've been in a couple relationships and I've never felt anything this strong before. I haven't really felt much emotions or anything for anyone in years due to my depression but it's different with him. I'd even go as far as saying he's the one.

I don't know what to do, it physically hurts when he shows less interest in me and it breaks me when he says things that are his way of telling me he's not interested anymore. It seems like he doesn't want us to even be friends anymore but he's too nice to say it.

I don't want to lose him, I love him too much.

772,"So I'm currently taking a programming class, and for our final project, I was originally going to create a demo of a clone of Pokemon Red, but my two other groups members found it too difficult, and wanted to do something else. One of them found working code for a hangman game, and as it is right now, it's 100% plagiarized. The only difference is one of the file names. One of them assured me that the final game would be different enough to not be plagiarized. He wants to add music and sound effects, change the way it looks, and add hints to it. But that doesn't sound like nearly enough for it to not be plagiarism. Like, if the code was 90% original, and 10% was copied from the internet, and modified a bit just because we wanted to do something we hadn't learned in class yet, that would be understandable. But going from 100% plagiarized as a starting point, and just making changes to another person's program just doesn't sit right with me. They seem set on going with this, and it's 2 vs 1, so I don't think I can change their minds. What should I do?",17Apr2019,1

777,"My little cousin might ruin my (or my brother’s) whole weekend.



First things first, I love my big bro. He practically raised me, and was always there for me while our parents were too busy with work. He taught me so many things, and shaped my personality and helped me become who I am today and I am so grateful to have such an amazing brother. 

He works at a place called pedal party which is basically a tour company for a bar on wheels that you can rent privately for parties, family, etc. and drink and listen to music while the guide drives you around the city. My brother (26) works as a guide. He’s a very charismatic, outgoing guy and gets tons of good reviews and is very well know to customers who request for him to be their host, so of course he’s one of the company favorites.

Well, his birthday is coming up, and he’s decided to schedule a pedal party for this Saturday night. We actually planned it together a month ago, when he was asking me if it were a good idea. Being the people person he is, he invites the whole family. He really wanted me to go too, since it’s his birthday and we’re close, but one of the rules is that all guests have to be 18 and older. I, however, am a 15 year old girl. I asked him about it and he said his boss would make an exception for me because I’m family, and because my brother is a favored tour guide.


Of course, my parents are going too. And my mom tells the WHOLE family about it, everyone we know. The bus can fit 17 people, and we were trying fill in all the seats. My brother somehow forgot to tell my mother that I was going too, so she just assumed I would stay home that night. 

So you know what she does? 

She goes onto invite two of my aunts, each with children years younger than me, and tells them that I can babysit the kids while they go to the pedal party.

I told her that I was actually going on the pedal party and that I was the first person my brother invited, and she tells me that it’s too late to uninvite them, and that I would have to stay home.

Thank god one of the aunts said she couldn’t make it because of her work, but the other aunt (the more favorable one in my family) was glad to accept the invitation, leaving me damned to staying home with my younger cousin.

Told my brother, and he looked very disappointed. I could tell he really wanted me to go. 

So I was over here thinking either my aunt goes to my brothers pedal party and leaves me stuck at home with my little cousin, or she doesn’t come at all and I get to go to the pedal party. 

But surprise, she already bought plane tickets. 

I am so frustrated and bummed out that I can’t even go to MY OWN BROTHERS PARTY because of some kid. 

Like, fuck, man. We both picked out the music and everything. 

Im trying to think of a way that I can still attend the pedal party. This is my brother’s big night, and I wouldn’t want to miss it. This whole situation pisses me off so much, and it’s had my stomach in knots all day.

Any advice?",17Apr2019,1
778,"I've gotten slightly better but i always keep my hands to myself. I'm okay with hugging but i find it so hard to reach out, I'm terrified of being rejected. I've started to hang out with a guy that I think is really cute but i can only really reach out to touch his hair something, I'm so scared of possibly misreading the situation, even if I get the feeling he feels the same possibly.
