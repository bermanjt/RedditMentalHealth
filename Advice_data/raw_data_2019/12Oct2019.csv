0,"I want to be close to people, but once I start getting closer to them in a relationship sense, I always get this weird uneasy feeling in my stomach and want to push them away. Every time I start dating someone, I end up breaking up with them in like a month because I can't handle it. I think part of it is that I hate people seeing me when I'm emotionally vulnerable, but I don't know how to deal with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to just power through and remind myself that it isn't how I actually feel, but it's always still there. How can I work through this? (I have a therapy appointment scheduled, but I would also like to try to make progress earlier than that).",12Oct2019,3
1,"Hello guys first of all this is a throwaway account for obvious reasons now let me explain what's going on in my life. 

I'm a teenager soon about to go into the real world, I was born in a country where you can likely have a great future and be successful, but when I was little my parents had to move back to the country they were from (3rd world country), so I moved back with them, said country wasn't  as great, I grew up there had a happy childhood. There was times like once a year where I would go to the country I was from and everything was different in a good way, I loved the place, the people, the big buildings, everything.... 
My parents couldn't go back to this country anymore because they didn't have the proper documents, so I would go with my grandmother. one day when I was a little bit older my grandmother had a talk with my mom basically she told her that it was going to be better if she would've let me go with her to live there so I could have a better future.
Now let's talk a bit about my grandmother, she isn't your typical grandma, that one that always hugs you, makes you cookies, gives you a lot of love, etc. She is just cold and she's been like that since she was young, but I really didn't care, after convincing my mother one day she finally said yes, we had a big talk about it and the day finally came, I was going to have a great education, I was going to have things that my parents couldn't afford, everything was going to be beautiful I thought... 
This wasn't the first time staying at my grandma's house so I knew how things worked, first months were hard because she would constantly yell at me for not washing the dishes, cleaning my room, etc... But then I got used to it so that wasn't a problem anymore.
But the years passed and things started to change , I became socially awkward, I started to become a loner, I was always sad, mad, and had (still do) suicidal thoughts.
Now here is where I need the advice, I'm about to graduate, but I don't know what to do with my life, a part of me wants to go back with my parents and live with them but I know I'm gonna be miserable and sad, and if you wonder why sad is because the very fact that I don't like that place, I know I won't be no one in there, but at the same time I know that if I stay here I'm just gonna get more messed up but I'll probably be successful if I try hard enough, I have everything here yet it feels like I have nothing, sometimes I just pray God and I tell him if it wouldn't be better for everyone to just take me with him, that's how bad it gets, please if I forgot to add something else (a key part) let me know and I'll add it, I need help asap before making a big decision for my life.",12Oct2019,1

3,"I'm a sophomore in high school and I've been doing terrible in school since I was 11. My family is poor but my mom used money from my grandfather's trust fund to send me to boarding school. My mom is bad at managing money so she took the opportunity to move somewhere she can't afford. She constantly moves money through my bank account and I have no idea why, it's sketchy and stresses the hell out of me. At any moment she could run out of money (she already has) and I'd have nothing. Because she has so little money, I have no way of getting the things I need at this school. I only have three shirts, I've run out of rubber bands for my braces, and I have to stick my toothbrush and toothpaste in a dresser drawer because I don't even have a dob kit. I'm still doing terribly in school, my history essay has been overdue for three days and I don't understand Spanish at all, and I'm missing homework in every class. I feel like there's no way for me to catch up, and this year just feels like a repeat of the last even though every single day for the past two years I've told myself ""Today's going to be the day I get my life together."" I still don't have any friends because the only hobby I have is running cross country and I'm so busy procrastinating doing homework in my dorm room that I never end up going out and doing anything to make friends. It feels like there's no way out. I know there are people who have it a lot worse than me, but that doesn't negate the fact that my life is terrible and that, if I had just done well in school and done everything I needed to do to make a nice life for myself from the start, I wouldn't be in this situation.

I just recently went to visit and stay my bf who really eat nothing else but fried chicken, pizza(only pepperoni and cheese), fries, occasionally fruit shakes. Enough said, I have had more pizza in this 5 months than I have in my entire lifetime.

Few weeks ago, I had pizza as a hangover food and I was really struggling to swallow it down at that time. 

We just had pizza today and ugh every bite of it just reminded me of how sick I felt during that hangover or am I just tired of pizza?

7,"Ok, this is a very long and complicated story, but please read.

My sister and i are very close, we are twins and she is literally my best friend.

When my sister was 16, she got pregnant, and my parents forced her into a shotgun wedding.  The marriage went terribly and they didn't get along.  As a result, they got an annulment/divorce, which cause a lot of members from our church to look down on my family (I didn't care about this at all, but since my family is super devout and catholic, this cause tension between my sister and parents).

Within the next 2 years, my sister then meets another guy and starts a FWB relationship with him.  Later, she meets another guy who has a lot more money and better social standing and ends up getting engaged to the second guy.  However, she didn't break up with the fwb guy until after she got engaged to the second husband. The two got married ASAP.  Lo and behold, she gets pregnant immediately on her honeymoon and has a baby boy (my second nephew.)

The baby looks EXACTLY like FWB guy.  I can't stress it enough.  FWB guy and second husband look similiar enough that it has been over looked, and no one else in the family knows about FWB guy other than me. I confronted her about it when the baby was born, but she begged me to not say anything so I didn't.  

However, second husband and my sister are now getting divorced.  He is fighting for custody for ""his"" son.  I don't know what to do.  My family has stopped talking to my sister.  She has been completely ostracized.  I am the only friend she has.  If her soon to be ex husband finds out she'll know it was me who told him since i am the only one who knows anything.  If I don't, then I am complicit in this mess.  The soon the be ex husband is a nice guy, but I can't turn my back on my sister.

20,"(Warning: This will deal with child sexual abuse)

Hi everyone.

So from the title and the warning im sure you guys are able to guess what this post will be about. Im going  to be as straight forward and short as possible so let's dive in.

I was molested when I was 6 years old.  He was about 11 or 12 and he was my big brothers best friend at the time. He told me i would get in trouble if i told. It went on for a while until i threatened to tell my parents consequences be dammed I wanted it to stop. And so it stopped but I never told my parents. Life went on we moved to a different part of town a year later my parents stayed in contact with his parents but i never saw him again so i pushed it all down and I repressed those memories  until the year I started high school. 

We were clothes shopping for my first year in high school and I turned a corner and there he was with a nametag on i froze in place as all the memories flooded back. He talked and caught up with my dad while I made some excuse and went to the dressing room to silently cry.

The next few years were filled with lots of depression, self-harm and therapy but my parents never knew what caused it. I still never told them. 

Fast forward to a few months ago and due to stress because of some intense family stuff I broke down and told my dad everything. He was devastated. 

About my dad. He is a very big guy. He grew up in a bad neighborhood and grew up with lots of gang violence around. He was into some really bad stuff when he was younger but got out of that life when me and my siblings were born. He now owns a business and has worked very hard to get himself where he is. Also,He use to be a private security for celebrities and was a minor boxer for a while. So he is use to dealing with problems with his fists or by other means.

Anyways, after telling him he confided in my grandmother and my stepmom (which I was fine with) who both revealed that they were hurt in a similar ways as a children.

My dad has just been having a rough time dealing with all of this and even eluded that he feels at fault. My grandma and stepmoms attackers are dead and gone but mine is still out there. I've tried to tell him that the years of therapy has put me in a good place. I dont want revenge or retribution. 

Im affraid that he will try to get in contact with his old friends from when he was growing up and do something bad. He said he is trying to not to be the person he left behind all those years ago but he is stuggleing. 

How do I get him to come to terms with what happened to  me, know its not his fault, and get him to recognize that I am okay and have moved on from that pain and get him to do so as well?",12Oct2019,1

I apologize if this is the wrong place to post this and for putting this on the shoulders of my fellow redditors, but it's a weight I am having trouble carrying on my own. 

Having been abondoned by my family, I had learned to fight for scraps. I grew alone and I had no regard for friendships as I felt i had to keep fighting. Mental health became a factor. Diagnosed with depression. Anxiety. Manic episodes. Panic attacks. I didn't know how to make friends. But I still fought. The reason I bring this up is to illustrate my lack of connections.

But I did ok. Real good by normal standards.

To save any more detail however, somewhat recently, I had been laid off. Then I lost my place of residence. I have been applying rapidly. No callbacks. I know someone can get back to me eventually. But I am at a state of hopelessness.

I am currently in a shelter. As you would imagine, the staff here are more abusive than they are helpful. There are no resources here. It's pathetic.

I fell. Hard. 

Mental health has been fucked as well.

25,"I’m going to attempt to make this short. 

In general, I’m not a very big religious individual. I do celebrate the classic American holidays; such as Thanksgiving and Christmas, but that’s mainly due to tradition over anything else. I never have- and never will- dis on anybody for their beliefs. I’m still enrolled in a school, and the majority of students around me are Christian. Having been reared in a predominantly Christian household, I know their holidays well.

And I love to give them gifts! 

So, with Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years rolling around it’s prime time to celebrate with the people I care about! One of them; however, is Jewish. 

I adore them just as I do any friends. I’m perfectly aware they can only have Kosher products, and I aim to get them some every time I treat the rest of my companions. I just don’t know very much about Jewish holidays. I’ve researched it a bit, but there’s no set “yes you can celebrate with them”, or “only family can”. There’s also no set “what to get” and “what not to get”. 

So, Redditors, I do ask for your aid:

In the upcoming Jewish holidays, of which can I celebrate with them?
How?
Is there any set gifts I can and can’t give for each day of Hanukkah?
If so, then what? 
And any extra knowledge you can offer ;)!

There aren’t many Jewish people in our school, and I really want to make sure they’re included. We aren’t extremely close, but I do consider them a friend and I want to be sure they feel loved this holiday season!

another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‘excuse me....excuse me’ and then asked me ‘how do you get a job in here’ and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‘yea we don’t know her that well’ and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ then the brunette said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know...’ and then I juts nodded and she stared at me and quickly grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you’ quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away.

37,"So, for context:

Mr. Q is my ex-band director. He is a horrible person who has sent kids to the hospital, has touched the kids in his care, has caused many children permanent trauma due to his practices, abuses his authority, makes female students uncomfortable by invading their personal space, and he lies about it all.

Mr. K is our principal. He has shown time and time again that he will do anything to uphold the schools reputation.

Many students have reported Mr. Q to Mr. K in the past, but for some reason, Mr. K does nothing. One student actually wrote a very lengthy email detailing every single reported case of Mr. Q mistreating children, along with multiple witness testimonies. Usually if a student makes a claim as serious as sexual assault, the teacher is to be put on paid leave until a investigation is done, however, Mr. K didn’t do that. Instead, he not only defended Mr. Q and his actions, but he also claimed that the students reporting Mr. Q were lying. Saying things like “He’s a good man”.

When he said that, I thought he might have been talking about some poetry I had written and someone higher up got a hold of it and saw it as a threat.

However, when he showed me the email, I realized very quickly that I didn’t write it. It wasn’t even something I said taken out of context, someone literally just wrote it, said it was me, and gave it to the principal. 

As far as what it said, to sum it up, it talked about me being depressed about a girl. It thanked my friends for being good to me, and it ended with “Don’t come to school Friday”

So, With no proof that I even wrote this vague threat, they arrested me. I spent the night in the juvenile correctional facility, then in the morning, the judge sentenced me to be put in an adolescent psych ward for evaluation and treatment. I ended up spending eight days in there and was sentenced to six months of probation for a threat they had no proof I made.

I wasn’t even charged with anything really, a petition was never filed.

Now after getting out, I’m starting to wonder who might have framed me. I don’t have any enemies, and I only have a few friends because I have trust issues and problems with opening up to people. I honestly have no clue who it might have been.

Then, someone pointed out to me that it might have been either Mr. K or Mr. Q. I was the one who had all the records of Mr. Q’s actions, and since Mr. K is defending Mr. Q, he obviously ignored my reporting to him.

And since Mr. K didn’t take the proper procedures with these claims on Mr. Q, he may very well lose his job if higher ups find out. 

So what does he do to save his job and his reputation? He framed me for a terroristic threat, gets me locked up, and gets me expelled from school and required to stay 100 feet away from any school property.

I’m not to sure about this conspiracy theory, but I’d like to hear what you think.",12Oct2019,6
38," My friend S is one of the sweetest girl ever. She runs charities and help LGBTQ homeless youth into shelters. One thing is, she's in emotionally abusive relationship with her on and off boyfriend. No one likes her boyfriend and I mean no body likes him. He will ignore her for days and never text her. He does pretty nothing in the relationship.  One thing about S is she wants to see good in everyone even there isn't any good.

 One day I just had enough of her crying over him and I texted him a very long message on how he is so toxic to her and she deserves better and mostly how he should leave before he breaks her even more. I want her to be in a better relationship who will treat her so much better than him.",12Oct2019,2

40,"Basically the title.
My problem is as follows:

Two years ago now, I got out of a toxic relationship with a homophobic dude, and I really started figuring out my sexuality. I’ve always known I wasn’t just straight.
Well, so far I would say I identify as bi/pan.
That’s all nice and good, just now I have run into a problem.
The old relationship was long distance and we never actually ended up meeting up.
I now am in another (heterosexual) relationship, and I just find myself not enjoying sexual acts.
I enjoy the thought of having sex with a dude, but actually doing anything remotely sourcy is basically impossible for me.
I don’t get into it like I do when I just imagine it. I’m stuck on the physical stuff.
Now, I’ve explored the thought of “So maybe I’m only into girls, but Imi have the strong feeling it would be the exact same.
So now I’ve found myself in the Situation where in theory I’m attracted to everyone (like, all genders) but in real life I’m attracted to no one.

This might be based in my last relationship being sexually manipulative/abusive at a time where I was in my early teens and had no experience even masturbating before.

I just want to be sexually attracted to my boyfriend. I want to feel the same things with him in real life as I do imagining doing these things.
Does anyone have any advice?",12Oct2019,0

44,"Whenever my friends have something going on in their lives, they often come to me to talk about it. I'm not complaining about this, I think that my friends should always be able to trust me with talking about things they're going through. It's just that they never seem to take into consideration that I have a lot of problems myself. It's kind of like they see me as never struggling with anything and always having a perfect life. They will often talk to me about things that are very serious, like abusive parents or self-harming, and then ask me not to tell anyone. Of course, I don't, but I just feel like I'm carrying all these secrets around all the time. I just constantly feel guilty thinking about all the stuff that my friends are going through because I feel like I should tell someone to help them. I know that it probably sounds stupid, but it's just like a constant moral dilemma of whether or not I should say anything. In some cases, I'm afraid that if I tried to help them by telling someone, it would backfire and they would hate me. I just don't know what to do anymore, and I lose sleep thinking about this stuff. I often have anxiety attacks and a lot of stress because of everything that I know is going on. It probably sounds selfish, because they're going through something, and they actually trust me enough to tell me, but I just can't handle everything. I feel like it's my fault because I'm too afraid to say something. I just don't know anymore. Any advice from any source would be welcome at this point.",12Oct2019,1
45,"I don't know how to help my brother anymore. The last 3 years he has been struggling with a Heroin addiction (uses meth too). He was spending around $500+ a week on drugs. He hid it pretty well for a while until he started losing a significant amount of weight, getting pick marks, and disappearing for multiple days with no contact. He always downplays his addiction, saying he can stop on his own he just needs our support. We have tried that method with him various times now to no avail. 

After stealing over $500 from my parents earlier this month and getting fired from his job we had finally talked him into checking into a rehab. He entered the rehab and completed a 4 day detox. Then today, against nurse and counselor recommendation, he checked himself out.

The counselor warned us that we needed to set boundaries with him, including not picking him up from rehab, or giving him a place to stay if he left before completing treatment. My parents told the counselor that none of us would be picking him, which she relayed to my brother. He told the counselor he was going to buy a cab and get a bus ticket to take him back to our hometown. 

His significant other has not been able to set the boundaries recommended by the counselor. She has always given him a place to stay and offered to pick him up from rehab if it got too hard. He has been living off her for a couple months. 

I don't know what my family or I can do to support him. He no longer responds to my messages or calls anymore. My parents have tried to let him live with them, but they eventually kicked him out because he was using in their home while my parents took care of his daughter, not to mention he has now stolen money from them. 

How can he have a chance if he doesn't have a place to stay after leaving from detox? What are the chances he gets better on his own after detox without treatment? What can my family and I do? Any tips or suggestions welcome.",12Oct2019,1

48,"This is a very difficult subject for me. I adopted a shepherd mix over a year and a half ago. I am 18 years old and suffer from severe depression and anxiety. My family thought that it would do me good to have a dog for emotional support. It would also get me out of the house more and hopefully help in recovery. She is the best thing that has happened to me in a long time. My nightmares have gone away, I feel more confident, and she soothes me when I have extreme anxiety. Our dog-owner relationship definitely started out in a honeymoon period. She was the perfect dog (still is), and I felt like the perfect owner. We would go on long walks everyday. I'd never miss feeding her a meal. We would play for what felt like hours. We were inseperable. 

Then our two hour walks turned into half hour walks. I started going to school again. She got less attention, but was still loved more than anything in the world. Our bond was made of steel. It has been that way ever since that first week. This was how it was for over a year. 

Then things changed. 

First is her exercise. 

Over the summer, I got really into hiking. I would hike at least twice a week. At first, she came with. She is pseudo-off-leash trained (first red flag, I never formally trained her to go off leash yet I still allow her to roam free on hikes) she never left my sight. She was good at recall, and this way she wouldn't need extra strain on her neck with a halter for hours on end. She has a very high prey drive. That is the only thing that has prevented her from performing recalls. If there is a squirrel that crosses our path, she is a different dog. This is the biggest red flag. After she dove into uncountable bushes, sometimes off steep ridges, I still didn't leash her up. I care immensely for the environment and would never want to harm the ecosystem in anyway. Yet I still wouldn't leash her. The terror those poor squirrels experienced.... I tried to train her to pay attention to me when there was a squirrel involved, but I wasn't deligent enough and she never caught on. Thank the gods she never got one. 

I thought that all this extra exercise was the best thing for her. She got very lean and her overall demeanor was calmer. Yet every time I'd let her off-leash, I risked her life. 

The last hike I took her on, she almost died. It was 80°+ and there were parts of the trail in full sun. I stopped semi-frequently to give her water, but towards the end I could tell she was struggling. The difficulty of the hike was more than she was used to, and some parts were so steep I had to boost her up. I remember one point she got so exhausted that she layed down and panted profusely. I poured water over her head and body. We took a break until she stood back up again. 

This is animal abuse, I'm not going to sugar coat it. I knew I should've turned back, yet I didn't. There was a lake at the end of the trail, and I knew that would help the both of us emensely. I also knew that if I turned back, I would have to admit to myself that I did something horribly wrong. Yet it was even worse that I kept on going.

We made it to the lake. Both of us enjoyed long swims. We stayed in the water as long as possible. I took the longest break I could before heading back, knowing that we would need the renewed energy for the return trip. 

Coming down was worse. My dog had been able to scramble up the steep areas with ease, but she struggled going down. If she had fallen or lost her balance... 

This is animal cruelty. 

Thankfully I had enough brains to not take her on another hike the rest of the summer. But that meant that she suffered perhaps even more. I was hiking so often that on my days off, I was useless. I would stay in bed all day or watch television all day. My body would be in so much pain, I could barely stand up to take showers. Walking the dog felt out of the question. She went weeks between exercise. Weeks. 

This is animal cruelty. 

But in my defense, she is not a hyper dog indoors. She knows how to control her energy. Yet when she gets the chance to sprint in large fields, you can tell just how much energy is pent up. She can go for hours and not stop. 

I will also say that there wasn't any change of behavior during this period. She wasn't chewing up couches or running sprints around the house or chewing off her legs. She seemed just as happy as she always was. 

But she still suffered.

Once the hiking season came to an end, (a month ago), there were no more excuses for not walking her. Yet I didn't go back to our nightly walks.

Now let's talk about her feeding. 

She's a picky eater. When I adopted her from the shelter, she was skin and bones. It took about three months to finally find the food she'd eat. Since then, the FDA released the name of dog food brands that are linked to dog heart disease and her's was on the list. So we had to go through the process of finding her a different food brand. But we found one that worked for her. 

I say we, because I'm not the one who pays for the food. I'll touch on finances a bit later. 

I'm very forgetful. Mindless, really. I've tried setting reminders on my phone, or writing them down on my hands, or putting up sticky notes everywhere. I always still manage to forget. This is most likely due to the meds I'm on. I forget to feed my dog on a regularly basis. I'd guess she goes without a meal at least twice a week, if I'm being generous. Granted, I have improved quite a lot but I still feel like it's worth mentioning. She cannot stand to lose any pounds, as it took so long to build up the weight she has now. 

This is animal cruelty. 

Now about the finances. 

I live with my parents, as most 17-18 year olds do. The deal I made with my mom was I had to get a job if I were to get a dog. This way I could pay for her food and vet bills. I got a babysitting gig. It didn't pay much, but enough. Then the family I worked for moved away. Since then, my mother has had to pay for the food. My dog is 60+ lbs. That's a lot of food. As for the vet bills, there are none. 

Why, you must ask? Because she hasn't been to the vet. She is a 5-year-old adult dog. This means a visit to the vet once a year. She went straight to the vet the first week I got her. She got up-to-date on all her vaccines and a clean bill of health. Three months ago the vet sent me a reminder that it's been a year and I need to make an appointment. This means bills I cannot pay for. It also means that I would need to talk on the phone. No big deal, right? This is where my severe anxiety comes into play. Phones are a no-go for me. Last time I had to talk on the phone, it ended in me hanging up abruptly and uncontrollable sobbing for the next hour. 

This, my friends, is animal abuse. 

And now I'm attending community college. I am still enrolled in high school, but I'm in a program that grants free college education to eligible students. This past month has been grueling. I've relapsed badly with my depression. I've lost all the progress I made with my mental health. I can barely take care of myself let alone another living organism. My mother has been helping out, but my dog is fucking suffering. I surprisingly managed to walk her one day last week, and it felt amazing to be able to do that for her. I made myself promise to walk her at least every other day since then. But I haven't. At all. 

Today she got out. She ran across the street, into neighbor's yard. The neighbor yelled at me. This wasn't the first time she's gotten out. But the neighbor finally gathered up the guts to say something. This has acted as a wake up call for me. I need to get my shit together. 

So here I am. Explaining what a shitty human I am. Knowing myself, this will happen again. Mistakes will be made over and over and over again. I have planned to take her with me when I go to a four year university as an ESA. I wouldn't go to college if that wasn't a possibility. Yet that fucking terrifies me. Her quality of life is already so diminished. To be cooped up in a dorm room half the day? What the fuck am I thinking. 

Then I realized something. I need her. Yet she doesn't need me. Would it be better if I do the impossible? I'm not sure I would live long after surrendering her. Yet is it extremely selfish of me to keep her in my possession?

I need advice. Granted, this has been very one-sided. There have been good days. I have been a good owner in the past. But the bad days overshadow the good. And in the end, some mistakes just can't be overlooked.",12Oct2019,0

68,"Back story: I (f17) have had the same job for the last 2 years (since I was 15). I started out my job wearing tame make up. But over the last year or so I have really found my style, which is a little extreme/different for my small town. Ever since I have found my style I have gotten a lot of rude/sexual/akward comments. 

Story: I often have customers I see once or twice a week. So when a new regular (let's call him mark) started showing up I didn't think much of it. He was a very quiet 60ish year old man. He seemed a bit shy. But as I developed my style he started to comment on my makeup, things like ” that color looks nice on you” or ”how did you get that color”. But a few months ago he said ”does that lipstick smudge when you kiss people?” I was wearing black lipstick, but I was so taken aback that I didnt know what to say. I kind of laughed it off and said no. I decided not to read to much into it. Since then he has made a comment almost every time I have seen him. I always ignored it until today. He walked into the lane next to mine. I politely greeted him as he made small talk with the cashier. He then said to her ”she likes when I tell her (me) how attractive she is”. This stunned me. It is very clear I am not 18 and that he shouldn't be making those kinds of comments. He then asked about my makeup like nothing happened. Right before he left he asked what I liked about his outfit. I tried to avoid the question by telling him I liked the color of his shirt. He walked away like nothing happened with a smile on his face.

71,"We miss our son.  He started calling less and less when he got serious with someone.  She insisted they spend all holidays with her family in the town they live in.  We live in a different state.  Basically, she has taken over his life and dictates everything.  Controls his social media, schedule, etc.  The two times in the last two years they came to see us for a few days, she spent every single minute with us.  We could not get a minute alone with him.  I am not exaggerating.  We needed to talk about some family business with him, but she would not let us talk alone to him.  Don’t get me wrong, he is also to blame for letting this happen.  Now they are not returning any calls, texts, messages, etc.  and she blocked us from both their social media accounts.  I know it was her because they both told us last year that she has his password and does all his posts.  We have tried to be friendly, but this is just not healthy.  We don’t know what to do.  Has anyone else had this experience?  I would love to hear from both sides how you repaired the relationship (we basically don’t have one with our son right now) because we don’t want to lose our son forever.

74,"So the past 10 months me and my best friend of 13 years became really distant. The cause of this was mainly due to his girlfriend, they have been dating a little over a year. We started to hang out less and less  and in that 10 months we only hung out twice 1 on 1. The other times we hung out about once every two weeks and only with her there. But thats not what really made me want to just end our friendship. The real reason is that every time he said we were going to hang out he would bail and not ever tell me ""let's hang out today at 4"" then I would ask him if we were still on and he would push it to later on then just not let me know he couldn't make it then either. This happened many times(we also haven't hung out in 2 months now). Anyways with all this mind what should I do. Cut him out of my life without messaging him? Message him and tell him I don't want to be friends? Leave it not take any action?",12Oct2019,1
75,"So I currently have a small circle of 3 friends. Or at least I think they're my friends. I'm not sure. Let's call them George, Lisa, and Sierra. We all go to school together and sit next to each other but I have noticed a couple things over the course of the semester. George and Lisa are really good friends. Lisa and Sierra are really good friends. And I am really good friends with Sierra. But I feel like George is only my friend wherever Lisa isn't available. It's like I'm his replacement friend. Which isn't really a friend because if Lisa was available all the time, he wouldn't ever come around. 

I also get the vibe that Lisa doesn't really like me because I only hear from her when she needs help with homework or when she has a question about something from class. Also, I know this is childish but the 3 of them made a group chat that they always talk in and didn't include me, even though I'm supposed to be part of the group, and that kind of hurt my feelings. George also sent Lisa and Sierra very important notes that he got from an upperclassmen but didn't send them to me, which sucks because we all take the same classes. I mentioned to George that I don't feel like we are really friends, at which point he reassured me that we are, and then immediately continued to treat me as a replacement friend.

I am great friends with Sierra and I don't mind being an acquaintance with Lisa instead of a true friend but at this point, I don't want to continue to be George's backup friend. At the same time, I don't want to cause any drama between the 4 of us. Am I overreacting? What should I do?",12Oct2019,1
76,"Just want to preface this that I moved into this apartment with the expectation that pets wouldn’t be allowed. Because of this, I have put off adopting a pet of my own.

Upon moving in, I found out that the couple above me has a fairly large dog, and they have an agreement with the landlord. The dog is registered as an emotional support animal, so that made sense to me.

But the dog barks constantly. I am frequently woken up by the dog barking, and I’m not sure if I can really do anything other than speaking with them directly about it. I have voiced my concerns to them in the past, but I don’t want to be “that guy” that constantly complains, but after I get home from work I really don’t want to listen to an “emotional support animal” bark for hours on end.

Also feel like it’s worth noting that I fully understand that emotional support animals are valid, I just feel that they may have registered the dog in this way so they would have an easier time getting an apartment. Do emotional support animals usually bark like this?

What should I do?",12Oct2019,2
77,"So as a warning, this is prolly gonna be kinda long, so sorry. 

As a sort of trigger warning, I don’t mention any specific numbers regarding my anorexia or calorie counts, but I do talk about my struggles with recovery and feelings 

Right now I am a 2nd year student who moved 3 weeks ago to a new country I’ve always wanted to live in on an exchange program through the college one of my parents is a professor at. I’m also a 19 yr old F. I’m using this as an opportunity to make a new start here, and so far things are going really great, I am socializing more, and actually making friends for one of the first times in my life. I am genuinely much happy over here. 

However...I still have a lot of baggage from my past I am trying to manage or overcome and recover from.

I’ve struggled with depression, anxiety, a verbally/emotional abusive gymnastics coach the last 4 years I did competitive gymnastics (I quit at age 17), a verbally/emotionally abusive narcissistic parent, and being over all sheltered as the ‘pet’ of my parent.  (My other parent is okay, but worked a lot so I didn’t get much interaction. I am on okay terms with them now) N parent wasn’t as bad as some of the stories I’ve read on the raisedbynarcissits subreddit, but both my other parent, therapist, and doctor have told me they think parent is a narcissist. 

On top of all that shit, I’ve had anorexia for 3 years now. Last year moved across country to a new state for college. That college ended up not being financially viable, wasn’t what I expected, and so I ended up having to come back home over the summer. While in my first year, I started to try eating a more ‘normal’ amount but still not enough and had a very restrictive mindset. I was finally diagnosed with anorexia here, and decided I wanted to try and get better over the summer.

Over the summer,my anorexia relapsed when I went to the doctor and found out I had gained a small amount of weight from what was diagnosed to be hypothyroidism, even though I had been restricting calories and working out at the gym 5 days/week and walking a few miles every day. I was still at an underweight, but not as bad as I was before. My anorexia did get pretty bad during the first year regarding physical health and I had any and all the stereotypical anorexia symptoms. Being near my N parent and also feeling like a ‘fake’ anorexic because my body didn’t work like a normal one, caused me to relapse. I did end up losing back the weight I had gained from my hypothyroidism through the relapse. On top of that, having debilitating fatigue, being worn out from the previous kinda stressful year of college, and dealing with my depression and existential nihilism, I was not in a good place. 

I was seeing a therapist every two weeks, which I found very helpful, and I did get a new primary care doctor who helped me get antidepressants and on a synthroid for my hypothyroidism. I was diagnosed also with major depressive disorder, general anxiety, and on spectrum for OCD. The antidepressants are working okay, and I don’t feel like sobbing over the smallest thing anymore, but I still have a general melancholy when alone, disinterest in things I like and struggle with everything feeling meaningless. 

However...even though I am still underweight, I am not as underweight as I was in the past, nor as underweight as I should have been if I didn’t have hypothyroidism or like what a stereotypical anorexic looks like. 

Since I moved over here to the new country, I have upped my calorie count to an almost normal level and I do feel much more mental clarity and better. I no longer am triggered by my narcissistic parent to keep restricting and I am trying continue my learning of the language of this country so I can break free completely and become my own person, and don’t have to ask for money for necessities (still financially dependent unfortunately). I did apply for a part time job and have started to try and start selling prints of my art I make on the side to save up for continuing my studies in this country next year. And I haven’t gained any weight yet. I did buy a scale to track my weight and only weigh myself once in the morning. 

However, I have been craving sweets and carbs like crazy and I want to eat all the sweets I can find because I am so hungry and everything here is so delicious and new. I guess I should mention I was a vegan for the last 8 months, but I did switch back to being a vegetarian since veganism isn’t really known in this country and I’m trying to be less restrictive. I want to eat all the cookies and pastries and noodles and tofu even after I have a normal person sized meal. I feel like I am always hungry. But I don’t want to turn into having binge eating disorder or gain a ton of weight.my doctor wants me to get to the recommended amount of calories for an adult person, and I am trying to focus on eating at least the amount I have for the last 3 weeks  so my hormones can stabilize, but I have no one to talk to and I feel like I’m going insane. 

I can message my doctor, and she was really helpful in the beginning, but I think I sent too many long walls of text of questions about recovery and my inner turmoil and now I think she got irritated because she used to send a paragraph or two response and would be nice, but her response to my last message was very frank and literally only one sentence. 

My parent I am on okay terms with does t understand mental illnesses and I am trying to limit contact with N parent. I am making friends now, but I can’t open up to them yet about all this sob stuff because a) I am only at an intermediate level in the language and wouldn’t be able to properly convey my feelings, and b) I doubt they would really know how to deal with all the shit going on. I have had a video therapy session with my therapist once and I’m going to continue doing that every 2 weeks, but I feel so needy and like I need constant stimulation of people around me to feel re-affirmation that I exist. I am an introvert and used to be okay by myself but now I have to constantly listen to background noise when I’m in my room or I feel like I’m not real and like I’m going crazy. I’ve also had a nightmare every single night since I’ve been here of my N parent and that has been unsettling me too...


TL;DR: Moved out 3 weeks ago to a new country from narcissistic parent to study. Doing much better away from the crazy of my parent but managing MDD, anorexia recovery, feeling existential nihilism, and trying to reintegrate as a normal functioning person with no one to talk to is hard. Also having cravings for sweets and am worried about getting fat. 

Idk I just need some advice please. I am generally doing much better over here, and I really love this country and the people here, but not having anyone to talk to about anorexia and my narcissistic parent any time I feel like I need reassurance or validation while I’m trying to recover from is hard.",12Oct2019,1

80,"Hello,

I have a woman who is harassing me (including statements like ""obviously you know I already have your mother's information"") on Facebook and via text.

What are my options here? My Facebook is 'friends only' and this woman has never been a 'friend', she is all ready blocked on my phone. 

However, I have anxiety disorder and PTSD, so seeing these and knowing they are there tend to trigger me so I delete most of them. I still have all the Facebook ones. But I keep deleting the texts. I'm trying not to now.... But that does mean I'm missing all the texts from July until pretty recently. 

Unfortunately for backstory... She's the wife I didn't know existed for a guy I dated. I knew him for over a year before him and I ever did anything, and I never had a clue he was married, I even asked early on and he said no.

I never asked for any of this. I have never spoken to her. And I blocked him early on, but I briefly still had to talk to him due to work (at work, and strictly business related) until I found a new job, and then I fully cut all communication. I literally did everything to escape this. But she is still messaging me.",12Oct2019,2

I’ve shared my feelings in the past, but I’ve realized that either no one cares or they insist that they are listening/not talking over me.

86,"So i'm stuck between two different career paths. I've already made up my mind of not going to uni to do a course in computer science purely for the ""job security and money"", despite people telling me to. I want a job that I have a passion for regardless of money. My main goal in life is to wake up and enjoy the job I do. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. My first path, would be to join the military. I love all things military, military history, military equipment and the countless inspiring stories of those that have served. I like the discipline, the idea that I could be moulded into the best version of myself. Perhaps I romanticise the military too much, but I like the idea of standing for ones country, training with experts in their field, travelling to places you'd normally never go (even if they're dangerous), making lifelong friends, that sense of brotherhood belonging to something bigger than yourself.
2. My second path, would be music. I've always been creative at school and when i'm given an artistic challenge that's when I tend to shine best. When it comes to music, I just love it, I mean... Imagine a world without music, its not one i'd want to live in. I could sit back for hours listening to music, I've always wondered what if I dedicated 100% towards music, how successful could I be? Would people ever care? Would I fail...

Obviously these are two completely different career paths and both require 100% dedication if I want to become successful, my worry is that I try one and wish I'd picked the other and realising its too late to do anything about it. Any and all help would be greatly appreciated, thanks.",12Oct2019,1
87,"i’ve posted here before about becoming a neckbeard, and thankfully i have moved past that stage in my life. but, that time has me stuck with the creep reputation and it’s not helped by something else i did.

90,"About two weeks ago, I pledged to be in a sorority. I’m a sophomore in college and I haven’t made as many friends as I had hoped due to my shyness and having a toxic bf my freshman year that didn’t allow me to hang out with anyone other than him, including my family... I started dating someone else two months ago and he’s a great guy and he encouraged me to join one after I told him I wanted to join a sorority so that I could be more social. So when I got a text a month ago inviting me to an informational I jumped at the chance. I honestly was just eager to join a sorority, it didn’t matter what kind. The girls seemed nice at first. It’s a Latina based sorority which was fine with me but I’m only 1/4 Latina so i don’t really identify with being Latina that much. After I pledged, the leader of sorority gave me us this big binder and told us all the weekly responsibilities we have to do. Only three girls pledged- me and two other girls. There were five responsibilities. I was overwhelmed with everything so I picked what I thought was the easiest. Every week we have to study 3 hours together and spend 2 additional hours with two diff girls in the sorority a week. Then I have additional responsibilities putting together the scrapbook each week, then we have to study 10 pages word for word for tests about the sorority weekly. You have to memorize everything or else you fail. I failed last week and if you fail you have to schedule a retake. I take 16 hours of college a week and I live 30 min from Campus. The leader of the sorority is very very rude to me and tries to find flaws in everything I do. I’m trying to say this in a way that’s not coming off as rude but there’s no other way to put it— I come from a family that is pretty well off and I accidentally let it sleep that I came from the richer side of town and I think that made the leader jealous so how she dosent like me.

91,"I'm 17, whether or not that matters. I've been ruminating on this idea for a while, and am still unsure whether it is a good idea or not. 

Programming, my main interest, is something I have been doing since I was 11. Music production is my second primary interest, which I started fiddling with around 12. Essentially, these are the things that I have spent the most time on (asides from slacking off, playing video games, and wasting my time, which I used to do much more than I do now). 

Thing is, I want to be great at something. Like recognizably great. My programming skills are pretty mediocre, though I believe I can do anything I set my mind to in that department. As far as music goes, I feel like I'm not really improving. I feel like [my music](https://soundcloud.com/adammakesthings/silk) will always be subpar regardless of what I do, because I feel inherently uncreative in comparison to any other artist out there. I'm thinking that maybe I'm spread too thin because it seems like I'm not making true progress in ANYTHING I do, and it's really getting me down...

I'm extremely afraid of spreading myself too thin. These are the things I really want to be good at: programming, piano/keys, guitar, music production. Should I give up on music and solely focus on programming? Is this a bad idea? 

I'm very sorry if this post is poorly organized. Today was a long day so I'm not thinking very clearly. Feel free to ask for any other info if you think it will help you answer my question.

Now, she sat me down and said that if I don't marry who she chooses then she will not come to the wedding and neither will the family and not talk to me ever. I think its absurd to have such a dated view on marriage. I know that arranged marriages last, but my parents hate each other and I want to be with someone I like and my mom should support that. Just her saying that really pissed me off. Idk what to do. I go to college in a year, so hopefully I will have some time to be myself. Any advice is appreciated, and thanks.",12Oct2019,37

113,"Ill give a little intro here. It is long and detailed but I truly need the vent its really taking a toll on me...

I have been friends with this girl we will call her Gina.

I truly have always tried helping her by giving her a place to stay, keeping her things here at our house in the middle of her moving and shes never helped me when I need a favor. I never really gave it much thought until now that she never reciprocates the favors. I finally got sick of her being inconsiderate the time and I stopped going out of my way. Once we went to a concert and she ditched me and another friend to eat brunch with her boyfriend while we had driven 2 hours out of the way to help her not have to drive so far since she lived close to where the concert was. we waited and waited on her and after that I was over it.


So recently we got into an argument because I was helping her drive around to gain clients for a new job, she wanted to meet a friend and get drinks in the middle of this and i expressed i would rather not so she got upset and tried to say I am a bad friend because I never want to hang out with her friends (which I do not drink and she insists on getting drunk when going out ive always been understanding but she knows I don't drink) AND that she always drives to me that i never came to her house (which I had on a few occasions but i have a 2 year old its tough to take him to a college town but i thought since she came over so often I didn't want her getting burnt out on seeing me). Which is true but we allowed her to stay here once or twice a week because it cut her an entire hour of a drive to her college. So therefore I never gave much thought to it that I was being unfair. During this argument I told her I was sorry and that I wish she would have been honest and told me this bothered her since I have always been honest with her in the past. I told her I would give more effort to drive to her and that we could plan to do more things together, I drove almost 2 hours to come and see her and last night invited her to Six Flags with another friend who invited me first. I asked her (and I realize this is out of the way for her but it wasn't my intention.) if she would like to stay the night before and we ride together the next day. she said no because she would have to drive 30 minutes to my house and back the next day so she wanted me to drive to her since she lives closer to the park. I finally just decided I could ride with my friend and Gina could meet us at the park since it was further for us and less of a drive for her. She hasn't texted back and I feel shes not going to like that. Am I rude for not driving to her? Is my text rude? I am so obsessed over whether I am a bad friend or if I am too critical on myself. I am having a tough time at a good time in my life and I want to know if this friend is worth my time or if I am just an asshole.",12Oct2019,1
114,"posting this on a brand new account. not sure if this is fit for the sub, i haven’t been here long. i haven’t written one of these before, so i hope i give enough information. 

i’m gonna talk a bit about self harm here so, trigger warning. 

i have recently (maybe for a month or two) relapsed into self harm. the last time i did was about a year or two ago, and at that time i told one of my good friends. we are still very close. 

i’m currently seeing a therapist (mainly gender dysphoria, social anxiety, depression), but i have avoided the topic of sh, because she is legally obligated to tell my parents (i am a minor) if i tell her about it. i’ve already stressed them out because of other things, and they don’t need another problem right now. but i don’t want my friend to be stressed either. 

i just don’t really know what to do right now. i guess i’d want to tell her just so she knows why i’ve been acting weird. or just have someone to talk to sometimes (she has self-harmed in the past and has been very open to talking about it). 

i’ve done some google “research” and i’m getting mixed answers. some say you should because it’s good to have a support system, and others say that it’s unfair to force someone else to carry that secret. 

i’m just feeling kinda lost right now. there might be a really obvious answer here i’m not seeing. should i tell my friend i self harm? 

TL; DR one of my good friends is a past self-harmer and i’m conflicted whether or not i should tell her about my own problem.",12Oct2019,1

116,"My bf and I have been in this very weird state of break but not break up after he told me 2 months ago that he has doubts about our relationship and is unsure of me. I proposed the break after he told me that because I couldn't really speak to him casually after that knowing that he isn't 100% committed. So, we give each other space (we dont love together and he lives a few hours away), we talk maybe once a week and that talk is him reaching put and ""checking in on me"" he says. I personally am very hurt and am processing and healing this hurt, and he still has yet to come up with any detailed explanation of these feelings. Whenever I bring up the fact that he hasnt given me any clarity on the subject when he calls for these ""check ups"" it leads to an argument and he blames the argument on either me being combative or the fact that I need to ""handle what Im feeling"" ummm hurt is a process, its not like Im gonna just snap out of it. Im literally doing my best at being receptive toward him still after all of this.

Earlier today we spoke because he ""checked in"" , I told him some good news about some projects I might potentially be taking on and the conversation was going surprisingly well after I shared my news I told him if felt weird for me to be vulnerable with him because after what happened Ive built a wall and have been very guarded. He then got upset and said that I dont have to keep reminding him that Im hurt because he has to carry that every day and that he has to battle guilt and its hard for him etc. I told him that its hard for me too and that Im sharing how I feel the same way he shared he's unsure and that I will no longer share with him my feelings because if I share good feelings like with my good news its all breeze but if I express sad feelings such as my hurt and difficulty with being vulnerable with him he gets upset and says he's ""thrown off"" , I concluded with repeatedly telling him that he's selfish! and also that I wont speed up or rush my hurt healing for him.

Like I repeatedly said selfish and that I don't know how he cant see that its selfish. It felt empowering but maybe because Im not used to standing up for myself is where feelings of maybe I was an asshole come in.

Td;lr Its literally been 2 months y'all like how have you not worded or drafted up an explanation by now? And anytime an argument happens he'll say he wanted to talk about it but somehow blames me for him not feeling comfortable to do so because I tell him Im hurt still. Wtf.

This is all a mess. Please any insight or advice?",12Oct2019,3

121,"She loves me, she really does, but she’s such a burden on my life. 
She is objectively the most obnoxious person I’ve ever met, every time I met someone that resembles her I immediately avoided her. 
It’s like she literally doesn’t know anything, it’s honestly like she’s my little sister or something, she divorced my dad and i feel like she’s forcing me to be the dad in the family and I never f*cking asked for that. 
She cannot do anything herself, she never makes a desicion herself (which means I’m being asked questions 24/7 like I’m her f*cking husband) and there’s just no value that she has ever added to my life. 
She’s no role model, she’s disgustingly average and hates her job(English teacher in Israel) she has a doctorate in Criminology “because it interests her” (never had a job in that field), and used to act irrationally towards me when I was younger (threw me out of the house when I talked back, hid my things, woke me up with a slap at 5 AM for not putting my shoes where she asked me etc.) but now I guess she respects me because I’m a big boy. 
On top of all that, she is a heavy smoker and constantly yells (she thinks she talks normally) which results in her having an indescribably annoying voice. 
That being said, she’s not a bad person, she does love me and she’s never really abused me or anything. 
It’s just that she’s a person I’d normally avoid but I “have” to treat her nicely because I “owe” her for raising me. 
I don’t know if I’m right to feel the way I do, but I really feel she’s gonna be a big pile of deadwood in my life until she dies.

123,"Hello everyone,

As a preface: In the past when living with cats, I struggled with this “cuteness aggression” thing. I would find myself petting it nicely, until it seemed content, and then the cuteness would ‘overcome’ me, and I would sometimes hold it down, or startle it, or pet it with more force, until it pawed at me, and ultimately looked betrayed. I wouldn’t ever be rough enough to actually hurt the cats.

Now: I recently moved to the US for school. This place that I moved to ended up being as perfect as it seemed, except for the fact that I didn’t know that the owner has two cats. I’m faced with the same problem. I try to not be at home as much as possible, but inevitably I have to come back at some time. Something about the cuteness and particularly affectionate nature of one of the cats, makes me act this way. It constantly follows me, every day, meowing until I pet her. 

I have always avoided living with small animals, as I am totally aware of this flaw of mine. I’m totally fine with small animals when I’m not living with them, I think building familiarity and getting to know their character also has a part in it. 

Please don’t give me the usual “you’re fucked up, you’re a terrible person, blah blah blah”, because I know that this is fucked up. That is precisely why I’m asking for advice, I’ve acknowledged the problem.

I would really appreciate serious advice, personal stories, or information about this (I already know about “cuteness aggression” though), as I will be here for the next 6 months at least.

So obviously I’ve been putting these things on him to help and he’s gotten use to it.  So now he asks me to put his lotion and nail oil on or he’d go into my bag and grab the lip balm and stuff to do it himself. 

My sister saw him putting on nail oil and yelled at him. When he told her auntie let’s him, she came to curse me out and say I was going to make him gay. She also told our mother and she agreed saying that it might be making him too feminine at a young age. 
I’m just trying to keep his skin healthy Also he’s only 6, I don’t see how giving him good skin care habits would make him gay or how his sexuality in the far future could even be affected by it.

134,"I’m in need of some outside advice because everyone around me is understandably biased. Tl;dr at the end.

I just learned who my biological father is yesterday from someone who was a friend of my mother. This friend, years ago, introduced the two and they in turn had a one night stand which resulted in me. However, my mothers friend refused to provide her his contact info because she assumed she wanted child support. She says she didn’t and I believe her because she was and always has been a strong and independent (albeit awfully stubborn) woman. She just wanted to give him a chance to know he had a child. Well, their friendship ended at this point and all I knew was his first name and the town he lived in back then.

Fast forward to present day and I finally found this person and was able to confront them. As furious as I was that they were responsible for making this decision when they had no right to, I politely asked for his info. I knew if I was going to get answers, I had to keep emotions aside. Well, I got those answers and I have located him.

My entire childhood and adult life up until a few years ago when he passed away, I had a father-figure who I still wouldn’t trade for anything in this world. The anger and resentment I first had towards my mom’s friend almost doesn’t matter anymore. Looking back, I am happy with what I had and so grateful for family that was ultimately created by this persons refusal.

This is where my question comes in. My wife thinks I’m being too forgiving, too much of a pushover. I can see why she says that but on the other hand, I don’t think she truly gets where I’m coming from. My mom and this friend have also reconnected as a result and it bothers me  but I’m not about to tell her who she can be friends with. It’s up to her whether she can forgive and forget.

Tl;dr - Mother gets pregnant, friend refuses to give her the contact info of the father which ultimately changed my life forever.

So my best friend lives in a different state than mine, we both talk every day, and we like it a lot, but we decided not to date until we can meet.

But this is the thing we were talking about today, and the conversation ended up in ""waifus"". The conversation unfolded a little, and I found that I wasn't the only ""real waifu"" of her. There is another girl, and I already knew she liked that other girl until we had talked about liking each other. But well ... Knowing she still liked the girl, even a little, meant to me that she really only liked her, especially since she was closer, closer to my best friend's age and all that.

Another detail ... We are both very affectionate and cheesy with each other, so we end up just throwing something cute in the air out of nowhere. And she basically played ""Let's get married"". And I responded by talking about the other girl, I answered well, even jokingly, saying that she had to marry the girl she liked. She said it was me, and I once again commented on the girl.

She simply replied ""Fuck her then. You're very boring sometimes"" (we wrote the wrong things usually in a cute way, but that was basically it) Then the fight started. She said ""I like you. Can't I like someone else?"", ""Let me like as many people as I want,"" and until if I don't want to be with her one day, just talk, to be quoting someone she likes. like slightly is boring, and everything. I just don't know how to answer that. No way. I'm really so lost now, it would be very good if someone could shed light on the situation for me.

Fast forward three years later and we are catching up once a month on the phone or in person. He is still dating his gf and I’m dating a new guy. My new guy is nice but we don’t have the same interests which is fun at times but strenuous at other times. I’m adventurous and athletic and enjoy hiking, intellectual conversation, and being positive. He prefers to stay inside, is anxious a lot about anything adventurous, tries to convince me to not do fun adventurous things, is pretty negative about anyone or anything I compliment (I guess he feel inferior?) and generally just likes looking at memes and get upset over minor things. He doesn’t tel me he loves me often and I found out some weird shit about him recently and I try to just deny it happened. He basically told me he has a list of girls on his phone who he has fucked and kept nudes other women sent him and he called them him trophies when I said it was really disrespectful for him to keep the nudes of those women and I said he probably masturbates to them still, why else would he keep them? And he insisted it was because they’re trophies. I told him to delete all of mine. 

So basically my ex never did anything like that with me. We are super open and can talk for hours. My boyfriend and I are basically just on our phones all the time (I don’t want to be but since he’s always on it I may as well stay occupied myself....) my ex was my best friend. We broke up because we weren’t good at dealing with conflict and had lots of baggage. He wanted us to stay friends but mature so we wouldn’t fuck our relationship again if we tried in the future.

My ex gives me extended hugs and extends his visits with me as long as he can, but he never texts me first or initiates hanging out with me... yet is super eager to spend time with me when I do ask. 

Basically is it ok for me to be best friends with my ex and date my bf? My bf doesn’t seem really into me and I kind of feel like I am just his prize cause half the time he doesn’t listen to what I say or when I try to make jokes he doesn’t respond and then later makes a negative comment about it.

Help guys, I don’t know what to do. I really like this girl, but my classmate (that also likes her) is my good friend.

140,"So I'm somewhat close to a longtime friend I met in college. She's great, attractive,smart and really understanding. I've had romantic feelings for her on and off for the past few years. Iasked her out once but at the time she was not in a position to date. That happened 2 years ago. I moved on and have even dated other women since then. We've been hanging out frequently again and those feelings are starting to come back. The problem is that she's now in a long term relationship with someone else. They are great together and I don't want to intrude on that. Is there a way for me to get these feeling out of mind? I don't want to make problems for her and her partner but I feel guilty spending time with her with me having this attachment to her. Do I have to break the friendship off or is there some other way?",12Oct2019,0
141,"My PS3 was overheating after being on for only a minute or two. I wanted to have the thing professionally ""reballed"" which is usually the best method to fix this issue. Rather than ship it out, I decide to take it to a place nearby that fixes PS3's and claims to be very experienced. They have very good reviews online (4.8 average on Google) so I take it in. They charge no fee up front, and say they would probably let me know by tomorrow.

A few days later I get a call saying the repair did not work and that the unit now is completely inoperable. I ask why and they say they attempted and failed to reflow the solder, which is a far more basic way of repairing and honestly something I could do myself. Granted, I did not clarify what repair method they would use, which is completely on me. In the end I would have been happy if it worked or was the same as I dropped it off.

So I say I will come pick it up and he says they would have to charge me a $35 bench fee for their time if I wanted to pick it up. I say I will. He then says, actually, it isn't a good idea because the motherboard is now damaged so there is no way this unit would work again. I am kind of annoyed at this point and decide to just call it a loss.

So what else could I do? Just leave a bad review, or not bother? Seeing how like 99% of their reviews are glowing I feel awkward doing it. But this whole experience just seems shady. Why charge me to pick up my ps3 that you broke?  


tl:dr - Highly rated repair shop broke my ps3 beyond repair and wanted to charge me to pick it back up. Is there anything you'd suggest to not feel like I just got had?",12Oct2019,1

146,"So I posted about my sister a while ago and got some good advice on how to deal with it.  However, my life is a mess so here is more issues that i need advice on. 

Ok, so i don't want to dive into too much detail but through a long series of events i didn't get my first boyfriend until i was 21.  He is my first kiss and my first everything, and i am very happy with him because he is genuinely a nice guy. (FYI he is 5 years older than me)

It has been 2 years since then and he has proposed, and i of course said yes.  I am very happy. This is where everything goes south.

When i came home to tell my father and sister the news about what happened, they both got very upset and said I could do better than the guy i was with and that I wasn't ready for marriage.  I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  My sister got married at\~16-17, my dad at \~18.  I am getting married at 23.  I'm not saying i'm wise and know-all, but I don't think i'm ""too young"".

I've already met his parents to ask for approval, and they were so sweet and kind.  They were so happy to see us and gave their blessing right away.

I know I make more money than him, but it's honestly not by much. (we both make 6 figures).  We both came from lower middle class backgrounds and worked our way to become successful, we both are breadwinners to our respective families.  He even is the same religion as me which i wasn't even looking for, that was just pure luck.  We both work in similar fields, What more can you want???

When i confronted my sister and father about what they don't like about him they just get angry and avoid the question.  I'm so frustrated right now.  I never thought i would consider eloping since I want to spend my marriage day with my family, but now I am briefly considering it.

Before some of you say just have the wedding without them, we come from very family-oriented...well... families, so that's a big no.

I think she suspects/knows that I like her because sometimes when I glimpse over at her I think/am positive she was looking over at me, but I look away to quickly too see if she looked away, then today I tried talking to her and she was definitely looking over at me afterwards, but I think that at best it’s because she wonders if I like her 

My friend gave me advice on what to do (which quite frankly I think was shit advice) where he said that whenever I glimpse over, to look slightly longer (like 1-2 seconds) so that if she’s looking at me, I can see what her reaction is, but I’m not comfortable doing that 

I tried talking to her during the second class we have together but I don’t know how to go up and start a conversation without making it obvious that I like her and just being like “heyyy, what’s up...”, I tried to start a conversation by asking her about how she resolved an issue she had registering for an AP exam but I failed to bring up a new topic in time so that failed

However, since it's getting colder here in Minnesota they turned on the steam-powered heat, and the pipes run right along my ceiling in all my rooms since I'm in the basement.

I have the windows cracked right now (which might be making it worse because it's trying to compensate for the cold air, idk) but I can't have them open forever because I have issues with men looking into my windows (I am a woman who lives alone, so it's kinda scary.)

I’m fine with that, but my issue is that I travel back an fourth between my mom’s and dad’s house, since they’re divorced and I haven’t settled in one household. Love them both equally despite their problems. I understand that as a bird owner, it’s important to spend time bonding with your pet, so I don’t want to leave it at one or the others house, only for it to get sad and start potentially harming itself.

165,"We get a 700L(+-50) drinking water for our apartment every 4-5days from a municipality water tanker.
We are total 6 families living here. For the sake of easy explanation, let it be A(3), B(4), C(5), D(3), E(5) and F(1). Me being A suppose. Count of members mentioned in parentheses.

The tank has two taps. We were more than 10 families a year ago who used to feed on that tanker. But, peoples started leaving the place eventually. People were not satisfied then, not satisfied now either, even we have only 5 families feeding on that tanker.

* A, B, and C on one side

* D, E and F on the other side. F being a single guy and he doesn't live here 90% of the time. He takes 40L when he visits here. So, mostly its D and E on the other side.

* A, B, C get around 110L+ each. We don't have a count for the other side, but since both taps are same, we can assume more than 330L falls on other side too.

* Now, there is another person X who comes to take 20L of water. As of now he rotates his turn.

* The thing that bothering me is, if D and E has only two families, they can easily accommodate the extra X person.

* But, both( strongly D) always didn't share the extra water on their side with us. According to D, it was divided from the beginning. So, now we cannot demand extra from their side. We fill only when they are done with. We all are satisfied with the quantity we get except D, who mostly acts a crybaby like they didn't get enough water and shit. The day when the tanker comes, they don't fill from the other source of water. While the rest of us do.

* Right now, I am 100% sure, the quantity on our side is more than sufficient for all of us to survive 5days. But, sometimes due to delay during public holidays there is a little shortage but not a big problem. We get 1h supply of non-drinking water that contains dirts and rusts. We use it for non consuming proposes.

* This is my plan: Next time X comes, i am going to say him. Please fill 20L from the other side. I will face the same argument from D and E perhaps. I will try to explain them the stats that i mentioned above, although they always speak against it. If this doesn't work, then i am straightaway going to tell X, you are not filling that bucket on our side anymore, if you do then i am going to remove it by myself. This might create huge unrest among D E and X.

* B and C never really supported me with any argument for the sharing of the EXTRA water, its like they don't care much. They just tell me to fill when D and E are done on the other side. They act nice and friendly to the other side people. If anyways I am successful at this, then B and C are going to gain from it without saying a word.

But, i have seen them talking among themselves about the imbalance for water, among them and to my mom sometimes.  I hate it when my mom speaks about these things to me. I don't want to debate for this shit but cannot stand my mom preaching about how inferior we are because we are not fighting for this. I try to convince her to stay contained with what we are getting, we always have more than 40L water left when the tanker comes. But I fail to do so.

On the other side, we don't really talk to D. E is neutral to us. I hate it when these people talk shit on their backs and then act so good, i know they are doing for their own good, but stillll....

* I am not doing this because my family is having less drinking water, we have sufficient water to drink and cook food. More than enough. I am doing this because of self-esteem or ego( you name it) , I want equality to prevail. I hate how D acts supremacy just because they quarrel well and pin point what others are doing.
My weakness is i can't contain my anger when debating, and I am working on it. I will be speaking as peacefully as I can the next time. If i don't suppress 'D' here, they will be doing the same in future in other matters.

* Is it worth it? Fight for equality or stay on the path of self containment because there is no end to human demand.

* No we don't have any authorities to speak to, The only next higher authority is police station.

[Short: Families in 3:2 ratio for two taps of water; me being on side 3 ; outsiders(X) fills alternatively; i am going to ask X to choose side 2; we don't face scarcity of water; going to argue for equality]

173,"Hi Folks. 

Tldr from the get go:
 Garden style condo. Neighbor who rents (we own) keeps spraying an ungodly amount of air freshener/perfume into the shared hallway. It's leaking into our unit. Property managers do nothing. 



Garden condo means 4 units, one building. 

Imagine a huge house divided in half. Two upper units and two lower. I'm an upper unit so we share an entrance with the other upper as well as a stairwell. The two lower units have their own entrances. 

I've been here 14 years. The unit across the hall is owned by someone who rents. Never met them. Never had a problem until they moved in this past year. 

They started plugging in those plugin air fresheners to the hall outlets. They have sensitivity controls so we turned it to low but didn't say anything. 

We came in to tape over the sensitivity control along with a note that said ""DO NOT TOUCH""

 We knocked on the door to let them know my husband has asthma and they are really bad for your health overall. We nicely asked her to keep those kinds of air fresheners in her unit, not the shared hall. She got confrontational and accused us of letting our dog pee in the hall (we don't, I think she just hates animals our dog is well trained). It escalated into us complaining of trash left in the hall by her and just devolved from there. 

A few weeks passed and there was no confrontation. 

Now she is dousing the hall in air freshener. To the point where I come home I can't breathe and my eyes itch. 

Now we cook a lot (I'm a chef). I get cooking smells aren't for everyone.  But the fact that she has to douse our shared hall is infuriating.

- A tiny vial with his favorite perfume (on me).
- A smaller envelope with a birthday, christmas, new Year's, and valentine's cards. I expect him to open them when the appropriate holiday comes. I trust him.

Not sure what else to add. Any suggestions? Anything that can fit in a large envelope along with a bunch of letters. I truly want to make it as thoughtful as possible.",12Oct2019,8
178,"So i have a really good friend group, all of the people in my group is my best friends, but one of my best friend keeps going on how good his game is, and always says the games i play sucks and is trash even though he played and liked it in the past, i used to say his games sucks but i don’t do it anymore and also haven’t done it in months, in our test group chat he keeps advertising mobile games which me and my friend group don’t play, (we don’t play mobile games) , i assume its for free rewards ingame, and its kinda annoying, he has sent about 5-6 games already, and i have ignored it without saying things thats negative, I just say dude i don’t play much mobile games can u stop, so yesterday i told him its really annoying a disrespectful to do that without asking us first and he’s mad i think, so i bring up how if i have done it, he would have 100% said it sucks no matter if he played it or not, liked it or not, but he goes on how i also says what he plays sucks, but like i said i haven’t done it in months, in the past i also told him to try the games i recommend then if he really thinks its trash then complain, but he has never done that, i think he’s doing it to get on my nerves or maybe he’s just the person who do that, over this year i have quit a game about a year ago (Fortnite ) and he has been going on how good it is when he played it, then how trash it is when he couldn’t download it, now how good it is and why i am stupid to delete it so i can download a game i like which he also thinks is trash, in the group chat, he even said Minecraft sucks without even trying it, Minecraft  is among my most played games following by Warframe, destiny, apex which he also thinks is trash even though he liked Warframe and apex in the past .most of my friends also play the game he is liking right now which is Fortnite and maybe thats why they think I’m in the wrong or something, but this is getting too annoying, almost every time im talking to someone about some games we play in common, he’s like “dude you still play that game? Its trash, why did you delete fortnite though its really good fun?” And i just hate it so much, im pretty sure my friends think im wrong for just wanting him to stop. ( i said whatever since i realised i wasn’t going anywhere in this argument he would just make excuses / things up to make me look bad, like saying i say his games are bad, i never tried his games etc)

So i really want to get him to stop and also convince my friends that this is annoying and should see my side of this arguement, after yesterday our group chat is silent, idk what i should do, i also don’t want to end those friendships because they are my best friends and we often play games together, and also since our group chat is silent since yesterday, im afraid i accidentally made them hate me or whatever , so what should i do now?",12Oct2019,1

181,"So there was this guy in the 1800s who had a really graphic construction accident one day, and he somehow survived. The accident caused brain damage with lasting effects to his personality. It's a case that literally every neuroscientist and cognitive scientist knows about, because it shows a direct relationship between brain physiology and personality. His name is Phineas Gage. Google him at your own discretion.

That story really irked me. On top of how chilling it was to hear the story, we also saw an image of his skull enduring that kind of trauma. It hurt to see.

187,"Long post because I’m absolutely fed up.

My dad has cancer and needs to gain some weight before he can even be considered for radiation treatment.

Up till this point my dad vehemently refused to eat anything that his sister hadn’t prepared for him. But, my aunt is that type of person to look up “cancer remedies” online and follow those by the book. So she’s been feeding him a fuckton of vitamin C, plain tasteless porridge (that he refused to eat bc it was too bland), and plain broth. Needless to say, he’s lost a lot of weight. He and his sister basically ostracized my mom and kept telling her that she wasn’t doing enough, even though she‘s been cooking healthy foods for him, getting him his vitamin C drinks, and Ensure drinks (which he’d refused because his sister thought they were bad for cancer).

Finally, my dad saw the radiologist who told him that he HAD to eat more. Eat anything, add some salt if that will help keep the food down, DRINK SUPPLEMENT DRINKS. Even then my dad was hesitant, but then decided “fuck it” and asked my mom to buy him a case. 

When my aunt came over, she saw the Ensure, and reacted in disgust, as if they were bottles of, like, opium or something. A few hours later with her and his other sister, when the rest of us went out, he seemed worse for wear. Probably just tired, but also I think it’s the constant negative, doom-and-gloom energy his sisters have been giving off.

They are driving me fucking insane, passive-aggressively putting down my mom, and also just bringing my dad’s mood even lower. My aunt also doesn’t take the doctors’ advice seriously, which she’s been instilling into my dad, and making him rely on her as a main source of “cure-all foods”. 

How can I get her to stop? Or at least get my dad to get out of her influence?

.

tl;dr My aunt doesn’t believe in medical remedies, googles too much quack science, and influences my dad. She puts the whole mood of the house down, my mom is irritated, but she insists on coming every. single. day. What can I do?",12Oct2019,1
188,"So for context, I have this ex girlfriend that we have had a turmoil of a relationship together off and on for 20 years. She is bipolar and an alcoholic/drug addict, with a history of mental illness and suicide. She has struggled with poverty, no support, no family, etc... I have helped her a lot over the years, paying her rent at times, buying her food, and sadly enabling her off and on a lot over the years. This person has used me, lied to me, deceived me, manipulated me, and when we did date, cheated on me something awful. We haven't dated since we were kids (20's).

But over the years, I have still helped her every time, even after I swore her off many times and get burned.

After many years of not talking, I have been married for a long time, and a teenage daughter, she got in touch with me again. She was a mess in Vegas, and worse than I ever heard or seen. I was already in a failing marriage with another woman who wasn't a good mother, and I was carrying all the weight of our family, including working two jobs. She was selfish, abusive, and psychologically traumatizing to me often to get her way.

So when the old flame came back in my life, we started having a nonstop emotional affair long distance over the phone, which she made me realize I was in a failing marriage, so I left my wife, and divorced her. Now a single dad with 2 jobs. My wife was abusive and just didn't know how to protect and love her family properly.

So to make a long story short...the ex drunk and I hooked up at a really bad time for both of us. She came to me in sheer terror, desperation, talking about the world ending, and all kinds of other nonsense I didn't understand, but she was a mess. She flew into town in tears BEGGING for my forgiveness, and the worst drunk I have ever seen her and physically she was a mess.

Anyway, for transparency, just being honest cause I am confused... when she first arrived and on the way home from the airport, she had not started drinking yet. She BEGGED me NO MATTER WHAT, dont let us sleep together even if she gets drunk. She was in tears begging me to ""NOT"" let it happen, and she was a mess and vulnerable. I agreed and promised her several times I wouldn't. She kept insisting this in the car.

I have ALWAYS had a thing for her more than she has for me though for more disclosure, and she is the one that leaves me all the time, usually after using me, not the other way around. But I have been a bit obsessed with her off and on over the years, and could never walk away before.

So I ended up getting booze for her because she is that type of alcoholic, and was detoxing really bad and begging for it, and I expected this part ahead of time anyway with her. Nothing new. I was OK about this part because she was talking about ideas how to get help and that was good, and she needed to medically detox somewhere to be safe, and here and now wasn't the time...she was that bad, but not willing to go yet.

I have a teenage daughter and shouldn't have brought her back into my life, but I really love this gal and it's just too much at times to watch her suffer and have her tug on my heart strings.. Since I have gotten help with my codependency issues and things are different today, but that's what I did at the time for transparency.

While she was super drunk and had been drinking for hours, she started hitting on me. She talked me into going to the store and getting condoms, more booze, and we ended up having sex.

My teenage daughter was not there the entire time and was away with her mother, so she didn't see any of it. But she was impacted by her coming back into our lives suddenly after never being there before, plus the time and energy I wasted towards her instead of my daughter. I am just starting to realize that now.

An odd thing happened though...I met someone else, my wife died without us coming to full peace about what happened, and the ex girlfriend is now sober for 8 years without a drink. In the process of all that ugliness, she ended up getting sober and completely turning her life around in ways nobody thought would ever happen. She never lies to people anymore she claims, never cheats folks, and is super active in trying to help others, although her life ended up in a half way house for 3 years, and now lives a life of poverty for all those choices she made. Nobody ended up forgiving her, and even today I get really resentful just thinking about her and all the problems she caused me, and money she used me for., but she is a much better person than she was and doing good things in the community.

However, she recently confronted me after trying to make amends with her about that night together. She claims technically, its date rape because she begged me prior to it all happening to not let that happen. But by the time it happened, even though she was at extremely high levels of alcohol in her system, she still knew what she was doing, and she knows how vulnerable I can be for her. She pushed my buttons on purpose while drunk wanting to be with me, even if she clearly didn't in the car ride from the airport. Besides, she sends mixed signals all the time I think. Although we had not been I intimate in 20 years, we were that night.

For more transparency, she is not looking to harm me with it in a cruel way or looking to press charges kind of thing, but in arguing with her, she through it in my face that technically and legally, that would be date rape.

I think that is total bullshit...until I thought back and remembered how clear she was in the car begging me over and over to make sure it did not happen between us no matter how drunk she got. I have told her over and over how wrong she is but I am starting to question myself on what is true and real...and now I dont know.

I know that I didn't go out of my way to harm her like that, and think we were both just stupid vulnerable, and she admitted she put me in a bad spot with her drinking and lifestyle. But if I was to teach my daughter right from wrong, I need my words to line up with my actions, and now I am not so clear.

If she used it against me criminally after all I have done for her, she would be a total waste of life as a human because that would be revenge for something I wasn't trying to do or harm her. She was drunk, I had a few drinks with her, we had been having an emotional affair on the phone for a while, we hadn't seen each other in 20 years, plus I have always had a thing for her, and we have this lifelong weird connection like ALWAYS boyfriend and girlfriend that never cut the string emotionally in many ways. She was my first major girlfriend in life.

195,"I live in a housing complex. Everyday for a month I have had kids playing on my porch and my front lawn from 4 pm till about 8 pm. They scream, they ring my bell all night and throw stuff at my windows. I’ve tried to ask nicely for them to leave, I went to the parents and I’ve gone to the resident office. The parents say they don’t believe that their child does stuff like that and tells me that they are at the park. I’ve offered to show them the footage but they tell me to go away or come back with a lawyer. I got annoying and would come out everytime they get on my property and ask them to please leave and go play at their houses or the nearby park. They leave for a few minutes but always come back. The resident office can’t do anything other then send cease and desist orders which don’t do shit. 

 I’ve gotten to the point where I have to call the police because they’ve begun to vandalize my property and throw my packages in the street. I have them on my security cameras doing all of this. I’ve given the footage to the police but they don’t do much other than ask them to leave. The most they’ve done is get one boy in particular who knocked a hole in outside wall barred from the property. For reference my family is white, most of the other families are  black or Latino. 

Last week  at about 10 pm they were sitting on my porch and they rang my bell about 20 times and when I came out and told them to leave they asked me to make them something to eat. I told them no, to leave or I will have to call the police again. I closed the door and phoned the police. When the police got there they removed them from the property. After about an hour my doorbell started ringing like crazy. 5 women started yelling about how I called their children the n word. I told them I never did and that I have the footage to back it up and to leave before I call the police again. 

Today I received a  nasty letter about how I’m the neighborhood racist and my boyfriend  was approached by a man yesterday while he was leaving for work and was told by him he should beat his kkk ass. The kids are even worse now and ring my bell all day and have destroyed my outside furniture. Now when I ask the children to leave they call me all kinds of names and never leave or they go get their mothers and they stand on my front porch banging on the door. I’m fucking powerless.  I’ve offered to show the footage from the camera to them but they say I probably just edited that part out. 

I have no fucking clue what to do. I’m not mad the kids are playing I just don’t understand why they play here. I have never called them any names or cursed at them.  

I tried to break my lease but it would be the next 5 months rent plus an extra month because I do not have a legitimate reason. I don’t have that kind of money right now and it would be just as expensive to hire a lawyer to fight it for me.

196,"I'm 22 and all my life I've only ever cared about how I treated other people and whether or not I was kind, compassionate, honest, and respectful. As I've gotten older my kindness has more often than not been seen as a ""weakness"" by my friends, colleagues, classmates, and even my only (ex) boyfriend. I'm a relatively calm person, but I've found myself increasingly irritated dealing with the ""scorekeepers"" in my life. 

Instead of applauding me on my character, people only seem to applaud me on material things, that to me have no real meaning. It's all about ""impressing"" them and what impresses them is if I am driving, if I have a car, if I'm in a relationship, moreso if I'm married, if I'm traveling, if I'm ""hustling"" with multiple jobs to achieve in this capitalist society etc. This issue has affected literally *all* of my friendships and the one romantic relationship I've had so far. I don't know if it's because of my environment if it's because I have yet to meet genuine people, but the friends I've had in my life don't seem to respect me or think me valuable because I dont have x, y, or z. My ex thought I wasn't ambitious because I wasn't driving/didn't have a car and because I hadn't done what he had done with his life. At the time I was a senior in college and he had graduated and was already working 2 jobs. He valued being busy all the time and thought I wasn't busy enough. He thought I was a pushover and of course he didn't respect me. I considered myself ambitious, but to him and most people, I didn't have the signifiers of ""success"" despite being at an Ivy League college. 

What I'm getting at is that so many people seem to measure my value by my quantity not my quality. The tell me I'm so pretty and sophisticated but I'm not maximizing my potential. Potential for what?----And so when I talk to ""friends"" and a lot of the people I know, all they're concerned about is where I'm working or how much money I'm making. I'm at the point of tears. I'm so exhausted dealing with these people and I  physically hurt. My emotions affect my physical state and I can literally feel my pain hurting my body. I honestly don't know what to do.

197,"I’m 18 and a freshman in college (undecided on a  major) and I don’t know what I want to do with my life. 

My goal is to create something worth while. I want to create something that says something. I love the arts: music, art, literature, film, theater, video games, etc (I especially love things that combine different mediums of art or use mediums in an unexpected way). I love how art/media can make people feel things and communicate narratives. 

But I don’t have any particular skills or experience in any of these areas, and I’m afraid to just jump into something that I’ve never done before. What if I try to pursue something and I’m completely awful at it. To “make it” in any of these fields takes incredible talent, energy, and basically dedicating ones life to the craft and I feel like at 18 I’m already too late to start. Maybe what I want to do is really none of these things. I don’t even know. I crave to create something unique and inspiring. Though even if I did choose a specific field there’s still a high likelihood of failure as there is in creative fields. I envy people who grow up with a passion and follow it and become successful, I just wish I had some direction. 

I wish I had many lifetimes to pursue every one of these art forms but I only have this one life and I feel aimless. What if I can’t even handle doing any of these things? I’ve struggled with mental health my whole life and at times it makes work and school difficult. I’m afraid that that too will hold me back from accomplishing what I want to accomplish in life. 

A part of me is telling myself I should just accept that I probably won’t create anything of value and I should just try to get a normal job and have a normal life and die with regret because there is no other option. I don’t think I can accept that though. Creating something substantial and meaningful seems ingrained into my being.

My fiancé was my brother’s best friend growing up, and we’ve known each other for a decade and a half. We reconnected New Year’s of this year, engaged by mid February, moved in together in March. It was unexpected to be sure, but we couldn’t be more happy; we’re best friends and honestly consider ourselves super lucky to have found each other again. 

That being said! When we initially became engaged we told our closer family and friends we’d probably get married next spring. Then life happened- he underwent a major surgery, one of our pets was incredibly ill and cost us a pretty penny, and recently (after many talks) I decided to make a career change. 

So we decided (again, tentatively) to plan for next fall. Now it feels like we REALLY need to start planning, because that’s just a year out, and tbh it makes me feel frantic. Our parents are willing to chip in thankfully, and I have ideas for various bits of the wedding and even have a cheap but sweet local venue in mind. Our wedding party consists of amazing people who also want to help, but it feels like I’m just having Pinterest boards thrown at me. I even bought a damn planning book, because I’m normally the freaking best at shit like this. 

For this, my super stubborn ass feels defeated. Please. Where do I start. (Also, ps, the FUCK is the difference between save the dates and actual invites and why do I need both??)",12Oct2019,1
205,"I have a coworker, who is an incredibly nice person and a friend to everyone he meets. I’ve worked with him for 9 months now. We’re friendly with each other but we have never hung out outside of work aside from grabbing a drink with coworkers a handful of times after work. During those times I learned  that he’s also a very generous  person and buys a LOT of drinks for people. He’s the type who, If you try to pay for yourself, he’ll go back and forth with you til you agree to let him get it. 

So my birthday was recently. He gave me wine, a very generous gift. I thanked him numerous times for the thought. Several days late he gave me an envelope that he told me to open when I got home. I did and discovered a gift card for several hundred dollars. I don’t mean to sound ungrateful but I just could not bring myself to accept that much money from somebody in the situation that he and I are in, i.e. friendly coworkers. I feel awful but tonight I did return it to him and beg him to accept it and apologized profusely to him, trying to explain why I wasn’t comfortable with it. I know he understands but also I know he was upset. 

I spoke to a friend about it and he says it would be rude to return it and that I probably really bummed him out, going on to say that you should never return a gift. But again I ask, how could I possibly accept that? I certainly didn’t want to do it to be mean but it feels equally as rude to accept something like that from somebody with our context. Don’t return a gift under any circumstances? Would you?",12Oct2019,1

207,"I am currently studying abroad and my mom is not here. We were never close, and Went 1 year without seeing each other (only with her supporting me financially). 

Now, I was home a few months ago. I told her I never wanted to be away that long that I missed her, my sister my dog. 

So she said “don’t worry we will arrange December”. 

It was never arranged. She was always working (she travels a lot for work) always complaining about my siblings when I asked about it, etc. Now tickets are 1000+ euros and I feel too guilty about buying them even though according to her we can afford it. My home currency isn’t that great. 

So yesterday I gave up, after trying over 50 times for it I just gave up. I told her “next time please be more clear so I can make better plans and I have somewhere to spend Christmas”

She said “Ok.” I said “Ok?” She then texted me saying she loved me and messed up. Started calling me to bug the ticket but I just couldn’t let her. She then just said the website was faulty and gave up. 

Now I don’t know what to do, I obviously want to go but I want her to want me to come too. I also want to know if it is financially this is feasible. When I ask I just get bland answers. What would you do? Should I text her about it again? She is ignoring me Rn as usual after something like this.",12Oct2019,1
208,"I understand, before you grab any pitchforks please understand where I am going to be going with this.

A long time ago, I met a man by the name of Anon, now anon was kind of edgy and had this complexion of no other. The more I got to know anon the more I fell in love with him, specifically just how he was in general. Despite complications a t the time, I asked him out. He said yes.

Well, after about a few months due to his depression he decided it was probably for the best to not have a relationship at the time. -Okay, that's fine.-

Except it wasn't.

He later got together with nonA and was having a time of his life, after a year he finally thinks it's his soul-mate. I'm happy for him, and well we plan on moving out with nonA and Anon together at a later date

Except, for the small detail I still have feelings about Anon, I can't move on for whatever reason. At this point, since I have had so many different types of emotional abuse I don't know how to handle this, they're my best friends and they will always be there for me.

So far I've tried other boys, all satisfied me to some degree but I feel like I am missing the person I really fell in love with.

I don't know what to do, and bringing it up to them would be really insulting.",12Oct2019,3
209,"Idk if this is just a release or what. I’ve always been depressed and over meditated on the idea of death and wish it sometimes. But I’m scared of Hell and whatever my brain is used to thinking about after death. I’m also scared it’s “black” like I no longer exist. But at the same time that sounds like a relief. Life is killing me right now and to know it all would end and to not have to exist sounds fantastic sometimes. 

I’m off my depression meds at the moment and everything is falling apart in my life at the moment. I’m going through major change in every part of my life as a 20 yr old. I have little direction I don’t know what the hell is going on. I’m just tired again. I’ve always been tired. 

Will death be a relief one day. Not even trying to sound suicidal. Idk how I’m feeling right now. Death is on my mind more and more and idk where I am in my “faith”. I just want peace. That’s all I fricken want and apparently it’s too much to ask. That’s all I’ve wanted since I was very little. Peace.",12Oct2019,1
210,"Hey guys, tonight is incredibly tough and I feel like I want to just fall apart completely so I thought maybe to ask for some recommendations on what my next steps should be.

A multitude of ongoing events have amplified my depressive state; college stress was causing me to start getting lazier, unhappy all the time and right when I started convincing myself that I was turning myself around, the woman I have trying to become closer with and eventually create a relationship with, finally admitted her mutual feelings and how overjoyed she was, making me the happiest man in the world, only to decide against two days later due to her believing it wouldn’t be healthy for either of us in the long run as she needs to focus on herself before she can commit more of her energy to something like a relationship.

The way we talked about it today made it pretty apparent that we needed to move on and to be honest it’s felt like a harpoon through my chest. I’ve tried to cover up my state by forcing myself to go to a friends birthday party and other social events yet the entire time I’ve been in incredible emotional pain, the kind where you could step away and cry at any given moment but must save face instead. It hasn’t worked. I’ve been set back in my want for a relationship, I’ve wanted to be with the woman for so long and to finally believe that I had succeeded only for it to be yanked away so quickly has thrown my mind into the void.

I don’t have time to step away from school to let myself heal as it’s currently mid-term season and with my mind in the gutter I’m afraid my grades will tank. I don’t know how to deal with all of this as it is so overwhelming. I don’t want to feel so hopelessly depressed, I don’t want my room to get more and more dirty, I don’t want my body to get worse and worse with littler and littler nutrition, and although I am aware that I have listed issues can can simply be answered with “the just do the opposite”, everything piling up causes the biggest lack of motivation and ultimately I don’t know what the next steps should be. I’ve tried to call everyone who is close to me however they find themselves busy with their own lives and I am left here in my room alone to ask the internet for advice.

Please anyone, tell me what I should do to get better, and even if it’s hard, what steps are best for my road to recovery.

TL;DR College midterm season and having my heart torn in two by finally thinking my relationship with this girl would be evolving only for it to completely get dropped has sent me spiraling downwards emotionally and am severely depressed. What steps should I take to get back on track with an emotionally healthy and balanced life?",12Oct2019,1
211,"I live in the US I came from very small tawn know his folk to be very religious catholic, my parents where noting different from the mainstream, as soon when I did hit the puberty at 15 I had strange, feelings emotions and desires focused to be a slave to the male master and having master-slave releishionship 24/7, year ago my parents made my brother leave and give him money for college and stated when u finish college we are done.

213,"22(m)So I’ve started to notice it is near impossible for me to focus on multiple things/responsibilities. If I focus to hard on one particular thing I ignore my other responsibilities. I.e if I need to work harder To make more money (I’m a server/bartender) I will pick up more hours but then neglect my workouts, or my gf, my diet, my school work , etc. And vice versa if I focus to much on my workout and diet ignore work gf etc  and so on...how can I get better at managing everything",12Oct2019,1
214,"Hi Reddit, I'm not too sure where the correct place is to post this so I'm going to post it here and hope that I can get some advice on multiple things, so essentially before I begin I'd like to say that I made this new account because I feel like if I post it on my main account that it would potentially cause some issues in my life. I will be going over why I've gotten to the point of needing to ask for advice and what has led me here as well, apologies if it seems as if I want ""attention"" in no way shape or form am I looking for that I just need to know what steps I can realistically take to move forward with my life.

So essentially my current situation is that I sit at home almost everyday (go outside once or twice every couple of weeks to attend job centre in order to make sure my work coach is happy with what I'm doing to find work, which isn't going so well in my eyes) I've been very isolated by myself even still living with my family, being 20 and a male what I essentially do is play games all day and watch twitch at the same time, wait for 2 friends to come home from work at 8pm-6pm then they head off to sleep after an hour as you can imagine 90% of my time is spent alone nowadays. 

Usually I do go on a game to chat to other people and meet nice new people which has slowly become less compelling to me over time since I've been doing this since I was a kid to make friends around 6 years old this started, it's not really made me any friends that I talk to everyday Infact I met my two best mates online on minecraft when i was around 14-15 creating minecraft servers etc. Overtime I've been becoming more and more lonely being scared to even try attempt another relationship after being cheated on and emotionally/mentally played with by multiple people in the past, the only real reason I feel like I've been okay with being this way up until now is because I kept getting into a relationship straight after another one ending but I stopped that around a year ago, although they were all online relationships as you can imagine that might sound a bit silly to get so messed up about but I suppose long term and long distance really seem like a dream thing to me since It's the only real way I can meet up with a girl to begin with. 

All I really do now is do what I said above and let myself rot away really, I've had an issue since I was a kid I think it began with being bullied really bad for most of my childhood up until I finally moved schools but essentially I was told by a doctor that I mentally don't tick that box ""go to the toilet"" without even knowing it 90% of the time I soil myself (both ways) quite often and so that's also embarrassing as hell but I've learned to slowly take care of that and it's super slowly getting better but not to the point I'm happy about it. I'm super overweight I'd say obese essentially but not to the point where I'm making myself physically unstable, I drink lots of water and rarely coke/fanta occasionally although the recent influx of having my own money has made me want to eat more junky food I've become sick of it now though so I think that the cravings will go away.

I also do desperately look for ways to get work and it's not working at all I can't find a stepping stone or something I can hang onto to climb myself up that mountain that needs climbing, I feel like working will be a big part of getting myself better but I will explain why work is pretty much becoming hopeless for me but I do need to explain a couple of things bad parts of my life so you can get the grasp of essentially what has happened to me over the past 4-5 years.

So around 2016-2015 my last year of school I was about to finally finish school and do my final assessments (GCSE's) which helps you get into the subject you want to study under in university or college, I had gone through quite a lot beforehand as I said earlier the bullying I was also dealing with an abusive father which he went and got mental help with and he was a better father since that point up until my last year of school he had a mental break down and essentially stabbed my mother 16 times and she survived but I was in the house I heard every scream and saw everything you can imagine what impact that had on me and so since it was due mental issues my mother didn't press charges and he got three years in prison, they're still together now and I live in the house with them and he has had his slip ups although he is okay at the moment, I do get anxiety attacks at night whenever I hear him go downstairs early in the morning to get breakfast and essentially get ready to defend my mother I've gone over this scenario in my head many times and It's very unhealthy obviously. 

I pretty much lost my life because of this guy and I don't know if i love my father or just deal with him now, I don't have any grades behind me nor do I have any support now. I did up until i was 18 but it wasn't really support toward a direction of what to do and since then I decided to try do something with my life when I turned 20, I dealt with all of this on my own I did try counselling and going into college but I didn't find talking to someone who wasn't helping me get somewhere helpful and college was just a mess of emotions really. I tried going around 3-4 times and I just couldn't deal with the social environment at the time of being 17.

So to put this mess of a post to a conclusion of what I need to know is, what do I do now for work, in life, socialising?

the most important thing to me right now is work although it'd be nice to know if there is anything you'd suggest, I've tried applying for jobs I qualify for without actual qualifications and I've tried applying for apprenticeships but that's also been a hard time since I don't have any qualifications and people aren't willing to take in someone like me without any qualifications to begin with. I've gone full circle in my work search and now I'm well and truly just giving up and don't know what to do next after so many failed interviews and being lied to. I sit here everyday alone, not showering unless I have an incident, not cleaning myself up and being well and truly bored of my life.",12Oct2019,1

218,"Sorry if this is kind of a long post. Recently i’ve noticed that i’m not as likable as I had thought I was, specially at work. I’m a very open person and im also kind of a talker, I can get a bit annoying but I know when to stop myself. However at work I don’t really have any acquaintances despite working in a very close office and everyone else being friends. I always shucked it up to me being the newer one until the last three months when we got two new colleagues and everyone is practically obsessing over them. I share a close birthday with one of the newer colleagues and despite always getting my colleagues a treat for their birthday (for reference i’ve been there for nearly a year) and on my birthday all I got was a generic corporate card only signed by our executives. However on the newer colleagues birthday ( has been there for two months ) they got her cupcakes, a cake, and a home made card. I also got her something because I don’t like to be petty and I actually get along with her very well and she’s the first close acquaintance I make. I’m very open with my colleagues about any work issues I have and used to ask for help quite a bit when I was newer since this was an entirely new job for me and had an issue with upper management one time due to being yelled at by a superior for simply asking for my check ( Other managers and such took his side ). I’ve also noticed colleagues making plans with each other right in front of me and often times will even ask for my opinion on said plans but will never extend an invitation even though they’re mostly group hangouts. Recently a coworker joked that “No one liked me “ which I know was supposed to be “funny” but I feel like there’s a bit of reality to that, I simply laughed it off and told her “Its ok”. I know this is probably very stupid and I should not judge my character based off these events but it’s very hard not to specially when it’s happening for a year, I pretty much want to know how do I get my colleagues to like me and just how to be all around a more likable person.",12Oct2019,1

220,"This was around late 2013 early 2014. My older brother, who was 24 at the time, used to hang around with a 13 year old girl in our neighborhood. I was 16 at the time and since I was just a kid, I never really gave it a second thought. I remember one day he started bragging about having sex with her and/or doing other sexual things. I called him weird and left it alone for a long time. I mean, I still never looked at him the same way but to me it wasn't life changing. He was still my older brother. Now for the past few years, it's all I could think about when I look at him. I started having this deep hatred for him for millions of other things but this was the only thing that made me despise him the most. 

Today, at my parents' house, we got into an argument and my parents got involved. He tried to put me down and I said, ""say whatever you want, at least I didn't rape a minor."" My parents got mad at me for bringing it up like I was the enemy. My brother then started to say, ""I DONT GIVE A FUCK. SHE SUCKED MY DICK. I LOVE ME SOME YOUNG PUSSY!"". I was mortified, literally loss of words. My parents were right there just defending him because ""I brought up old news.""

I need some help, Reddit. What can I do? I want to report him but my parents will never talk to me again. I can't leave it alone cause it's just eating me up inside. Is it my business?

223,"Hi! So I need help with speaking to my bosses. I am a full time student and part time worker in the school cafeteria as a culinary student worker. I’m in upper division courses now while also helping run two clubs and when I sent my schedule in this year I requested 15 hours a week and have been being scheduled 20 because we are understaffed. I have been working 5 days a week and have class 4 days a week and between both I have 0 days off a week so I’m going 7 days a week with no breaks and I’m absolutely exhausted and burnt out.

I have asked to be scheduled 15 hours a week a couple times and they always say we are understaffed we need you and I always agree but lately if I bring up that I’ve had no days off from school or work and that I’m extremely tired and feeling overwhelmed one of my managers who has 2 children, works 2 jobs and goes to school says that I won’t understand true tiredness until I have children and basically she is saying I’m exhausted so you can deal with it, she also says when I have children I won’t ever have any days off, I’m 20f I’m not having children for a long time if I do have some.

I would never say this but I want to say things like it’s not my fault you had two children with two different men and now you have to work two jobs while going to school that doesn’t mean I should be exhausted, but her saying I should basically suck it up upsets me because I feel invalided for being tired like I’m not as tired as she is so it doesn’t matter. I don’t know how to respond when she says stuff like this be she also says it to all the other students when they bring up being overwhelmed with work and school. 

I love my clubs I am unwilling to quit them because they make me happy and I need time to spend with friends doing mutual activities plus if I was not involved in these clubs I would go from school to work to home and that’s a bit depressing.

I've been friends with these guys for awhile and it seems like she just kind of weaseled her way in. 

The situation between me and her isn't all that great. Truth be told when we broke up I said and did some pretty cringy things. I took it pretty hard. After her new relationship became ""Facebook official"", She messaged me saying: "" I hope you have found some peace in your life"". Me, not wanting to get into with her, only replied with ""thanks for the concern but I'm doing fine"". I'm not sure if that was the best thing to say.

227,"my boyfriend (18) and I (19) have been dating for a year and a half. ive pretty much realized I have to leave him for a multitude of reasons, it’s just so hard to do right now because that’s my best friend. he’s the one I’ve talked to every single day. it’s hard to lose that, and I’m scared to be alone. ive been coming to terms with the fact that he’s done some kinda fucked up stuff to me. he told me a few months after we got together that if we hadn’t started dating at the time we did, he would have killed himself. like he had a plan. and even though he’s never told me explicitly he’d kill myself if I left there definitely have been some implications (I wouldn’t be able to live without you, etc etc). we had a talk the other day and I was honest about the fact that I’m thinking of leaving him. pretty soon after we got together he cut off all of his friends and stopped hanging out with people other than me. he told me it was because they were all “awful people who had a bad influence on him” basically, but I have always encouraged him to have friends and hobbies and just a LIFE outside of me because that’s what I’ve wanted. when we talked the other day, he told me he did that because he thought it was what I wanted. he said he thought I would expect him to prioritize me over everything. even though I’ve told him countless times I don’t. and that he wanted to be my priority. so I lowkey feel like by cutting other people off he was encouraging me to do the same??? throughout our relationship he has been very clingy and demanding of my time, and this has caused me to spend a lot of time with him I’d rather have to myself or with friends because I felt bad. and wanted to please him. I feel like this relationship completely just like. demolished any boundaries I attempted to set bc I wasn’t strong enough. I talked to my therapist about some of this and we agreed he has used me as his only coping mechanism, which has put immense pressure on me. he will bring up the same issues (about himself) over and over and fucking over. and he knows I won’t call him on his shit (or wouldn’t in the past) and tbh I kinda have been an enabler for him doing this so I’ll say the same shit back bc he craves validation that badly. for example, he constantly and goddamn I mean constantly would whine about how stupid he is, how he couldn’t even get into community college. and I’ve told him countless times how smart he is bc he actually is, and that anyone can get into community college. he also had a job at a fast food place (he just quit w no notice too :) so that’s great) and said sooo many times he feared he would be stuck there forever. like I don’t know this relationship has left me so confused and I want out. sry more than anything just could use some more insight and needed a place to vent. sry if this is hard to read I just got off work and I’m exhausted",12Oct2019,1

229,"I apologize in advance if this seems a little confusing or mixed up. I'm sleep deprived right now. I also apologize if this is too long. 

My sons father and I broke up a few weeks ago. It was a mutual breakup but it still hit me really hard. We have an 8 month old son and we had a ton of plans for the future that aren't going to happen anymore. It was a 4 year relationship, and I 100% saw myself marrying him. There was a lot of arguing arising, so we decided, in the best interest of our son, that we should break up and start co-parenting. 
I had to move back in with my parents with my son, plus I'm attempting to finish my Grade 12. I feel like my life is crumbling around me. I've been extremely depressed since the breakup, but I've been doing everything I possibly can to stay positive for my son. Every time I think things are starting to look up for me, life likes to kick me down again. 
My ex recently added his ex-girlfriends and past flings back on Facebook. Now, I don't want to sound like 'The Jealous Ex-Girlfriend' type, but yeah, I was upset. It seemed like he moved on faster than lightning, which really hurt. I understand we broke up, but it just, hurt. A lot. I don't know how else to explain it. 
I changed my settings on Facebook so that we're still friends but I cannot see his posts, which helped a bit. But I still get those stupid 'friend suggestions' of the girls he added. It's like Facebook is purposely trying to sabotage my mental health. 
My relationship with my ex really shaped me into the person I am today. A lot of my interests are stuff he introduced me too.

231,"Hey guys, Like the title somewhat references, I have a MAJOR problem with tounge biting. More specifically, I do it constantly and my tounge is always raw or bleeding from it. When I bite it is more than that. I  trar off small pieces of ky tounge's flesh. It's gotten to the point where I can't even eat or drink anything acidic (citrus, tomatoes, coffee, etc.) I want to stop but I just can't. The way I usually start is by I guess, seeking a part of my tounge that is ""uneven"". I bite off the small pieces my tounge until it is uniform and I feel no bumps or higher places. It hurts after and I can't eat anything hot or spicy either for a few hours. I don't know why I do this, it's kind of like a compulsion and/or addiction at this point. Please, for the sake of my tounge, Has anybody else gone through this and more specifically,  can anyone help me with this?",12Oct2019,1

233,"I just saw my husband stole from my business. I have a small business and net about $40k/year. He wrote 3 checks to himself in the amount of $100 each and forged my signature. I now can't run payroll and run the risk of going inot overdraft. My bunisess account never has that much and it covers expenses and payroll, where I pay myself.

This isnt the first time he took money from me. He took cash before, which I sat down and talked to him about. He never stole from ym business and never forged my signature. I feel so used and violated. 

Realistically, he makes good money (a bit more than me) and gives me most of it to cover bills (bills in my name). He has money, so I dont know why he took mine. If he ran out, he could have just asked right? I  don't think I can get by financially without him.

236,"igh school and my friend was really crushing on his girl but she thought they were best friends 

Anyways she would hangout with him at his house and they were pretty close. One day we were all at a party and she basically asks out this other guy, my friend got upset when he found out and people explained to the girl that my friend had a massive crush on her

The next day she goes to his house to talk it out and explains that she isnt intrested in him but would still want to be best friends. After that they continue to best friends until 2 days later at my friends house , even tho she said she isnt into him, my friend starts kissing her and grabs her ass and moves his hand to her front part while laying on her without asking her , she is in shock and is scared and 8s just frozen until she can get away, 

Later that day he calls me up really excited and saying how smooth he was with out telling me that he did anymore then kissing 

When I found out what happend me and the guy she liked went to his house to confront him

When we get there she was also there crying and getting up him, while her dad was parked in the driveway

He said he was sorry and was saying how he was going to commit suicide,  part of me thinks he actually ment the suicide bit, but I was really suspicious since when we called his family about how he wanted to die (so they can make sure he doesn't follow though) as soon as he answered each family member on the phone he would act way sadder then he was

They took him to the hospital and a few hours later he went home. They dont know what he did.

I hate him right now and so does everyone that knows, I'm not sure if I should be friends with him still because I want to make sure he understands and wont ever do that to another girl, he is really good at playing the victim amd I'm just not sure he is as sad as he says he is and im not sure what to do

I moved back with him (I used to live alone) after we moved to Mexico but realized this was a big mistake. I can’t study and I can’t pick what I want to work in since I have to follow his rules. I plan to move yo the US but only have 1000$ in cash. I was wondering if this is enough to make it?

I was so confused and my voice cracked so embarrassingly when I said, “but I didn’t pay.” It took a moment but he did a half wave and a facial expression that said ‘don’t worry about it’. 

Yeah I know this doesn’t seem like a lot. Especially because the total was a mere $1.50, and I know it’s not right to hit on someone while at their work because it’s a situation they can’t escape and likely makes them very uncomfortable.

The country is Germany, I have noone I know in this town I'm going to work in, except for one man that recommended me at my work place, and he said that he'll help me with anything, which is great. 
Still, however, I'm extremely anxious and also sad for leaving my home, family and friends behind.

I adopted a cat a few days ago as a rescue and she was the sweetest thing; she came from an abused home so the shelter and foster said it would take a while for her to warm up to me. As soon as I brought her home, she went into hiding immediately and i have no idea where she is. I live in a tiny place so there are very few places she could hide, especially because she seems a little chubby (or fluffy, I’m not sure). I’ve checked every place but behind my fridge so she could be there.  My question are: if she were stuck, would she meow for help? Who should I call to move the fridge? Should I even move the fridge? I’m fairly certain she didn’t run away but could she have slipped through a 1inch crack through the door?

I really didn’t want to be poly to be honest, and it’s my fault for agreeing to it. 

After living with my exes I quickly realized I was just a unicorn. The girl I bonded with and her ex were very much in love. They never stopped loving each other. I was just being used and lied to the whole time. I really was in love with the girl I bonded with.

248,"Something I’ve noticed the past year or so that’s become really mentally draining for me is that acquaintances will reach out and text me way too frequently and then will send me nasty or guilt-tripping text messages if I don’t respond to their liking (I’ve been called out for sending brief texts and also for not responding).

I’m 26/F and the acquaintances who text me often are all men ranging from 28 to 34. These are all men that I have no interest in. I say acquaintances as I’m not exactly interested in developing friendships with them because the clinginess is such a turn off and I’m not sure a real friendship would even be possible. They simply have my phone number from either high school or some special occasion in recent years (like meeting through a work friend, etc.). Despite my turning down every single time they ask to hangout, they still continue to text. 

I have a few close friends. We don’t really text big conversations. We call each other to talk, or we get together rather often and spend time with each other. I’m extremely grateful for my close friends who I feel genuinely comfortable and open with, and we respect each other’s boundaries.

The problem that I have is when someone who I don’t even have a friendship established with finds it okay to bombard me with texts, literally sometimes it’s 20 text messages, sometimes it’s drunken phone calls or face times at midnight, sometimes it’s a combination. Then I don’t respond because I’m busy, or because I just don’t feel like responding (especially when it’s 5 people trying to communicate with you at the same time), and then the nastiness comes out. One guy called me out for posting to my fucking Instagram story (business account) before responding to his text, telling me I’m extremely rude. Another guy will send me a fucking photo of him driving by the road I live on. Another dude simply continues to text random shit to me. As I’m writing this I’m swearing more because it makes me so upset. I feel so uncomfortable with telling someone that they’re bothering me, because when I have done that, in fact to one of these guys last year, they lash out at me and call me some vulgar name. I told a guy I wasn’t interested in him (the 34 year old) and he said you don’t have to say it like a cruel bitch.

So my question is mainly, how do you AVOID these situations? How do you deal with them? I don’t want to be a bitch but I’m at a point where I’m just ignoring people to try and give them the message but in the event that they get defensive and try to start a fight over it, I want to know how to stand my ground.

TLDR; I feel extremely overwhelmed with people constantly wanting to have long conversations over text, then getting pissed off when I don’t respond, not sure how to handle these situations going forward.",12Oct2019,1

251,"So it's my roommate's birthday weekend. We invited over his two sisters, his girlfriend, two of my friends, and our third roommate invited over a couple people.

Towards the end of the night, everyone aside from his girlfriend had left. Our third roommate got too drunk, to the point where I had to carry him, now passed out, to bed. Something around this point absolutely triggered the birthday roommate, although I'm not entirely sure what did. As he went into what I'd personally consider some type of blacked-out panic attack or something, he started freaking out for the next hour. Long story short: He punched/kicked maybe 8 holes in the wall, kicking in our two bathroom doors and his bedroom door (breaking them completely), lunged MY loveseat at HIS tv, damaging both in the process, flipped my coffee table/end tables, which resulted in carpet damage, and (I don't think intentionally) pushed his girlfriend pretty rough to get her out of his path of rampage a few times.

The point here is... I don't know what to do. He's calm and I got him to sleep finally, but our apartment is absolutely trashed.. we paid a very expensive ($6,000) security deposit which I'm not sure we'll be able to get back, and I'm worried about the rest of the lease, as it's only been 2 months out of 13 so far. We're college students and his father is very wealthy, so I was considering using him to repair/pay for the damages, but I also kind of want to know how I can legally change my living situation earlier than 11 months from now, or save my own ass in terms of the security deposit.

She understands she’s depressed and is in the process of getting anti-depressant medication supposedly. She divorced my father a few years ago. Her previous relationship lasted a year however she ended it on the suspicion the guy was cheating. After they broke up she gradually started to think he was watching her or accessing her phone and computer remotely.

I don't want to make a really long post so I'll sum it up as best I can. The gym I go to used to employ a personal trainer around 2017. Apparently he saw me there one day wearing sandals (he has a foot fetish) and decided to go into the gyms system to get my number. I can only gather this much because after hours of texting back and forth with this guy he finally admitted where he knew me from. He knows my first and last name, phone number, what i look like and apparently still works out at the gym. And he's seriously attracted to my feet.

I was out of the country all of 2018 so i don't know if he had messaged me before. The first time he contacted me was in February of 2019. I ignored it and erased the text thread, but a few days ago he started back up and i decided to get to the bottom of it.

Needless to say, I'm not interested in his propositions ( he offered money in exchange for foot play).

When I googled my phone number I was terrified to find my home address is attached to my telephone number.

&amp;#x200B;

I need HELP:

How do I deal with this guy? I told him I wasn't interested and I was in a relationship but he seems relentless. I'm worried that simply blocking him might make him more obsessed.

&amp;#x200B;

What do I tell the gym? I plan on going there and speaking with management tomorrow. They use client's phone numbers to check them in, and sometimes the employees just have you read them outloud to them. Not hard to memorize someone's phone number when they check in.

&amp;#x200B;

How the FRICK do i detach my phone number from my home address in google searches?! Why is it even there in the first place?

Should I be more worried? I'm honestly a little tickled by this whole thing because as weird as this is - sucking on toes is just hilarious to me.

279,"I went to Poland for one week and I took a taxi from Chopin airport to Warsaw old city. The taxi charged me 60 zloty but I had no cash so I paid with VPAY. I paid through his terminal (I just saw 60) and he gave me a receipt from the payment. I just realise now (one week later) that he charged me in euro. So I paid 60 euros (260 zloty) instead of 60 zloty. Is there any way I can get my money back ? 

I know I should have checked the bill at the time but I was in rush and I naively thought I could trust taxis from Warsaw. I also don’t think it was an error from the taxi driver. I’m sure he made it on purpose and this kind of behaviour makes me completely lose confidence in Polish taxi services. For sure I'll go with Uber next time (and they are like 3 times cheapier).",12Oct2019,2
280,"So last month I've gone through a breakup that was basically out of nowhere, which was kind of a massive delusion, but generally I try to stay positive and did what I could to entertain myself, like hanging out with friends etc. I was prescribed xanax for one week to deal with my anxiety but had the absolute douche idea to stop after four days, then obviously had a relapse and took it again for a couple of days. Immediately after that episode I tried to get into art school, and at the exam this guy from the committee hated my work for some reason, and was overrall extremely rude to me. I got in anyway to my surprise however my self esteem had already been crushed all over again. Since this made my insomnia worse I started taking melatonin pills, they worked wonderfully but I began having horrible nightmares that ruin my entire day. Tried getting rid of melatonin, I fall asleep earlier now but the nightmares are even worse. Yesterday was maybe my worst day so far, basically had constant anxiety, forgot I had class until very last minute, little to no motivation. I can think rationally and tell myself it ain't so bad, that there's no reason to be sad, still I feel like all I want to do is stay in bed and do nothing at this point. I'm sooo tired. I don't know what's happening to me.

tl;dr had a heartbreak and a career-related delusion, been feeling like shit for a month because I get nightmares every night, meds didn't do much and I'm losing my motivation.",12Oct2019,1
281,"Hey guys not sure if this is the correct place, I just kinda need advice on this subject as my parents have just told me I'm going to die with debt and find a job I like without getting a BA..

I recently graduated with a certificate from college in early education, I've gotten 5k debt from that, however, I dont pay this back until I earn over 25k per year which is pretty much impossible due to the fact pay in childcare isnt the most well paid and right now I make &lt;17k yearly. 

I've decided I cant see myself doing this in the future and thought for many months about what I wanna do, I went through a lot of stress and research, most of what I wanted would take 10 years (clinical psychologist), I'm also going to Canada on a WHV next year so shaving 2 years off study.

I think I've finally found what I want, Graphic Design, my reason being that its creative, I enjoy art and I feel like my mind has ADHD when I try to study from books and read tones being creative let's my mind do this and I enjoy creative things, it would be new projects all the time etc

Anyway my biggest issue is the cost.. it's not funded by my country, I'm in Scotland this Course is in England so I need to take out a private student loan, the course is around 4 years but you pay 3 levels, £4.5k so £13.5k total.. to repay that they take £5 every month and 3 months after graduation, then its £300 a month in repayments with the interest could be closer to 15/16k.. 

I'll be doing this for the next 2 years whilst working in canada (I'm able to do this as its online) but I will be working full time. Also after those 2 years idk what I will do, would I be able to make my life there would I need to go home? It's an immense amount of stress but i want to start my life..

The debt is turning me off.. any advice?",12Oct2019,1
282,"Hey guys, so a month or so ago I went back to an old dead-end job I used to have previously just for some extra cash. The night I came back, I had to train a new employee, who goes to school at the local university, but lives a considerable distance from this school. 

I’m super into trail running and what not, and coincidentally she is staying with her sister and brother-in-law, who are pretty big into that scene. I know her brother-in-law pretty well, having ran with him a few times in the past.

So in addition to that, we have quite a bit else in common and get along very well and she makes work actually fun. We made plans to hangout soon, but the only problem is next semester she will be studying abroad, plus we are limited on the time we work together left due to Thanksgiving/Christmas break/etc. By the time she comes back, I will have graduated college and am unsure where I will be at that time.

I really like her, but things have happened so fast and there’s not a whole lot of time with. Some of my friends tell me it’s dead in the water, while others say to keep trying despite the circumstance.

So I made the last place, although I could (and should) have been the best of the group. All the recent training and time seems kind of wasted.

Whenever I see someone my size or even bigger that seems confident, happy, etc I can't help but to.... hate them? I feel jealous. I'm mad at them because it seems as if they have their life figured out, like they're completely fine with who they are and what they look like.
It bothers me. Everything about them bothers me. When they're not sweating at all, when they have no problem wearing short sleeves and short pants and be revealing, when they have no problem eating in public, when they don't mins being the center of attention - I fucking hate it.

297,"I don't really know how to start this off but I'll just write and see what happens. I'm not doing well at all I'm depressed all the time. Currently I'm not working I lost my job when I missed work being in the hospital for a suicide attempt. I'm living with my mom atm and my mom a massive alcoholic. Like 140liters of wine since mid August when I started to count. 36 of which has been in the last 3 weeks since she went to the hospital for a week due too alcohol related illness. Shes been like that my whole life. Abusive aswell shes given me 3 concussion in my life and I've stop counting years ago how many times shes punched or kicked me in the balls, or tried to break my arm. Cause shes the ""alpha"". Shes at the point were she just lies in bed drinking from the wine bag. I've saved her life a couple times when shes thrown up while passed out. She has a dog which was my step dads who passed away 5 years ago. A bulldog named Sarah who's been super pampered but now that shes not being pampered anymore recently. She barks incredibly loud or just scratches my door for no reason at all hours of the night and my mom is passed out through it so I take care of it. And i cant fall back asleep so i only get 2-3 hours of sleep a day. No one cleans the house so I make sure everything is clean. No one cooks either so I make all the meals. I had a dog but he passed 4 months ago. I've been living here for a year now. Before that I lived at my dad's gf house while working for a year and a half. This was also really bad time cause at my job my boss constantly fucked with me and would call me fat and bunch of other stuff including fucking with my hours and the amount of work I had to do. After this I'd finish at 1 am and come home but be locked out cause dads gf would not unlock the one of 4 locks on the door that can only be unlocked from inside. She refused to do so and I have to wait tell my dad got home 30 min later. She would also get up at 6 am and would open my door then slam It closed waking me up or stomp on the floor knowing i was asleep right below her. While i was there i tried to support myself rent, food, everything to not be a burden there. My dad wouldn't let me pay rent saying "" your my son, save your money"" and would pay my part of the rent but I bought my own food. Which she would constantly throw out. I got fed up with this and got a mini fridge for my room. She responded with I'm not allowed to use any cooking equipment in the house. My dad said dont argue with her tell him and he will deal with it, it never worked. I eventually just ordered a pizza after work every night as my dinner and breakfast the next morning. Eventually I quit the job cause the restaurant was closing plus fuck my boss I couldn't handle it anymore. She kicked me outta the house the next day. She never wanted me to live there stating the landlords would raise there rent or kick them out cause I lived there so when ever they would come she would say "" stay downstairs and turn off the lights and shut up or run our the back and dont come back for 2 hours"" I never did, i met the landlords when i moved in they were nice people and knew i lived there. All in all costed about 13k in pizza and thrown out food and mini fridge. Didnt help I had to miss work for 2 months while I was living there cause I ended up getting mugged one night after work on my way home and got a bad concussion.

 
I moved in cause in 2016 I went to college for culinary. I ended up getting kicked out for bad attendance after the first semester. Cause classes started at 7am finish around 5pm then work from 6pm to 1:30 am get home at 2am and try and eat or just pass out were my mom being drunk would almost like clock work 3-4am come down and punch me in the dick while I was sleeping yelling at me to order her food or make it. I'd say no and she get really pissed off and walk away calling me a worthless piece of shit son. Thay burned me out really quick. My friend also got cancer and another committed suicide during this time and that fucked me up. My mother was also saying she was really sick and was most likely gonna die really soon and that worried the hell outta me. I met a girl at college who I was really into but didnt wanna pursue cause i was 22 virgin and fat so confidence really low and honestly I saw from a God damn mile away what would be the answer. But this guy at college was like naw man you got this you'll be fine. Welp went how I thought it would and he started to go out with her and would always grab her ass or make out with her while starring at me so eventually I just skipping classes. After that new year and my birthday. Had quit my job cause my boss was being hella racist to me and nothing being done so fuck it. New years night my mom ended up giving me a concussion cause I gave her crap cause the cops came cause there were reports that there were noise disturbances cause she and her drinking buddie up the street lit firecrackers and ran up the street saying the niggers are coming the niggers are coming. My birthday came around and well my birthday sucks nobody from college cared my friends didnt say anything. And to my mom its not the day I was born it's the day she gave birth to me so shes massively bitches of she doesn't get dinner or presents. After getting kicked out I did nothing for 2 months just sleeping all day getting hit in the dick and dealing with mom and trying to get over shit. Eventually moved out to dads gf. 

Like I'm at the point of fuck man i dont know what to do. I'm 25/m 350lbs, still a kissless virgin,dead broke, majorly depressed and thoughts of suicide are daily and many. I cant get the girl outta my head no matter what I do and it bugs me that I still think of her and that I should be over her and really wish I was and could move on. I've tried to be into other women to same success. I cant focus on anything anymore. Any new job I self sabotage I feel and lose it. I got no friends and I talk to only my mom and dad cause there the only ones who will talk back. The first 20 years of my life is just honestly more of this crap. I'm furious, I'm sad to the point of tears everyday, I dont think I can do anything. I fall asleep 9am wake up at 12pm give my mom her meds, clean the house, walk the dog, make lunch for dad for work the next day. Apply to jobs and then make dinner then try to be productive, then try to fall asleep and cant so I lie in bed for hours trying and can never. Idk what to do I've been on anti depressants and those suck hard. I see a councilor but it doesn't really help.

301,"TLDR: My 34 year old single sister insists that I go on a vacation with her but I don't like this idea. If I refuse to do it I am told that I'm selfish.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 24 year old female and I'm single. I have a 34 year old sister - let's call her Sally - who is also single (she has divorced several years ago). My sister likes travelling but:

a) she doesn't like and doesn't want to do it alone

b) apart from me and our parents she doesn't have anybody whom she could travel with.

So Sally has this habit of making me go with her, and by saying ""making me go"" I mean she and my mother keep insisting that I go with her until I give up. This is what my whole post is basically about.

&amp;#x200B;

I had gone on vacation with my sister a few times but later I refused to do it if only two of us would be going. Now Sally goes on a vacation with me and our parents. I guess my sister would be more or less ok with going on a trip only with our mother but then she feels obliged to also take our father so that he wouldn't feel left out, even though neither my mother nor my sister get along with him too much. I'm still expected to go with them, maybe it's because my presence might be changing the group dynamics for a little better or because families usually spend vacations together and it would be strange if I stayed at home. It's not exactly that I hate spending vacations with my family but I think that I would prefer solo trips, at least from time to time.

So I used to spend a week or two on a trip with my sister or with my sister and parents, but, since I was a university student, I had a long summer break so I could ""afford"" it. However, now I will start working and I would like to spend my free time the way I want it. If the next year I refuse to go on a vacation with my family they will be upset about it and they will say that I'm selfish or asocial.

&amp;#x200B;

I think that I should shed some light on why this situation is like that.

I'm an extreme introvert (maybe kind of a loner) and a homebody and my idea of perfect vacation is either to go somewhere alone or stay at home. Additionally, I don't seem to enjoy my sister's company. She is generally a nice person but I guess we aren't really on the same wavelength so I don't think that I will ever again go on any vacation if only two of us would be going. My sister is single now and she has no friends close enough to go on a trip with them. I'm one of very few options of company for her and that's why she always insists that I should go with her.

I feel that Sally's strategy of spending holiday won't change, I guess she expects me to always accompany her. I do understand her sad position but I also want to have fun, in my own way, and that excludes her. A game changer would be a situation when either she or me find a boyfriend. In the first scenario she would finally have a travel companion and in the second scenario she would figure out that now I have my own adult life and it's natural that I want to spend my vacation with my boyfriend and without her. Nevertheless, it's unlikely that either of it happens.

&amp;#x200B;

QUESTIONS

Would it be selfish if I started to spend my vacation alone? I mean, then my sister would probably go just with our parents but she wouldn't like it as much.

Should I make an arrangement of ""this year I spend my vacation the way I want to and the next year I go with you even though I don't want to""? May I go on a solo vacation every year?

Sally likes organised swing package vacations – or however it is called? – and she can afford them. I am thinking about such a vacation where travel agency ferry people around from one place to another and show them all the important places. She could go on this kind of vacation without me: she would be among people then, but alone nevertheless. She doesn't like this option. What do you think about single people who take part in such organised vacation? If you took part in such a trip and went alone would you feel strange and lonely since most/many people there are usually couples?",12Oct2019,1

They switched up last minute saying i should do it because my brother was nervous but I was pissed and didn’t take it well

I opted not to go to the pre dinner thing and met them there and the dinner was weird, expensive, and the girlfriend, though nice, was rude and said stupid shit

In the uber back I told them she sucks and they said that they support her regardless and I called them naive and said some shit she said some of  which probably really hurt my parents, things about how they look funny and old

We got into it, I was pissed so I went to the club to listen to music, at the club I met some cool people but really thought the whole time what the fuck was I thinking, it was so rude of me to do that and they’re trying to be best to be accepting and I’m being self centered and hurtful, and I’m hurt, but I was anxious, overwhelmed, and snapped, doesn’t excuse what I did nonetheless

I went home and am going to sleep but trying to decide whether to be apologetic, swallow my pride and hang with the, or apologize and then do things I want to do alone, or just leave early in the morning and do my own shit without worrying, I don’t know what to do because I feel awful but some of that is brought on by being with them so much

306,"I'll try to keep this brief. Several years ago I bought myself a universal TV remote that I used occasionally to troll my wife by clandestinely changing the channel or volume when she was watching it. She always assumed it was a problem with the TV and watching her get irritated from it was a source of amusement (I'm aware this reflects poorly).

I nearly got caught a few times so didn't use it for a while to let the heat go down. Have started again recently and now my wife has began to suspect it might be an angel. She thinks it is a guardian angel kind of deal and has began to tell stories to our daughter (young enough that she loves the stories and finds them magical) about the guardian angel that guards the house.

I had always intended to eventually reveal that the random channel/volume changes were really me having fun and let her in on the joke but now I'm not so sure.

311,"Background:
-I'm F/18.
-From a large family where every member has/had a problem with drugs, abuse, and crime
-Family has been poor my entire life
-I had to become an ""adult"" early on 
-I have OCD, Anxiety, Depression, and an eating disorder (all professionally diagnosed)
-""White Sheep"" of my family (excelled academically, graduated with honors, never did drugs, never been arrested)
-I am my worst critic, I will tear myself apart faster than anyone else 

My senior year of highschool (2017-2018) my eating disorder and depression/anxiety got to its worse. My weight dropped to under 80 pounds (5ft 2in) and my performance in school suffered. I finally sought help from a Psychiatrist and Therapist, that with addition of medication greatly improved my mental and physical health. 

After graduation I noticed pain in my right ankle, and brushed it off. I began college (Fall 2018), I was pursuing a degree in Pastry in my college's Culinary Academy (basically all of the classes you are cooking/baking). I loved it, food is my passion. But as the semester went on the pain in my ankle spread to all my joints, it became debilitating. I consulted 7 doctors, all said there is something wrong but they don't know what, and the worst ""I can't help you"". I had to get disability status at my college because it was affecting my performance, I felt so ashamed and defeated. 

As I entered the next semester my condition just got worse, to the point I had to sit in the back while everyone else was cooking on the line. 

As the semester came to the close I was excited, my next course during the summer would be baking, it was the class I was looking forward to all year. Unfortunately, I did not have the money in time to pay for tuition (I did not qualify for Financial aid and my Father was helping me pay previously). I tried to look on the bright side and figured I could work more to save more for next semester.

There is a local Pastry shop that had been hounding me to work for them for months so I finally gave in. I thought if I work full time for them and part time at my other job (Barista/3 years) I could finally save up money. 

I started working at the pastry shop and I loved it, I was tasked with shaping all of the breads and decorating. But as the weeks went on working there my health worsened, it didn't help that my boss was very demanding and sometimes demeaning to me. After working there for 2 months, I ended up in the hospital after I had a mental breakdown that resulted in a suicide attempt. The day I went back to work I quit because my boss was shaming me for being in the hospital and missing work. I felt like shit, I loved that job but it was not healthy.

I returned to working regular hours at the coffee shop, everyone there is like my second family and they have always been very understanding. At the coffee shop my bosses are husband and wife, the husband is an asshole and is always making the workers feel like shit. The wife on the other hand is loved by everyone. 

As time went on I did more testing and saw more doctors. It turns out I am allergic to everything and my immune system is incredibly suppressed. Heres the kicker, I'm allergic to wheat, WHEAT! I want to be a Pastry chef, and the food I want to make makes me sick (Also explains why my health worsened working in a pastry shop). I also found out I had a deviated septum and had surgery (2 weeks ago). 

The first couple days after surgery were brutal, and I was scheduled to work a few days after that. I decided to take a week off, but after that I rushed back to work because I know they are very short handed (I hate to disappoint people and not pull my weight). I am still recovering from surgery, on top of all my other health issues, so my body is all out of whack.

I was scheduled to work at 8 am every day this month. So to the best of my ability I go to work, I ended up being late 3 days in a row. Which I know is unacceptable and I feel like an asshole trust me. But as the clock strikes 1 my male boss ask to speak to me in the back and says ""You have been late three times, you are off the schedule for a month"". The wife hugs me and I go in the back closet and cry before leaving (I did not want customers to see). 

Now I am out of a job, I am unable to work basically every job, I can't work in the field I want, and I can't attend school. I'm a person that needs to keep busy, I can't sit idly by and watch life pass. Ontop of that my mental health is garbage, my suicidal ideations are back in full force. 

I'm at the end of my rope. Everything I strived for and worked hard to obtain, feels completely out of reach. Do I even have a Future? I don't have money to fall back on (I'm even in debt), my family can't support me financially (being sick is very expensive), I'm not able to function like a normal person, I don't have any friends, and the list goes on. 

I don't know what to do.",12Oct2019,1

314,I am extremely tight with my best friend of around 6 years and we are facing our senior year of high school together now. she’s had some struggles with depression and mental health. i have always been a good friend have been there for her. she was doing extremely well lately until school started. we were at a football game last night and she said something kind of rude to our guy friend and he snapped at her. later i look over and she’s crying and then runs away to the bathroom so i follow. she says it was her meds and drinking and the huge crowd made her freak. i have to comfort her and support her. this kind of stuff happened all junior year but now i am getting tired of it. i UNDERSTAND she can’t control certain things but it’s getting to the point where i just want to be able to enjoy myself instead of having to comfort her all the time. it’s very tiresome being a good friend. but i feel like lately i don’t get to enjoy myself at anything becaus something always happens with her. does it make me a bad person for not really wanting to have to put up with it anymore? :(,12Oct2019,1

i’m going through some internal conflict where i just don’t believe in my (muslim) faith anymore for a host of reasons. 
While my family isn’t super religious, they would be devastated and i’d be totally ostracized by my extended family if they found out i’m having these thoughts. I feel super guilty when my mom or someone in my family asks me to ‘have faith in God’ and ‘Pray, God’s always here for you’ because i just don’t believe that anymore. At the same time i’m struggling to let go of the idea of God and keep thinking of the what ifs.

323,"Not much to tell.

We have been classmates for a year now and we hang out here and there. One thing everyone, and I mean everyone in class has noticed is his lack of personal hygiene. He smells, his breath smells (even though he is that dude in class that always has chewing gum), his clothes smell and are dirty too, his face and hands are unwashed, his hair is greasy... there is a lot. But when I say he smells, boy does he smell. It has gotten to the point where I could be standing 5 meters away from him  and it would still be unpleasant. For the whole junior year of high school he was told jokes about his smell from other people, but I guess he never saw it as a real issue. I am not going to lie, he is a bit on the bigger/chunkier side, so I am guessing it is hard for him to shower because of that. But then again, it seems like he showers once a week or 2, 3 times a month, not ever other day like he should. I mean, we are teens, we are hitting puberty and it is hitting us back harder, we should shower every day and keep our hygiene in order. And he doesn't have issues with money or such things, I visited him once and ngl his parents earn a lot of money.

I just don't know how to approach him about the matter at all. I really want to tell him to start caring about it because rumours are starting to spread around and I hate it. It would be selfish not to say anything, but it would be rude to tell someone they stink.

But my depression just got worse once I hit 18 and couldn't afford psychologists on my own. I was still going to high school back then. It was my last year, but because of all the emotional stress at home and my depression, I didn't pass. At this point I was at the lowest times of my life. I really had no motivation in anything and a few months later someone I looked up to committed suicide because of depression. I just had no motivation in anything back then.

So I've been at this job for about 6 weeks now. I transferred from a store in my hometown. I'm now living with one of my friends, who comes into the store often to say hi, get a drink, or bring me something if I've forgotten it. I have this coworker, call her M, who has acted weird as fuck with me from the jump, asks me a ton of personal questions every time I see her and generally makes me feel uncomfortable like she's up to something. But i show up to work and leave nonetheless.
The other day, roomie and I stopped in to get some lunch. M took our order. Afterwards while we sat and ate, distanced from the staff, my roomie starts making jokes about how the people working weren't having enough fun/'getting lit' etc. He's just fucking around bc we used to ghetto jobs on the west side lol and everyone here was really focused. Not a bad thing tho, I didnt think he was even loud enough to be heard, but apparently M was eavesdropping. 
The first time we went in there he heard one of my coworkers yell 'Unique girl switch it over!!!' and tap her headset. And him and I are the type of gays to hear something funny and literally never let it go so to this day he still repeats it sometimes. So he started saying shit like where the hell is unique I know shed get lit with us (lol he doesnt even know her and has never seen her he was just fucking around, i hope im articulating this well) and when I came back to work yesterday, M had a lot of questions about it? Asked me if roomie likes unique, I didnt get what she meant so i was like yeah lol, he wants to kiki with her. She started acting weird and saying how odd it was that he is into unique and doesnt know her. I said no no fam not like that, he is gay and was just playing. But she wouldnt let up and kept insisting he was like a creep and a stalker...and went back and told unique that my roommate has a fixation on her and thinks shes beautiful and that I was too embarrassed to tell her myself??? Just framed it really weirdly...and made my roommate seem like a whole pervert. So when I got home and told homeboy about this he immediately called the girl and asked why she wanted to slander a god fearing man like himself (LOL.) Threatened to call our GM, said he wanted her job, etc. So now I work with her in an hour and im terrified for whats gonna happen or what she will say. But i feel like I didnt do shit? My roommate shouldn't have called bc its putting my job in jeopardy but also hes valid for not wanting a whole stalker accusation on his back right?
I just have no idea what to say to her when i go in today. I'm so afraid of losing my job bc of stirring the pot.

But my depression just got worse once I hit 18 and couldn't afford psychologists on my own. I was still going to high school back then. It was my last year, but because of all the emotional stress at home and my depression, I didn't pass. At this point I was at the lowest times of my life. I really had no motivation in anything and a few months later someone I looked up to committed suicide because of depression. I just had no motivation in anything back then. I knew if I pushed myself too much that I would probably do the same. So even though I didn't have my high school diploma yet, I took a year to stabilize my mental health if possible. I promised my mom to only take the exams and study on my own to get my diploma and she was fine with it. After a year of trying to recover my mental health and a year taking exams and not passing them, I realised I have to go back to school, cause I wasn't able to do it on my own. The thing is I was pretty much older than the rest of the students at this point. I thought to myself that I shouldn't care about it. I just had to receive my diploma and carry on with my life. I was at this point the most suicidal I've been though, but I wanted to carry on cause I wanted to help people like me, and the person I looked up to, cause I know how unbearable things can get. I really still want to help people out. So this year I started the last year of high school again. So this is already the 4th year that I'm trying to finish school.

And the reason I've never told my parents about my depression is because they are very religious. Especially my mom. I know she would blame it on the fact that I'm not praying to God every day and that I've been really out of touch with our religion the last years (I actually don't believe in ""our"" religion anymore). I know for a fact that she'd force me to pray and remind me of how blessed I should feel cause God gifted me with this life (I didn't even ask for). I know it for a fact cause when the person I looked up on committed suicide, and when I went to her for some consolation just once in my life time, that was all what she'd told me about him. That it was because he had no faith in God that he dared to commit suicide and I shouldn't feel sad about it cause God wouldn't like that.

It's already really hard to struggle with my depression on my own, and convince myself to stay alive and carry on while also dealing with an unstable family and dealing with the fact that I'm going to school with a bunch of teenager that doesn't really understand my situation. My mom has been complaining about how useless, self-righteous, lazy and what not I've been for the past two years to my aunt already and she still keeps bringing it up. I already know that I'm disappointing and that it is also a shame that I still didn't get my high school diploma yet, but I'm trying my best. I'm trying my best but no one knows. It's really hard not to give up sometimes and a constant reminder at home isn't helping my case at all. I really wish she would stop talking about me but I don't know what to do....",12Oct2019,1
354,"TL;DR: people I don't like that don't like me are playing nice and constantly saying hi to me if I or one of them is passing by. I don't want to say hi back because of personal reasons.

So I'm currently living with my family in a suburban area. We've lived here for maybe two years when I was little, we moved back to the city and, maybe five years ago, we moved back here again.

In the first two years of living here, we've experienced all kinds of, well, bullying.
We were never a religious family and everyone around us here is, so you could imagine how that turned out. We were insulted, abused, threatened and they did things to us like throw fireworks at our house and our dog (later they even killed him - there wasn't really evidence, but he did disappear, we never found him and some kid did say it was true, plus we had every right to believe it was true especially after being treated the way we were AND cherry on top, the one that (supposedly) did kill our dog, owns a gun), the same person that harmed my dog threatened my mother that he was going to cut off her head, one kid threw a rock in my face and I was bleeding like crazy, being pulled by my hair and pushed if I don't buy them potato chips in the store, I was pulled by my ears in class even by the teacher that worked there, just to name a few.

And now, years later, after we moved back here, they all started to act polite. Saying hello everytime they would see us, making small talk, etc. I don't think they changed, but even if they did, I will never get over what they've done to me and my family. 

I do say hi back, but I want to stop. I don't feel the need to look at these people. I don't feel the need to say hi back. Does that make me a bad person?",12Oct2019,0
355,"I met this guy in 8th grade and we became friends because we were sitting next to each other,no other reason.If we weren’t forced to be with each other,then we never interacted.We got on pretty well though.We got into the same high school and we are in 10th grade now.We haven’t properly spoken to each other in two years because we are in different classes,on different floors.Recently an earthquake happened in my city,it wasn’t serious but everyone got out of the school building and the students were told to wait outside until the school buses arrived.Our schoolyard is quite big,so everyone was hanging out with their friends,just chilling.I spotted this friend of mine by himself and decided to go sit next to him.We did some catching up,and I stated how frustrated I was because we couldn’t spend time together anymore,and that we had grown apart even more.I told him I was scared and hesitant to go up and talk to him because I didn’t know how much he enjoyed talking to me and that I thought that I liked him more than he liked me.He said “How do you know? Maybe I don’t show it?”.About a week after when we got out of school,he came up to me to say hi.I asked him if he wanted to spend more time with me,and he asked me how.I offered to hang out outside of school sometime,nothing too serious,anywhere and anytime he was available (Some details so you can understand the situation better : This guy is fucking gifted in maths,he loves it and studies very hard on it.He is interested in science,any branch.He likes and does sports, and reads a lot.But he only reads to improve himself,to broaden his horizons.Meanwhile I,a romantic person, am interested in art,film,literature,architecture,music,languages,basically any kind of artistic and cultural area,I am an abstract thinker?Like I daydream all the time?I only seek feeling and not understanding?.I am also academically successful,especially in physics,but I haven’t been paying any attention to school for a few years now because of depression.I wanted to have a career in astrophysics,but I have given up on it.So our interests are quite different,but we are congenial.The way our minds function and the way we see the world is very similar.I don’t think I have ever met anyone else who speaks as wisely as he does.).I knew he played tennis and football,especially tennis, intensely.He said he had his tennis course,that that took most of his time,and that he wanted to play mobile games in his remaining free time.I told him to be honest,that he should say it clearly if he didn’t want to spend time with me.”Don’t make excuses,just say it if you don’t want to hang out”.He didn’t give a clear answer,just shaked his head and said “I don’t like spending time outside”.Then we had to separate because the school buses were about to leave.

So this is my conclusion : He has many friends he talks to in school,they are all smart people and have common interests with him.But he doesn’t spend any extra time with them,he also does very well on his own,which is exactly me.I wouldn’t give up my solitude for anyone,except him.I don’t have friends,because I don’t want to.I got used to being alone and now I realize it takes too much effort and energy to interact with people.I didn’t meet anyone else like him,and I want us to be closer,I don’t want to lose touch with him.I am willing to do whatever it takes,but it seems like he doesn’t feel the need to have friends.He does not value friendships,he doesn’t show or talk about how he is feeling with anyone.He closes himself up,and I think I am the only friend he has who wants to change that about him.I want to make him listen to beautiful music,I want him to cry while watching the sunset..Should I push him,force him a bit more,to get a proper answer out of his mouth? Should I tell him to let his soul surface,to let his heart ache (I love Tame Impala)? 

If I come across him in school,I plan on saying “Hey,I know you said you didn’t have time,but if you liked me enough you could always make time for me,but we are not that close,and I understand that.But we still have more we could learn about each other,you could decide if you like me or not after getting to know me deeper,better.If you still don’t want to,I won’t force you.But at this rate,we probably won’t go any further than saying hi and good evening to each other.Do you want to lose what we have or not?”.Should I tell him all this?",12Oct2019,3

360,"Greetings everyone, hope you are all well.

The past years there has been a pretty big family problem I'm dealing with and I've come to a dead end regarding how to deal with it.

See, I'm the youngest out of 3 children in family. My brothers are a lot older than me, about 15 years difference , making me the runt of the litter. Growing up I didn't have a lot of experiences or quality time with them since they had to be away for their studies, work etc.

6 years ago I also left for my studies and graduated 2 years ago. After that, I moved back to my parents' as a temporary measure and search for a job (keep in mind the town I live in is awfully small and there are not many opportunities here). I managed to get hired in a pretty ok job with the aim to gather some money before I have to leave again for my mandatory military service (all males in my country have to serve for some months by law). I'll be joining the military in some months and after that I will move to the capital in search of something better. Another reason for that is that I want to start a new life close to my girlfriend, since we have spent the past 5 years together and we have decided to start going serious when it comes to our relationship.

Thankfully, the problem is not with her, our relationship is healthy and it's going very well despite any minor problems. We manage to deal with everything.

The problem lies mostly with my family and, in the majority, with my middle brother.

He moved back in our hometown about the same time I left for my studies, so we didn't really see each other a lot. My oldest brother is living in the capital for many years now, he's married and has two children. He only visits once in a while. So, you see, we haven't really seen eye to eye a lot.

Anyway, back to the problem. All of these are a prologue to make you understand my status and the general life we lead. My middle brother moved back home about 6 years ago with his then girlfriend (who is not from the same area) and they both tried to start a new life, find a job etc etc. To avoid paying for rent, my parents allowed them to live in the second apartment they own free of charge. Things however did not go well for them, they had to close the business they had opened and my brother started working for another business while his girlfriend worked as a waitress for a restaurant.

3 years ago my brother found out his girlfriend was cheating on him with a rich guy from the area. It was about the same period he announced my parents he was planning to marry her. The break-up went terribly, lots of crying, sorrow and my parents made him sleep in their house out of fear he would commit suicide. He started smoking, drinking and I have suspicions he took drugs once or twice but didn't stick to them (thank God for that). For several months he went quiet, reserved and melancholic, while in the meantime he returned to his flat. Until a couple months before I moved back.

He changed. He started considering himself better than other people because he had higher education than them, he started picking fights and shouting at employees working for public services like the tax office, he started blaming the goverment for his poor economic state, my parents for not helping him (while they had paid a lot for his education and supported him in many difficult moments of his life) and much more. He even started talking foul about our oldest brother behind his back, saying he should not complain and have an opinion on matter because he has a job, is paid well and whatnot.

Of course, his aggressive behaviour turned towards me when I moved back. And it still does.

He started insulting and belittling me and my opinions on matters every day. He said I'm too young to have opinions on matters, that I don't know anything because I have not yet experienced the real world, that I'm spoiled and foul-mouthed. The trigger for these reactions where random conversations where I had a different opinion than him. If anybody wants, I can provide examples but not here because the text will be really long.

At first, I stood my ground. I was trying to be as calm and polite as I could, but sometimes he would go too far. I would then lose my temper and there where moments where I was so enraged, I was about to attack him. He would insult my girlfriend, my relationship with her, my studies (I'm an IT engineer, he's an enviromental engineer), my appearance, everything.

Every time I stood my ground, my parents where shouting at both of us and made me apologise to him. When I asked them why, they said ""because we know you are the more rational and logical person, and we know you have the character to step down first and stop the fight"". However, as time went by, I simply ended up standing there, boiling in my own anger and sorrow as my brother openly insults me in front of my parents. And they don't say anything. Not a word.

Their excuse is that he's suffering and let him relieve his pain, since that's the only thing that makes him feel good. I disagree. I think this ruins our mood as a family and creates tension between us that sometimes breaks out in fights and shouting.

I will leave in a few months for my military service and after that, I don't plan to coming back. My brother has hurt me a lot, has insulted me, and broke my heart. I've reached a point I believe I would not feel anything if, say, a car accident happened and he died in a crash. I pity him and despise him at the same time and any feeling of love I may had for him is long gone.

I really don't know how to handle this situation and what to do. The only thing I care about is to get my life on track and be with the girl I love. But until then, I have to cope with my brother and his terrible behaviour in some way and I don't know how.

Any advice is welcome. And I'm at your disposal for further information or conversation.

Thanks in advance for any tips and huge kudos if you survived my massive wall of text. :P",12Oct2019,6

366," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a bar job  myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise especially for only getting a bar job. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me. 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself for some reason.,it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly.

370,"Hello this is actually my first time posting on reddit and I'm not entirely sure how things work but I need some advice/opinions. From elementary until high school, I have always lived in the shadow of my elder sibling. He wasn't necessarily better than me in everything but the thing is, everyone always assumed that he was. What frustrates me even more is that they assume he is better just because he looks a whole lot better than me. They never even met him in person yet they assume that he got all the genes for beauty, intelligence, and talent while I was left with nothing. Some of my classmates even got friendly with me just to try to get close to him. Don't get me wrong, I never had problems with him, he is actually a very good big bro but I hated how I was constantly compared to him. There were even times when I started to blame him even though he did nothing wrong (how immature I was in high school).
Now here's the thing. I'm in college now and I am luckily not in the same uni as him. So I really expected that I would have let go of my feelings of inferiority by now since nobody knows him and would therefore, no longer compare me to him anymore. But I still kinda get that naggy feeling at the back of my head that maybe my old schoolmates might have been right? And maybe my inferiority complex is too ingrained for me to let go. This is already considering the fact that I am already in what is widely regarded as the top uni in my country (so for those who said that I was a dumb version of my bro, I guess you were wrong).

I didn't think anything of it but then I noticed it really wasn't a common letter as there was no address whatsoever, only my first name written on it.
When I opened it I pulled out two pictures of me smoking a blunt (which I had posted to a private Instagram account only me and my group of friends had access to). They were printed on photographic paper so i realised someone really tried to fck me up. I was in shock bc I couldn't understand why. I'm not in a lot of trouble as it seems however I knew one of my friends must have tossed it in the mail themselves hence the missing address.
I confronted them in our group chat and they all were surprised and asked who would do something like that. 
However it is clear to me that the person that did it is a very close friend of mine and I must find out who it is.
I can't just keep hanging with them knowing someone wants to get me in trouble.

Ive taken an interest in making cosplay and props as a hobby but one of significant issue of mine is space.

Im currently still living with family as i am trying to pay off my student loans. The only space i have access to work on these projects is my 10x9 bedroom. Between all the supplies, work space, and material storage. My bedroom is usually a mess for long periods of time. It doesnt help i have to keep my pet cat out of my bedroom during for said period of time. Its just mental toll coming home to my messy bedroom. I cant even sleep on my bed most of the time.

I was looking if there were any workshop spaces available. Its 500 dollars a month for a 10x10 cubical space with access from 5am to 1 am monday thru friday. The downside is that i live over 2 hours away from it and work monday thru friday so i wont be able to use it during week days.

Now you might ask why not rent 2 bedroom apartment? I live in New York where a minimum studio apartment is $1400 a month. Space is expensive here!

I've talked about this with my parents, but it seems they really don't know how to help me... Afterall, the only jobs with which you could get by at that time were as doctor and/or teacher.

I don't want to believe that these are the only good jobs out there. I like English and have completed some translating projects, all of which I found much more enjoyable than studying biology or chemistry.

Naturally, my parents believe that this is due to laziness and that I would feel the same way, no matter what career I will choose.

I tell him i have to go since my mom was crying again. About 30 mins later he texts me he was sleepy and that he might fall asleep but he told me not to hesitate to call if ever i needed someone to talk to. After about 15 mins when all is normal at the house, I text him on the off chance he's still awake. I dont wanna wake him since he's on night duty for the past week and I know he's trying to get some good night sleep but is it normal that i felt hurt about that? I cant help but feel that since we're not gonna have sex anymore that he's not interested and not willing to stay up for me. I don't wanna nag him about it cause I feel like I'm overreacting.

384,"Hello everyone, I am creating this post on a throwaway account since I do not want it linked back to my main one. So, for all my life, I have ""played"" with straws. I use these plastic straws to help me creatively think as well as give my hands something to do, I sort of ""twittle"" them between my thumb and pointer finger. I am extremely picky about which ones ""work"" for my hands, and for the past 3 years I have been using only ones from this local eatery, nothing else is the same. About a year ago however, the straws, although looking the same, just had the wrong ""feel"" to them, almost like they were weaker. I had stockpiled some thankfully, but I was worried about when I'd run out. I will stop using a set of straws once they are ""worn out"" or if it gets a crack in it, I cannot stand the cracks or the worn out feeling. Well, that day has come, I just threw out my last set of straws last night, and my hands just feel, empty, part of me is missing. Is there anything I can do to help with this?

I am currently studying chemistry and I really enjoy the subject and want to work as a chemist, but whenever I’m alone or have time to reflect I „imagine“ or think about a weird scenario.
It’s 2013, I’m in a room with dark oak furniture but still rather modern, it’s my work or my university and I’m doing creative work on a mac. (Game Development/Digital Art) and this „scene“ just invokes such strong feelings in me. Hard to describe but it’s like how different periods of your life feel a certain way- but this way I’ve never felt before. 
It can’t be a memory because in 2013 is was 12 and too preoccupied with legos and TF2 for anything of that sort. 
It’s that bad to the point where any mention of 2013 and the sight of MacOS user interface and images of Portland Oregon (I live in Europe) invoke said feeling but to a point where it makes me incredibly sad.
It feels like a perfect future or a thing I’m destined to be but will never be. It’s like deep strong nostalgia to something that never happened.

During the summer i found (probably professionally shot??) porn film that said “16yrs who like anal!” (it was in his guitar room) 

i bought an SAT book, and when i got home he asked what i bought. i said it’s a book about stuff so that lead him to say “a book about how to be a bad girl?” 

yesterday he came into my room to tell me that people are coming over to the house and he slapped my butt out of nowhere. i was appalled so i told him to get out, he didn’t leave right away. (that does not happen in my house)

392,"The guy I've been talking to is 17 (let's call him Liam for the sake of anonymity) and I'm 14 going on 15.

I met Liam online through an app that allows you to match with 'possible friends', in which the profile that I made stated that I was 15 (originally wanted to seem 'more mature'. *wasn't the smartest move on my part*). We matched and began talking and really hit it it off, gradually building up to texting and calling almost every day. I remember him double-checking the age on my profile and that I in response gave him a fake day and month of my supposed birthday, although I did tell him my true birth year.

I lied, as I've already mentioned, to seem 'more mature', and although I regret it immensely and wish I just corrected my age to begin with, I didn't want to lose contact with him. 

The problem is now that we've been talking for a few months, I think I've developed romantic feelings for him. Plus, on a more important note, my actual birthday is coming up soon and as he follows my social media he's bound to see something referring to it. 

We have a similar sense of humor, taste in music and philosophical outlook - he's also shared things he says he ""wouldn't share with other people"" (implying a sense of trust, which makes what I'm trying to do even harder). He's genuinely one of the loveliest people I've ever talked to, so I don't really know how to break it to him that I'm not 15 yet. The possibility of him deciding to stop talking to me is something I really don't want to think about. The difference between the age I told him and my actual age is roughly 6-7 months - not something I'd think would be viewed as anything major in an adult relationship, but in a teenage one I'm not so sure. He's joked about 14 being ""too young"" for him in referral to this guy trying to hit him up and it's made me pretty anxious that he'll be upset if I tell him I lied about my age. He's also sent me pictures (consensually, of course, and nothing too nsfw) that I'm not sure he'd be comfortable with a slightly younger person viewing.

The question is: should I tell him that I lied about my age ? and, if so, how should I go about it without making it into something more complicated than it actually is ?",12Oct2019,1

404,"**Short introduction**

Just recently a certain idea emerged from my subconsciousness once more and grew ever bigger into one brachiosaurus of a nuisance, romping around within my well-ordered thoughts: Are advertisements, bought and crooked reviews starting to shroud the quality aspect into thick, almost impenetrably fog? Modern marketing and Internet seem to be able to project a mirage of heaven onto hell itself. But this is not meant to become a philosophical debate about whether advertisement prevents us from buying the right things. Instead, I seek experience reports regarding items that have made your life more productive. I'm especially looking forward to suggestions from aspiring students, scientists or similar groups who share the idea that it matters NOT HOW MUCH they have, but rather HOW EFFICIENT their property is on average.

&amp;#x200B;

**Outlining my understanding of an excellent purchase**

Here are a couple of aspects I consider when I need something new that I don't plan to eat or drink:

&amp;#x200B;

Will my logistics benefit from the product?

*- OR -*

Does it come with the bitter aftertaste of having to rearrange my desk order when my current work requires a lot of material? Why should the lamp be located on my desk when the light could be attached on top of the monitor?

&amp;#x200B;

Is the purchase going to enable me to use my time more efficiently?

*- OR -*

Is it going to obfuscate the important accessories behind a waterfall of redundancy, sort of like a newspaper with advertisement inside?

&amp;#x200B;

Is this item worthy of my valuable apartment space?

*- OR -*

Will it transmute hoovering, cleaning and so forth into a pain in the neck?

&amp;#x200B;

**The contributions I hope for**

I'd appreciate if you could structure your replies as follows for a clear overview, without too much glorification of the product. Core idea of this thread is to trust in your honest opinion in contrast to (possibly faulty) advertisements out there.

* What (furniture, accessory, clothing, ...)
* Product's lifetime thus far (It is not uncommon for goods to break as soon as the warranty ends.)
* Link (Yes, I have a particular interest in the EXACT product that has enriched your life!)
* \[optional if not obvious\] How does it facilitate life?
* \[optional\] Why is it worth buying?
* \[optional\] Short extra info

&amp;#x200B;

**Example**

&amp;#x200B;

* What:

Whiteboard

\[This example is a general one, but I would also love to read about goods that surpass their competition by a long shot, e.g. a superior whiteboard.\]

&amp;#x200B;

* Product's lifetime thus far

1 year and still in good shape

&amp;#x200B;

* Link

Not necessary here as I'm referring to whiteboards in general.

&amp;#x200B;

* Why is it worth buying?

Aside from the obvious usage there are no consequences resulting from the purchase. It takes space that I wouldn't be able to use otherwise (there's also a holder for the markers and the eraser sticks to the board due to magnetism).

&amp;#x200B;

* Short extra info

Especially neat to write down reminders or sudden inspirations. For excessive usage pen and paper are mostly preferred, because wiping doesn't always go smooth and takes time.

&amp;#x200B;

I called the emergency after hours number and they sent out a guy who checked my thermostat, but couldn't do much else since he didn't have access to the other apartment. He left a space heater, assured me I could leave it running while I'm at work if necessary, and said he would contact my rental agency so they knew to schedule an appointment to get it fixed. Cool.

This past week was fine. It was in the 60s usually, so running the heater while I was home/awake and turning it off overnight and while I was at work kept my apartment at a comfortable temperature. 

But now it's been a week and it's in the 40s/50s today and I work today and tomorrow, which means I'm gone approximately 10 hours a day. But since I have a few pets, I need to keep the temperature at least reasonable. 

Isn't running a space heater unattended dangerous? Should I be more persistent about getting my heater fixed when my rental agency opens Monday?

So I quit a place I have been apart of for a decade. I didn’t even get a chance to say goodbye to the clients. The most shocking betrayal is how my bosses could know me for a a decade and pick some new male employee over me. We invited my bosses over to my birthday parties and even my graduation!

Me and him have just recently been not having anything to talk about. And I feel like we piss each other off more now. Even though it’s probably just me who has anger issues. I really don’t want to lose him but lately I’ve been wondering if it’d be better to take some time and not talk to him. Should I? I need some time to sort myself out. But I don’t want to leave him. And I don’t want him to leave me. I’m honestly just lost. I’m going through a lot right now. And so is he. So I feel like we should take some time to figure ourselves out. But I’m just worried that it might lead to us not talking. That’s all. Byes.,12Oct2019,1

I then used their phone to call my own because I was “looking for a friend” and once no one answered I politely thanked them and left.

428,"I’m feeling very lost in life. I’m 22, I have an engineering degree, and am working a pretty boring job not in the field I’m interested in because it offered a higher payment than most other entry level engineering positions. 

I’ve lately realized that I’m angry and depressed because I’m not where I thought I’d be at this age. I came from a pretty poor background and went to a terrible public school in an area where no one goes to college. I was determined to be successful so I worked my ass off to save up $20k before graduation so I could afford to go to college. My parents did not financially support me and made too much for me to get financial aid outside of loans.

I ended up getting into a top tier college and everything was way more expensive than I imagined, so I worked 20-30 hours a week in undergrad and did internships over the summer. My grades were poor and I had no social life because of working so much. 

I took the highest paying job offered to me and discovered that while it occupies my time and is challenging, I do not care about the subject area at all. I’ve realized that I didn’t take any major risks in undergrad, I didn’t take co-ops or time off of school, I didn’t try to study abroad, I didn’t do any unpaid internships or research projects because I was scared of being broke and getting into a worse financial situation. I’m lonely because I didn’t make many friends on account of being so busy. I’m jealous because everyone I went to school with is working these amazing dream job positions or going to amazing graduate schools and I feel perpetually lost and behind. I still have loans and feel like until I pay them off, I can’t take any risks for better satisfaction, because I do not want to be saddled with debt that grows interest.

What’s worse is that I have no idea who I am. Since being 13, I’ve worked paid jobs literally every free moment I’ve had and have nothing to show for my sacrifice. I don’t know what I want to do with my future. I don’t know how to make friends. I don’t know how to even figure out what I want to do. I have subject areas that interest me but that’s about it. I feel like I wasted my adolescence for nothing, and would probably have had a better life if I just took out more loans in undergrad.",12Oct2019,1

I don’t leave the house except for 6 hours a week to work at a football  stadium as somebody there to help. sometimes it’s ok but other times it’s very difficult. I always get put on the shitty jobs (part of being ugly) and there’s times I blatantly get stared at because I’m ugly. Last week some fat young guy walked past me stared at me walking past it was obvious what he was thinking yet he had severe acne all round his mouth and was vastly overweight.  don’t ever wanna leave the house for it. Just last week I was at work at that stadium job and a girl and her dad was standing drinking the girl looked at me with a blank stare (I only stared back because I thought she needed help with something as that’s wha I’m there for) and she looked back up to her dad with a disgusted look on her face, yet she had tons of makeup on like it was a mask, it really got me down tbh as I was having an anxiety free day for once. Also the there’s a guy who’s a higher up authority on my part  I work and he’s younger than me and all he does is stare at me like I have 3 heads and looks me down because I’m skinny. I don’t wanna ever leave the house. I never knew being ugly would make life so difficult. Sometimes when it’s cold I wear a hat and a snood and it helps a lot tbh.  I have bad depression too so it’s difficult to not look very tired and pale too. And tired of trying to help someone when it’s a women and they’re snotty I take it personally. The most painful thing is when a women will be cold towards me even when iv not done or said anything wrong but will open up to the attractive guys even if he’s a complete douche. 5 years ago a gorgeous girl had a crush on me but she will be the only girl who will ever like me :(",12Oct2019,0

Are there any other routes I could potentially take to avoid going to another institution? I know getting a job would be a route but it is difficult for me due to lack of transportation and inability to drive.

437,"So let me give some context for tonight. I have a this group of friends, 2 in particular, who I grew up with and was really close with. Moved away for college and we drifted apart a little but were still good friends. A year ago I moved in with my gf and we drifted even further apart.

I went on a little road trip for a concert with them back in February. Since then, I've only hung out with them 2 other times, the last time being in July. My severe depression led me to isolate myself and ignore their phone calls when they'd try to invite me over. I have texted them apologizing for being distant but others then that, not much contact. Should also mention they've only met my girl one time.

So tonight the gf of one of those friends is throwing a big Halloween party. I was invited thru text and accepted. Theres going to be lots of booze and some snortables as well. I've been stressing about it for weeks.

I've really tried to narrow down why I am nervous. I think it stems from 3 places.

The long period of no contact and my flakiness over the last months has made me really afraid to confront my friends again. They're going to ask where I've been and I dont know what to tell them. Not about to bring down the party with my depression stories.

I am nervous about my gf. She wont know anybody there and she gets a little out of control when very drunk. And who knows what she will be like after snorting something. I'm scared that something might go wrong with her or she will get out of control and offend somebody.

I have general social anxiety so just that fact that's itll be a large party for at least 4 hours makes me not want to go.

I've talked to my gf and shes allievated some of my fears. Shes told me my friends will be happy to see me, and I might get some light ribbing but it's not like they'll make me feel horrible (hopefully). But idk what advice I'm looking for.

443,"It’s been three weeks since I’ve worked at my job. I’ve worked there for 8 months. It’s a very small store in the mall with 4 managers + 15 sales associates, therefore most of us get 4-5 hours a week (8 if you’re lucky). And they’re ALWAYS hiring....like we don’t have more than enough people already. 

Now mind you...

- I’ve never missed a shift (in fact, a lot of the times they’d ask me to take an extra shift/stay later or a coworker would ask if i could take their shift. 95% of the time, I said yes)

- I’m never late to a shift (we count 5 minutes past your shift to be late. So if you’re scheduled from 5PM-10PM and you arrive at 5:02, you’re still on time. But if you arrive at 5:06, you’re late. I’m literally always on time/clock in before the 5 min mark)

- I’ve never been written up (you get three write ups before getting fired) 

- I do my job. Maybe not perfectly and I do make a couple mistakes but I always double check with a manager and I correct myself with the quickness

All in all, I would say I’m a pretty good employee or at least decent. 

So I can’t understand why they haven’t scheduled me in 3 weeks. I used to put in 16-20 hours of availability every week and like I said, they’d schedule me for 4-5 every week. So now I just put in 4-5 hours every week. 

Also, I just got a job at another store in the mall. They’re giving a good 10+ hours a week.

Should we get back together?

                    So me and my girlfriend both are 15 BRAKE to fix our relationship after 5 months. For the following month we were great friends. But than she got this one guy friend. I would like to say I’m not the jealous type but this guy just felt better to me. He could drive had a job and was a little taller. I didn’t think anything of it at first because it was just a friend. 
                     One day he texts her while we are still on our break to fix our relationship. I love cuddling with you it was great and she said it was great too. I got pissed off. I would say I am very calm but when I get very very very angry I lose control. I started flipping out on her calling her a no good cheater and I told her to stop doing that or to end the break. She ended it and I was fine with that but I was just hoping she didn’t do it so she technically has the right. Before she met this guy friend we was friends with benefits but after she met him I couldn’t even touch her to the point where she fell on the ground and I would just t to help her up. She starts hanging out with him at 3 am. She is 15. And was sleeping over today every night even if she has school or not. 
                     I went to go get my stuff at her house one day and she ask me. “Tommy are you sure100 percent sure he’s only trying to get in my pants”? I told the truth that he was since she would tel me other thing like how he would sneak her I and stuff. She then goes to block him and than ask me what will he probably do now. I grew up around bad guys who used girls for the same reason and I kinda understood the way they think. I start asking question and than I ask how far did he get? I asked this because if she kept it I her pants he would move on right away. She says that they kissed while on the brake with me. I keep cool tho because I am currently trying to work on my anger. She than tells me that they did oral the night after the break. At that point I flipped I was so heart broken. I start yelling and Walked our the room to calm a bit and told her how that was pretty much cheating since it was not official yet. She than uses an excuse that I was abusive. I have never hit her and never even thought about it. I just never could hit a woman I have too much strength and anger to the point when I was 8 I would beat up high schoolers for fun. I packed my shit and left being all sad and mad because of what she did.
                       I want to just go to the kids house but I know that won’t solve nothing. We talked last night and she told me she still loved me and regretted what she did and said only did that because she was stressed and that it didn’t help anyways. We talked for about 4 hours and I decided I think i can get over it. She said give her a answer if we should date in the morning. I just don’t know what to say should I be angry at her and the guy.  I also found out that she lied about sexual experiences with her ex which I’m not mad that she did it but mad because I could of got a std or something along the lines. 

Should I date her again even know what she did?

Should I be this angry?

Should I just move on or try it again to see if it could work?

And my anxieties range from “your normal” stuff to literal phobia like stuff and almost all of those ring true, not because of anticipation but because of people around me act really weird?

I feel like the whole get out of my hometown thing might help as many have said that, and I have found a lot of people and their advice, where I live, is not good for me (and believe me it really is not.....) I’ve never felt safe since I’ve moved here. And I know that if I “Move out to a college town,” “Or to somewhere like Seattle or San Mateo,” those bustling with activity... It’s going to be similar people because where I live they all have connects to those places somehow and so I can’t really get up in a lot of places because everyone knows SOMEONE from my corner of the world. And I know it’s unhealthy af but I found it immensely better to maybe just mostly isolate myself from majority of people anyways... lol.  And of course money is always tight so moving is not necessarily an option, and I don’t have time to “move/uproot” myself and then find out I hate that place too.

We get to said person and he says he’s super close to his brother and I tell him what he already suspects the guy does. He gives his friend who is the older brother the heads up and the guy is super thankful but wants to talk to me also. He wants to keep it between us.

462,"As a kid I used the internet as some sort of coping mechanism. I just wanted to escape the reality I was born into, and it worked like a charm. Now after a long time of soul searching I overcame a lot of difficulties. But browsing the internet has pretty much became the default thing for me to do. I do have stuff to do in my life. I go to uni, I party on the weekends, I work out religiously, I volunteer at my frat. But that's not a whole lot actually. As soon as I'm done with the immediate tasks I'll start browsing the internet.

Now I've tried reading books in my free time instead. I used to love books before I had discovered the internet. But nowadays, I can barely read books anymore. I'm not illiterate lol, but the internet fucking nuked attention span from orbit. Can't concentrate longer than it takes to read a Reddit post.

The worst part is, I can't even study for uni at this point. Either I'll space out in front of my textbook or become so distracted by the internet that I don't even study in the first place. I feel like I'm behind the curve. While other people find time to get their shit done and have a bunch of hobbies, I'm a hollow shell of a person doing nothing but consuming all day every day. I'm turning 21 soon. I can still turn my whole life around but I feel like time's running out. I'm not a kid anymore, I can't just eat a pound of candy or spend weeks on end doing absolutely nothing. My decisions bear weight.

I can't just throw out my electronic devices either. Lots of stuff for uni is online too. I've even tried software to limit my time in the hellholes that are YouTube and Reddit but it's not working. What do I do?",12Oct2019,1

464,"okay, i didn’t know if this should have gone in the relationship advice subreddit but i’m not exactly in a relationship and it’s more about what do i do now. i think i’m looking for someone to just spell it out how it is so i stop making excuses, stop feeling conflicted or confused and actually do something to help how i’m feeling because this sucks. 
how i’m feeling sucks. 

i’m 17 and i was in a relationship with a guy from my school for a little under a year before i broke it off around 4 months ago. 
we are in the same grade at school but hadn’t really met before we went on a school trip overseas, where we developed a crush on each other. we confessed our feelings and whatnot but did not get “together” for another few months after the trip.  

the first crappy thing that happened (and this was even before we were together) was him pretending to be in a car accident. he texted me pretending to be his friend and said that he was in a car accident and that he can’t feel his legs. i was in a different state at the time, and could only go off his word. i was so upset; i had just recently been in an accident myself (which he was fully aware of) and was very touchy about the subject. 
i honestly don’t know why he was so immature and thought that was a great idea but he lied to me. i almost called the whole thing off right then and there, over the phone. i couldn’t believe he was that childish! should’ve trusted my gut. 

anyway we had a few fights here and there - about me making jokes and poking a bit of fun at him when he got jealous about me talking to my friends that are boys, about me not agreeing with his views, wanting to have a discussion about them when he wanted me to just listen to him rant about things i didn’t agree with and to not speak up against him, etc. 

we lost our virginities to each other 6 months after we began dating.  he was sneaking over to my house nearly every night of the week for months. i’d like to clarify that i didn’t mind this - although we were sleep deprived, i was having fun and so was he. 

then he began to ask me to send him photographs of myself, which i was kind of okay to do but i only wanted to show certain things and he wanted me to show things i didn’t want to show him. i didn’t really want to send photos to be completely honest, but he made me feel like i owed it to him or something. it was weird and i didn’t like it but i couldn’t tell him to stop. 

all he wanted to talk about was sex. we barely had conversations anymore, all he wanted to talk about was me and him doing something dirty and i hated it! all i wanted was to talk about places we wanted to go, ideas we had, anything else! 

one day at school, i got very angry at him (i was on my period at this time.)
he decided that it would be funny to throw stones at me. 
i saw red, and i slapped him to which he told me that i abused him. 
i felt so bad about it that i went home and got very very drunk. i don’t remember much of that night. all i know was that i started to text him and he came over to my house again. the next day at school, i asked if anything had happened. sexually. 
i felt sore so i knew something had happened by i just couldn’t believe it as i was on my period at the time. 
he said that nothing had happened, that he had taken me for a walk, put me to sleep in my bed and then left. 
he texted me that night saying that we had had sex. i felt and still feel disgusting and i feel dirty. 

our relationship began to spiral. 
he didn’t want to go anywhere with me or do anything with me unless it was in one of our homes when our parents were out. 
he didn’t initiate any conversations unless it was of a sexual nature or talking about how sad he is or how hard his life is. he never asked any questions about me or how i was doing, or even what i was doing. 

he started to express an interest in doing something that i really did not want to do (sexually). and i told him that i was very hesitant about it and that i didn’t really want to do it. he would always talk about it, trying to convince me that we should try it and that it wouldn’t hurt and lots of girls like it and blah blah blah. 
i caved and we tried. 
i said that i would never ever do that again - i was in so much pain, i was shaking and crying. he said he was sorry, and that we would never speak of it again. 

a month or two passed and he was at my house. he said it was an accident, but it happened again. i just screamed. 
i showered and i cried and i bled. 
he hugged me afterwards and asked for round two. i said i didn’t want to as i was in pain and i didn’t really trust him after that. i also was not in the mood.
he said that he’d make me. those words. he’d “make me”. and so he did. 

i feel disgusting. it’s been 6 months since that happened and i feel as dirty as if it happened yesterday. 

i did not want to be alone with him anymore. he would make plans alone and i would invite someone else too. he got very very angry at me for that.
i broke up with him. 

he taunts me at school now. my grades have dropped, he is in all of my classes. i have skipped class a few times. i cry at random times in class. i am scared to be at school. no one sticks up for me, and i feel so damn alone. i feel ashamed and i don’t know why, i still feel dirty and i don’t know why, i don’t understand what happened and i don’t understand why i am feeling so bad all. the. time.

471,"I am 16 years old and work at a dinner as a busser. Minimum wage is 7.50 and I make about 4 from my employer and about 2$ per waiter a hour from tips. I usally have 3-5 waiters and as of right now I only work fridays and saturdays. On days that I work with another person (Fridays and Saturdays) however this money is split (so about 1$ per hour per waiter), and this job is decently physical (lifting, constantly moving or cleaning, and in contact with many dirty surfaces and objects). Since I work only fridays and saturdays however the money I make in tips is also always split with the other busser working. There are 2 things I think I am getting scammed for. The fist is that no matter what shift I work I will always work at least 1 hour of the shift by myself. However when it comes time to do tips instead of including that hour as a lone hour it is split. So for example if I worked that lone hour for 5 waiters I would make 5 instead of 10 dollars for that hour. The second reason is that any overtime I work isn't paid with tips. So im effectively getting paid 4$ per hour for any time after my actual shift which is below minimum wage. I usally work at least 20 minutes and max 40 minutes extra everyday. Plus as of today they are trying to make me stay a full hour late ( considered overtime without tips) anytime it is busy which is pretty much everyday considering its on friday and saturday nights, and they aren't paying tip money for that extra hour either. So basically I want to know if im overreacting in thinking they are scamming me or if what they are doing is in the wrong as I dont have much experience in the work force.",12Oct2019,1

I really liked her and my group of friends knew that I was interested in her, long story short We ended up hooking up one night and everyone found out. Anyways heres where shit starts to get weird. 
After the hook up she started treating me noticibly different. She doesn't make eye contact with me or even tries to hold a conversation with me. But shes very talkitive with everyone else. She makes me feel left out of conversations and what not.

I thought this was all in my head so I took her on a date one day. Before picking her up she said to wait outside because she didnt want her roomates (part of our friend group) to know that she's out with me on a date. We had a very awkward dinner where it was made clear she wanted to be friends. But my feelings didnt go away.

Everyone knows we hooked up one night so they make jokes about it. 

 Okay so heres what happened. the group went out one day and she started flirting with other men. At this point she said we're just friends. Cool no problem. Or atleast I didnt think it was.
 she proceeds to start grinding with this stranger in front of me then has the audacity to wink at me. I Feel like she knows it's making me feel uncomfortable. I'm not going to lie it really hurt because I kind of ""let her in"". She proceeds to talk to me about how shes going to take that guy home etc to the rest of the group, fully aware that I'm into her. My group of friends started giving me pity looks as well.

We've been friends since the 7th grade and best friends for about a year, so we've known each other a while. She's always been one to complain and vent a lot, but recently these past few months I think it's been getting ridiculous. I've always been known as the ""Therapist Friend"" who's great at helping with problems, but I think she's more interested in me just sitting there and listening to her complain for hours (I'm not exaggerating when I say hours) straight every time we hang out rather than the occasional healthy vent.

 It's been getting so bad to the point where I've found myself making excuses for us not to hang out. Even over text she'll send me multiple paragraphs out of the blue about things she's complained about to me multiple times over the past few days. It's not that I don't give her advice, I do, but she never listens to me or even seems to consider it, which is fine, but then why are you still complaining about it if you're not going to try to fix it?

I would let her live with me, but we barely have enough money to feed ourselves and we also don't know where she would sleep. Both of her grandpas died recently and she's had a guy she liked screw her over about a month ago. So she deals with a lot. 

I'm here for her and I support her and she has no one else to talk to about these things but me. Am I just being rude? She's trying to find a therapist which is good, but what if she still doesn't stop?

I was in a relationship with someone for 7 months, and soon was threatened to be killed by their mom, and was physically, sexually, and verbally abused for 5 of those months. I didn’t understand Stockholm syndrome but, this person made me feel like I had nobody else to go to, and I was under the constant threat of being hit, yelled at, or killed. And if I didn’t do sexual things with them, they’d threaten to kill themselves and blame it on me. 

I went to Florida for my birthday, which was a great and amazing experience for the first half, but then, this person actually attempted to commit suicide, and I was 12 hours away from my home state, driving time. I didn’t know what to do, then, she blamed everything on me, and her friend backed her up, saying I tried to cheat on her 3 times in her hospital with said friend, who lives across the street from me.

My reputation was ruined, and everyone hated me. For a very long time, as well. Then I dated some girl, who I won’t name, who knew I was trans and told me she didn’t see me as a girl, and needed me to be manly.

489,"so, trying to keep this as short as i can without leaving out any key details may be a bit hard, but ill try my best. 

my girlfriends mom (E for gf, EM for her mom) is not a fan of me. at all. i would maybe begin to understand her habits and actions if i was a terrible man who did terrible things to E, but she has never even reeally met me before. EM has met me and we've exchanged greetings and all that while she was in a car, but that's about all the interaction that we've had. i don't use the word lunatic lightly in this scenario, ive met and dealt with strict parents before, but this to me is just unfathomable. it's just not right. 

a bit of backstory. so about a month and a half ago,E was still in a two year relationship with one veery toxic man (D). throughout this entire relationship, me and E had been friends and had somewhat steady contact through our socials. the last couple of months of the relationship, our friendship developed and developed into being each others absolute best friends. im not one to use the word best friends lightly too, that's alot for the both of us. in the beginning of their relationship, EM hated this D, im assuming as much as she hates me. the more time that passed, EM started to absolutely love this D character, and then all was well with them. fast forward to the last couple of months,where the relationship turns emotionally abusive and of course, ended because of it.

 EM is still team D all the way,and doesn't even want to try and think that there is a better man for E in this world. EM continues to yell and yell at E about how stupid she is for letting D go, how sad she is for falling for a twink like me (EM's actual nickname for me, she calls me a twink) and how weak she is for crying when she yells about it. EM consistently says things along the lines of ""just wait, D is going to be back"" and ""you're going to start crying defending your fucking twink now, huh?"" she consistently calls her own daughter a slut for having any kind of relationship with me, which couldn't be further from the truth. she doesn't even give E a fucking voice. she doesn't want to even try to listen to anything E has to say about me. she doesn't do either of us the respect of actually meeting me and actually getting to know who i really am and what my actual intentions are. 

Even though EM hates me, she was able to muster up enough of herself to allow us to have multiple days together. these weren't dates in her eyes, but they were dates. these dates are where our relationship was really established. last night, E and her friend (A) met up at a close-by mall with me and my friend (G) for a double date. i was under the impression that EM knew about me and G's presence in the mall, but that apparently wasn't true. after an absolutely picture perfect night, E and A leave, and me and G start to walk in the direction of my house. walking this way, EM spots us from her car while she was taking E and M back home. as you could probably guess, chaos ensued. E is texting me on the way home how much shit she got herself into and how we won't be able to see or even contact each other for months. both of us are obviously devastated. E told me that she'd find a way to contact me to tell me that she's okay. this contact would most likely come from discord on her computer, but theres a good chance E won't be able to use it. im assuming EM confiscated E's phone and put her on house arrest now, but i still don't know for sure. E has still yet to contact me.

now, i understand strict parents. i understand the strictest of parents, but EM isn't even ""strict"" per say. EM is just irrational in every single way possible. she just flat out does not want her daughter to be happy. basically every single reason E's life is so miserable is because of EM, and EM still swears on her life that she knows and is doing what's best for E. she still does not want to even give me a sliver of a chance to prove myself to her. i don't know what to do. i know for a fact that if EM knew who i really was, she would fucking adore me. if she was able to love the absolute douchebaggery of D, she will without a doubt love me, the one who has done and will continue to do everything beyond good for E. im thinking of ways to try and fix this problem, and all of it is pointing to trying to get her to give me a chance, or at least talk to me one goddamn time. to at least give both me and E that respect. my parents do have EMs phone number, and i was planning on calling her and trying to somehow mend all of this, but i wouldn't know where to begin. that's where i turn to this subreddit. hopefully you beautiful lot would be able to give me some pointers on how to go about this. 

if i didn't give enough information in this post, or if you think that there's more things that i can shed some light on, please please let me know. call me a stupid adolescent, but im mature enough to know that E is the ""one."" no matter what happens now, when E moves out of her house, im following right behind her. no wedge that EM drives in our relationship will break it, and that is probably the most true thing ive said in my life. we're both not tooo far from this happening, it's just about a year or so away, but there is no way in hell her mom can do this to the both of us.

My wife, our two pets, and I have had a terrible year financially. At the beginning we thought we were more than set and since we were handing over our house back to the original owner/landlord, we thought we'd move to a different state. 

I pondered (and we briefly visited)  Missouri because I have family there and my father even hinted that he would help. Buuut...

 We'd just had a friend move to California who had previously stayed with us and invited us to join her until we got a new place. We began the process of packing, quitting our jobs, getting a truck, etc. 
Not long before the move the friend backs out on some technicality things. We're stunned, but determined so we head West as we already had interviews lined up and... Well we were optimistic. 

We visited friends in Vegas along the way who talked about how great it is there and cheap to live. We stay a couple nights and looked at apartments, we ended up trying to settle there as we could already tell money was depleting.
Getting work there was terrible for various reasons and the struggle set us back. We were paying weekly rent and ran out of money and panicked. We borrowed money from friends and family. I couldn't get any financial loans so I started a new credit card and maxed it to help us survive. 
Ultimately we had to throw in the towel to avoid being on the street and called for help on the internet. Can anyone take us in? 

We had different friends in Cali give us shelter in a small town to help us get on our feet. 
I've only been able to get odd jobs, but my wife found a nice full time job and we're rebuilding or lives. In all the moving we've had to lose everything we've owned except for clothing. 

Now we've moved into an apartment with a roommate that needed help as well. (They had a roommate previous to us who paid no money at all) They were behind on important bills and we had money and needed a room. I've helped them with countless things and life advice, right down to drawing up their budget to try and help them understand it. 
Understandably they seem less stressed about money and have even been out buying new clothes, accessories, going out to the movie, and talking about throwing a big party at a rental house later this month. 
It seemed a little odd but I didn't think much of it until A) the internet had issue the other day and roommate panicked that it might be shut off (it wasn't) and B) yesterday wile roommate was at work someone knocked on the door and informed me that since there's been no payment since MARCH the gas is getting shut off. So now we have no way to cook our food and no hot water. 

So they've been talking our money and not paying bills with it. 

I'm so frustrated at life being so massively unstable and we've been narrowly avoiding homelessness over the last 6 months. 

Going back to the beginning, I'm thinking about going to Missouri after all. It isn't our number one choice but I have family and friends there, the rent is  very affordable, plus based on my searches there are many more job opportunities. I feel like we made a mistake not going there in the first place, but on the other hand we've been moving so, so much and landing on a pile of fail each time. 

I suppose I'm just a nervous wreck that wants to get back to a 'normal' lifestyle.",12Oct2019,2

494,"In my school locker rooms, people have been stealing things straight from other people's bags. Cash, airpods, credit card information, you name it, it's been taken. I foolishly set up bait in the form of my wallet and had my card info, as well as $30 stolen. This was issued by the organization I worked for, and only a small amount of money (at least, in terms of total amount stolen) was taken off that card. I have since deactivated it.

A few weeks ago, a fake account on Instagram messaged me, saying that they knew who took my card information and they knew who was stealing money in the locker room. I set up another trap, and recorded it this time, but the thief deleted the video off my phone (yes, deleted it from the trash can as well. The gym teachers know about this situation, but they do not want to come forward to the dean or assistant principals without any evidence of who this person is. 

The account is still active, although nobody knows who it is, and it sent me a phone number that supposedly belongs to the thief. That phone number allowed me to find the person on Snapchat, who has yet to accept the friend request. I just tried to extract the deleted video from my phone to no avail, and I was just informed by my gym teacher that we technically aren't allowed to have a camera positioned anywhere in the locker room.

I've effectively been ruled out as viable bait, as they know who I am and what my bag looks like, and there seem to be no other methods of weeding this S.O.B out of hiding and turning him in.

What measures can be taken to either a) extract the permanently deleted video from the phone (if there are any), b) find out who it is via the phone number or social media accounts, or c) lay another form of Home Alone style trap to get him?

Update 1: the Instagram account has since been deleted.",12Oct2019,4

We read them short stories and prepare questions and activities.

 I literally just came home from my first session and my kid does not know how to read and the school year is almost over. She's in first grade and she seriously struggles on combining the sounds of letters and identifying words. She doesn't know the complete alphabet, she is good at math though. She's also very distracted, and I have trouble keeping her attention for long.  

Other kids have serious learning disabilities, so im thankful that at least my kid knows a little. Can anyone give me some advice on teaching little kids? Ones with learning issues?

Add another element: this person is interested in you and has been for years, but you have no interest in them and they are aware of it. Do you feel rude sending brief responses? Do you feel rude to stop responding at all? What do you do/say when they text you a negative/petty/trivial reaction because you stopped responding for 5-10 minutes? I feel like I (26/F) allow other people dominate my time by letting myself to get roped into text conversations. I'm gotten sick of it and I'm tired of the creepiness and feeling guilty all the time.

Long story short, if he doesn't get what he wants he starts getting really, really dramatic about how disrespectful the person who's keeping him from getting what he wants is. I.E. He asked me to be somewhere at a certain time, and I told him I couldn't and needed an extra 15 minutes. 

He went off about how I'm always late, and how it's super inconsiderate, and how I need to approach people with more respect blah blah blah...So I straight up told him he didn't even ask to see if the time was possible for me, and that all he's really complaining about is that I'm not doing exactly what he wants, when he wants it. 

I told him he needs to consider other people when requesting things of them and it's selfish to take concessions/pushback as disrespect because we are all our own people and sometimes we need to come to a mutual agreement versus just doing what you ask. 

So he went off again on some weird rant, talking about how he's got a family, his life is so hard, and how he respects me and I don't respect him so I just tuned it out and said ""whatever man"". 

Now, that left a really bad taste in my mouth especially cause I've been basically babying him so he doesn't get some type of way for a while and I'm not really interested in working with him after this, but I'm probably going to have to continue to work with him for a little bit. I just don't how to keep it from becoming hostile with a person who clearly is not afraid of making things hostile when they don't get what they want.

I have a bad feeling that people like this are only manageable by making concessions to them all the time but I'm really not interested in being that guy.

I've realized that I still have a few of his things and he still has some of my stuff (a purse, clothing, jacket, swim suit, etc.).. I've tried to arrange with his sister for her and I to meet up and exchange things, but she lives 2 hours away and isn't coming into town anytime soon ( she's newly pregnant and just moved into a new house, so she's pretty busy right now). I tried to arrange with his sister to contact her dad so I could do an exchange with him, but he isn't replying to her messages. I really  want my stuff back, and want to get his stuff to him. 
He has Borderline Personality disorder, so I went from being a caring loving girlfriend in his life to a complete heartless bitch who never cared about him when I broke up with him. Him and his mom completely turned on me and blamed me for all his suicide attempts (he attempted suicide or cut himself every time he felt like I was withdrawing from the relationship). Our relationship ended very harshly.
Is it inappropriate or stupid to unblock him and message him and ask about exchanging stuff again? He's already moved on and gotten another girlfriend it seems, and I don't want him to think I'm trying to ruin his new relationship (??)

I don’t leave the house except for 6 hours a week to work at a football  stadium as somebody there to help. sometimes it’s ok but other times it’s very difficult. I always get put on the shitty jobs (part of being ugly) and there’s times I blatantly get stared at because I’m ugly. Last week some fat young guy walked past me stared at me walking past it was obvious what he was thinking yet he had severe acne all round his mouth and was vastly overweight.  don’t ever wanna leave the house for it. Just last week I was at work at that stadium job and a girl and her dad was standing drinking the girl looked at me with a blank stare (I only stared back because I thought she needed help with something as that’s wha I’m there for) and she looked back up to her dad with a disgusted look on her face, yet she had tons of makeup on like it was a mask, it really got me down tbh as I was having an anxiety free day for once. Also the there’s a guy who’s a higher up authority on my part  I work and he’s younger than me and all he does is stare at me like I have 3 heads and looks me down because I’m skinny. I don’t wanna ever leave the house. I never knew being ugly would make life so difficult. Sometimes when it’s cold I wear a hat and a snood and it helps a lot tbh.  I have bad depression too so it’s difficult to not look very tired and pale too. And tired of trying to help someone when it’s a women and they’re snotty I take it personally. The most painful thing is when a women will be cold towards me even when iv not done or said anything wrong but will open up to the attractive guys even if he’s a complete douche. 5 years ago a gorgeous girl had a crush on me but she will be the only girl who will ever like me :(",12Oct2019,0
509,"I work(ed) for a small accountancy firm for nearly 3 years, my boss has always abused his power and on several occasions I've just allowed it. This has set precident for my redundancy.

I found out earlier this year I was pregnant, strait from the get go inhad messages on facebook privately telling me I was stupid for keeping it (he doesnt like my partner).
He then went on to bypass all confidentiality and tell virtually everyone he knew that I was pregnant and putting him out. When i confronted him he admitted it and said it was a drain on his company and I've essentially made a selfish decision. I was made to feel extremely guilty then on.. I was signed off for 2 weeks with work related stress as it had become unbearable to be around him. When I had a meeting about my issues he said i was full of shit, he later stated in email he didnt say that.. he said ""that's bullshit"", all in regards to my stress stating he didnt beleive in mental health.

A few months past and due to complications in my first pregnancy I was told I'd need more appointments that average. He again said he was put out by this and decided he would sent an email to all female employees (we have another pregnant staff member) stating he was capping all maternity pay to 1 hour and will pay maximum of 1 hour travel, anything past that will be unpaid or from my holiday.. obviously I questioned if he could do that and explained making an appointment in that time was impossible (travel is 1.5hours alone)
He emailed back to say it was being enforced. I sent a grievence as directed by Acas to which he said he would respond in 7 days, on the 7th day no reply so I asked what's happening over text about my grievance. He said ""tomorrow"". Tomorrow came and as I walked into the office he handed myself, the other pregnant employee and a girl he hired a month before a redundancy letter. The worst thing was he was smiling as he it to us. 

His reasons were:
He doesnt have enough work for us.
Brexit
His mental health 
A restructure leading him to drop the bookkeepers (I'm an accounts/client manager)

I appealed naturally to which he ignored again until I reminded him. He then admitted he hadn't read it but chose to reply in 3 hours saying essentially he wont be allowing the appeal to go anywhere. I'm now speaking to Acas for early conciliation. That's where it's at now however yesterday he randomly sent me a contract.
We've spoke during my notice of 4 weeks and hes asked if I want to take any of the bookkeeping on privately (as hes fired us he needs to downsize as it's just him now so naturally some clients are going to go) I said I would be interested in a few however I had no interest it working with him ever again.
This contract states however he will pay me £12 an hour as a subby... which is more than he paid me initially. 

Please advise me what corners I can take him to court on. Is he essentially hiring staff with this contract. What forms of compensation should I go for?

Fast forward three years later and we are catching up once a month on the phone or in person. He is still dating his gf and I’m dating a new guy. My new guy is nice but we don’t have the same interests which is fun at times but strenuous at other times. I’m adventurous and athletic and enjoy hiking, intellectual conversation, and being positive. He prefers to stay inside, is anxious a lot about anything adventurous, tries to convince me to not do fun adventurous things, is pretty negative about anyone or anything I compliment (I guess he feel inferior?) and generally just likes looking at memes and get upset over minor things. He doesn’t tel me he loves me often and I found out some weird shit about him recently and I try to just deny it happened. He basically told me he has a list of girls on his phone who he has fucked and kept nudes other women sent him and he called them him trophies when I said it was really disrespectful for him to keep the nudes of those women and I said he probably masturbates to them still, why else would he keep them? And he insisted it was because they’re trophies. I told him to delete all of mine. 

So basically my ex never did anything like that with me. We are super open and can talk for hours. My boyfriend and I are basically just on our phones all the time (I don’t want to be but since he’s always on it I may as well stay occupied myself....) my ex was my best friend. We broke up because we weren’t good at dealing with conflict and had lots of baggage. He wanted us to stay friends but mature so we wouldn’t fuck our relationship again if we tried in the future. So basically my ex and I have hung out pretty frequently doing all the fun stuff we used to do, like talk about nature, culture, politics, and play sports and reminisce about growing up together (he’s my childhood best friend). My ex gives me extended hugs and extends his visits with me as long as he can, but he never texts me first or initiates hanging out with me... yet is super eager to spend time with me when I do ask. 

Basically is it ok for me to be best friends with my ex and date my bf? My bf doesn’t seem really into me and I kind of feel like I am just his prize cause half the time he doesn’t listen to what I say or when I try to make jokes he doesn’t respond and then later makes a negative comment about it.

He also hardly initiates sex with me and never compliments me.

I just feel like I'm not ready to be working. I don't know what I would do if I did quit. I don't know if it would hurt my career as an engineer and I don't know if I even want to be an engineer. Everyone tells me now is not the time to make big decision but life is big decision and I can't not make them. 

Tdlr: I'm sad about my dad and I don't think I'm ready to be working, but afraid of what would happen if I did quit.",12Oct2019,2
532,"Hello,

I’d love for other’s perspectives to weigh in on an upcoming decision I need to make by Monday.

On Friday my boss approached me and informed me of an opportunity to move to Cork, Ireland for 1 year. I’d be doing the same job, my transportation and rent would be paid for. I’d likely be able to ship whatever I wanted aside from large furniture. Possessions in the states would likely be put into storage on company dime. 

This feels like a big decision to make by Monday! Nonetheless, I need to make it. I live in the Bag Area, I am not from here. All my family resides in Colorado so nothing really changes for them. I’m currently single, turning 28 this week. 

I can think of four major benefits to this:
1.	Professional Gains: I’d be in pseudo leadership position, helping to startup a new lab there. While I wouldn’t be an actual manager I think I’d be positioned as a mentoring engineering. I have been with my company for almost 6 years, however, I am very new in my current role. Only been in the role of an engineer for 6 months, so I’m not terribly experienced yet (I was shocked I was even asked). 
2.	Financial Gains: If I socked away the money I’d be spending on rent instead, I would be able to save tens of thousands of dollars.
3.	Personal Growth: I’ve never lived in another country... never even traveled to another country, ha! So this decision seems a little daunting. I’m certainly not opposed to traveling outside the US, it just has happened yet. So just like my move from CO to CA was different, life changing, and gave my new perceptive, I assume moving to a new culture will be all of that even more amped up.
4.	I may never get another opportunity like this again. I could spend a trip around the sun in Ireland! That sounds really cool. Like something I would always reflect on and remember fondly for the rest of my life.

I can only think of one major downside:
1.	I would be leaving my friends/community I have built up here. Only temporarily, though, of course. But still, it could feel very isolating to move to a new country and know absolutely nobody. I had a couple friends when I moved to the Bay Area so that was extremely helpful. This time, it’d be 100% on my own. 

What am I not considering? Both good and bad? Cork seems like a great place to live. It seems like Ireland is pretty free from conflict. Cork is supposedly a very safe place to live, free from majority of crimes with the exception of a higher than normal homicide rate. 

What are your thoughts?",12Oct2019,1
534,"So the company that I work for thru colaboration with my self employment firm is run by a bunch of really big shitheads. I found myself a new job, with permanent employment with what seems to be really great people and working conditions. I went to my current employers and told them Im going to leave them and they didnt take it well. Im not gonna go into details but the way they run the company is really shitty for the people working for them and their customers, but somehow they dont see it. When I told them they treat me like trash and pay me to litlle the said some things that made me go completely balistic. 
I almost started screaming in the office, I did say some bad things and really got pissed off. 
Then I got home and double checked my contract with them and realized that I fucked up because there is writen 3 month resignation period. I had to apologize in the next days and pretend like Im sorry eventhou I could fucking kill those mtfckrs. What is my next step? Do you think they can hold me and mess with my new employment? Im prepared to work for a month for them and the new employers would wait for me, but 3 months is a long period for them. What is best course of action here in your opinion?

535," There are probably hundreds of posts like that here, but I still have to ask. My best friend and I have been friends for 15 years, inseparable since kindergarten and went through thick and thin. Two years ago I started developing romantic feelings for her, leading to me realizing that I'm bisexual. I've tried to go to dates with different people, but every time it just feels like cheating. After one such date, I was, literally, worried sick. Some time ago I've decided to limit our interaction, thought that maybe It'll go away with time but as you can imagine nothing has changed. We still don't talk as often as we used to, she's confused as to why and I can't tell her about my feelings because I know for a fact that she is straight. It's torture: I can't' talk to her, I'm jealous of her other relationships, we mostly talk at parties when I'm drunk and I'm always afraid to do something I will regret later, but I still want to be with her. I yearn for her touch and afraid to touch her myself. I don't know what to do with it.

Is that an emotional dependency? What should I do? How can I get over it?",12Oct2019,1
536,"[Serious] I just want to ask for opinions or advises from someone who knows about Pregnancy or something related to it. So here it goes, I had been with my girlfriend for almost 7 years, and we never had a child yet, but recently we had intercourse on her period, on her 3rd day of her period to be precise.

[Continuation]Her period started at August 19, we had unprotected intercourse at August 22, and it was almost a month since we had done it, and even if I had withdrawn it before I ejaculated, I felt that some of it was already at the tip before putting it in, and after withdrawing it I know that some of it were left inside her,and every time she has her period it almost ends at the 3rd day because on the following days she just haves spotting, so recently she cheated with me with some guy, and they also had unprotected sex last August 28, and after a month, we found out that she was pregnant, and she doesn't know who the father is, we had a check up on October 2, and the OB based it's age on her last period, 6 weeks and 2 days to be precise, after a day, October 3, we had an ultrasound and the results were the embryo was already .83 cm which matches with their chart of a almost 7 weeks(6 weeks and 5 days to be exact) old embryo, which also matches with the date we had unprotected intercourse if I add up the 1 week menstruation period, and if it was with the guy it would just be 6 weeks old even if I add the 1 week menstruation period, is it possible for me the father ?",12Oct2019,2

538,"I know from the tag line the gut reaction will probably be duh adoption picnic even if you don’t know what exactly I’m talking about so let me explain.

I gave up my baby for adoption for a multitude of reasons almost a year ago.  The agency I choose have an option that every year they have a picnic in which bio mom/families can interact on that one day with the adoptive families. It happens every year and the family I choose for my baby was nice enough to agree to these days.

For anyone questioning why the fuck I wouldn’t go; I don’t know if I’m ready.  I had refused holding my baby in my arms until the moment I was handing to his new momma. I am a depressed mess currently and i have no idea what this will do to my mental state. 

This game with all of my family would be a excellent was to distract myself from this if I choose it. 

I’ve already committed to both since I forgot the days these things were but that doesn’t really matter the adoption agency are very chill and would completely understand along with the family. And on the other side my family would understand if I just said ahhhh oops forgot I had something planned.

The only thing that would suck about going to the picnic is I would be alone going. I was planning on inviting my sis or mom but both are going to the devils game and one person dropping out isn’t sus but more? I don’t want to lie more than I already have.",12Oct2019,1
539,"So to put this as simply and as shortly as I can, my GF and I have been together for nearly four years. We life together and most things that come with that.

I think you get it. Every time I try to be affectionate in a non-bedroom way she acts weird. Like, really weird. It's gotten way worse too where she barely responds to anything at all. Then she makes it blatantly clear that she wants to sleep with me. Like, overtly says so, without realizing that she's killed my desire to do so with everything she's done when I'm trying to be affectionate.  \&amp;nbsp;

541,"My boyfriend and I met a year ago. I had problems growing up in a catholic household where virginity was put on a pedestal so the thought of pre marital sex terrified me. 
Until I hit 24 and drunkenly had sex with my ex. We broke up shortly after and I struggled with it for a year and ended up sleeping with a guy from work. I started to embrace the fact I was a sexual being and that it’s ok for women to have sex. 
Then I met my current boyfriend who I’ve been with for a year and a bit now. Our relationship is great and it’s getting more and more serious. 
Very early on he made a passing comment that he wishes he was my first and that he hates that other men have had me. I know he meant no harm as he didn’t know my past and when he saw the comment upset me he has never said anything since. 
However I know that he had an ex for four years. They broke up six years ago and he’s mentioned that he was her first and that ‘ if they were older things would’ve been different, too young and immature ‘ I’ve mentioned that that made me insecure that he’d have rather been with her and is playing shoulda woulda coulda. He said that I’m being silly. 
I don’t know if I’m being crazy insecure but I can’t help feeling like he feels like he’s left with me and my unpure self and that he wishes he could go back in time so that he could be with a woman who would have only have been with him and him only.

550,"So I need to keep things a bit vague so that way no one I know will find out this is me posting this but I need some advice. I work at a bank as a teller and recently applied for a job in the back office and got it. One of my coworkers at my branch also applied for the position and didn't get it. There were two positions and I did hope that she would get the second one. She also applied before me and I admittedly did only apply after she mentioned she had applied. So I found out yesterday that I got the job and was/am really happy and excited. I will mention that I do have Asperger's so not all social situations are easy for me, but I am able to function ""normally"" in terms of picking up on social cues a lot of the time. Anyways, I was talking with another coworker about how happy I was and that I can't wait to start, basically I was really excited and almost couldn't believe that I actually got the job. I did try not to talk to much about it because that coworker was there and I definitely understand that she is upset, if the roles were reversed I would definitely be upset. So today another coworker and I were talking and she said that the first coworker felt like I was rubbing it in her face. I will say that I was not doing that intentionally, I can understand why she might see it that way, but in reality I'm just excited that I got this job that I wanted.

What I'm looking for in terms of advice is what, if anything should I say to this coworker. Part of me wants to apologize but at the same time I don't know if I should. I don't want to make this worse as we were on friendly terms before and I do understand where she is coming from in this but I also don't want to make myself feel bad for being happy about something good that happened in my life.

557,"three years ago, i lent their son $3000(my parents 1500, and from me 1500) because he was practically begging us because he said he needed it for school. My other aunts and uncles also gave them 1500. He never paid us back. Later I learned that my mom said that he can keep the money and not worry about giving it back. Shortly after we gave him that money, he brought a new car and later on got TWO graduate degrees. Two months ago their parents came to stay at his sister's house. They also stay at our house now and then. We took them shopping, and they wanted us to pay for everything, so we did just to be nice. It was about $300, we also gave them winter supplies and coats. Of course, we don't expect to pay them back the $300, but I keep hinting at the $1500. We feel rude to ask them for the $3000 directly because they wanted to come to Canada for a long time for 20 years, and they finally got their visa so we don't feel like spoiling the mood.

When we went to their home country, they didn't pay for anything, we had to pay for every single thing. So why do they expect us to pay when their staying here in Canada.

She somehow managed to hack into my PRIVATE Instagram that no one except me even knew existed and showed my mom the accounts I followed and I got in trouble (some of the accounts were sexual). 

She also hacked into my other Instagram account and showed my parents a bunch of videos of me smoking (legal in my country) and drinking right before we were gonna go on vacation.

Recently 2 of us left for college and 2 stayed behind for high school, this isn’t really an issue though as most of our time hanging out is either online video games or getting together for a movie or event. 

Over the years I (m) fell pretty hard for a friend (f) that was in our group of 4. We’ll call her, After a few months of sitting on our feelings we both confessed we were into each other and began dating. It lasted for a few really great months but eventually ended (that’s to say, I was dumped and this is what I was told) due to myself going off to college and her still being in high school, as there was a slight age difference. It’s currently been about 2 and a half months since the break up, and she has started to date another guy from the group of 4.

Overall I think I took it pretty easily, I’ve had appropriate time to grieve the relationship and move on. Naturally, I get uncomfortable when they act “relationshipy”, but they’ve been pretty respectful about it all and I’m genuinely okay with it. 

Yet lately I’ve noticed a sharp decline in the activity in chats, in how much each of them is speaking to me, things I’m told about, etc. and this is from all 3 of them.

She kept telling me that she couldn't because I hurt her too much. I know that if she gave me another chance I could make her the happiest person in the world. She loved me a lot. She said she still loved me but couldn't be with me. After a few days of constant tears and no sleep, I finally contacted one of her best friends for help. We talked for about an hour on the phone, and she agreed to talk to my ex. Her best friend told me that begging her only pushed her away more. And realizing that's true hurts a lot. Anyways, they talked yesterday. The only thing her friend told me was that my ex ""needed to clear her head"" and then she would text me. That was 26 hours ago and I haven't been able to sit still. I'm so nervous. I don't know what to say when she texts me. I have never used reddit before but I can't screw this up. I need to do everything in my power to win this girl back. Any advise would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",12Oct2019,2

574,"I’m Male 182cm tall lanky slim framed and pale with a receding hairline so yea I’m fucked when it comes to looks. I’m a kissless virgin. And most  girls treat me like shit despite the fact they need makeup to look attractive yet they have that ‘ewwww how dare you even look at me’ attitude on them if I do. I don’t leave the house except for 6 hours a week to work at a football  stadium as somebody there to help. sometimes it’s ok but other times it’s very difficult. I always get put on the shitty jobs (part of being ugly) and there’s times I blatantly get stared at because I’m ugly. Last week some fat young guy walked past me stared at me walking past it was obvious what he was thinking yet he had severe acne all round his mouth and was vastly overweight.  don’t ever wanna leave the house for it. Just last week I was at work at that stadium job and a girl and her dad was standing drinking the girl looked at me with a blank stare (I only stared back because I thought she needed help with something as that’s wha I’m there for) and she looked back up to her dad with a disgusted look on her face, yet she had tons of makeup on like it was a mask, it really got me down tbh as I was having an anxiety free day for once. Also the there’s a guy who’s a higher up authority on my part  I work and he’s younger than me and all he does is stare at me like I have 3 heads and looks me down because I’m skinny. I don’t wanna ever leave the house. I never knew being ugly would make life so difficult. Sometimes when it’s cold I wear a hat and a snood and it helps a lot tbh.  I have bad depression too so it’s difficult to not look very tired and pale too. And tired of trying to help someone when it’s a women and they’re snotty I take it personally. The most painful thing is when a women will be cold towards me even when iv not done or said anything wrong but will open up to the attractive guys even if he’s a complete douche. 5 years ago a gorgeous girl had a crush on me but she will be the only girl who will ever like me :(",12Oct2019,0

592,"Essentially we are all going to be 16 at least by June 2020, and part of my friend group (3 other males) have decided to go backpacking in Europe for a WHOLE FUCKING MONTH. When I was told and invited, I was psyched for it. A month of Europe, alcohol, and more with some close friends? Hell yeah. All our parents are fine with it. It’ll cost me just over 1,000 Euros and I can get 500 of that easily. The other 500 I must work (and get paid) for. This means from October —&gt; May -  I need to get my _first_  job, somehow save and earn 500, as well as organise my part of the trip (we decided that some time in November we are all gonna split up the responsibility). 

The problem is that I have a severe lack of confidence in my own maturity and ability to handle a trip like this. I don’t wanna be stupid, and smoke or drink, but who knows?!? It should be fun but I feel it is unrealistic now the novelty of such an idea has left me, I am quite daunted by it. My desire to join them has gone entirely and to be honest; a month spent with them is probably too much. What if we argue, y’know?

Anyway, recently I concluded that I feel this trip is better off without myself and in all honesty I have lost my enthusiasm for it. But nobody in my friend group knows. At all. As far as they are concerned, we are all stoked for a month without adults. I really have lost my ‘want’ to go on this trip. But what if I change my mind? How do I **know** this is what I want?

595,"Hello everyone. This is maybe a wrong place to post this but I need advice from you guys. As you can see from the title I have a friend, to be more precise bestfriend, who is constantly flirting with me and she does that on purpose. I have told her 3 years ago that I am in love with her, and she was to, but some things I did (I was 15 years old, child lol) she did not want to be my gf. 
""Unfortunately"" after I told her that, I was in love with her for 2 more years because of impact she left on me in those 2 years (hanging out and stuff) and she has everything I want on a women, but nevermind that. I was trying really hard, but she always denied me.
Now after those 2 years have passed, we are bestfriends. I know, she friendzoned me I get it, but the main reason why I want her for bestfriend is beacuse we would always hang out and laugh all the time (and that is somethinng you want in today modern world, right?). And we always helped each other through the dark times.
Now lets get back on the real stuff I want advice on. She is in relationship for 2 years, and tbh in a unhealthy relationship (fights, arguing). Recently she has been flirting with me CONSTANTLY and I mean that when I say it. She never like never told me that she loves me even like a friend, but know she tells me that every other day. She touches me when she wants, especially my hands, and the other day she jumped on me like she wanted to have sex or something (lol). She even went on coffee with me, yet she never in a past wanted to (beacuse of her bf). But here is the problem, I asked her why she does this, and she did not want to reply like not even a word. I asked her if she wants to be my gf (even though I am not in love with her anymore there is a still and always will be a dose of her in me, because of impact she left on me) she replied no, and she still is continuing to flirt with me like WTF.
What should I do guys ? Should I stop her somehow or what, I am really confused, like REALLY.",12Oct2019,2
596,"Hello, everyone. This is my first time on this sub, and I hope it’s the right place to be posting this and forgive me for its length.?I don’t have many people I can open up to and look to answers/help for. I am posting this because I am currently living with my mother again due to a physical disability and a myriad of mental illnesses (I am 22 years old). I don’t have a choice right now but to live with her and have her help me with medical related things. I love my mother, however unfortunately, she is, in my opinion, severely mentally ill. She is officially diagnosed with obsessive compulsive personality disorder (I believe anyone familiar with it knows it extends into more than cleanliness and has qualities of other personality disorders), which I too have, but affects my life to a much lesser extent.

My mother doesn’t realize how ill she is. She may clean something vigorously and say, “Oh haha, that old OCD!” Though, it’s much, much more serious than that. She is the definition of an obsessive cleaner. It is genuinely frightening how fervently she cleans and how absolutely hostile she is while doing it.

I suffer from PTSD myself... I become very triggered when she cleans (a very long history of this), because she cleans so aggressively. It is especially bad when  she comes barging into my space and starts hawkishly cleaning, literally a millimeter away from me (or even on me), while she indignantly huffs and puffs; incredibly annoyed by something as simple as not cleaning up a water spill with the grain of our tile floor. 

Unfortunately, her necessity for cleanliness extends beyond objects as well... or to put it one way, she has classified me as an object which must maintain the upmost cleanliness at all times. I do not smell or have any other offensively dirty habits, I do respect that I live with her and her husband, and I try my best to maintain relative cleanliness. However, anyone who suffers from depression and similar mental illnesses realize how hard it can be to do simple self care things, like change a pair of pants daily or brush your hair properly... hell, even get out of bed.

To get to the point. Again, my mother has stratified me into an object. She chides on me day in and day out. It has been this way as long as I’ve been alive. Again, I am 22, and although depressed, I again, have the faculties necessary to keep reasonably clean. My mother however, will tell me how filthy I look, how my hair looks like a rats nest, that if I want to be seen in public with her (when I’m not wearing revealing attire, merely comfortable sweatpants), I absolutely must change my clothes. She tells me I look like a homeless individual while I’m relaxing at home, shaming me into changing in my own living quarters, on nearly a daily basis. She will literally retie my shoe laces if they don’t fit her standard... the list goes on and on. Though, I’m certain you’ve grasped the idea at this point. Similarly, however, she is under the impression that making jokes about people’s insecurities is totally fine and is genuinely puzzled when others are not amused. This is also very frustrating and another long story with a long history.

Anyhow, just this afternoon she told me that my pants looked filthy... I can see how ridiculous getting bothered by that sounds. But lord, was it ever the straw that broke the camel’s back. She makes me feel so insane. Her madness rubs of on me... I feel like all the terrible things she calls me. I truly need some external confirmation that she is the crazy one... I understand getting upset feeds into her sickness, so it’s not as though I am entirely without fault. However, this is an honest cry for help. Am I alone in this? Does anyone have any advice on defusing these situations, or something similar, like how to stay calm, and realize it’s her, not me. Any comments are more than appreciated and would ease my mind greatly. Please, someone. Thank you, if you are still reading... this is the most difficult thing I’ve ever had to articulate and write. I’ve always tried my best to see the best in my mom (hold her world view and see eyes to eye), but I am old enough now that I see the illness more.

PS: I will be talking to my therapist about this when I have the opportunity to see her, but it’s going to be a few days until I have that chance.

608,"I’ve never posted on reddit before but I’m in need of some unbiased advice and there’s no one else I can really talk to about this.

I live in a college and I’m coming to the end of my first year here. I live on a mixed floor of about 20 people that I didn’t know before moving here so we all made friends with each other. First semester was really great; we all got along so well and I became pretty close with three other girls on the floor, one of them in particular (we even travelled a little bit during the mid year holidays). I really felt I clicked with these people and for a while I felt really relaxed and secure in my place in the friendship circle.

Semester 2 has been a lot tougher. I suppose it kinda started when I started a ‘thing’ with one of the guys on the floor and now it’s turned into dating. End of semester 1, turned out we both liked each other and we wanted to see where it could go but also didn’t feel comfortable telling everyone bc ‘floorcesting’ is frowned upon. Fast forward about 2 months into semester 2 and the truth about us came out in a really ugly way, thanks to these girls. I’d snuck off with this guy on a night out and the girls overacted about my safety even after I said I was ok. This turned into a massive fight which dug up a lot of surprised problems we had. I was made to feel as if the whole thing was my fault and I’d betrayed them, not bc I didn’t tell them about him, but bc they thought I didn’t care or respect them. I couldn’t defend myself against anything they said, I could only accept what they were saying. I apologised profusely for anything they brought up, simply wanting everything to just go back to being friends. But they told me we could never be like the way we were before, and the girl I was particularly close to didn’t know whether she could be friends with me anymore. This was roughly a month ago. Since then, I have been working my butt off to reconnect with them and honestly I thought I was making some ground.

To make matters more complicated, a new girl joined the floor this semester. Really lovely girl and we get on pretty well. However, because there was some distance between myself and the other girls, she’s ended up getting closer with them and making me feel like I’m being replaced. I’ve been noticing over the last couple of weeks I’ve been subtly excluded from things. Concerts, photos, not enough seats in a car, breakfast at a cafe. Nothing big, but just enough to feel a little hurt.

Now for what just happened to prompt this post. To pick who you live with next year at college, you form a quad of 4 rooms and then that quad is put with other quads to form a floor. We have to submit these preferences to the college before the end of the month. This has been causing my a lot of stress and anxiety recently bc obviously I can count and there’s too many people for 4 rooms. I brought it up with two of the girls about a week ago, asking if they’ve thought of their preferences yet. They told me not yet, recognising the awkward position we have. This was a relief for me. I thought ok there’s still time we can talk about this and figure something out.

Yesterday, the girl I was close to and the new girl came into my room and told me they had already organised and submitted their quad a while ago and, obviously, I wasn’t in it. They did this before I had spoken to the other girls. 

I am absolutely devastated. I don’t have that many friends at college, and not enough to form a another quad with. I saw this coming but thought we were going to talk about it like adults BEFORE they did anything. I thought we could work something out so no one was left out, form a three and a two instead of one quad or agree for someone to not be in the quad but be on the same floor. It seems they were not interested in doing this. They went behind my back to get the choice they wanted regardless of me and now they’ve told me when I don’t have a choice in the matter. As a courtesy or something.

If you’ve somehow still reading this long post, am I right to be upset? Am I overreacting? Do these people care about me at all? Is it worth trying to negotiate to be with them? Is it even worth trying to be friends with them after they treated me like this? Any advice would be great, I need other perspectives cause right now I can’t help blaming myself for absolutely everything.

617,"Hi,

I have tiger parent(s) that want me to be successful, but my dad in particularly (and mom used to) tends to compare me to my childhood friend. Who goes to Yale. He constantly compares me to him whenever something scholarly comes up. This has been going on since middle school, ever since I didn't make it into this exam school (which is one of the popular high schools here that have a reputation for excellence). 

I understand that he wants me to be successful but why is there a stigma that I have to go to Yale or Harvard to be successful? Success shouldn't have a standard right? I think this constant comparison has made me develop negative feelings towards my childhood friend. Every time he brings it up, it almost immediately triggers me now, I'm tired of hearing about my friend's success. I just wish I was supported for my own.   


I'm trying to bust my ass in college to show my father my ""success"". But I always dreamed of being a streamer or content creator, just playing games. But I barely have time for games let alone just streaming for fun. I don't know what I can do at this point, I don't want to be this puppet and I don't have the support to do what I want to do.",12Oct2019,2

619,"i called it quits with a friend a few months ago. we were having repeated misunderstandings because i didn’t feel listened to and, as a result, i was being salty and it was pissing her off.

i’ve grown in the last few months and i believe more was at play than just her immaturity(this is what i told myself).

i know i have problems voicing my feelings and i recognize this played a large part in our conflicts.

we started following each other on social media and we’ve even interacted in small ways. is it okay to go back into things IF we do it responsibilities and recognize that open communication is the only way it will work?",12Oct2019,1
620,"I've been roommates with my best friend for the past few years, but there's one thing I can't stand. They hog the washer and dryer. I'd say 90% of the time either one or both are filled with their clothes. I've attempted to talk to them about it but they are absolutely steadfast in their very specific way of drying and washing. Washing isn't the issue, it the drying. On a good day, if their on top of it, they dry their clothes 4 times on the delicate setting (20min cycle). I do a single 60min cycle. One hour doesn't sound bad, but they will constantly 'forget' and start over from cycle 1, or they'll just not do their laundry and leave their clothes in the dry for days on end. This ends up delaying their wash as well. And since this cycle takes so long they constantly have another load to go. This means a single load of laundry can be running from dawn to midnight, on a 'good day'.

So it goes like this. Build up pile (roughly 4 loads usually), get home from work, washes load 1, dry load 1, wash load 2, dry, dry, goes to sleep, wake up, dry, goes to work, gets home from work, dry, dry, goes to dinner, forgets for 4 days, dry, dry, dry, forgets again, goes to work, dry, dry, dry, dry, folds load 1. Rewashes load 2, dries load 2, washes load 3...

As you can guess, this is a massive waste of electricity and of course prevents me from doing my laundry. When I talk to them they get defensive. Excuses range from ""It's a bunch of dress shirts."" (along with towels, t-shirts, underwear, and shorts) ""That's how you're supposed to dry things so nothing shrinks."" (despite never having a problem with I do laundry in a single cycle) to ""you know I always dry it like this, why are you getting so upset about it now?"" (That's why I keep bringing it up)

Typically I will circumvent this by pulling out their clothes from the dryer and doing my laundry, this doesn't work if their in the apartment (apparently it's super rude). Or I will annoy them about it each time the buzzer goes off. 

What can I do to convince them or force them to break their abserd drying habit?",12Oct2019,2
621,"Hi reddit,

I live in a sleepy little town in SoCal with a few roommates. We live in a duplex in a residential area full of families, and apparently some punk kids, because my pumpkins keep getting stolen.

Our neighbors all dress their houses up for Halloween—we are recent college grads and don’t really have the money to spend on extravagant decor. So we buy tiny little pumpkins to put around our front door. First, two were stolen so we replaced them. Then one of the replacements was stolen. Today the rest were stolen.

I know it’s a prank but it pisses me off because we don’t really have the extra funds to keep buying replacements all month. So how would you guys go about getting back? I thought about buying one more pumpkin and rubbing a spicy pepper over it or something (we have peppers that are pretty painful to get in your eyes) but open to other ideas that may be more playful and less mean.",12Oct2019,1

623,"so for some context i have a friend that was raped when she was young and it's obviously a very touchy subject. about 3 months ago she broke off a very toxic relationship with a very toxic person and her ex knew about her past. after they officially broke up, said ex started saying stuff like ""you're never gonna get anywhere in life because you'll always have that rape in the back of your mind holding you back"" causing my friend to have a really bad anxiety attack. my friend blocked them on everything and she calmed down but we have screenshots of what her ex said to her. for more context me and my friend are graduated and her ex is a senior in high school and the screenshots apparently got around school but nothing has happened. is there anything i can do to ruin them? is there a law or something that has anything to do with targetting rape victims?",12Oct2019,1

628,"So I’ve been having a lot of problems already lately but this has been bothering me for a long time. I have a group of friends at school that everyone at school, hates them but not me and people have been telling me to leave them after the incidents of racism and peer pressure that happened to me which was caused by my friends. They had caused most of my breakdowns and bullying. My friends haven’t been bullied but some of older years have been picking on me since I hang around them and don’t talk much. So they set the target on me. The next two years passed, I was still picked on then one day they surrounded me and I cried for help then teachers got involved. Later in the year, they were gone...
And each time, I hang out with them, they ditch me and shout at me in public like, “Hurry the fuck up, BITCH!” I got used to it but lately I was having a really bad breakdown at school and they laughed at me and would say they’re depressed then make excuses why they were and said they don’t need to go get an diagnosis since they was so sure. They would call me depressed as in the mental illness but I’m not, I’m just upset and stressed. They have even forced me to do things that I didn’t want to do and separated me from old friends when I try to meet someone. They’ve also been telling me their issues about friendships like petty arguments though at that point, I’ve told them that I’m having my own problems at home but I end needing to fix it myself as they are really stubborn and they are really insensitive sometimes when someone cries, they laugh and insult them even more later making them feel worse.  

I really don’t know anymore since they’re the only people I can hang around since the rest of my other friends I talk to are from other schools and everyone has their own group already. People tell me lately that they aren’t friends but I don’t think they’re that bad...

What should I do? If I say anything, they’ll isolate me from others and start rumors. Not all of them are bad, three of them are nice to me but they are in different classes and always hang with the others. The last person who got kicked out was hated and had rumors around them but they are really nice and kind. So I’m scared...",12Oct2019,1

I told mom after few months, she said she'd talked to him and was told he didn't touch me, he was only trying to cover me. I tried to move out but had to move back in when mom started to get sick. I gave him another chance and thought maybe I'm just scared of men that's why I thought he touched me but, he would often ask me to kiss him on his chicks and would often almost kiss his lips. I would move away but he forces himself to kiss my chicks instead. I am always scared.

631,"My [20F] best friend [21F] is severely depressed, and is struggling with everyday tasks. We’re both attending the same university, but she rarely goes to class. We’re both in the marching band and there’s another club we’re both a part of. She’s still involved into those two activities because 1) there’s a lot of accountability and no room to slack off and 2) they’re the only aspects of life that she feels competent and isn’t falling far behind, so she feels actually feels motivated to participate. Other than band practice, club meetings, and occasionally hanging out with friends, she does nothing. Her sleep schedule and diet are really inconsistent, and she just isn’t taking care of herself. She’s gone to therapy before, but isn’t going right now. She says she wants to go back to therapy and ask about medication, but she’s struggling to get past the barrier of making the appointment and then actually showing up.

The main problem I’m asking about, though, is her house. According to her, it’s filthy (she lives alone except for her 2 cats). I haven’t seen it recently because she won’t let me come over, but I believe her. She’s been telling me for weeks that she’s going to clean it, but she hasn’t. The last time she cleaned it there were 2 month old dishes in the sink, and when she tried to wash them she found maggots in the sink and that caused her to have a bit of a mental breakdown. Her fridge broke, which wasn’t her fault, but she never cleaned it out so it’s full of food that has been sitting at room temperature for about 3 weeks, so she’s afraid to open it, but she can’t call anyone to come fix it because her house is too filthy. Before her depression got worse, her neatness level was very normal- she wasn’t a neat freak, but not a slob either, so this isn’t like her.

I’ve been offering her emotional support, like friends do, but I also really want to help her in a practical way. The reason I especially want to help with her house is because it’s been a major source of stress and frustration for her lately, and it’s definitely making her mental health worse, which just becomes a cycle. She tells me she hates being at home and that she really wants to fix it, but she’s just overwhelmed and so she feels trapped. She’ll sit down and write out plans and to do lists, but doesn’t accomplish them.

I’ve offered to help her clean several times and she’s definitely on board with that, the problem is that she’s too embarrassed to let me come over before she gets rid of the worst of it. We’ve made plans several times for her to clean on her own for a couple hours and get the worst of it, and then I’ll come over and help, and she seems enthusiastic about it, but then flakes when it actually comes time to do it. I just want to help her but I’m not sure what to do. I’ve thought about just coming over and cleaning even when she insists overwise, but I’m afraid that might cross a line. I just want to help without crossing any boundaries. Any advice for me and/or my friend would be greatly appreciated.",12Oct2019,1

633,"Hey guys and gals, 

So, I [30M] met this guy [25M] on an online dating app. We've spent the past number of days talking endlessly. We mesh phenomenally well (like, to the point of bouncing dialogue back and forth without missing a beat, as well as being my intellectual equal),  and it's safe to say that I like him (he's told me he digs me as well, which is shocking considering that I see myself as a swamp troll). 

He told me he wants to start platonically, which is understandable, because I don't want to ruin a good thing and push him into something he's not ready for. I genuinely am beginning to care about this guy. But I have anxiety living rent free in my head, telling me that he hates me, I'm going to be forever alone (you know, standard anxiety thoughts), so on. 

So, given that he wants to start platonic for now, humble Redditors, how do I go about neither scaring him off nor ending up in the friend zone? He's really something special.

Thank you guys all so much! Enjoy your weekend!",12Oct2019,0

635,"First of all, to give the situation some background, I’m a 16 year old in my sophomore year of highschool. I’ve played all kinds of different sports since I was 6 but once I got in to highschool I settled on tennis in the fall, track in the spring, and I’m going to start taking boxing lessons this winter once I get my car. Recently, a few of my friends have been telling me to ditch track and to play rugby with them in the spring. It’s a no cut sport at my school so there isn’t a lot of pressure to be a star player, but I’m worried that I’d be putting myself in danger if I tried it out. I’m not especially big for my age (5’9” and 140 lbs.) and I’m currently excelling in my academics with honors level classes. I love trying new things and I did play tag rugby when I was much younger, but that’s obviously much different from full contact. At the same time, I ran a 58 second 400m during last year’s track season and varsity time at my school for that race is 53.5 seconds, which means if I trained during the winter I could probably make varsity time for track before the end of the school year. I’d really like to hear an opinion from somebody else on whether I should go out and try rugby or if I should stick with what I already have going with track and keep myself from getting hurt.",12Oct2019,1

Turns out she was the one who was planning this and inviting people.  One of my guy friends(This guy has a girlfriend) told me everything and that i shouldn't go in order to not make it awkward towards her which kind of makes sense. But the truth is that i wanted to watch it with them, who wouldn't want to watch movies with friends right? Now i'm feeling left out and out of respect i just said ""It's fine and thanks for the invite though."". Basically the thing is that i have liked her for quite some time now and most of our common friends know about my feelings towards her. I haven't told her yet on how i have liked her for a long time. Maybe she knew towards my actions or have been told by one of my friends. 

One backstory that could have triggered this would be that I texted her on social media that she looked pretty and this was from a couple of weeks ago after the birthday party of one of our friends which I also probably made hints through my actions(On the day of our friends birthday party, we played table tennis and got a bit sweaty and she didn't bring any tissue/towel/face towel so i got her a lot of tissues for wiping off the sweat and she said thanks). Then didn't communicate on social media for two weeks up until now. Maybe she hated me for that or something else? I'm not good at these types of thing due to the lack of experience of relationships(meaning that i haven't had a girlfriend yet and I'm almost turning 30.) On Mondays, on our badminton games, she will be most of the time chatting with some of our friends on breaks, and I recently haven't had the guts to talk to her on a deep conversation. Only short talks.

We will meet(Her) on Monday for a weekly badminton game. And i don't know what to say or how to open up a conversation after hearing this from our friends.

My Kindergarten kid was so excited about running, so I signed us up for the one mile and bought us new running shoes.

I am not in shape at all but want my kids to have healthy lives. I want to be healthier for them also.

The race started and my child did exactly what he was supposed to, he took off running super fast, as fast as he could. 

Terrifyingly, I lost sight of him in the crowd of runners.

I caught up with him after he crossed the finish line. He was crying and had asked an adult to help him find his family. 

I feel so awful, just totally messed this up, messed up, parenting fail. 

My question is how do I help him process this and heal so he is not afraid to run again? 

He was talking about training with me for the 5K, working up to that next year before this race, but when I mentioned it after the race, he told me that he never wants to race again because he will be afraid of getting lost. 

I tried to focus on the good parts of the run, showed him photos of the day and told him how proud I am of him. I told him it was great he ran so fast and that I was so sorry I run so slow. 

He wouldn't look at the photos I took of the run before it began and later of him and his medal. He told me he never wants to see the photos because they remind him of when he got lost. 

I wanted to support him in having a great experience today and build up his confidence in something he really enjoys, running, but I ruined this and I don't know what to do now. 

In the past I was a total hover mother, but I kind of tried to relax a bit because he was surrounded by parents and kids I knew, cops were present closed down street for the run, etc...there were run monitors all over. 

I felt so bad that I couldn't keep up with him, that instead he crossed the finish line and felt totally alone like we left him, vanished and he was sad and scared. 

I still remember getting lost in Disneyland as a kid.

We talked fairly frequently but I wanted to keep it on the low down when it came to my friends (we both went to single sex grammar schools) but it eventually got out that I liked her and one of my friends told someone that went to the girls school and she found out. I kind of thank him for it because I don’t know if I would’ve told her on my own before we became to good of friends. 

She later confronted me (around a month ago at this point) about it and I told her. I kind of expected her to say no because she had told me a couple of weeks before that basically, she never felt like she’s loved someone before, like actual love. 

So she said no, but we agreed to be friends because like I said, I was pretty much expecting her to say no but I still wanted to be friends with her because I really like her personality.

After that, I just couldn’t get her out of my head, I don’t know why. She just always stuck in my head and I would constantly think about her in school, at home or anywhere. It’s really annoying because I want to be friends with her, but I just feel like I can’t get over her rejecting me. 

We still talk every now and then, but recently, she posted on her Instagram close friend’s story, a picture of her holding hands with someone (pretty sure it’s a boy) holding hands, and it said “Love of my life🥰💕🥵” and it really messed with me.

I don’t think I deserve her cause I’m not and in rl and I want her to be happy, but I just can’t get over her and that post on her story just got to me.

650,"There’s this guy in my class that’s from the hood n shit and he gets real touchy with people a lot. He usually hugs a lot of girls and stuff like that. Sometimes he’ll like come from behind while i’m sitting down and hug me for no reason, shit like that. He doesn’t do it often to me but last time he did it he went way over the line. He went from behind and started pressing on my stomach which was weird and I didn’t know what to do. Then at the very last moment he presses on my crotch area. I was shocked and idk what to do. He was supposedly like a friend/acquaintance. This dude supposedly straight as he had a few girlfriends he was sexually active with. Also I’m shorter than him so idk if this some establishing dominance kind of thing or something he does to cope with living in poverty. I contemplated beating him up but i’ve never been in a fight and it’s not worth it as id probably lose and be expelled. (He’s been in a lot of fights, is resistant to knockouts.)

651,"So I want to keep some details vauge to keep identities safe but the situation is as follows.

So my SO is currently at a university she was forced to attend by her parents, since being there she has been on a sharp decline into depression and I have been seeing it on a daily basis. She is aware of this as she knows that is whats causing it, She has spoken to her parents about the matter however they have brushed her away and said ""you will get over it"" and ""we all have to do things we dont like"". She currently feels trapped because of that and knows they wont listen to her as they seem more focused on their image and and how it looks if she walks away from it despite the fact she wants to leave and apply elsewhere that she would be more comfortable as she would have picked the place to go as opposed to doing what they force her to do.

Because of being ignored by them she feels afraid to stand up to them and tell them that the depression cause by the place is putting her in some bad places. I currently don't know how to help as i have tried to comfort her and encourage her to make the choices she needs to make so she can be happy but I dont know how else to help without confronting the parents myself as that would mean I get to involved with their matters.

Any advice would help if anyone else has found themselves in that situation?",12Oct2019,1
652,"About a month ago, I was visiting my in-laws. I had recently got my gums contoured (something I had been wanting to do for years and was super excited about) and I was showing them the results. We talked about the procedure for less than a minute, and them moved on to other subjects. Five minutes later, my mother-in-law goes up to me and says ""let me see your smile again"". I smiled wide feeling confident in my smile. She looks at me and says ""now all you need to do is get your lips done so that you can have a nice smile"". Confused and completely taken by surprise, I tried to laugh it off. I told her that I didn't want to get my lips done and that I liked my lips the way they were. This was true - I had never considered lip fillers and I never thought that my lips were that small (they definitely aren't big but they also aren't that small). She then said ""No really you need to get your lips done, they're too small"". I froze - I didn't know what to say. My husband, who was also taken by surprise just started saying how he liked my lips. She replied that I should really at least get filler in my top lip because it really just was too small. Then my husband told her that she can get lip filler is wanted and her and my father-in-law started talking about how nice her lips were naturally and that she didn't need filler which made me feel even worse.   
We left a couple minutes afterwards. The second I got out of the door I started bawling. Being a relatively confident person, I was surprised at my reaction. I was completely heart-broken, and humiliated. I was used to her commenting about my looks (saying that I am too pale, telling me that I'm too skinny, telling me that I have acne), but this was different. I didn't know how a person could just look at me in the eyes and tell me I need to change my face - especially someone that hasn't had any cosmetic procedures done herself. 

The next day, I made a decision to brush it off. My in-laws acted as if nothing happened so I did too. But that night, I noticed that I developed all these new insecurities. When I look in the mirror, I focus on my lips. When I take pictures, I focus on my lips - an insecurity I never had before. Throughout this month, instead of my frustration towards my mother-in-law going away, it has gotten worse and worse. I get an instant head-ache and anxiety just from being around her.

 I'm so upset that she made me feel this way, but I don't want to be upset. She hasn't even apologized. My husband just acts like she doesn't know better and that she doesn't mean to hurt my feelings but I don't know why someone would say that to another person. I don't know what to do. I don't know if I'm overreacting, if I'm too sensitive. I don't know what I can to feel better about it and let it go.",12Oct2019,1

656,"So, I’m in a club at my university that’s trying to do a movie event (free admission) to raise money to donate to a charity for victims of Hurricane Dorian. 

In order to show a movie on campus, you need public performance rights (a license to show the movie), which you can get from the movie’s distributor. The thing is, it appears that the company that distributes our movie of choice has gone out of business (I only have one source for this but even if they’re still around they have NO contact information online). So, we can’t really get the rights to show the movie if there’s no one to contact. 

We also tried our second option for a movie and that one does have a distributor but they’d be charging us too much to show that movie. (We do not have the money for this. We only have the money for the snacks and drinks that we’ll be preparing to sell - and those profits go towards the donations. The cost of showing that movie may be more than the amount we’d even be able to donate, which defeats the whole purpose of the event. 

So I’ve been looking into ways to get rights to the first movie, but I’m honestly stuck. So do you guys have any advice as to what to do? We’ve tried contacting other companies associated with the movie but they’re not listed as the distributor so would that even work? Is the movie considered public domain if the distributor goes out of business and is not replaced? I’ve heard that, depending on the type and size of the event, the cost of the license can be little to nothing - does a small charity event count? I’m quite lost and stressed at the moment.

A number of reasons why. One being that I struggle with mental health (anxiety/depression). Another being that I've never found training to be any good at any workplace (I don't know if I've just had bad luck) so I tend to find the job more difficult than I should. Everyone around me seems to get on with work fine, but I just take longer to learn than most (never had any issues at school, so I assume my brain works alright haha). But yeah, I, like everyone starting a new job, get nervous but I'm now at the past 2 months point in my current job, still finding it difficult in a variety of ways and still beyond anxious- today I started welling up on the shop floor. 

Retail is the only job sector that I'm able to find work in (around the area I live)- I'm always on the look out for other jobs in different sectors, but years have gone by and I can't find anything.

661," I'm a high school student, and I'm currently in a different country, as an international student. I'm supposed to go home soon for a couple of months and then come back. It's not like I'm going to be studying or going to school there, my parents just want me back. But what they don't know is that I am very traumatized by my home country. As a kid, I was pretty chunky. I didn't notice or care about it at first, all I wanted was more food. But as soon as I started attending elementary school, I got bullied. Thankfully, it was just this one random girl ( I'll call her Susan ), who would basically go around insulting every boy in class. To this day, I don't know why, but she was especially harsh on me. She would throw her leftover food on the floor and make me eat it, infront of everyone. I was a shy kid back then, and all I could do was obey. After a year of suffering, I told my parents. They were infuriated, and they were constantly arguing with Susan's family. I learned to ignore her, and she soon became a nobody in school, after numerous complaints from other parents. When I turned 9, I went abroad, without my parents, to go to school at a different country, just for 6 months. Right away, I fell in love with my environment. I had the best experience there, with lots of friends and a caring homestay family. Sadly, I had to come back. I was bigger than ever, weighing 120 pounds at 4'1. I was under lots of pressure from my family. They wanted me to have top notch grades while losing weight. This only annoyed me, and I started spending at least 20$ on food and snacks every day. My parents were confused, because the numbers on my scale just kept on going up and up. The following year, I started playing soccer, which brought my weight down to average. I also took up swimming, which also helped. But I was in a lot of pain, due to an abnormal bone growing in my foot. I had to quit all sports, and I gained even more weight. Whenever I went out in public, people would stare and laugh. I would stay inside most of the time, making up lies to skip school at least twice a week. I was addicted to video games, spending at least $100 on it per week. I grew further and further from my parents. I was a bad brother to my younger siblings, and now, they're addicted to games as well. My grades dropped, and this continued for 2 years. I was sent to a boarding school at 12 years old. I managed to quit gaming, but I was very obese. I was around 200 pounds at 5'1. All the kids in my class would  act friendly around me whenever I had money, but were rude and arrogant most of the time. They would always comment on how I needed to lose weight, deliberately taking my clothes and laughing about how big they were. I got into lots of fights, and the teachers never cared. After 6 months, I moved to another boarding school. I wish I didn't. Students of the lower grades were forced to do whatever the older students said. We would have to bend our backs and almost salute them whenever they passed by. Strangers both in and out of school would laugh at how fat I was. I always stayed in my dorm room, eating even more under the covers. I never studied, and therefore I failed all my classes. During winter break, I practically starved myself, and I lost around 40 pounds in a month. I was still kind of fat, but not as much. I repeated 8th grade, and things seemed to be fine when I started feeling horrible all the time. I couldn't run, and I was too anxious to eat anything. I was merely eating 200 calories a day. January of 2019 was when I dropped out of school, and started planning to study abroad. I lost even more weight, and got to 120lbs at 5'6. Pretty skinny, actually. But all that bullying and suffering made me antisocial and depressed. I had permanent scars on my arm, from my darkest times. I've gotten my life together ever since I've moved here. I have lots of friends and I play multiple sports. I cook my own healthy food, and I've gained a lot of muscle. Im around 140 pounds at 5'8. But whenever I think of going back to that horrible country, I get depressed. My parents insist in me coming back for 1-3 months, but I don't think I can stand it there. Whenever I see anything in that country's language or culture, I immediately look away. What should I do?",12Oct2019,1

673,"Long story short, I have a pretty tight knit friend group of about 5 people and one of them has a fiancée named “George” that didn’t get on everyone’s good side once upon a time. He was kinda weird and flirtatious, and even at one point pretty much hit on every single friend in the group.

But once we confronted the behavior and told our friend about it, it seemed to clear up and the fiancée apologized. All seemed okay again. At my friends insistence, we still included fiancée in group activities.

I’d say over the last year now, fiancée is maturing a lot and me and the rest of the friend group have actually befriended him.

Now this is where things get stupid because now our friend is jealous that we’re being friendly and hanging out with her fiancée. She does this thing where she loudly sighs and becomes upset during hangouts if her fiancée doesn’t include her in conversations and talks just to us. I wish I could describe it better, but the behavior is just petty. She’ll roll her eyes, or just simply sulk as the fiancée keeps talking to us and grab onto his arm and just stare off into the distance. When we try to bring her in, it’s like she’s already shut down. 

I’d say 9/10 times during the past couple months, during hangouts or house parties, this friend will get mad if fiancée is not paying attention to her and to us instead, and insists they have to leave after a while because she came down with a stomach ache. She throws us super dirty looks and now she won’t reply to group texts or anything. 

She’s been very short lately with me and made a comment the other day that I’d probably only come over to see her if George was there. I ignored it because wtf. 

This is getting pretty annoying on my end and I want to step up and say something but this friend is pretty delicate and I know it’ll upset her whatever I say. I just want her to realize that she’s the one who wanted him included and that’s what we’re trying to do. We’re not trying to purposely exclude her.

List of symptoms
I'm always forgetting things, from names to keys to that wasabi dish I was supposed to grab for table 7 twenty minutes ago.
I can't sit still (always shaking my legs, even as I write this)
I get distracted really easily. I'll be doing a paper for school, and see a notification on my phone or notice there is some hair on my desk, and I'll spend the next hour watching videos or cleaning my room instead of what I need to do.
I talk a lot, like excessively, and I know it, which tends to make me self conscious and stay in the back most of the time.
I butt in on conversations, and tend to miss some social queues.
It's likely that since moving away from Athena, it's gotten worse, but recently I broke my finger as well, and I don't want to get it diagnosed/spend money on it when we have to deal with my hand first.

I wouldn't talk to them or think about them, but when I saw them I would feel at peace and it would be the only important thing in my mind. I didn't have many people I actually admired or liked, so I begun thinking about why certain people appealed to me. Was it their face? All people I found myself to be drawn to were of different facial structure, so no. I was helping my mother clean up one day and I sat down. Then she hugged me lightly and said she loved having a child helping her with her chores. My mother never hugs me or shows affection. She might do it verbally when there are others around, but it's never direct only as a story for others to hear.

She thinks she’ll just be a burden if she does, she hasn’t even told her parents cause she thinks she’ll be a burden on them. One of the first things were taught as kids is that if you see something illegal, or you see someone getting abused or bullied you report it, but maybe this is different? She’s asked me specifically not to report it but I don’t know if that is the right thing to do. She’s only going to get worse if she doesn’t talk to someone, she won’t properly heal, and I care about her more than anyone else in the world and it’s killing me to see her go through this. I can’t give her the support she needs or would get from a professional and I don’t care if she hates me for reporting it so long as she gets better and he gets punished.

682,"This is going to be quite long, but I really need some advice right now.

The thing is, I started college last month, and I was in secondary high school up until June. During high school, I had two very close friends, and there was a group of four girls in our class with whom we didn’t get along very well. I actually had a pretty good relationship with one of them, who went to school by bus with me. We used to sit together in the bus and one time she asked me to lend her my phone to use instagram, as hers had run out of battery. When she logged out of her account she selected the option to save the password by mistake, which basically meant that I now had access to her account.

I told my two friends and, as you can imagine, we started to see what she talked about with her other three friends on Instagram, which was criticising other people mainly. It was not very often, but I did spy a bit. But then during this summer she changed her password and I lost control over the account. The thing is, I started college last month and one of the girls in this group (not the same one) was in the same degree as me. We sit together and we’ve actually become close friends since then. I had a little bit of remorse about what I did.

The problem comes now. One of my friends in high school did something really hurtful towards my other friend and I, which I won’t explain because it really doesn’t matter. We got furious with her (although we didn’t tell her) and we don’t want any kind of relationship with her anymore, though she doesn’t know it. As far as she is concerned, we’re still friends, but she doesn’t want much to do with any of us either. And I’m really afraid that she will tell my college friend about what we did. She doesn’t have a good relationship with her, but I’m still afraid that she will talk with her. I don’t have any WhatsApp conversation with her in which I told her about the account issue apart from a very minor thing which I could justify easily, so she really doesn’t have evidence to back her up.  I mean, even if she did tell her some things I spied, I could just say I knew because I saw the messages popping and forgot to tell the girl to change her password. The problem is, I believe (although I’m not sure) I told her stuff I saw in this girl’s conversations that happened way earlier than when I got access to her account.

Again, I’m not sure if I told her or not, but I’m still scared, bc I’m very paranoid. Do you think I have a good reason to worry? If so, what should I do? I really don’t want to lose my friendship with my college friend, and I know I fucked up badly, but there’s nothing I can do now.",12Oct2019,1

My roommate laughed, the other two people looked horrified. One person told the dude in charge of the ride that I threw up, and he told me to go to my dorm to clean up. 

I'm not too worried on what to do to clean up, but I am worried about the social aspect. I have not gotten any messages from them, and I'm worried that if I mention it to them and apologize it would be weird. I'm not so worried about my roommate, but I'd like to be able to reconstruct bridges with the acquaintances. Should I give the dude in charge of the ride compensation of some sort?

I think she’s depressed or going through some shit, but I dont fucking know. I feel like a total asshole for not seeing her but my family won’t go see her because she lives so far away and she doesn’t want to see anyone. She used to have a dog, but she neglected it and it eventually died. She lives all alone in a small apartment stained with cigarette smoke. I can’t stand the thought of her dying. I think about how she must be feeling. There’s also a sort of language barrier between me and her, since she has a very thick old-danish accent and I feel very nervous about going to visit her alone. I would have to take a ferry over to see her and many hours of public transport (probably like 8 hours away). What should I do?",12Oct2019,2
688,"   So me and this boy had been dating for over two years and I was so crazy about him. But there was this girl that he was friends with that I was scared of him leaving me for. 

  The thing is our whole relationship was so abusive as he would always treat me like I was going to cheat on him, made me feel like shit for being extroverted, and so on (I can edit it later if anyone wants to know more but yeah). 

    The time we broke up he would get mad if someone even had a small crush on me and make me feel like shit. But not even a month later he’s dating the girl I was afraid of. I don’t hate him and I still wish him the best. 

   But now I’m scared of any sort of commitment, and I still can’t stop thinking about him, it’s been three months and I’m still crying over him. I really need some advice on this.

So a few montha back I was the person who did the setup for this new person lets call her (E). After a day she ended up having some laptop troubles and I finally got to meet (E) in person. She is super cute and one day I saw her wearing glasses where she looked even more cute which hit me like a rock on the head. (Weird I know)

Whenever I see her on that floor she gives me a hi or hello with a cute smile. Or ask each other how was the weekend or day once in a blue moon. 

I barely get to go to that side of floor cause RNG gods of the ticketing system maybe hates but im finding I want to go see her and say I or hoping if I go on the floor id run into her maybe walking or something.

692,"Hey!

I'm a 17-year old non-binary boy, and carnival is something which is celebrated to a big extent in the city I live in.  
We have, like, costumes, a real whole culture around it and a lot of celebration. (I live in Cologne, Germany).

For next year's costume, tonight the idea of going as a purple cat has struck me. It was a sudden idea out of  
nowhere, and I immediately found a liking in it. So I thought of how I would be able to do it best, and well...  
the wish to wear a purple dress as part of the costume grew stronger and stronger. I am out to my mother, and  
while I was already very sure of not being allowed to wear a dress in public, I talked to her about what I thought  
about. Well, no surprise here, the main reason being that it's just too dangerous. Our society isn't far enough  
to make it safe for a boy to wear a dress in public.

I would fear possible consequences in form of discrimination and, not unlikely, violence myself as well. However,  
this wish to wear a dress as part of my costume for some reason is so strong, and no, I am sure that I am no girl  
but non-binary male. I feel so torn. Is it foolish to want to pursue this wish so strongly despite the obvious un-  
necessary risk and dangers as well as the worry of people close to me speaking against it?

Hoping for helpful (maybe compromising) advice here. Thanks in advance.

Yours truly,

696,"Hello and thanks for reading. I'm at a loss here and the stress this has been bringing is immense

My brother will not stop bringing his son around. His son was recently diagnosed with schizoid personality disorder as well as bipolar disorder. We are not ableist in any way shape or form, but some of the stuff he does leaves us feeling very uncomfortable.

He comes around and sits by himself in another room, if I come out of my room at all he will follow me everywhere I go, even if it's outside. Not talking, just following right behind me and sitting wherever I go.

He recently started doing something that not only disturbed me, but bothered me a lot. So I am a transgender woman, I am very noticeably trans. The kicker, unfortunately, is that my family does not know, they can only guess.

Whereas before he came out as a happy gay man, now he's claiming to be transgender. He's copying my clothing style now, copying my hair, the length, etc., and is now trying to come out to the entire family about being this way. The problem is that he has Never described dysphoria, he's talked about being a gay man and doing drag. So now somehow he's conflated these two things, and this is my family's first experience with transgenderism before I could even come out to them myself.

I am very low-key, just trying to live my life, and it bothers me so much something I'm going through is now being perceived by my closed minded family as something only born out of mental illness that presents itself like RuPaul's Drag Race.

This is not all though. I am also disabled. I have slipped discs and have to walk around with a cane. He has also started doing this, claiming he has the exact same injury and leg pains I do.

It's off the wall and I can't take it. I feel like my entire identity is being parasitized and I can't do anything about it. He's representing my entire life in a negative and harmful way. My disability leaves me barely able to walk and he goes around getting attention on it when he doesn't understand how painful it is, standing there dancing around.

I don't know what to do.",12Oct2019,1

One night I was relaxing on the  sofa when the puppy walked into the room where this person was, the person assumed I was sleep I'm guessing.

700,"First, some context: I'm (17M) currently in my third year of high school, and next year I'm going to have to choose which universities to apply to. This September I picked up maths and IT as my elective courses, because I like programming and maths is also fine. I'm planning to become some kind of programmer or VFX artist (also tried some 3D modelling at home, and really liked it). My parents would like me to become a programmer more, because they probably see 3D modelling more as an art, than a ""real"" job. Now to clarify things, my parents (God thank them for this) are really supportive about most of my life decisions, so they'd probably stand with me no matter what I choose to do.

So here comes the bummer, I've always considered myself a createive kid (drawing, 3D modelling, literature, etc.). I feel like I've always had the aspiration to create something exceptional, that people can experience and remember, something that lasts, something of spiritual value.  Everytime I see a great movie or read an interesting story, I feel like with enough practice, I could create something of similar value (on a lot tinier scale of course). Recently these sparks of interest  formed a thought in my head. I could pursue a career that would make me feel content, and would let me express my thoughts in a creative way. I have thought about filmmaking (directing, editing, special effects, etc.) or writing books.

I feel like if I pursued a programming career, all my aspirations would go to waste, I could make my ideas become a reality, and eventually, I'd hate my job and regret years learning it. 

So the questions are:

Should I tell my parents I'd like to do something more ""creative"" without any solid plan or line of work in head? If I picked up literature elective and dropped IT or maths, what could I do with it or would it even help my situation? What kind of universities should I consider that could eventually point me in a direction to a job that fits my needs?

703,"Before her and I got into a big fight, we were close friends and roommates. We had a lot of good memories. 

One day, she got upset because I got busier with work and couldn’t spend all of my free time with her. I noticed she only will be close with you if you give her literally all of your time.

So she invited me out with her and another friend (this other friend and her had a falling out as well but recently became friends again at this time) and I said I’d come at 9 since I worked til 8:30. My phone was dying so at 8:15 that night I messaged her letting her know I’ll meet her at the front of the club since my phone is dying at 9. 

She got the text but she stood me up. She left the club without saying anything. Keep in mind I paid for entry a week before the event. When I asked her why, she said she didn’t give a shit about me and that she had this old friend back so didn’t really need me anymore. Her and this friend wanted to do other stuff that night and didn’t tell me so left me on my own. 

I thought this was so childish and absolutely rude, so I texted her saying “ok...well when you want to be nice to me you can talk.” She never messaged me 

I asked her a couple days later if she wanted to make up, and she said sure. She came into my room with a fight saying she was too good for me, her energy was too good for me, and she moved on to better things. Never heard from her again and luckily the lease was up 4 weeks after this happened.

I talked to this girl (reliable source I used to hang with her but then we stopped cause she switched schools and is now kinda far) who used to be friends with my roommate and apparently this is just what she does. She’s from a rich home in Dubai and is just given things and her parents give her everything and she has maids. She says she’ll only be close with people who are constantly around to hang out and if not, she takes it personally and disposes them and moves on with her life. She just replaces people. Then the girl said that she used to be friends with my roommate but couldn’t deal with her Behaviour and she is very careless. She said she also stood her up and never apologized. 

This morning, 6 months after all of this, I got a message from my old roommate saying she was thinking about all the good people in her life and remembered me and misses her best friend. BUT she hasn’t tried apologizing. She just wants to “move on” past it and rekindle the friendship. 

There were a lot of moments when I did miss her and did think about her, but I knew she showed me who she truly was and remembered not to be friends with someone like that. 

Idk what to do. I replied asking her what made her send this after all this time and that’s it so far. I agreed if she wants to talk it out she can wait a couple days cause I’m with family for the holiday.

Basically when I go to sleep at night, before I even begin to drift off I have this very strange 'vision' thing. It's only happened twice, the first one happened when I was listening to the podcast I listen to every night, it was like what i assume an acid trip is like, I was actually in the main guy of the podcasts mind, it was very real and scary I was quiet uncomfortable so I kinda shook myself out of it. 
The second one was last night, I was in my vision and it was like I entered a different world and it was so strange but I understood it, it was like I was in a different world, both times I was pretty awake so I don't think it was a dream, both times were quiet scary and it's never happened before, the only thing I can think of is when I've just woken up from sleep or dozing off I can make up quiet a few veres of songs really quickly, which is odd as I am not musical and i struggle to make a poem rhyme!
I'm not thinking this is anything supernatural I'm just asking for peoples opinions, and maybe it's worth mentioning that I go to therapy 3 times a week so I do feel alot (maybe that adds?) And I  on meds but have been for 4 years and there's never been any side effects. 
Oh and i spoke to a women I know who said that's (that time before you sleep or just wake up) is the freest place in a human but she's all I to witches and stuff so don't really accept her opinions on everything...

The long story:
My girlfriend (which is 21) has been, when she was 6, regularly raped by her grandfather (he lives in Japan so they only go see him 2-3 weeks per year). She has PTSD and all that kind of stuff, with also suicidal thoughts; it also possibly grew out nymphomaniac symptoms.
Lately, after months of therapy, she's been doing shootings on Instagram (the psychologist said that it would be great to do so, because it could make her feel better about herself). She has been contacted by  many photographers, when one of them asked her if she would be ready to do nudes. We discussed about it, and she went to see him.
Everything went perfect, the guy was professional AF, he didn't even touched her. But the second man she saw did. And he did pretty bad.
Even though she said no a multiple times, he wiped out his d*ck and forced her to stroke it. She didn't know if he could be violent, so she did it... And almost everything else. He licked her, f*cked her with a dildo and even forced his c*ck to her mouth.
She later called me (after the shooting) crying, telling me that she hates herself, that it's her entire fault and that she will kill herself today
And so she tried... She's currently at the hospital...
And I don't know what to do. I want to take my f*cking revenge on this guy, but she said that he didn't even tell her his name
All I have is his Instagram
I want to kill him or make him suffer, but I know you'll tell me to not do it. What should I do then? How can I make my girlfriend feel a bit better?

713,"Hi I’m 17 from the UK 

For the past three months the rumours about my dad have been at their highest I’ve seen in my life. Firstly, from several family members I’ve been told that he is possibly facing a prison sentence for taking part in a string of car thefts; apparently he harboured the cars in his garage why these gypsies would take break down the cars for parts. I slightly remember someone in his garage working on a car, but I didn’t think much about it.

 This “rumour” was combated by my grandma and my dad saying no my father did not know the cars were stolen and he only thought he was helping a friend. What is weird about this is that the timeline doesn’t really make sense to me, my grandma said this happened when he had his food shop which was many years ago probably when I was in year 7 and the gypsies harbouring the stolen cars must of supposedly happened when I was in year ten or Perhaps 9. 

And on top of that apparently there’s TWO court cases one about some gypsies breaking into my family’s property up north and selling weed.. so I’m just super confused as to what’s going on there’s these two court cases that I had no clue were going on and then my family goes on tells me he’s going to prison. My dad ringed me to say that the two court cases are true but he did not know the cars were stolen.. I personally do not see my father as someone who would harbour stolen vehicles. The second court case is true too but I don’t really know much about it. 

The second rumour is that my dad is taking hard core drugs or heroine. Okay my dad has had a past with drugs I have hard core evidence of weed( I don’t give a fuck about the weed) and cocaine ( I don’t remember him taking cocaine) I was probably too young.  The point is everyone knows the men in my family are sleazy with drugs ; my uncle went to prison and left 7 kids at home because he brought drugs. The evidence I have about my father taking drugs is that every time I’m over at his house this man pulls up in his car and they go for a quick spin and he comes back, a mysterious car like this has been happening my whole life. I vividly remember him getting into this guys car with these chavvy ass ghetto fucks and coming out a minute later. LIKE WTF WAS HE DOING . I remember he would say to my brother and I that he is going to buy these gyms passes from this guy at the back of a pub, like who the fuck does that. Because I was young I don’t know what was going on but it seems obvious the answer was drugs. But that’s the point that I don’t know. So apparently he’s taking heroine now, I once found a bong like contraction made out of a inhaler and my aunt found Tin foil like burnt ?? What’s that used for ? I’m kinda worried for my baby brother if him and my “stepmom” lol are taking it with a new born. I’m just so confused. I’ve realise how much trust issues I have with my dad he isn’t the best dad but he’s not bad TO US that’s the thing he’s never hurt us but it’s rumours and actions that hurt the most but TBH I feel like I had an amazing childhood the most perfect so I’m okay I saw and heard things and I have used that as advice to not be like that in some way my dad motivates me to succeed so I’m not like the men in my family.

- they sent a technician friday who worked on my modem for atleast 2 hours and 30 minutes later the wifi slowed down again.

-that same technician was supposed to come back the same day by 10, he never showed up

-another technician was supposed to come yesterday AND today, they didn't show up

-every time I've called them they had me on wait for well over an hour.

- I've called them over 7 times in the last 5 days and still no progress has heen done

-the last time I called the, after waiting for an hour, I was told they'd send another technician NEXT FRIDAY.

The only idea i have as to what the problem is is a windows error I got just today saying: ""Windows has detected an IP address conflict"" were it basically says another device has the same IP adress as my computer. I mentioned this on my last call and I assume it was overlooked.

722,"To put it up bluntly, my sister (24/F) molested me (20/F) when we were around the ages (10-11 and 6-7), this happened while we grew up in a 2-bedroom downtown apartment where we shared the same room, while we slept in the same bed. Mom had died prior to this and dad had a full-time job, she'd basically became my babysitter at this point what I believe gave her a lot of leverage over me.

My dad eventually got to know about this and put a stop to it, what follows next is my sister resenting me and avoiding me during the next couple of years, THIS messed me up. I adored this girl, you can imagine how guilty I felt when out of nowhere she decided to delete me out of her world. I became a reclusive girl, that felt playing alone on her own was the new normal.

Now forward today, I didn't have a good childhood, few friends, social anxiety, etc. So many missed opportunities… I just want to get over this phase and jump onto the next one, that's why I feel I need to open up with my sister but my dad says she also had it rough and is very emotional towards me, she was just a kid and if she knew the total extent of her actions she would never forgive herself with who knows what consequences.

We are currently really good friends, but one part of me stills wants to yell at her LOOK AT WHAT YOU DID, all I want is one big hug and an apology… I don't want to break her.",12Oct2019,1

One week, Tom said that Josh is into school uniforms and lolis (little underage anime girls). The school uniforms isn't what concerns me though. I'm creeped out by the lolis. Josh said that Tom must be making stuff up. Later when I asked Tom if he was being serious, he said ""A little bit. Mostly joking"". Over the next few weeks I've noticed that Josh was playing a game on his phone with lolis in it. He was showing it to other people in the group.  Last week when Josh was talking about his game, he said ""the flatter they are the more powerful they are"". I'm pretty sure everyone else in the group heard that too. This is a very weird situation that I can't make sense of. I'm suspicious that Josh is into lolis, but I'm not 100% sure and if he is into that stuff, then I don't know what to do.

726,"Sorry if this is long. I am a 22 year male old, and for the past 9 years of my life I've been stuck in a virtual world game everyday of my life for hours on end. You essentially dress up your character, decorate your room and go into chat rooms and type to talk to other people. I was in grade 7 when I started playing. I developed a fake personality on this game by copying the personality of my grade's class clown. I was funny, macho, confident and popular in this game. I lied about my age (saying I was 23), name on this game. In real life, I was a 12 year old, shy, fat, and not confident.

# 2 years into the game (2012)

I met a girl on this game, lets call her Emma, who lived half way across the world from me. We became really great friends. We talked everyday, sometimes for many many hours for the next 7 years.

Instead of buying lunch at school with the lunch money my parents gave me, I saved it to spend on the game. Due to this, I lost a tonne of weight and became of average weight.

# 4 years into the game (2014)

I developed feelings for this girl and I started to obsess about her in my mind. I imagined us being together in real life. I played out scenarios in my mind of dates, nights at home, etc.

# 5 years into the game (2015)

This is the year I graduated high school. I got sick of lying about my age and name and came clean.

# 6 years into the game (2016)

I started university and none of my high school friends went to university. I became distant from my high school friends and I had 0 friends at university. I basically stopped speaking verbally, because I had no one to talk to. I talked to my parents for about 1-2 minutes a day, but that was about it.

End of the year, I gained huge status on the virtual world game and started to earn good real life money.

# 7 years into the game (2017)

I can't form proper sentences verbally. I can't get my thoughts across into a verbal form of communication. I started shuddering too and I became really lonely and depressed. The virtual world was my only source of happiness.

# 9 years into the game (2019)

At the start of the year, we got really close. I told Emma how I felt about her, and she felt the same way. However, she had a boyfriend in real life. She broke up with him to be with me. We made plans to see each other in real life in December.

3 months later we broke up. I blame myself because I kept suggesting we should go back to being friends, then saying we should be a couple, and going back and forth. I did this out of my insecurities. 

After the break up, I dedicated myself to becoming ""ripped"", and fixing all my social problems. I joined the gym, went in 4-5 days a week for 4 months. I started seeing a counselor. My main goal being to make friends and have a life like I did in the virtual world, but in real life.

Its now 4 months since the break up, I've stopped going to the gym. I didn't expect to get ""ripped"" instantly, but the progress I made after 4 months is disappointing. Even though I'm seeing a counselor on a regular basis, I still haven't been able to approach people at university to make friends. People from group assignments /tutorials don't seem interested in making new friends (as they already have a group of friends).

In 4 months I have gotten no where:

* I'm not fit as I hopped to be.
* I don't have any friends and I feel more alone than ever.
* I've still never been in a real life relationship.
* I still struggle to verbally communicate or even be not boring when I talk verbally.

I have no hobbies or interests. I've wasted my entire teenage and young adult life, living on this game. How do I fix myself? I haven't even done the basics of life, like going for dinner with friends or going to a party..",12Oct2019,2

So I blocked him one day out of the random on snapchat and  instagram because i wasn’t sure if I was entirely sure of my feelings and then like 2 days later he was like why did you block me? and obviously I had no idea what to say so I just left it but he got his mate to ask me and I just ignored that too. This then went on for a month. Then one day I got a phone call from no caller ID and I answered and later I realised it was him so I messaged him and we started talking for a while again. But now he just constantly brings it up and I try changing the conversation but the smart guy clearly notices and then I try to be like just leave it but he’s like just tell me and then when I say no he just gives me dead replies and I don’t even know what to do. Like I want to tell him so we can carry on ‘talking’ but he won’t let it go. And if I say oh I wasn’t sure of my feelings or If I like you or not  then I know 100% I’ll just be making a fool of me because I’m honestly not sure if he likes me and it’s stressing me out so much

work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and I said 30th November then Sam bubbly pointed up with both hands saying ‘mines 21st’ and then sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays eh (Sam was laughing about it a bit) then Sue said ‘are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted seriously like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’ and looked annoyed/serious a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? Juts before this they asked how old I am and I said I’m 29 and they both reacted nicely saying ‘awwwwww are yer?!’ Loudly, Meaning I look younger coz I do get told I do a lot.

733,"I’ve had too many crushes to count, but only a few of them has been to the 4 month mark when it becomes love. Half of them have been narcissists. 

I was about 10 when I had my first love, but it wasn’t toxic like this. I was just friendzoned for a  little over a year. My second one however (when I was 12 is what got me the most pain. It went on for four years because of this person leading me on for so long. He would reject me, but also flirt enough to keep me around, I was just purely used by him to fill his ego, and the amount of love and care I put into it meant nothing. This person would even hit me enough for me to be injuried because he knew it would give him attention and no consequences whatsoever because I was always the one to get into trouble.  He convinced the adults that I was a stalker, I was just a kid with feelings who liked his attention when he lead me on. He framed the abuse as self defence- and everyone believed him despite him having no wounds, despite me being tiny and ending up injuried. It took me four years to leave and get rid of my feelings for him.

Ever since, I’ve been looking back at it, still feeling pain in my body from being kicked so many times. Sometimes I feel sick and have a hard time breathing,  then I have to lie down when the tears are coming out and just hyperventilate for a few minutes. Sometimes I can’t sleep and just lay down in bed touching my scars. I haven’t told anyone this. I only joke about things this person did to me when I’m in front of other people who has seen his abuse because it all happened in school. 

I had a second love, only lasted for about half a year and this time it was completely made clear that this person didn’t feel the same way. Nothing much. The third one however was the catalyst for the second narcissist. I was 16 and this person took advantage of my heartbreak to redirect my feelings for him. He was really kind at first and we talked every day until he suddenly would start to mentally abuse me. Gaslighting, insulting, Silent treatment, but still just flirt enough to keep me around. This person never rejected me, but didn’t express feeling the same either. I still deeply loved him and cared for him, would always make sure that he knew he was loved and would always bring him food. 
I thought that I was finally in love with someone that cared about me and was happy for a while because he wasn’t always being toxic, but when he was, I would feel terrible. I would stay in bed for weeks with no energy at all. I would on some occasion throw up when I was being ignored. At last, about after he had used me for a year and a half he told me ”You’re not really a person.” without any emotion in neither his face or his voice. That’s when I realised I meant nothing and all that I was is just food for his own ego.

The words of not being seen as a valid person is echoing in my head and despite not having any feelings for none of these two anymore, I still have these panic attacks. I’m 18 now and I still cry when I remember what they did to me, and sometimes I feel unable to be romantically loved. I can’t talk to anyone about this because I don’t know who to talk to and I would have a panic attack when talking about it, or be blamed for everything just like I was from the physical abuse. It was even a hard time writing this, but it’s also hard to bottle it up.",12Oct2019,1

I deleted the last post because I know people at my school and I cant risk anything 

Last night he texted the girl trying to guilt trip her into being friends, me and the guy she likes told him not to talk to her at all and the guy she likes threatened her, at 1am ,while I was asleep,  he messaged me asking to have a civil conversation  , I said sure but made it sure that I want to know the worst of it Nd didn't want him to play the victim, he agreed

He started saying stuff about how she was flirting on face time days before and asked him if he had condoms .

Someone else told me they face timed before he told me this 

He knows he fucked up and didn't ask for concent , 

I made it clear that he hurt her and not to even look at her 

I dont know what to believe since she does flirt but is still a virgin

so two days ago i was messaging him about being friends and such like that, i got upset, really upset, because he really doesn’t want to be with me anyone (i need to learn how to control myself) so i sent him a message saying how he pretended to like me just for sex, i hope he regrets his decision walking away from someone who truly loves him, how that hopefully he will mature and not just want to have sex with people all the time, and how because he got a new friend group he decided to throw me to the side.

after i sent that i unadded him on snapchat and insta, but not fb, i just deleted that and decided to get it back once i am over him. today i went and checked because i couldn’t handle it, but i found out that he blocked me. i decided to message him on discord about it. 
i asked him why did he block me, he replied telling me it was because of what i sent.

i am so fucking dumb, why did i even say any of that to him, none of it is true, he is the sweetest person alive, and never used me. i feel like a fucking loser, i regret it all. i messaged him back on there telling him i didn’t think he would even care about what i said and that i didn’t think it would have hurt his feelings. i told him how sorry i am and how he is actually a great person and how i didn’t mean anything i said to him.

i don’t know what to do, i don’t even care about getting him back, i just want him back as a friend, i want to take it all back, i hurt him a lot by accusing him and shit. idk what to do about this, it was so shitty of me to treat him that way. what can i do to show him or anything. i don’t want him to think he is like that or anything, he has a lot of issues too and i just feel like shit for causing more.",12Oct2019,2
738,"Hi, I'm posting because I'm struggling, my life has been difficult lately and I want to heal, most of all I just want to be happy, and I need advice on how to get there.

So here's a bit about me:

Until recently, I was taking anti depressants for 3 years, and just over a year ago I was self harming and had frequent suicidal thoughts. I'm in my final year of university and the semester has begun, I was hopeful for a great year, however I've been feeling so sad. I get thoughts of feeling ugly again, I feel so so lonely, and I feel lost in my life, so lost. As it's my final year, I feel pressure of wanting this year to go right, so I want to sort out my life as soon as possible and don't want to fall down the same path I was on before.

 These are the issues I most struggle with: 

- Anxiety (worrying so much about others' opinions, and I often get stomach pains from anxiety)
- Lonliness (feeling alone even if I have friends/family around me, feeling like I need a girlfriend to be happy)
- Stress (if I can succeed in life, questioning my goals, my purpose, who I am. I rarely sleep well)
- Obsessive with girls (I have always got easily attached and fallen for girls, who are often my close friends, I'm currently in love with my best friend for 3 years and get very depressed at the realisation that I can't be with her. I also think about her lustfully often and feel regret and guilt for it)

I'd like to get past these issues, I feel they're stopping me from being able to enjoy life and be happy. I'm terrified of becoming suicidal again, I hate being so sad. I want to let go of my earthly tethers, to be happy. 

If you read all this, thank you so much, and if you have any advice for me, I would appreciate it so much. Thank you.",12Oct2019,1
