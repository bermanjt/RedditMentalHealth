4,"Hi everyone,

The title pretty much is the core of what I need advice on, but here some background. I do have some friends already but lately they have become a little boring. Don't get me wrong, I love them to death but they all started working and stuff and they all have serious boyfriends while I'm still at university and single. They just don't have that much time anymore. I had some bumps in my higher education road, which makes me 4 years older than most of my fellow students. I don't really have uni friends and it's frustrating because I'd love to go out more and do fun activities. Meanwhile I'm locked up at home most of the time bored out of my mind, feeling like I'm really not getting any younger at 23! 

The thing is that I'm not completely shy or silent, during practical lessons when we are divided in smaller groups I can talk to others just fine but it all stays very superficial and I don't know how to take it from there because most of the people I clicked with already have a friend group (who most of the time aren't there during the practical lessons because we all get mixed during those lessons which is why I'm able to talk) and I feel like they don't really need any more friends and I'm scared to go sit next to them randomly because it makes me feel like some kind of intruder in the group and then I do become shy... It's just terrible! I did have a friend last year but she stopped with her studies... I just don't know how to break this cycle of loneliness.. Any advice?",22Oct2019,1

10,"So I recently graduated university with film degree and managed to get a job in Los Angeles straight out the bat which was great.

11,"I am a 20\[M\] year old Junior in college, 5'9"". And its been 3 solid years since Ive been laid. 

Long story short: I broke off a two year relationship during my Freshman year and spiraled into a deep depression (came very close to suicide). I made a deal with myself that I would try my absolute hardest at school, say yes to every opportunity, and hit the gym. If in three months things were not marginally better I would kill myself. 

Well Im still here 3 years later. Ive been doing pretty well in school, have bulked up from 115lbs to 145lbs, and am on track to have a software internship in the bay area. I would like to think I am a better human being now, but the fact remains that I have not had sex for 3 years.

I live with this thought over my head at all times. I think about it basically every waking moment. I feel crushed that all of my peers have no issue with this and are able to successfully go out into the dating world without crippling fear. Im scared that I will graduate college without having sex. And above all I am scared that by going so long without sex, it is an indicator that I am a weak and unattractive person (even when I am giving life my all).

12,"I met my friend (F18) a couple months ago when school started, both of us in first year. She’s been having a really tough time, has some family problems (she lives at home), struggling with depression and anxiety, feels overwhelmed by the workload, is having trouble making friends, and just generally is having a really bad time/is feeling really alone. I’m trying my best to help her and recommend some resources to her, but unfortunately her mom won’t pay for any therapy or counseling for her (even though it is covered by the mom’s benefits plan) and the school can’t cover any counseling costs because they opted out of wellness fees.

Here’s where things go from bad to worse.

She’s started talking to this guy (M26) online. Now, as is, the age gap is.... kind of weird. Like, she’s eighteen, just started university, and this guy has graduated and is in the workforce. And then it’s also kind of sketchy that they’ve only talked online.
He wants to be her boyfriend and they’ve never met irl. Especially considering she’s in such a vulnerable spot, I don’t want her to be manipulated  and coerced by this guy because she feels so alone and is clinging to any attention someone gives her. I expressed some concerns but she doesn’t really seem to be listening.  This just doesn’t seem safe. Obviously there’s not really much I can do as it isn’t technically illegal (although if she was just a year younger it would be) but if anyone has any advice I’d really appreciate it.

14,"Hi. On mobile. I’ll try to keep this short. Throwaway account

In March my apartment complex in my hometown evicted me (f20) and my roomate (f19) and boyfriend (m21) on... shady terms. i didn’t have the money to get a lawyer and fight it. My parents and i are very little contact and they are not supportive. 

When this happened we really lost everything. My roommate moved in with her mom and BF and I went to live with his mom who offered to help us. Halfway across the country. I am really happy here. Have always been unhappy in hometown but... it *is* home. 

I wanted to move back to my hometown for a year to try to heal my relationship with my parents. I am very close with my siblings. However over the course of time living here my mother has shown me that she isn’t interested in a relationship with me unless i am in school, which i can not afford and they refuse to help pay for. 

we were going to move back here after being there a year anyways. my roommate was going to live with us again and is frustrated with me about not having the fee for an application for an apartment today when I told her a week ago that I wouldn’t have any money to spend until two weeks from now. 

My question is, doesn’t it just make more sense in terms of my wellbeing to just stay put, find my own apartment here and just continue to work on furthering myself in life? Or should I really go back?

We keep a log of all the tasks we do through the day with how much time each task took so management can see the amount of work that needs to get done and can schedule accordingly. Today I arrived at 10:25 for my 1030 shift and saw her log sheet that she started filling out when she began at 9:00. She had written in tasks that were complete fabrications (I knew this because I completed that task the day before I closed) as well as stated she spent 1 hour in another task (yet everything was just as I left it from the day before). Laughably one task stated she spent until 10:40 doing it (keep in mind it’s only 10:25). Later she inflated another task and slated it in a time slot when I know she had actually left the building. Etc. Etc. My question is- do I say something to my supervisor because it’s disgusting, dishonest, and I have to work twice as hard to get the real work done while she does sweet F.A.

17,"Okay, so to keep the intro short, I joined a digital art class this year, it’s not at my actual high school, but at its own campus. 
Let’s get straight to the point.
My teacher is a bitch, not sugar coating that, she picks favorites and if you aren’t one of them- well then god bless your soul if you dare to open your mouth to ask a question. 
The guy I sit next to is one of her favorites, and the only one that can even talk louder then her when trying to make a point and/or telling her she’s wrong.
She moved my friend that was next to me because after break when we were all coming back into class (multiple people talking at the time) she yelled at him for being ‘disruptive’ and moved him into a corner, and we weren’t even doing any work, he was simply asking one of his friends a question?? And four other people were talking during this, and if anything, they were louder then him.
We work on coding and photo editing, but she grades us by our calendars that we do (not our projects, mind you. That just peeves me cause I could fail a class for a f*ckign calendar instead of ACTUAL grading.

She’s going as far as pulling political controversy into the class, she even emailed all of us and told us why Pepe the frog was a hate symbol and that it was extremely offensive to use it, so one of my classmates was forced to delete his artwork even though it wasn’t used or made in any type of hateful manner. She’s even editing out peace signs (yknow, below the waste I get to hit you type of peace sign) Because she read an article on a news site saying how it was a symbol of ‘white power’ so the entire day she pushed into us about how we shouldn’t use it and that it’s extremely offensive.

She doesn’t like us cussing which I understand in class, but she tries to stop us cussing COMPLETELY. 

I honestly don’t know how much more I can take of this before I say something to her, and it’s not gonna be pretty, but I wanted to post this here to get opinions on it, I know that being a teacher can be rough sometimes, I’m not going against teachers at all, but me and pretty much the entire class are extremely frustrated with her cause at this point it’s just f*cking stupid.",22Oct2019,0

(It’s a long one, sorry in advance) 

So my sister has had a boyfriend for five years. They broke up at the beginning of this year for around six months. In this time, the relationship between the ex boyfriend and my sister got very toxic and unhealthy. To cut a long story short, ex became desperate and, in turn, did things that were pretty bad. He started off being upset and begging for her back and taking her on surprise elaborate dates to the park of her favourite food etc. Everything he didn’t do when they were together as the effort faded. At this point, my family and I felt bad for him and thought “Let’s see how it plays out, he clearly cares”.  

It will be worth mentioning that my sister is a very private person, she does not share things with anyone and if she encounters a problem that most people would seek help with, she will tackle it herself and stick her head in the sand when it all goes wrong. She sees any interaction of help or intervention as an attack and will push us away. (This become relevant). 

So as far as we were aware, they broke up because sister want feeling the same about ex anymore and it fizzled. Fast forward a month and she comes clean saying that it was because ex had been cheating and chatting to other girls for most of, if not all, of their relationship. I then became slightly wary of ex and the stories I had heard over the years etc. 

The six months apart had been so bad, my sister had regular breakdowns, time off work, even considered reporting him to the police at one point because he wouldn’t leave her alone and when she blocked him and went as far as deleting her social media, he messaged her friends and attacked them as well. Threatening to spill their secrets he had come to learn and called them ‘blind guard dogs’ etc etc. It goes a lot deeper but you get the idea. 

In this time, my sister was close with the family as she had always been. Came to us when she was sad and needed a hug. Came to us to tell us what he had done wrong and she was very depressed. None of us got involved at her wishes. The only time I got involved was when he confronted me on a night out with my sister and tried to cause a fight to which I called him some names and left it. 

So. Here’s the problem. My sister got back together with ex some weeks back. She hadn’t told anyone she was even seeing him again and as far as we were aware, she was still scared about seeing him again. Obviously, we were upset by this because she’s family and she’s going back to an unhealthy relationship where she may get hurt. A lot of arguing happened and leaded to just agreeing to disagree. I refused to have any contact with him, which I have made a post about on r/AmITheAsshole and then this caused a massive argument with my sister and I where she told me to not bother talking to her. 

A couple of weeks have gone by now, she has stayed at ex (now not ex) house almost every night and won’t talk to my parents fairly. Everytime they try to ask her anything about, she yells and kicks off and walks out the house. My mum is making herself ill and I feel like I’m losing my sister. I don’t understand why she won’t just talk to us, we’re not trying to make her stop being in the relationship, but she is trying to make it all her way or no way and we just want to talk because she’s not in a good place. 

I’m close with her best friend who is no longer friends with sister as my sister has done a similar thing with her. I’m lost. I want to help her but the stress of it and the upset has triggered mental health and some medical issues. We’re all getting ill over it and it can simply be solved by a conversation she isn’t willing to have. 

Please, please can someone offer some help on what I can do?

35,"For context I’ve been living with my grandmother for a year Up until this week.

I’ve never really been 100% in going to college. I finally found a degree I wanted to do, but didn’t get accepted into it. I was doing a course in a pre university college but it only lead into university courses of which I had no real interest.  There isn’t a way to do that course unless I wait until I’m a mature student at 24 or repeating my high school final state exams which is not happening. 

The environment there was suffocating, with the staff basically treating you more like children than high school. I  got told I wouldn’t be allowed use their computers if I kept “playing Minecraft” (I was looking at google maps) I didn’t really get on with anybody in my course and was totally stressed out with being there. 

I realised I was only keeping myself there because I’ve always been told college is what you should do. My grandmother in particular has always been adamant that I go to college, when I was struggling getting through high school she quite literally cried and claimed I was “her last hope” and that she’d done her best for everybody else, and basically went on to call the rest of the family failures. I had a very strong bond with my grandmother when I was young, this had especially been stained in the past few years and I’d grown resentful towards her because of the amount of pressure I was being put under. 

 When I made the decision to drop out our relationship seemed to mend very quickly, that is until about half a week later my mother and I told her, and everything seemed fine. She came into my room the next morning saying I was going to be late for college. When I said that I’d dropped out (still asleep) she started roaring, slamming doors  and telling me to get out of her house, then she locked herself in the room.

She then rang my mother and said I wasn’t welcome to even visit, and basically framed herself as a victim of my decision. My grandmother is probably the most “well to do” person in the family, and none of her children ever quite lived up to her ‘expectations’ . Neither of my parents completed high school, and only one of her children has gone into college as a mature student.  She’d been proclaiming to me since I was 5 that I was going to become a successful businessman (I’ve 0 desire to work in an office environment, I want to be an author)  but in later years just seemed to settle for going to college and “getting a good job”. 

I’m not sure how to handle her going forward. She’s been sick the last year, and my mother saw her today and she looked awful. My parents think I’m making a mistake but think its my life, and seem to trust me enough to not fuck up big time. They are very worried I’ll never do anything but minimum wage work or end up like them if I don’t go back immediately, even though I’ve made it clear I do intend to go back. 

I’ve taken the year off because quite frankly I’ve no fucking idea what I’m doing, I’ve never once sat back and made my own decision about my life. I’ve always just tried to live out other people’s expectations. I might aswell take this chance while I’m young and still can. I work two days a week, and I want to ideally work four by the end of the month so I’m job scouting. Then I hope to work on my writing and generally the ‘figuring shit out’ part of it the other three days. 

I know I don’t do well in the ‘classroom’ environment and work better left to my own devices (I’m in the spectrum) and I don’t see any future version of me working in an office. I’m happy my parents seem accepting even if they really don’t understand why I’ve done this, but I’m concerned about my grandmother, I don’t know how easy she’ll get over it.

Since I started, due to a variety of factors my grades have been the worst they ever have been. I failed a class freshman year, and I recently received a failing grade on a math midterm.

Knowing that is making it hard for me to live my life. No matter where I am, I always feel this gnawing anxiety about my grades. I worry I'm going to flunk out, that I'm too stupid for college. All of my friends are doing better than me, and while I'm really proud of them, I feel like I can't talk to them about what I'm going through because of that. Sometimes I feel like I don't even deserve to be friends with people like that, because I haven't achieved as much. I feel like a fraud.

I'm trying to improve my grades, but it all feels like an uphill battle with myself that I'm somehow losing. I feel like I'm doomed to fail. Advice?",22Oct2019,2

I currently attend 6th form in the UK studying engineering, media and computing and juggle a 16 hour part time job in Between that. I’m not going to name myself (for fear do ridicule if anyone I know finds this) so I’m just going to call myself James. I’m quite an open and social able person so I unfortunately often take a lot of stuff to heart and get hurt really easily one of the things I hate about myself. 

Ever since I entered secondary school back in Year 7 it has caused me to be bullied a lot by a lot of different people including some who were my closest friends. I think a lot of people think I’ve got problems because I can be very quiet and nobody really seems to care what happens to me or seems to want to try help me because most of them who do don’t know how to help. 

My mental state has been on the decline for a long time over the past year and I feel like I needed to share and just see what I could do and get some advice. I can’t share how I feel with anyone I know in real life because I fear they’ll tell people around the 6th form and I’ll get bullied about feeling the way I do so I came here.

45,This kid posted a video on Snapchat of his frined throwing a cat. What should I do if anything?,22Oct2019,1
46,"A couple weeks ago, me and my friend were in a situation. Nothing bad happened, it was just a miscommunication where, she was worried I was going to off myself. She seemed very upset when I talked to her about it later and I couldn't be more grateful. She somehow managed to fix the root of my problems without even knowing it. Thanks to her, I've never been that happy in a long time.

   However, things have been starting to get bad again. My mom and her boyfriend are verbally abusive. My mom can get physical while, her boyfriend manipulates and attempts to gaslight ( it seems like he does at least), and everything gets blamed on me. They never apologize and make me feel utterly worthless. They constantly hang everything over my head and threaten to tell the school lies about me so I have no one. Then, all of a sudden, they will completely flip and pretend nothing happened. That they think getting me things makes up of their awful nature. I doesn't help that my mom is the basically the last one around in my family. I feel like I'm trapped.

   School is no different. I have trouble making friends and everyone ignores me, unless they want something out of me. Not to mention, due to mu grade school, I have a severe fear of teachers and failure, that I don't think i'll ever get over. I've also been bullied really badly when I was younger, physically and emotionally. To the point where I have a permanent limp. So as you can guess I might  have trauma. I suspect at least one mental illness too but, I haven't been properly diagnosed so I don't want to lie.

As you can probably tell, I am at a loss. I kept hoping things would get better but, they just keep getting worse. The one person I can trust is my friend that helped me. I'm afraid to ask for help.

   The main reasons for that is because she's almost always busy, has her own life and is probably dealing with her own stuff. We have only known each other for a couple months but I do trust her. She had been kind, patient and understanding to me. She actually pays attention when I talk to her. Plus she's very honest too. Another reason why i'm still scared though is because our friendship is mostly one-sided. I have to reach out first if I want to talk to her. We don't really know much about each other and we've never actually hung out.

I'm at my wits end with all of this. I don't know how to deal with all of this on my own anymore. I've been alone most of my life and I can't do it anymore. I'm afraid I may actually end up offing myself, if I don't try to ask for help now. My mind is still in kinda a dark place.I hate to say it but, I really do need help from someone. With the girl, I just don't want to burden her with my problems, accidentally manipulate or take advantage of her.

What should I do? Should I try asking her for help? if so, then what could I ask? Or should I just drop it completely and try something else?",22Oct2019,1

The thing is that my dad is so confusing sometimes I love him and he is the best dad ever. But sometimes i really don’t know like he just goes off on me and my brother calling us useless and names and throwing stuff and just being a complete ass. He also drinks and smokes too much to point where he gets drunk and also the house smells like smoke sometimes. But my mom there is no discipline really. The only thing is that she is sorta questionable also. Like she did have a drug addiction for a long time I’m not sure about currently and she has some friends that I’m not sure of.

67,"Apologies for any formatting issues. Am on mobile. Also text wall.

Last December, I graduated from college with a degree in biology. Pretty bland and did not have foresight to specialize, and yes that is regrettable.  But besides the point. I got my first job in April for what I thought needed a degree, but actually doesnt in the job description, only a high school diploma. It is at a big corporate company that decided to open a lab to cut out the middle man and presumably save money. The lab has only been open a year. I make 36K a year, 16 hourly.

When I started, I found out that half the lab quit before I got there. The most experienced employee in my role had only been there 3 months. There were 3 total employees, including me, in this role.  One of those employees then moved out of state, leaving just two of us. No active hiring has been occurring until last month.

Three months ago, the lab nearly quadrupled in work volume. This was expected. Three additional employees have started in my role within the last two weeks, but are hardly trained. My coworker and I have been doing the bare minimum and working 50+ hour weeks. I usually work 8am-730pm, with an hour commute. I very much value a good work/life balance and discussed as much during my initial interview, where a 9-5 work schedule was given.

Even before the increased hours, the company culture was revealed to be very corporate. Management crises happen very suddenly and we are frequently berated for allowing them to occur,though we cannot possibly have seen them coming. I have not been given any positive feedback. Training is severely lacking and any missteps due to this lack of training are the fault of the trainee. The director is unstable emotionally and has a tendency to make sudden changes due to small inconveniences. The supervisor is afraid of confrontation and will passively tell you when something is wrong instead of addressing it head on.

 This lack of balance and awful culture has affected my relationships, my mental and physical health. I come home miserable and just go to bed. My husband and I fight about it frequently, something that isnt usual. I have lapsed back into depressive episodes and stopped self care routines due to lack of time. I have had multiple medical procedures recently that may be due to immune suppression from work stress. I've been crying myself to sleep at night on sundays and frequently feel panicked and anxious at the thought of going to work. 

I have addressed the work life balance with my superiors in the hope of finding a solution and to address my other concerns. I requested a day off during the week so that I work 4 10+hour days instead of 5. They gave me one, and it is no longer a possibility. They offered that I only work 45 hours instead, but insisted this must be scheduled so that they can plan ahead, i.e. push off that work onto my other coworker. I recently scheduled a necessary surgery which resulted in my superiors asking if i ""plan on working like everybody else""  now that I'm taking time off, suggesting I am expected to continue this schedule. All other concerns were pushed off and dismissed. The worst part to me is that the day before, my supervisor complained bitterly about the director, and apparently assuming I was going to bring it up at the meeting, told the director that I was the one discussing the directors way of managing the lab. I had no chance to defend myself.

Overtime is not necessary according to them, but the amount of work needed to be done according to my superiors will not happen in a day. No changes have been made to address our shorthandedness. Our superiors do not defend our work to their management. 

I need advice and opinions on if this job is worth keeping. I'm not totally sure if this is my attitude problem or if this is truly a terrible place to work. My previous job was nothing like this so I have no idea.

Thank you.",22Oct2019,1

72,"So this is a constant struggle.
Well, I met my best friend at the beginning of junior year in high school; we are in college now and have been best friends since. Of course, it took a while to get to this point but that’s how most friendships are. Well, overtime I grew incredibly Close and of course that’s to be expected. But when I turned 18 is when I really noticed it. Every time I saw someone attractive they weren’t as attractive as my best friend. When I described my dream type of person, it was literally the same type of traits my best friend had and the same physical traits as well.
I never felt as comfortable around anyone else as I did with my best friend. And I thought this was just normal best friendship(I never had a real best friendship when I was a kid, so I wouldn’t technically understand) but then I started whining to always hug him, always wanting to hold his hand, wanting him to cuddle me, for him to do really romantic things to me. I was always shaking these thoughts off— it was my best friend, you don’t think like that. The nail in the coffin was when I was laying in the car with him in the dark playing calm music. We were just sitting there and talking for literally hours. And then I looked over to him and in the moonlight his eyes shined and his smile made me melt and I couldn’t stop staring. He noticed and even questioned it. And another time was when we were taking really silly pictures and we just couldn’t stop laughing. I literally had never laughed harder in my life then that point. And when he was laughing I felt even happier. And those have been my favorite memories ever since. And the thing is, he acts like he’s in a relationship with all of his friends because that’s just technically what is normal to him. So we’re always hugging or cuddling or he tells me he loves me and has a cute nickname for me. And I trust no one more than him. And sometimes it feels like I would do anything just to make him happy. He is aromantic, and does not feel attraction to anyone. And I realized this entirety and had one of the worst panic attacks ever. So I decided I needed to try to find someone. Over the course of the year, I failed many times. And then I ended up finding this girl I liked. Except she looked a lot like him, And acted the same in more ways than one. And guilt completely sank in because it felt like I was only liking her because she was similar to the person I was already in love with. And it was like I was using her. My best friend supported it all the way and encouraged it. They got along real well. But I can never get over it. I’m still in love with my best friend. And sometimes it’s really starting to show. Because I talk about him all the time, to everyone. I’m always talking to him, my favorite things in life I’ve always been with him. A lot of my first experiences in life were with him. And I’m praying to goodness gracious that he doesn’t know. But I don’t know how to get over this, and I don’t want to cut off my best friend. It’s a horrible struggle, and I never stop feeling guilty. What do I do?",22Oct2019,1
73,"Year's ago I loved working on projects and I found joy and excitement in thing's from discussion about ideas to fixing problems to helping others to playing games.

I'm a mid 30s male and honestly I don't find joy in most things anymore. When I do find joy it's short lived or shadowed by feelings. I normally feel just bland not really happy not really sad

At this point I don't play games anymore, I don't work on projects anymore I don't even like discussion that much anymore. I also don't have interest in sex. 

I feel resigned and tired like I don't want to keep walking. All I do now is go to the gym because I hope maybe losing weight and being active will help me out. It doesn't seem to be working beyond losing weight. 

What can I do to find something in life that makes me happy? Is this just normal?",22Oct2019,1

75,"I am not sure what to do anymore, but here is my situation...
I am not quite sure where to start, but I feel that I have waited too long to put this out there.
It seems like every day I hear from my mother that I am not acting like the caring person she knows I can be, and that leads us to fight over it. Sometimes, she gets really upset, something that gets worse when I do not fight back.
My sister sees me as a waste of space, never asking for help, and when Mom gets me to, never thanking me.
I do so many things around the house, making sure that parts of our lives continue to function, but it feels like it is all for nothing. The only reason I am still here to tell this is because of my closest friend, but I only see her once a day.
I do not feel like I can go on like this for much longer, watching as the world does not change. I feel like I am falling into myself, into the part that I try to hide from the world, the part that can destroy a person in ways that cannot be seen or fixed. Everyone around me sees me improving at a stunning rate, but it feels like it is all for nothing, that I am alone in this world, that nobody knows the true person I am. I wish that someone knew, but I am afraid that I would scare that person away, that I might let out something that I do not have the strength to recapture.

78,"I got my cat, S, from our local shelter a few years ago. For a while, it was just me and him and he was great.

Then I got a boyfriend. I started spending a lot of time with said boyfriend, while trying to include S wherever possible.

S became very jealous of my boyfriend. But eventually, he showed him a lot of affection and liked to be around him. Said boyfriend and I got married and moved in together.

That's when the problems really started. My sweet (though clingy) cat was now becoming aggressive toward me for no reason. He started biting me and ignoring my husband.

He showed all the signs of hyperesthesia which is like schizophrenia for cats. We have no money, so I could not take him to the vet to officially diagnose this. Gave him some natural calming remedies and that seemed to help. Then he started up again. Increased the dose, he seemed fine. And so on. But that stopped working.

We eventually thought he might be lonely when we're both at work, so we got a kitten. They got along great at first, but now S is attacking the kitten and is bullying him. K is provoking a little, but not too much, and we think it is because he is a baby. He is slowly growing out of it.

The other day, S was laying on top of a blanket and I heard K crying underneath it. While moving S, he bit me hard.

I don't know what to do. He used to be such a sweet cat, but now I am worried he is going to hurt the kitten, or worse. He has already shown aggression toward me and my husband and I are debating getting rid of S.

I didn't want to be weird and follow her around.

92,"I need some advice.

My parents are going through an exceptionally messy separation after 42 years of marriage. My father is unhelpful, my mother is mentally ill and suicidal. I have been the sole support person for my mother; she has no other family, my sister is overseas, and her friends can only do so much. Despite everything over the past two and a half years I have helped her find a job, set up a home, and re-establish herself a little bit.

My mother has numerous issues that make her react unpredictably or violently, (towards herself.) Because of that I am not always fully truthful with her as her reactions can be more than honesty is worth. I don't blatantly lie but I do refrain from telling her certain details. Call it lies of omission.

Despite that, she demands total honesty. She felt betrayed and lied to by my father and gets paranoid about any and all dishonesty. 

I know a truth that may destroy her. A few months after buying her house my father changed jobs. He used to both live and work in a different adjacent city but his current job is located extremely close to my mother's new house. 

He has been working there for about ten months. I have known this for all that time but have been keeping it from my mother. If she knew she would panic. She would insist it was an intentional move by my father to destroy her. She would no longer feel comfortable in her home or in herself and would almost certainly make another attempt on her own life.

This is a pretty awful rock-and-hard-place situation for me.

I have lived with the knowledge that her finding out would be the end. I have convinced myself that the situation is what it is and as unfortunately as it is I just need to keep the secret to myself and hope it never ever comes out. I fully realise that if it ever does the reaction will be catastrophic but I have concluded that I need to accept that.

But am I making a huge mistake? Should I have been open and honest in the first place even knowing that it would have absolutely upended everything we had worked for? Can I be honest now or is it too late? Is the moral thing to do to tell her and wash my hands of the consequences or is it to continue with this burden to save her from herself?

97,"Back story: My fiancé was madly in love with this girl before me. He wasn’t very relationship experienced. Not a big deal. He proposed to me. I accepted. 

Awe sweet?! Right? Well....every day it eats at me. I saw the ring. Ring was beautiful. In a way my heart broke when I saw the ring. No, not the size of the diamond. Idgas about that. I thought it was the same ring he proposed to the girl he was in love with. (Even though he had ordered the ring and it was delivered.) idk why but I thought it was the same (style) ring. 

We go to get it sized. The jewelry store, omg, set me off. I was a size 7. Ring said size 7 but measured at a 9. I’m a principle person. The store treated us (especially him with such disrespect.) 

Again, all I wanted was a ring that fit! I didn’t want to lose it! 

Store berated him because of the size of the diamond. Berated me on my size. Berated him for the cost. Just berated us in every manner. Than tried to charge us a $75 fee to have the ring resized! The ring was just purchased! Seriously! 4 days! 

So, this is the part where I’m the asshole. I threw the ring back at the jewelry store clerk. Said I didn’t want the ring. 

I can’t tell you how horrible I feel. It wasn’t about my fiancé or the ring at all! It was how they were treating us and charging him half of the cost of the ring. (To be honest they over charged him to begin with.) 

We walked over to the other jewelry store I rarely had issues with and the manager was extremely helpful and I picked out a promise ring as my engagement ring. I even traded in some of my old jewelry to bring down the cost. 

I feel horrible. Every time I look at my engagement ring, I feel like I don’t deserve him. For the past three years I’ve hunted high and low to find the original ring he proposed to me with. But to no avail. 

I can’t tell you how awful I feel. It eats at me. I just don’t know what I can do to make it right. It doesn’t bother him. He lovingly smiles every time he sees me wear the ring. But deep down inside I am crying.

They told me they would wait to hear back from the insurance company about the amount of compensation we would be receiving and then purchase a replacement vehicle for me that they would put in my name. 
They purchased a Scion, showed me the vehicle, and told me to get some things together like proof of my driving records, glasses, and my drivers license, to show ‘I was ready to drive the car.’ 
I was told to meet with my mother to receive  the vehicle and show her the items. Once we get together and she drives over with my car I tell her I have brought everything that she asked for and would like to show her. She then refuses to acknowledge this and claims I do not have anything with and makes false accusations against me.
She then tells me that I can’t have my vehicle because “she knows that I’m not going to wear my glasses.”
I am a college student with a 3.7 GPA, also working, extremely responsible cooperative and honest. 
I feel that I must be dealing with narcissistic parents at this point and don’t know what to do. No matter what they create conflict and problems. They have historically been extremely toxic to deal with.

Would it be reasonable to ask the landlord to replace the awful ‘peel and stick caulk’ he has running along the edges of the bathtub where the worst of it is? Or would that be on myself to fix? I have no problem fixing it if it falls on me to do so since I’m the one renting it, I’m just not an experienced renter to understand what to do in this situation here.

To also add, the mold problem is throughout the *entire* house. My main concern in the bathroom as it’s the worst area. I’m also not sure how normal household mold is, so any advice on how to fix or deal with this would be extremely helpful. 

There is nothing in the lease regarding repairs as the landlord is an older man, and the lease is has just the basic terms and conditions regarding rent and when it’s due by.

TLDR: house is full of mold, is it reasonable to ask landlord to help me fix/find a solution, or should I handle it myself?",22Oct2019,1
105,"So long story short in my marching band we do a halloween show and squads can do costumes. My squad is dressing up as Jesus, Mary, and the three wise men because there’s a running joke one of the guys in our squad looks like Jesus. So we planned it out and this one girl keeps talking behind my back saying it’s offensive. First of all she’s not even religious, second of all it’s not like we’re making fun of anything. She also has not said a single word of this to my face even tho we’re “friends”. 

Now I’m kind of worried tho. I’m just doing it because I think it’s funny but is it actually offensive?",22Oct2019,1
106,"I have recently found myself in a situation that I'm unsure of how to handle and could really use some advice on how to proceed. 

So there's this friend I have that I feel I can no longer be friends with due to what happened between us nearly two years ago. We had this thing where if we weren't involved with anyone, we'd cuddle. He was a really good friend and I trusted him a lot, but then one time when we were cuddling he started to kiss right above my breasts. I got really uncomfortable and didn't know what to do. All I did was slightly nudge but then just froze. I was not expecting that to happen and felt so violated.

This was right around the time when he told me he had feelings for me. I politely told him I didn't feel the same way and that I didn't feel we would be compatible. There was also a time where he told me he wanted to kiss me, but I told him no because it wouldn't feel right. 

He was a little frustrated, but my guess is that the feelings for me and the reaction to me not wanting to kiss had something to do with the fact that while he's talked to women and been on dates, he's never had a girlfriend before. Either way, I feel that what he did was really inappropriate. We never said we were more than friends or have ever touched like that before. 

Ever since that happened, I've kept my distance and it took me quite some time to not think about that incident as much. Every time we hung out, I always drove separately and been more guarded. And yes, we did talk about it on two separate occasions right after it happened. 

I have come to the conclusion that I'm better off not being friends with him anymore. There was another woman (we'll refer to her as Amy) who he was really interested in, but she soon started dating another guy. He told her he had feelings because she asked if he did, she said she didn't feel that way. He got attached and didn't want to let her go as a friend so they kept in touch. Almost a year later later he tells me he went to lunch with her to catch up and I barely had to pry before he implied that he still has feelings for her/hopes something could happen one day. 

And then that's when I thought of the times he'd ask if I was seeing/talking to anyone. Then when I started dating my boyfriend, he knew we were exclusive, but when I last saw this friend a couple of months after he knew that, he asked if we were official. I found it a bit odd when he asked that, but later on I looked through our texts and found the messages where he did ready know I was in an exclusive relationship. So either he forgot about that or it was a similar situation to how he feels about Amy. 

I think that there's a chance he still has feelings for me and since I haven't felt the same since the incident I just feel like it's not right to be friends with someone like this anymore. 

My trouble is that he's one of those friends who will always reach out and, like Amy, he doesn't want to lose me. I was hoping that we'd just fade out over time, but that hasn't happened and I'm nervous about talking to him about it because he got really emotional when I talked to him about the incident and he said he got emotional when telling Amy that he had feelings for her and she didn't feel the same way. 

I don't want to be mean or heartless. I've tried during the past two years, but my spirit just isn't there anymore. I feel terrible for feeling like a fake friend, but I can't live this lie anymore. If I don't text him back, he'll just text back again days later. It would be obvious if I tried to ghost him and then he'd probably eventually ask about why I've been avoiding him. As far as he knows he thinks we're all good in terms of the incident but I just haven't been able to let it go. I just don't think it's acceptable for a friend to do something that inappropriate. 

So, what should I do? What do I even say? I'm really overwhelmed about this. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you for reading my post.

So I’m finally ready to try and get myself fully in the business of personal fitness training, my plan is to study for the nasm cpt exam so I pass and then start training people. So...my dilemma and what I’d love help figuring out is about my weight and body composition/physique. I’ve struggled with eating disorders for the majority of my twenties and I just turned 30 two weeks ago and had a bit of an emotional breakdown that I still haven’t gotten my reproductive system back on track from having been anorexic. So for the past month I’ve been gaining a lot of weight and feel like I’m gaining more fat by the minute. I’m still at a healthy weight so it’s not a danger to my physical health in the weight gain, for now anyways, but it’s messing with my mind and body image and now making me fear that I won’t be successful. Part of me wants to let my body heal even if it means looking in the mirror and thinking I’m chubby or fat but I feel like I’ll never succeed as a trainer and will be judged negatively if I stay this way or especially if I continue to gain. What should I do, get back to 102 pounds and get my training business up and running or let my body go to the weight it wants in hopes that I’ll be able to get my hormones working again the right way so I can plan on trying to have a kid at some point but at the risk of not being taken seriously as a trainer because people think I’m too fat to get them results. I was maintaining 98-105 pounds (for the past few years) since coming out of the hospital where I was “weight restored” from anorexia and just in the past month ive kinda let it all go with food control and am now like 112 pounds.",22Oct2019,2

120,"I’m currently on my way to finishing my bachelor’s for health sciences and at the same time I’m also interviewing at schools to be accepted in their dental program. These programs are damn tough to get into and this last year has been the most anxiety induced year of my life.

But on the chance that I don’t get accepted to any school, I don’t think I’ll want to apply again.

121,Kinda new here but anyway long story short I was talking to this guy for a little over a month and he was going through a divorce because he was miserable in his marriage. His words and not mine. The mother of his child was barely letting him see his son except maybe if he was lucky once every 2 weeks. Flash forward to about 2 weeks ago he tells me he was at a party and someone there had herpes and for me to get checked out and to tell him if it came back okay. Well it came back okay and i went to tell him next thing I know my number is blocked and he avoids coming into my workplace because he was a regular customer there. Few days later his brother tells me me lied to me about the herpes and that he got back with his wife and I’m an understanding person because I don’t know what his reason was going back to something he claimed he was miserable in. Maybe it was so he could see his child or he realized he still loved his wife who knows but t still hurt me because I liked him and he said he liked me too and wanted to see where it goes and after I found out the whole herpes thing was a lie I sent him a friend request and message that was awhile ago and he recently deleted my friend request but didn’t block me. Could he still have feelings for me and just waiting to find the right moment the get his divorce done or no? I’m jut confused as to why I was not blocked.,22Oct2019,1

130,"Hi! This is my story, is a little bit long and might be a hard to understand. English is not my first language so I'll do my best to get understood.

 A year ago I traveled abroad hoping to make my academic situation clear, I had a huge lack of motivation. My parents gave me the opportunity of studying English in Canada, and it was something I enjoyed very much. On that trip I met a girl, whom I eventually fell in love with. She liked me too, that made everything very easy. When we started dating seriously she told me that she was a single mother and she was expecting to give birth here. I was chocked, but despite that I decided to go ahead and offer my help in everything I could. She understood that, I was a young university student and I didn't have much money. I was willing to help in everything else, even with money, but that I wasn't pretty useful in that. 
The pregnancy process was fantastic and both were very excited for the birth of the baby, but I had eventually to go. I was here to decide my life and I thought I had finally something to study for and do my best. I asked my parents to help me study in Canada but it was not possible at that time, I had to return so. We didn't worry about that because the baby was the most important thing, and although sometimes I felt a little excluded (which I understand), I felt completely Happy. My ex-girlfriend and I agreed that we would continue no matter the distance and that we expected to see each other a year later (my career lasted 5 years). I accepted and I was determined to do my best to return as soon as possible. Everything was going well until February of this year, we began to distance ourselves and I didn't receive any update of the baby's growth. A couple of months later she decided to break up with me and stay as friends. It made me very sad, because inside I felt that I would never see them again, I was destroyed for losing a son who never was mine. At that time the option to return to Canada became possible. I got accepted in a College and my parents agreed with that.
 One of my great motivations was always to see them both closer but that looked a bit complicated then, I decided to go ahead but always in secret. Months passed and I told her that I would be there and I would like to see the baby and also see her, but then I was rejected, she told me that she had a boyfriend now. I didn't care, I still wanted to see the baby and I was going to be here on the date of the Child's birthday so I had to make my gifts received, at least. Later, 2 months later she accepted and I saw the child and was able to deliver the gifts, but I was told that the baby was going to live now with the grandmother in another country. That devastated me, I just arrived and he is already planning to go very far :(. I asked the mother to see him a couple  of times before he left, because I don't really know when we can see each other again. Unfortunately got rejected again with the same words and never saw the baby again. When the baby was here, it was also my birthday, I was expecting to see him In my special day but didn't even get a Happy from them. That made me super sad again. Yesterday the baby left and I could talk a little with the mother and I encouraged her to stay strong as she stays here and to seek for his best future. I'm writing this because I'm feeling too sad, time has helped me a bit but not enough to not cry every single time I see the baby smile. It hurts to know that maybe he will never know about me and that I will miss his growth.
Do you have any advice to overcome this?",22Oct2019,3
131,"Hello, male late 30s. Apologies in advance, on mobile. So I guess I'm looking for opinions on a decision that keeps coming back to me. I realize what I'm about to post may be controversial or of unpopular opinion to some. For a little over a year now I have been trying to self fix myself to be a better person. A lot of the had started with me just being a really lonely guy who had lost his way in the world. One thing has lead to another, and another over this journey and am still working on things. Seems almost never ending. Ultimately At the end I am hoping to have gotten myself together and eventually meet someone to share my life with. At the beginning of the year I decided to try online dating for the first time. Lasted close to 5 months with no real luck. Got frustrated, and gave up. Then decided maybe to work on myself some more. While I'm currently not looking and probably won't be till some time after the next year a thing keeps coming up from friends and family. That would be me having children. So, I have odd opinion when it comes to this, that most people disagree with. I like kids, I would like to have kids (have always wanted them), am told I am great with kids, but where the thing is I don't want to be with someone who has had kids. I actually completely refuse to. I had originally made the decision that I didn't want this in my mid 20s. This was based on the only relationship that I've ever been in. I dated this girl for a little under a year before she ended it. Somehow this turned into an on again off again thing that lasted between 6-7 years. The problem was never the child, dealing with her did make me happy. The problem was the mother, she had the horrible habit of when she'd leave (she's the the one who would leave but she was also the one who would look me back up) she would ghost. As in completely abandon me like I wasn't even there in the first place, completely cut off all contact including friends and family, and just move on with her life with someone else which would take months for me to figure out. Looking at it now there were a lot of signs that pointed towards borderline personality disorder. As much as I did care for that little girl the reality was she wasn't mine. Didn't matter what I had to say or felt about. I needed to be done with the mother because it was really destroying me. When all was said and done I made the decision that I wouldn't get involved with someone who has kids. Now I have gone back on this a few times but have regreted it each time. Apparently I tend to attract women who act a lot in the same manner as my ex and generally tend to get frustrated and walk away. Eventually I hit this road where I felt like there was something wrong with me and just gave up for a few years. Now there is a part of me that still would really like to have my own family but, with the last year I'm beginning to question it. I'm a little over a year from turning 40. I tend to wonder is it even worth it by now. Do I really want to be dealing with teenagers in my 50-60. Where this also tends rub people the wrong way is even if I don't have children, I still wouldn't get involved with someone who has. Maybe it's just me but, that's how I feel about it. I realize it cut down who I'm whiling to be with but this has been what I've been looking for a long time. Please if anyone could maybe share anything that might help me make a decision within the next few months before I put myself out there again it would be greatly appreciated.",22Oct2019,1
132,"Hey everyone, I posted a while back about my arrest and needing help coping with it, etc. Now, the day has finally come where my court date is tomorrow . I’m excruciatingly nervous. What can I expect? I know it’s the arraignment , which I’ll plead not guilty, they’ll ask if I have a lawyer or not , which I’ll reply that I don’t - they’ll offer a PD if I’m eligible (I’m a student w no job/ no parental help) . I don’t know what else is going to take place. 
What can I really expect? I also have class at 11:15, and they told me my time was 9am (even though on the DAT paper it says 9:30). Would I be able to make it to class ? 
Has anyone been through this before?

i want to just delete my instagram, and block them on everything else and never have to deal with them again but unfortunately i still have to deal with them  at school. i have to sit right in front of them in history class and i tried to ask my teacher if i could atleast move my seat but she pretty much told me ""its not my problem, you need to settle this outside of my class"" so i dont know what else i can do. if i just try ignoring them or confronting them, ill be the next person he targets and rants about much of a terrible person i am for ""abandoning him"". im probably just being an anxious bitch about it and should just confront him and tell him to fuck off but i just cant get myself to do it.",22Oct2019,1

My friend didn’t really want to make an insta, so slowly we stopped using discord and almost left him behind. I like this friend so I made a plan for him to get insta. I made a fake account of him, one that wasn’t completely obvious it wasn’t him, but you could tell if you looked into it. Well the whole thing immediately flew out of hand and our group started a man hunt for the imposter. I wanted this to happen because if it did that meant that he would have to make an account to say that someone faked being him. And it worked, but I almost feel guilty. Did I do the right thing?

139,"I went to a big public school. The worse one in the area known for having “bad kids.” Somehow I made it into a great private school on financial aid. So far, I have 5 friends. It’s actually a lot. The thing is everybody else feels intimidated by me. I think they might see me as ghetto. The school is dominantly white and I’m one of the only latinas in the school. I don’t really mind except for the way people see me. Everybody at my old school goes to the local public school, SR. Whenever I pass people that I knew from my old school, I get stares. I think people think I’m white washed and entitled. I’ve been told that from some random family members even though I never once talked about myself. I laugh it off but it really gets to me. Everybody else at my new high school doesn’t seem to like me. “You’re from Davidson huh. I could tell.”   I don’t think my race is the entire problem because the rest of my friends already have a lot of friends and plus, I’m quiet. The school is small so its expected to be friends with everyone but I don’t know why I can’t use my voice.  People that go to SR have been saying how it’s so much fun and there’s barely any homework. I get so jealous since I work on homework for three hours. I can’t tell them how I really feel about the private school since after all, I’ve been telling them how much fun I’ve been having. It’s really not. I can’t transfer since everybody will just see me as a failure and I can’t move far away. Not enough cash for that. In school I can’t hide from the label of clearly being latina and outside of school I’m not latina enough. I’ve fallen into jeolousy and I’ve lost my motivation to study or do homework. Now I find my self sleeping in class everyday too. I tried to get my shit together but I don’t have the motivation. I always think about the things that worry me and then my heart hurts and I feel this intense pressure. And then I get really really angry. And then I’m on the verge of tears. I’ll usually control it but sometimes I can’t. I’ll punch something really hard and leave a bruise somewhere in my body on purpose. I’ll have bandaids on my face which makes me feel good for some reason. I like people’s attention and I hate that. If people are going to be intimidated by me I’ll give them a reason to. But I also don’t want to be that kid. I’m failing and I don’t know what to do. As I’m writing this, I haven’t done my homework. I feel so weird all the time ever since I joined high school. I don’t want to ask for help, I’ll have to swallow my pride.

I remember that I was thinking about how much time I’ve spent away from my significant other since we are in a long distance relationship, and how little time we actually have on the Earth to be together in the long run. Ever since that day I been pretty much consumed thinking about the inevitable. 

I can’t stand it. I don’t know how to go on with my day to day actions without wondering if this is gonna be the last thing I do. It’s gotten to the point that even driving my car has became a point of anxiety for me because I’m so scared I could get into a car accident and die. I had to check that I locked my door tonight over four times so that somebody couldn’t come in and kill me in my sleep. It’s everyday now and I just want to make it stop. I’m texting and calling my parents almost every two hours because we have such a short number of years to talk and tell them I love them. I don’t want to waste my time with them. But I can’t function with work or classes or anything because i think... is that really what i’m spending my 70 or so years on..

two days later i crack a window a little and then about an hour later i see the light again closer but hear a slight buzzing. a couple night later i hear it again but it’s been getting colder so i stopped going out there.

now a couple hours ago i was playing on my phone and my cats just chilling on top my dresser, and the bright light passes my window but very slowly and moved in a weird slow going up, almost circular way. i also heard the buzzing again. my cat saw it too and it freaked her out. she ran under my bed and i went downstairs. 

no one else in the house has heard or seen it but i’ve seen it quite a few time, i asked my dad and he said it’s a drone. i have no idea what to do and i’m kinda terrified now. i thought it was just the aliens i used to pray for god to send and come get me lmao",22Oct2019,0

Almost every piece of advice I read on the internet is insanely depressing and paints the world I'm about to enter as a miserable, dream-crushing, soul-sucking place.

Why would *anyone* want to live like that? How am I expected to go on living if I'm just gonna end up in some miserable 9 - 5 that kills any fire inside of me? At least, most of the things I read on the internet are people complaining about how they're tired, they're broke, they're unhappy, they hate their lives.

I don't think this is good for me to read. I feel hopeless for the future. I don't enjoy doing anything anymore. I wanna go back to being a kid, when I felt things. 

Any path I choose seems like it will lead to misery as a side effect of modern society. I put faith into asking more life-experienced people for advice for my future but they're all zombies, and their light has been extinguished too. 

I wanna say fuck those people and their negativity for killing any passion and hope I may have had, and that if I am expected to grow up and be miserable like that, I will kill myself.",22Oct2019,6

I feel really bad because I feel like I’m missing out on stuff that other people are experiencing. I know high school is supposed to be fun and I only just started, but I feel like I’ve been left out of the fun. Everyone’s saying I’m super “innocent” and “pure” and I just wish I could fit in. I don’t know how to lower my score because most of the things on the test I’m way too scared to try and do most of them.  I have really bad anxiety and just the thought of me doing most of the things on this list make me freak out. I feel like I’m growing up way too fast and so is everyone around me.

148,"So long story short: I like JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. I told one of my friends this, and apparently she really despises it. When I asked her initially, she said she hates the art style. Understandable; JJBA has a very unique art style and she's an artist herself so she's obviously going to be paying more attention to that.

But then stuff started seeming a bit off. She knew a *lot* about the show. Not as much as I did, and she did make plenty of errors in her knowledge, but still: ***A LOT***. She knew basically all the events of the first three parts of the show and frequently brought them up in arguments.

This made me kinda confused at most, but then the following happened:

I told her I had a growing subreddit I'd made and that I was proud of it. We spoke a bit about how that was great and that the other mod I got was really good at the job, but as soon as I mentioned the community's name, r/standoffs, she went on a rampage. She went off on this huge rant about how stands are such a horrible concept with horrendous names and horrific designs, and I was just sitting here wondering why she instantly knew what the community was about and why she was so committed to being angry at everything about stands for seemingly no reason.

Well, contrary to what I initially thought, she never actually looked at the community. She's never watched a single episode or read a single chapter of JoJo either. She's just centered so much time and effort around hating a show for no reason that she knows more than many fans do.

How do you think she got to this point and how do I get her out of it?",22Oct2019,2

151,"My boyfriend and I [24F/25M] live together in a major city on the east coast, living a comfortable lifestyle in a nice two bedroom apartment, but nothing super luxurious. Boyfriend’s sister [30F] lives with the rest of his family in rural Wisconsin. She and her husband pretty much just make it by, but have always been able to vacation in FL by visiting the husband’s parents. Now that BF and I live together in a nice place, we have also become a vacation destination for her. She always comes alone, and always books the cheapest flight (usually a Thursday/Sunday) which always entails us picking her up at our local airport but dropping her off at the airport in the next state over that takes 2-2.5x longer to get to. She tries to vacation here as cheaply as possible, which is fine (and she never insists that we buy food or accommodate her, but let’s be real) but she also expects my boyfriend and I to change our plans on the drop of a hat - namely work. She works an hourly fast food job, and we both work in the corporate world. She expects us both to use our PTO every time she comes down, which isn’t realistic (especially for BF because he doesn’t get as much as I do) because we are constantly traveling to visit friends and family across the country. We also want to be able to vacation ourselves, etc. We also feel obligated to come up with some kind of plan/itinerary for us all when she gets here. She always insists that she’ll do “whatever” and is fine staying in, but again we’re trapped in that awkward host position where I want to be polite and let her have fun but it’s usually at our expense. 

The most frustrating part is that we feel like we can’t say no to her because we know she can’t afford to stay in a hotel here and wouldn’t be able to “vacation” at all if it wasn’t with family. However, it’s becoming a quarterly thing and we anticipate that it will start becoming more frequent. In contrast, we only see his family once a year during the holidays. I’ve been biting the bullet, convincing myself that it’s not a big deal but it’s really been bothering us as a couple and we feel like we’re in a bind. BF does not see his family often (by choice, strained relationships previously) and almost never talks to his sister - she talks to him through me because he intentionally never replies to her. I told him that HE has to be the one to put his foot down because if I do it, it will make me look like I’m trying to keep him from his family. 

We wouldn’t mind if she asked politely, but she just googles cheap flights, sends me the screen shots, and says “I should come down! This price is insane!!” and although I always default to my boyfriend and tell her to talk to him, it’s our joint decision behind closed doors. 

TLDR: boyfriend’s sister wants to do frequent impromptu vacations at our place and it’s annoying us. How do we decline her next “request” without looking like jerks?",22Oct2019,3

153," A bit of context is needed. I am originally from Canada. I was living an amazing life until my father passed away from cancer when I was 11 in 2009. My mom remarried a couple of years later to some jackass in Florida. She dragged us down here with her. I grew up from 11- nearly 22 in the central Florida area. I was promised citizenship but my ex stepdad never planned on filing us kids because he is a contractor and never paid income tax. Being a joint sponsor would have flagged this dick for his illegal neglect of taxes. I just finished a 2-year associate's degree. I'm working on my 4-year in engineering technology. After my mom got divorced to him she immediately filed for my siblings and I. But they took me into consideration after I turned 21. So now I am in an awful situation. I have been with my girlfriend for 2 years. We care about each other a lot and have a dog together. She doesn't care if we move to Canada or get married for me to get a permanent. If the ICE finds me I will be forced back into Canada with a 10-year ban for being here. Canada is great and all. However,  I grew up in FL. Middle school, high school, and college. I have a life down here. I don't have any previous jobs on record due to me not being a resident. But my ex stepdad did make me do 7 years of contractor, electrician, and roofing work. All I have going for me is my standard 2-year college degree and a Native American status. I don't even know what's happening in Canada right now.

155,"I don’t know how to end my relationship.  My boyfriend has severe depression and talks about wanting to kill himself all of the time. Sometimes he even cuts himself to temporarily distract himself from the anxiety and other mental pains he goes through.

When this happens I have to call his aunt and have her help calm him down because I can’t. I don’t have the kind of patient, nurturing personality it takes to deal with depression, anxiety, panic attacks, and the extreme needs he has for attention and care. I’m also trying to finish college. Spending every other night staying up until 4 am after a panic attack, knowing I will sleep through my 8 AMs is really causing my grades to suffer and my mental health is rapidly degrading.

My sister is dating a sex offender who is 22 years old. He has been living with my parents for the past few months as well, without their approval. Further, my older sister just recently had another friend of hers move in with them. My sister gave both of them keys to my parents house. All of this happened without their permission/approval.  
Needless to say, I've been pretty distraught for the past two years, but I was so angry yesterday when I found out that a complete stranger was living in my parents house without their permission that I called my sister and UNLOADED. I mean, I have NEVER yelled and screamed and cursed at someone like that before. I asked what was wrong with her and said that she doesn't deserve the kindness that we have given her through all this, and that she needs to grow tf up. After I hung up on her, I had a meltdown. She ran away from my parents house with her boyfriend and the stranger and said she was going to live in a halfway house. My dad was devastated and called me panicked. His words were ""I suppose I should be thanking you but I wish you hadn't done what you did."" I called her back shortly, apologized for how I handled the situation and asked her to go back home (alone). She did, but the stranger and her boyfriend are back in the house today.

I’m scared of showing affection unless it’s just us two around because of some verbal abuse I faced when I was younger, and I can’t tell him I love him because just the thought gives me anxiety. Everytime he tries to show affection in public I sort of act really cold and asshole-y and just sort of ignore and avoid him, and we’re barely ever allowed to be alone because I’m nineteen and living with my parents and they don’t let me be alone with him ever because they don’t want me to “make any choices I’ll regret”.

I'm currently on vacation giving myself a mental break because its taking a toll on me. I do not want to leave this job because I love the tasks I do and I fought so hard to get it.

We are team of about 8 girls. I would say 2 of them are the major instigators. Girl 1 has been there since day 1 and Girl 2 came in about 2 months ago and has only added a ton of fuel to the fire. 

Our manager did hold a meeting saying shes going to be more strict and start writing people up but she hasn't lived up to it. Shes not interested in dealing with people individually but they act like were a problematic team as a whole.

I have spoken up about things I've witnessed such as girl 1 being a bully to our handicapped associate and her breaking down to me about it. Girl 2 coming our areas and taking pictures of what were working on instead of minding her own business. Stuff like that and it's gotten nowhere. Girl 1 and girl 2 dont like each other at all, and because I'm friendly with everybody I'm seen as a 3rd party sometimes. Especially because these 2 are the main 2 I close with.

Girl 1 texted me today and let me know she was told we have to stop talking about drama before people start getting fired. I'm looking for advice on what to do to look good and not be a part of all this as much as possible.",22Oct2019,1

This literally happened 5 minutes ago and I’m still trying to make sense of my thoughts so I’m sorry if this sounds disjointed.

I just opened my Dad’s iPad to look up a phone number because I didn’t have my phone on me. I opened the internet browser and currently typed in the search bar was “(location he is travelling to in a few weeks) place to meet singles in 40s.”  When the search results actually came up, some of the links were purple, so obviously they had been explored.

I was really taken aback and wasn’t expecting this, it’s caught me really off guard. My Dad is someone I’ve always looked up to and really is my role model. They have been married for 27 years and not once have I ever noticed any major issues, problems or cracks in their relationship. They’ve been pretty much a model marriage.

I’m really scared and shaken up. I don’t know what to do or how to even react.",22Oct2019,0

167,"I don’t think anyone will read this considering the amount of posts in this community. But it feels good to type as if you’re asking for advice. Kinda feels like someone actually wants to hear you. Anyways, in 8th grade I went to a small hamburger restaurant. There was this group of boys there. I went there alone and it was around noon I think. The boys looked to be around my age except for one who clearly wasn’t. The oldest one, we’ll call him Jerry, started talking to me. I didn’t want to be rude but I felt kinda uncomfortable. As the questions got weirder and weirder I looked behind Jerry and I see a kid I know. We’ll call this kid, Alex. Alex was a bully in 7th grade but we kinda ended things off as friends-ish. Jerry then made a scene and started saying stuff like “don’t go drugs!” And then when I told him I was underaged he said, “Is it illegal to hold hands...kiss?” Uhm. Anyways, 8th grade starts and I have Alex in my class. Begins to tell me how he told Jerry all the information about me. And I found out that Jerry was a drug dealer. Fast forward,  (this is really weird) but Alex spread a rumor on how Jerry wanted to do “stuff” to me. Jerry was 19, I was 13. After that, Alex wanted to be friends. I. Did. Not. Like. Him. BUT. I couldn’t get on his bad side. Alex told me more things about Jerry which made me fear him more. As Alex told me more and the year went on, Alex disappeared. Supposedly he got expelled or was forced to move. After that I never saw him again and sadly, he left me with Jerry.  Jerry said he’d wait four years for me, but considering his recent actions, I don’t think so. Seriously, I want to stay away from him.

I plan to finish my degree since I have very little left of it... I do not know what to do with my life afterwards.

It's one of those cities where everyone leaves after finishing their degree.

\- I do find a certain passion for the arts but I do not consider myself creative enough.  
\-I am Mexican-american, I have both nationalities, this should help somewhat internationally.

\-I speak 3 languages: French, Spanish, and English.  
\-I love cinema, but I haven't been passionate enough to consider myself a movie snob.  
\-At last, I used to do a lot of street photography. My work was of enough quality to be in different exhibitions back in 2015/2016, I was only 17 at the time! Haven't done it in a while because college life and a really toxic relationship really stalled me in a lot of ways.

172,"I am a male freshmen in high school, and when the time came to pick out our P.E class i chose weights. I did this because I thought it would be more at your own pace like it was in middle school. They would just let us do what ever machines, and only machines that we wanted, at any weight that we wanted. Now obviously I knew that it would be more strict and difficult, but I at least thought it would be beginner friendly. High school weights is very very different. We have to do a difficult routine consisting of one main lift with a barbell, and then 2 supplemental lifts. He's making us do dead lifts, hang cleaners, squats, and bench presses. This is super hard for me. He never taught us the correct form for any of the lifts outside of him acting like he's doing it without holding any actual weight. I have messed up my back 2 times already doing hang cleaners because I don't know how to do them. My friend in the class has as well. Another issue that I am having is that I realized I cannot bench lift the 40 pound bar. My arms just give out. Dead. And it's not like I can lift dumbells or anything to get stronger, as I have to follow his plan. We are doing a max out test and when he sees that I can't lift the bar he'll fail me.

175,"A friend back in my hometown knows for sure that she's lesbian. Her parents are conservative and horrendously homophobic. To make matters worse, they are also incredibly controlling. They are constantly monitoring her messages to make sure she isn't secretly seeing a girl, so much to the point that to talk privately with the rest of our friend group about sensitive info, she has to communicate through comments made on an unsuspecting Google Doc. While she's been in the closet and worried about her parents finding out for a while now, it recently has gotten significantly worse. Her parents now suspect her of being bi, and are trying to convert her/convince her otherwise. Forcefully. While, to our knowledge, it hasn't escalated to physical violence, the emotional abuse is clear. She's now expressed suicidal thoughts aloud for the first time, and we as her friends are at a loss as to what to do.

Some things I should mention:

a) My friend is a senior in high school. She is going through the stress of AP classes + the college admissions process. Her parents are only supportive of her applying to certain schools; namely those close to home and more affordable.

b) A good number of us (including myself) are in college now, some up to hundreds of miles away. We cannot be there to talk with her in person, nor to speak to someone else on her behalf. 

c) Out current forms of aid: Continuing to talk through discrete methods, having her talk to the guidance counselor (she has not done this at the time of writing this post), having her call a suicide hotline. We're all spreading over the internet to  seek advice on what else we can do.

d) Coming out is practically out of the question. Her parents will not be even tolerant and she has no back up plan in case she gets kicked out.

We're all super worried about her, and we don't want to lose her. But we aren't sure what should be our next steps. We're not only worried for her now at home with her parents, we're also worried how she'll fare in college and beyond. If anyone at all has any advice on what she and what we can do, we would all be forever grateful. Thank you.",22Oct2019,1
176,"I have a half-brother who is 3 years older than me, he lived with us since before I was even born cause his mom was abusive so my dad got full custody. He was a nice big brother and I liked him a bit. We fought a bit but nothing ever too serious and I didn't even know he was my half brother till about 2 years ago.

The probably came up when his mom went to therapy and wanted to have joint custody and my dad was fighting that. (thats when I found out he was my half brother). My brother wanted to see his mom and to get joint custody but I guess my dad didn't want that cause he still thought she was abusive. I was like 13 at the time and had no idea what to think of any of it so I just stayed out of it. This was an on going fight for like a year and when I was 14 my half brother blew up on my dad calling him unspeakable names and ended it with a ""I fucking hate you and I can't wait till your dead."" I was disgusted with what I heard, later that night he left the house to go live with his bio mom. I was pretty fucking pissed that he said that to my dad and then a couple days later he said he still wants me to be his little sister and I basically told him that I won't be his little sister until he apologizes to dad. I never got a response after that. My sister has said I was too harsh on him and that he's just mad at dad and not at us, my brother is the same way at her and just can't seem to see the reason why I'm pissed at him for saying that about my dad. He is a great guy who had a messy divorce and has tried hard to make things right over the years.  Maybe I love my dad more than my siblings do since I wasn't the best child as a kid and he helped me get out of my bad kid attitude.  

Recently my sister said she was on the phone with him and he said he misses me and wants to catch up. I am conflicted on what to do since I do miss him too but idk if I can forgive what he said.

Should I give him a chance? I do miss having a big brother around in my life? I can never forgive what he said to my dad but should I just forget it and be his sister again?

So i asked, “What? How is it stupid.” and she replied with, “It isn’t that hard to just eat, or sleep. Or even stop cutting yourself.” and I was shocked.
     I explained that no kind of mental illness is stupid, and she should educate herself before she starts saying stuff like that. She proceeded to make fun of people with mental illnesses. F decided it would be funny to call me stupid for having anemia. I wasn’t fazed by that. 
     What got me is when she started making fun of my friends and my new friend’s (who sits at the table) scars. This relapsed my friend.

It was very, very stupid of me, but I decided to accept a payment for an item that I was selling on eBay, outside of eBay.

The buyer told me the transaction would be through PayPal, but it was unfortunately, a spoof. I’m not sure what I should do next honestly. Surely, PayPal can’t help me since it wasn’t through them.

184,"To shorten it, my teacher (just her, not the school or anything like that) is banning us from drawing ‘memes’ (that’s what she calls them, that tells you right there how she is) and even banning us from saying or doing certain stuff in class, yes I know what you immediately thought, ‘well you shouldn’t be doing it in the first place’, And I understand that thought completely, but here’s the thing that she literally yelled at us about, even going as far as to send a ‘news story’ about it from years ago, trying to ‘prove her point’ 
The hand sign, yes you probably thought of it, the classic meme peace sign that gets put below the waist and if you look then well buster-
Your outta luck if your friends know about it and are around. Well- She’s one of the bright minded people that thinks it stands for..well, WP because some news station grasped onto their last rope to be somewhat relevant.

And I know it may sound stupid...probably cause it is, and I understand that teachers do have it rough sometimes, but we’ve been nothing but nice to her??? And all we’ve gotten in return is being quite restricted on what we do, lectured, or yelled at simply because of her views on something much more then silly. (and she didn’t seem afraid at all to have us read the POLITICAL stuff on it, which I know they don’t allow serious political stuff like that in the classroom at our campus)

I know I know, it sounds stupid, but this is just a recent problem that EVERYONE in the class has a problem with, not because they’re‘uwu memers’ but because we all know it’ll just get worse and worse, a second year student even told me she was just as bad last year, and the one student that tried to stand up for themselves got sent back to their high school.
She doesn’t care for what the students say, and wonderfully enough, she’s one of those people that’s so egotistical and thinks they’re right 24/7, so it’s worthless if you argue with her. You’ll get nowhere cause she just doesn’t grasp anything you say if it goes against her opinions.

188,"Background: I had this teacher two years ago for Algebra II and now in Statistics, which was a class I was forced to sign up for because the counselor decided I was too smart for an art class and I needed to be in another math class (despite taking AP Calculus AB in the same year). In this AP Statistics class we used to have curves on the test, meaning that everyone got a few points added on to help boost their grade in a hard class.

Today the teacher said that he would no longer be handing out curves on exams because there was a case of students in 1st period (my class) telling 7th period the answers to all of the questions on the tests. He then pulled me out of class (so everyone could see) to tell me that I’m a cheater and I ruined have ruined my reputation and all of the teachers and, from now on, the students in my class, hate me.

I’ll admit, I did tell this one girl in my Psychology class what she should focus on studying for the test, because on days before the exam she would come up to my desk, loom over me, and beg me to tell her what was on the test. It’s my fault for telling her, but at the same time she’s the leader of my club and has the power to kick me out if she wanted, and I didn’t want to destroy something that I had built up for seven years (since middle school). Maybe a teacher saw that interaction and told the Stats teacher... but whatever.

The problem is, I’m conflicted on whether to completely give up and just skip his class for as long as I can or to stand up to him and make damn sure that I get good grades on all of his tests and homeworks. I feel like the first one would be admitting that I’m 100% at fault and that he wins, but on the other hand would be less stressful on a day to day basis. The second option would be much stressful on me day to day as I would have to face this man every morning, but at the same time I wouldn’t have to show defeat and I can prove that I will succeed even if everyone may want me to die. After all, if he wants to play this little game of toying with my emotions and my grades, then I might as well win at it.

So, what should I do?

197,"My grandma and I have always been very close, and her house is like a second home to me. She is very religious and when I was younger she would often tell me bible stories. I went to a private catholic school up until about 3 years ago and overall I was in a pretty religious family. Now, my grandma is really sick and she probably won’t make it to next year. This on its own is heartbreaking enough, but even more so when coupled with the fact that I am starting to have some doubt in God. After all, what sort of god would let such a kind person and loyal servant die so painfully? Thing is, I don’t think I could handle it if I believed that after she died, her memory and consciousness just stopped existing. I have to believe that she will be able to be happy and watch over me after she dies, because if I don’t, I might break.

198,"The dumbest shit is happening to me. I was choked by someone I called a friend twice after I told them to stop the first. They thought it was a joke and so did everyone else apparently because no one tried to stop him. I was with a group of ""friends"" most of whom I met at a college prep summer program I went to. One of the ""friends"" that I was with was one from my highschool and she had  joined  the friend group after fall started(we are all first year college students). She didn't even say anything or have my back even though I was clearly upset.
And get this: the reason the guy choked  me as a :""joke"" was because I said something about Cardi B who is his ""favorite"" rapper ( he is gay btw). 
I decided to completely remove myself from the friend group since no one had my back. The guy who choked me still has not apologized or even acknowledged his behavior. I talked to the friend from my highschool the other day and explained why I was upset and how I was disappointed that no one stood up for me . When we were talking she seemed as though she was going to cry and only said ""it was preventable"". She later sent an apology and acknowledged that she ""failed me as a friend"". I went home for the weekend to take a break from everything. 
That night, I'm at home scrolling through people's snapchat stories and I notice on one of the ""friends"" snaps that the whole friend group is at dinner  including the friend from my highschool and the guy who choked me. The guy hasn't even apologized but I would think that after how he treated me the others would have held him accountable after they saw that I was not okay with that treatment. I immediately  disconnect all social media ties to all members of the friend group except the one fringe highschool. I feel like I'm going crazy because I feel as thoughno one in the friend group is seeing it from my perspective and I know things would have went way differently if the same had happened to any one of them.

I already have trust issues, anxiety and insecurities when it comes to relationships and this making it 10x worse. 

Should I try to mend the friendship with the friend from highschool or should I just accept that she chose them over me and move on?

Also what do I do if I am confronted by one of them?",22Oct2019,1

My brother (19) visited from college yesterday and it made me realize how different my life is with him gone, and I toured college campuses all last weekend and I know it’s super normal to be stressed out by these things but I’m finding that I’m not so much stressed as sentimental. Its not that I don’t want to be an adult, it’s that I don’t want to stop being a kid. It’s like I’m nostalgic for something I haven’t even lost yet. I’m not even sad I just cry and cry, I am sentimental to such a degree that it’s impacting my ability to function. I’m honestly excited to be independent and go to college and buy groceries and all that it’s not like I am afraid of becoming an adult, I guess i am afraid of losing my childhood.

I'm trying to reach out for help but I can't seem to get any. 

I'm stuck in this apprenticeship that I hate now. I worked with my old boss for 4 years, and no problems ever happened, and then he sold it to my Co worker, who I also used to get along with. New owners, and the new guy who works here hate me, and wants me gone, but if I just merely suggested I leave, they'd be up in arms. I don't know what to do. I no longer have the drive to come to work anymore, all that happens is I wake up, go to work, get abused, go home and feel like shit. It's ruining my life. Everything's a competition with them. They always say ""get over it, I had xxxxx happen"", they never listen. I'm always polite and listening to them. 


They railed me the other day cause I wasn't working 100%,, and I just said it was cause I was tired. Truth was, theyre just beating a dead horse at this point, and I get so depressed that I can't work.

204,"Never thought it was possible to be emotionally torn apart, and verbally abused 11+ hours per day Monday through Friday. At my job as a software developer, I am doing everything I can to make the company soar, but 11+ hours per day in our ~100 square foot office with this guy, my lead developer gaslights me for hours on end. I go on lunch each day to make sure I eat for blood pressure problems (at 24 y/o, very sad), and get chewed out for going to lunch.
Before it was a lot worse, I was working 8AM-6PM in a helpdesk role, then beginning on call starting at exactly 6PM, I would rush to the bus, and take non stop tech support calls while taking the long bus ride home, until about 7AM the next morning. (I totaled my car being so tired at 4:30AM on the way to a client on-site repair, and ended up on the curb on the way)
I eventually ended up almost having a stroke and getting super sick due to no sleep, and stress. I took some sick time in the hospital to recover, and I have to this day, even though I did not end up having an actual stroke, not gained any feeling back in my face (numb) and continue to be lethargic as of today, no matter how much I sleep nowadays. Sadly I feel something happened, causing the senses in my facial area to deteriorate terribly, as well as slurred speech anytime I talk.

They ended up “promoting me” to software developer, which has turned instantly into basically pure, utter abuse, and behind the scenes are higher ups speaking of trying to get me to quit as I’m a “liability” due to my hospital stay, having worked nearly 24/7 for almost 5 months.

I have been looking for jobs for 3 months now, desperately trying to get me out of this abusive environment, and even with interviews, the job market is so competitive in this field and helpdesk, that I cannot find a position.
I’m stuck in an apartment lease expensive as heck, but cheap for the area, and cannot pay this lease on your typical fry cook or retail worker salary to get me through it so I can potentially move.
Nothing is happening quick enough, and I cannot find a job, and this job is at stake, due to the constant bantering at me and chewing me out by my lead developer. Ending the apartment lease early is not an option, as they require a 60 day notice, and then a 45 day additional payment to end the lease without an eviction record. 

After the hospital expenses and all, I do not have thousands to just pony up here to get out of the bind. So I’m stuck at this job until I find another job, and the apartment lease cannot be ended until I have that cash to front, which would require a bit of a better salary to speed things up.

I know it’s a lot, and it really is.. but I guess my question of needed advice comes to: what now? What options do I have? I’m going insane, my health is rapidly declining again, I can’t be without a job at all, and retail/food won’t cut it as I cannot do any major physical labor since my health issues began, without the risk of fainting/passing out.

Any advice is helpful, even if little bits of advice from everyone that can contribute can be all pieced together into an action plan. I’m tired.",22Oct2019,1

211,"Hi Reddit!

Here’s the situation:  we recently relocated to rural Kentucky and are renting a house while we look for a home to buy.  We rented said home while still in our old state and our landlords let us know that they own the property next door as well -there is no fence between the properties - and told us that the neighbors have three kids who were a bit nosy, but good kids nonetheless. 

This was straight BS. 

There are five of them, not three.  Ages 10-17. 4 boys, one girl. All of them have mouths that would make a merchant marine shocked and horrified.  Their father has cirrhosis and doesn’t work and the mom also doesn’t work.  The father just moved out, so it’s just the mom now. 

These children have no boundaries.  They play in our yard even though we have asked them not to.  They have opened our mail. They knock on the door asking to “borrow” everything from cheese to toilet paper 3+ times per week. They antagonize our elderly dog through the screen door. Here’s the kicker:  one of our outside cats had a litter of kittens four weeks ago.  The girl child came up on our back porch today and walked off with one of the kittens.  When my spouse flipped shit and screamed at the kid to bring it back, said spawn of hell kept on walking until her mother finally came out and told her to take it back.  

We clearly see that their home life is not good.  The water has been shut off once and the power twice in the two months we’ve lived here.  The parents fought all the time.  We have since found out that they were evicted from their previous home and that one of the boys was violent with his teachers and isn’t allowed back in that school. Stability is not something they have.  However, this is no excuse to just be a feral pack of animals. 

We have asked them politely to be respectful only to be cursed at and called derogatory names.  We have tried being nice, only to have them escalate.  We have called the landlord.  We have talked to the mother.  These kids just keep on doing whatever tf they want.  And it’s not just us:  they also do the same to our elderly neighbor on the other side.  

We are now at our limit.  What options do we have?   We just want us and our stuff and our animals left alone.  

Thanks!",22Oct2019,1

We have never had any major issues in the relationship. He doesn't really text other girls, isn't in contact with any of his ex's, has never cheated in past relationships and has been extremely loyal to me our whole relationship...until saturday night.

They had never talked before this point and neither expressed any interest in the other whatsoever before saturday. They were both drunk but not blacked out and they made out and according to everyone at the party, he did not initiate but didnt stop it either. He told me immediately the next day and was so extremely full of guilt, remorse, pain. He was really torn up about it and knows damn well that he fucked up. He told me that if I would consider taking him back, he would stop drinking altogether, i could check his phone every day, delete every girl off his phone, etc. Etc.

Around a convenient time known as Valentine’s Day, me and my “girlfriend” had a falling out, even though we still talked to each other. This kid named Gio kept debasing me and constantly tried to prove me wrong, that he was right, and not in a kind way. Essentially being an asshole about it.

After isolating myself until the end of year, I became depressed. I would talk to my crush about it and she was wonderful in helping me out because she had gone thru what I have.

But now in high school, my crush doesn’t really reply or text me, and she hangs out with Gio. Gio decided to take control of the group after it split up due to different schools and stuff. Me and the twins had the original idea to get the group together, and for him to leave us behind and have everyone else be normal. My cousin who is stronger isn’t at school, he had surgery still recovering. Me the twins and one of my friends from school aren’t really recognized as people of the group and Gio treats us with no respect.

225,"Here is a rundown of what happened tonight

I went out to the communal kitchen in my apartment that has 3 bedrooms to cook an omelet sandwich  for my girlfriend and I. While I was making them my roommate had a girl over who was cuddling on the couch with him. He was trying to get her to focus on the show they were watching and he was growing frustrated because she was focusing on her phone. They argued over the tv the whole time I was cooking and I felt like it was a bad date but nothing endangering. At one point she got mad that he called a 16 year old cute and later I heard “I know. I lived with her and she said you flirted with her when she was 16.”

After I returned to my room to eat and watch the dark crystal tv series with my girlfriend, I went out to get ice for my drink and thought (still think) I heard her say “stop, youre hurting me.” I looked to make sure everything was alright just as he pulled his face off hers I assumed from a kiss. 

Later in my room I heard thumping and then gasping and gurgling. This prompted me to leave my room and say 
“is everything alright”
They both said no. RM was on top of her. I then said
“If there is anything wrong let me know. Scream even”. 
RM then said
“Hey tristan come here”
To which I went back to my room and locked the door to watch more dark crystal. 

RM then began yelling at me through the door and the girl he was with. He was yelling “did I rape you” and “did I hit you” a lot.

Eventually my other roommate came home with friends. He has guns in his room and i told him the situation and told him to call the cops or do something if he hears something bad. I had my girlfriend with me and i did not want to endanger her to a potential predator so we left to drive around and calm down. I finished typing this at 1140 PM and I left my apartment at approximately 1030 PM

227,"For context, heres the story. me and my ex were in a long distance relationship for a bit over a year and a half. It was really good at the start, but towards the end of the first year together she started to become more and more emotionally abusive. I struggle with depression and extreme anxiety, after the first bit of dealing with me when I wasn't at my best she started to act more and more like she didn't care and i was basically just a burden when I was struggling. This went on for half a year, keep in mind she struggled with similar things and honestly treated me really awfully when I would try to help but I was always there trying, that's the important thing right? An attempt was always being made to comfort her and help her in some way. But she didn't really want to do that for me. We broke up and got back together a few times, once for a week, once for a month and a bit, each of those times she was the one that left me but I kept taking her back when she asked. One point fairly recently before the break up I told her about a disorder I came to found ive been struggling from and all she said was ""sounds about right"" and basically threatened to leave me a few times that day, until I ""made it up to her"". A few days after that is when I finally decided enough was enough and I broke up with her. It was a really hard thing to do, because despite everything for some reason I still loved her, she was my first real love (not some 2 month high school relationship like my others in the past), and I was scared to be on my own again but I did it. Then 2 weekends ago (a week after we broke up) she started dating this guy that she promised was ""just a friend"" when we were together, but a couple days later threatened to kill herself because I didn't care about her anymore (apparently because she heard I developed feelings for another girl), then when I told her she faked a suicide attempt then blamed it on me. Ever since then I've been getting message after message from her and her friends over various social media platforms and accounts. I dont know how to react, I loved this girl and did everything for her, she  ""moved on"" in a half a week then got her friends to start making fun of the way I look calling me disgusting and such when she knows ive struggled a long time with self conciousness. It all just hurts and I dont know what to do. If anybody read this and has any advice thank you, I'm a mess right now and I really could use some advice.",22Oct2019,2
228,"I have been hopping around tutoring, academic advising, prof. office hours, and recently mental health services. I'm still falling behind in homework and I think I'm losing my mind.

I can only attempt to sum this up, I am doing nothing but homework, but it takes me so long to finish I can't do anything else. First, I stopped being able to go to social events. Then, I couldn't take breaks at all, for anything that wasnt absolutely necessary (still slept as much as I could, ate food, etc.). Then, I couldn't go to advising/office hours as often. Next, I ran out of time to even study for exams. I could only do assignment. Recently, I've been pulling all nighters.

In my Junior High, we had a friend group that I nicknamed the outcasts. This was because we were all introverted, and we all decided to eat lunch together. Come 8th grade, and people I don’t like/soon to dislike start sitting at the table. At the table everyone had like equal treatment and it was nice.

Around a convenient time known as Valentine’s Day, me and my “girlfriend” had a falling out, even though we still talked to each other. This kid named Gio kept debasing me and constantly tried to prove me wrong, that he was right, and not in a kind way. Essentially being an asshole about it. I was already starting to separate myself from the group, and then, I decided to isolate myself, except for 6 people: The twins who were on board with me leaving, my new crush, 2 other friends from school, and 1 from church.

After isolating myself until the end of year, I became depressed. I would talk to my crush about it and she was wonderful in helping me out because she had gone thru what I have.

But now in high school, my crush doesn’t really reply or text me, and she hangs out with Gio. Gio decided to take control of the group after it split up due to different schools and stuff. Me and the twins had the original idea to get the group together, and for him to leave us behind and have everyone else be normal. My cousin who is stronger isn’t at school, he had surgery still recovering. Me the twins and one of my friends from school aren’t really recognized as people of the group and Gio treats us with no respect.

She does things like telling me to stop doing that while sending a picture, instead of asking me to clean it or she will bitch me out for the bacon grease I miss instead of telling me I missed it. She also will use any excuse that I use against me in a passive way. For example one of my things is not to leave things in the sink because she would fill it to the brim with her dishes. I left a bowl in there one after noon as I was soaking off dried up cake batter. She has now said she is leaving soup bowls soaking or lids to tupper ware soaking without any water in the sink.

240,"Hey everyone and thanks for helping. Here's what's happening. I'll try to keep it concise and as objective as possible.

I'm 21 years old and a senior in college. There are two guys in my class (let's call them Frank and Josh). I like hanging around both, but for different reasons. Frank is extremely amusing and is always looking for something funny to say. He can be outright offensive sometimes but he doesn't seem to care and just moves on. Cocky too. He's generally fun to be with and gets along with most of my friends and most of the class.  Josh is more of a loner. He's an older guy. He gets along with 3-4 people out of our class,. He doesn't drink, but he seems to have no problem meeting people. The thing I like about Josh is that he always has some sort of project going on, or an idea, or something. He's always focused on something and he tends to be very passionate about it. Even during class he's always drawing on his notebooks or taking notes for his next project, and he's already published a book (gave me a copy). He can still be playful and funny but it's a rarer. Being with him gives me this sort of... vibe. idk. Makes me feel inspired.

Another difference between them is that Frank is very outgoing and plays along with everything. Josh lives in his own world, and is more often serious than not. And whenever he's angry at something, he speaks up. Other times he will just randomly look into my eyes and tell me I'm beautiful, or smart, or a great girl, or whatever. He still messes with me from time to time, but is very rarely offensive. I have mixed feelings about this. He makes me feel amazing sometimes, other times he only brings unnecessary drama to people. Earlier this week he posted on our class group (includes current students and students who have finished the course recently) asking people to contact him urgently if they wanted a job offer in our field. Some of our classmates were out and responded with photos of them dancing or eating. He immediately snapped, called them kids, told them that someone who could potentially find employment could lose it by ignoring the group chat because of the photos, said if he wanted to see their ugly drunk faces he would get an Instagram account. Everyone turned against him apart from his little group of friends.

And this brings me to the heart of the problem. I started out really liking Josh. We went out on a couple of dates. I had to ask, because he wouldn't even reply to my texts apart from setting/confirming dates. After our 2nd-3rd date things turned pretty cold. To this day, I don't know why. I suspect it's because I never shared any ideas or projects of my own, I only listened to his, but he never told me the reason. I still felt somewhat attracted to him. But then, the more me and my friends got closer to Frank, the more he backed away, until he started ignoring me completely. I confronted him about this when I got him alone and asked if we could go into his car and talk. 

I accused him of being jealous, and basically his only reply was ""Look, I really am not comfortable being friends with you guys. Frank is always insulting you and other people. I want to have people who build each other up, not clowns or people who are focused on bringing others down, and not people who like being insulted. I'm not giving you a choice, I'm saying it's best we go our separate ways for now"". Thing is, I kinda miss him. After that he started talking to me again... when he has to. If we sit next to each other in class for example. He makes a couple of jokes, shares what he's doing now, and that's it. He won't text me or talk to me if I don't talk to him first. What do you think I should do? Is there any way of mending my relationship with Josh without ruining mine with Frank (they don't speak to each other)? Should I reach out to him? As for Frank, idk. I like hanging out with him a lot, but I don't know if I could have anything beyond friendship with him... what to do?",22Oct2019,2

246,"Hi,

I'm 29 and due to a lot of different reasons I never had a girlfriend and I don't have the smallest clue, how and where to get one. I think it's mostly because of the fact that women were never really interested in talking to me, at least for a longer period. Maybe it's because im unintentionally rude or creepy or childish or whatever. I've stopped thinking about it a long time ago.

When I passed the 20 and still had no girlfriend I got a little desperate and I started to only talk to women to get a gf. I had to learn that being desperate doesn't help and no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get a single female to like me. So I stopped talking to women because I couldn't bear it anymore and started to prepare my life in solitude. :D

For the past 4 years, my life entirely consisted of studying and video games and hiding at my parents house. I recently had to move to a new city for my first job. Rents are high and the only option I have is a shared flat with one guy and ... three women, lol. For the record, when I moved in there were guys only.

They are all at least 7 years younger than me, but living with them is fine so far. They don't know I'm a total weirdo and I try to behave normal. Sometimes we cook together or we just talk at a cup of tea or we have game night.

But I think my relationship with one of them might be a little different. I didn't realize it at first but for the past 3 weeks, we had dinner together nearly every evening. After that we just sit there for another hour or more and talk about work and... kinda everything else.

Our dinner has really started to make my day and now I'm at this point, where I can't stop thinking about what that means.

First of all, I know for a person like me, it is pretty difficult to not confuse attention with attraction. But I've had some good talks with my other roommates too and I don't think about them at all and as far as I know she hasn't been talking this much to anyone else in our flat.

I usually drive to work with my bike. The other day, I had a flat tire and had to get up half an hour earlier. The same time as she does. Our breakfast was basically the same as our dinner but less time to talk ...in the kitchen. We basically have the same path to work, so walked together too.

The next day, when she saw me this early in the hallway something strange happened. She said good morning and looked immediately looked down on the ground and I believe she smiled. I haven't fixed my tire yet, and I think she doesn't mind because she keeps asking me every day, how I'll get to work tomorrow.

I don't intend to ask her out, after all, she is my roommate but I'd really like to find out if she likes me. Because if this would be the case, It would give me at least a little self-confidence back. So could anyone tell me how I can find this out, without asking her directly?

248,"I’m only a 17 year old girl who’s a high school junior, but the best memories I have are the ones from middle school (which I think I took for granted). I didn’t have social media, I didn’t have pressure to do well in school, and I had a ton of free time and did really give care about anything. 

I traveled with my mom to Colorado where all I did was spend time in nature and watch anime in the cabin we had. There was zero stress. Most of my time in middle school was just drawing and watching anime and spending time with my friends.

I even went on a class trip to Germany in seventh grade (which is where I had my first best friend break up and felt emotions I never experienced before until that day). And summer before 8th grade I went up to the magical place of pacific grove with my best friend where we stayed with my grandparents. We walked around the town everyday, ate good food, stayed up late watching movies, went shopping, and went to the museums and aquariums there. 

And even though my relationship with my mom was rocky in middle school due to me just being a self centered, immature, brat, we traveled to places like San Francisco and and Colorado and where my grandparents live and it was amazing! I remember having no stress and just a magical time and these were all during my 6th grade and 7th grade years of middle school.

I do remember drama, being insecure, emotional, and getting into stupid fights in middle school and being really immature. But now that I’m in high school, I really miss middle school and wish I savored it more. I feel like I experienced some really magical things. 

At night my best friend and I would sit in the street by my house and talk while we watched the sunset and the stars come out. 

I’d watch anime until 2am because I had no homework.

I loved to draw and didn’t have thoughts of people judging me for my art or that there were others out there better than me (which made me stop drawing).

I spent hours reading and writing all the time.

I was barely on my phone and read books! 

HAD NO SOCIAL MEDIA! 

6th and 7th grade was a great time that I took for granted.

Sadly in eighth grade I developed anorexia (was diagnosed with BDD in fifth grade which was one of the few stresses I had in 6th and 7th grade, which were really good years for me). And 8th grade was terrible. I was irritable, malnourished, and just a huge mess. Then I went to treatment and was thrown into high school. Freshman year was tough, sophomore year was better and a learning experience, and right now things are chill. Picking bad friends and dealing with an eating disorder has made my high school experience a bit rocky but it has gotten so much better. I just miss the things from middle school like the freedom of not having that much peer pressure, having rarely any homework, not racing to get a license and being embarrassed that your parents still drive you places, free time to watch tv and hangout with friends, and just the stress free life I had in 6th and 7th grade. 

I’m just scared that I peaked in 6th and 7th grade because I had such a great time and really miss it.",22Oct2019,5

264,"Obligatory mobile user warning.

So I (23F) started seeing this guy (21M) I really liked for roughly 2 months. It was going great, sex was amazing, and he gave me his favourite sweater with his name on it. I met his sister and his mom on a few occasions. Then out of the blue he just stopped talking to me.

He didn't talk to me so I sought him out in person at work (we work in the same place, different departments), I asked if everything was okay, he said it was. 

So I asked if I could come over and he said yeah. Later, when I got off work, he messaged saying that his old friend is suddenly in the hospital and he's rushing over there. I tried to call and he sent me to voicemail after a couple rings. I asked if he was okay and he never read my messages.

It's been 3 weeks but I still miss him. I haven't seen him since either. I just wanna know what went wrong?

I also saw his ""bestfriend"" who always called him, upload a picture of her wearing one of his sweaters and I guess they're seeing each other now. Which still makes me a bit sick. 

I didn't like his constant partying, drinking, smoking, and coke addiction. But I liked that he always tried to pleasure me and learn how I like things.

265,"My plan for as long as I can remember is to accel in math, and go into a math related career, and that’s still my path. I’m in math classes grades above mine, and that would be the safest option for my future. The one thing conflicting me is that I think I have a personality entertaining enough for people to enjoy. It’s really easy for me to make friends, connect with people, and make other laugh. I absolutely crave attention in all of my classes, I love when the focus is on me. I constantly go out of my way to stand out, get a laugh out of someone, or just get someone to know that I exist. People tell me frequently to be a comedian, but I don’t think I’m fit for that, but a job like that is infinitely better than any desk job I’d get with my math skills. I’m in drama at my high school and I love the class, but I don’t think I’m fit to be an actor either, I don’t think I want to be an actor. What job can I get with only a booming personality on my side, if any? Help!!",22Oct2019,1
266,"This is going to be a weird one, but I was messing around on omegle  procrastinating, typing ""spooky"" messages, like pretending to be a crazy  person and saying I could see someone in the room with them, stuff like  that. Well, I was on there for a couple hours, and as I was chatting, I  kept progressing into darker and darker 'trolls' I guess you would call  them. Lets just say Ive probably spent too much time reading at creepy  shit on the internet. At the time I thought it was funny... Eventually I  was pretending to be locked up in someones basement and stealing the  neighbors wifi to use omegle, however I never said explicitly that I was  there against my will and needed help or anything. The person on the  other end didnt seem to believe me at first, but I just took that as an  invitation try harder to creep them out. Eventually I think they started  to believe me. Well, I had been sitting on the computer for a couple  hours and really needed to take a piss, so without thinking I just told  them I had to go and ran to the bathroom without telling them it was all  just a ruse like I usually would. I came back and they had wrote 'wait'  just before I exited. It then hit me that they might have actually  believed me and it would be completely rational for them to report this  as a tip to the fbi or something. So Ive just been really stressed about  that, I dont think  I did anything illegal technically, and if they  look at the other convos that came from my ip, it would be obvious that I  was either a troll or just some crazy person(not even denying that Im  crazy honestly, my grasp of reality slips more and more each day), but  Im still crazy paranoid something bad is going to come out of this. I  guess what Im asking is if I am justified in being as worried/paranoid  as Im being? I know it was stupid to do, Ive been more depressed lately  than I usually am and my usual entertainment hasnt been able to distract  me from it, so when I found that just writing  deranged and crazy shit to spook people on omegle actually distracted me from it, I kinda just got  sucked in and definitely took it too far.

267,"I’ve been told this by several different people and I’m starting to wonder if I believe them. It used to not bother me because even though they may think that way of me, I felt like I’m not as dumb because they didn’t actually know what I was thinking. I admit I have a hard time conveying my thoughts into words and getting my message across. I think that’s where people start thinking I’m saying stupid things? It makes sense in my head but I guess not to them and most of them time I rather not try and explain it because they either wouldn’t listen or their judgement is already set. Although I can’t say for sure if it’s just me being an airhead but after an incident in which my friend said I “need to learn better street smart,” it bothered me a lot and I started thinking. I don’t believe that in the situation I was in any wrong. When I told another person about the incident and from my perspective, they agreed with me and thought it was also rude of my friend to call me out like that. So am I the air headed one or is it just because people wanna believe that way of me because of how I am?
Then I started questioning do I have possible ADD? I know I can be very childlike (it doesn’t help with my baby face either) but I feel that’s also because of my personality. When I get overly excited with something I like or I’m passionate about, I tend to exaggerate because I genuinely want others to try or learn about it as well. I also do tend to forget things frequently for small things. Examples would be if I’m at home and I’m headed downstairs to do something specific, I might get distracted and actually forget why I even came down but sometimes I’d catch myself to think hard about why I’m there. 
It’s starting to irk me a lot knowing friends would look at me like that because I’m like this, To me it feels I can’t be taken seriously.",22Oct2019,1

270,"First off, if  I come off as whiny, I'm sorry, it's not my intent.

I  make movie reviews and pop culture type videos.  It's just me sitting  in a room and expressing my opinions.  I also have some characters on  the channel that involve puppets and costumes.  (Sorry if this sounds  like an ad, but it's important).

Anyway,  my Dad doesn't seem to care really about my filming stuff, but my mom  despises it.  She walks into my room while I'm filming, and grabs my  phone, which is the only thing I use for filming.  She then puts it in  her and my dad's room and locks the door.  She's also thrown away  several costumes and props I worked hard on, claiming I ""left them lying  around"" (total bullshit, I have them neatly organized on my desk.  I  also needed a scene with a toy robot opening a refrigerator, and she  literally stood in front of the fridge, refusing to move.

She  complains if I swear a couple of times in a video for comedic effect,  and she demands I delete the videos, or she's going to report to Youtube  that I'm underage.  I'm 16.  16 years old.  Youtube is not going to  give 2 shits about my age at that point.  My dad tries to stop her,  telling her that I'm being creative, and it's what I enjoy doing, but  she lectures him about how what I'm doing isn't ""productive"" and how I  should be using my time filming for studying.

Everytime  I try to defend myself, she says I'm ""talking back"" and when I get  pissed that she throws away 4 hours of work, she says I'm ""throwing a  tantrum over a waste of time"". and threatens to delete my channel.  It  was my mistake giving my google information to my dad, because he's  pretty much her cuck at this point.  She also has my dad turn off the  wifi from his phone when I'm uploading.

273,"Hi everyone! Would gladly appreciate any advice here. Sorry for the wall of text!

Last Monday I had a “check coolant” message pop-up on my dash. Decided to take it to my local mechanic that I’d been going to for almost 3 years. I told him the symptoms, and he said they’d take a look at it. Few hours later, I get a call back. Water pump + electronic thermostat. Just short of $2,000. The car is a BMW. The shop has great reviews, no issues. Going there almost 3 years. I authorize the repair. About an hour later, I re-call having purchased the extended warranty almost 3 years ago. Oops. Never had to use it, so I had a
mental lapse here. He gives me a big sigh and says his guy already returned from the dealer with the parts and how the warranty company has it’s own procedures. Blah blah blah. (This is all on Monday still)

I get an email on Friday from them saying the warranty company authorized the repairs, but that I would have to pay the deductible. ...But I don’t have a deductible. Called my warranty company to confirm. Not only do I not have a deductible, but no repair shop had called them at that point.

Fast forward to today, I get a call that my cars ready. Mechanic says he’s still working on the deductible but everything was “approved” and he wouldn’t hold my car. They also “pre-emptively” replaced a coolant hose, which in my mind, was probably the culprit. As I’m literally 5 minutes away, I get an email alert stating a warranty claim was just submitted from my warranty company. At this point I just want to take possession of my car and figure the rest out later. 


I pay what was due on my end and the car rolls up from a parking lot they use across the street. Visibly dirty. But in my rush to get back to work, I don’t examine it close enough. I get home tonight and:
- lower portion of the driver side door is dinged
- rear bumper + diffuser are scuffed with paint chipping
- front bumper scuffed against a curb
- exterior is filthy with handprints and dirt + interior smells like cigarettes

Obviously wish I had pictures just before I rolled the car in, but I don’t. If they refuse to accept liability or cover damages, what do I do? Call my insurance? Or am I SOL with it being my word vs. his.

In CA by the way.

274,"I saw a good deal with a phone company on a Saturday - $59 monthly plan and $0 for the phone.

I purchased. Got an email saying order received and total is $59 a month. Great.

Get a call from the phone company on the Tuesday asking to confirm some details, great, we're sending you your contract.

Receive the contract and it says $59 a month plan and $5 a month for the phone.

Confused I call them back. Explain the situation and my order email confirmed on the Saturday.

Phone company says that because they created the contract on the Tuesday and the promotion on the Tuesday is $59 + $5, that's my contract.

I try to argue that this is not the plan I ordered and does this mean that if they chose to take a month to create my contract they could charge me whatever they choose? They escalate the complaint to a case manager (yet to be assigned)

282,"This is a super long story so I’m going to try and make it as short as possible. I apologize in advance for typos, it’s late. 

So my boyfriend (20m) and I (19f) have been together for a little over a year. Right before we started dating, my best friend and I went to a party for the first time. My boyfriend’s friends, who we’ll call John and Adam, were at the party and gave my friend and I laced weed and alcohol, and tried to convince us to go home with them. I believe John would have had nonconsensual sex with me that night had it not been for a good group of friends that kicked him out of the party after they found out he was trying to take me home. Adam stalked my best friend after the party for a good two months and made her life a living hell. As a rape victim, the whole ordeal really messed me up and I had a lot of trust issues with my boyfriend and people in general. 

After my boyfriend and I started dating and I found out they were all friends, I told him about what happened. At first he victim blamed me and made me feel as if it were my fault. He told me it was just too hard to believe that his friends would do something like that. It took a lot of talking and crying on my part for him to believe me, but he did. After he realized how messed up the whole ordeal was and how upset it made me, he talked with me and decided that people like John and Adam weren’t people he would want to have as friends, and I agreed. He basically cut contact with them and didn’t tell them the reason. 

So that brings us to last night. My boyfriend and I have each other’s passwords, and phone privacy has always been a non-issue, considering we both feel we have nothing to hide. I was using my boyfriend’s phone to send a text because mine was dead, and in his messages I saw he’d been texting both John and Adam. I thought it was weird and clicked on the text from John. It looked like the thread had been deleted before, because John had said something along the lines of “yes for sure, we should get together this weekend” and my boyfriend replied with a yes. That was all, just two text messages in the thread. I clicked off of it and didn’t say anything to him because I wanted time to think about it. I used his phone again today, and the thread was deleted. 

Part of me feels bad because I feel like I saw something I wasn’t meant to see. Obviously my boyfriend didn’t want me to see it, or he wouldn’t have deleted the thread. He knows how upset it made me, and how him not believing me and victim shaming me took a toll on our relationship. I don’t know if I should ask him about why he’s talking to them again after what happened, or if I should leave it alone and come to terms with the fact he still wants to be friends with people like them. I know I’m leaving out a whole lot to the story and some background information, but it’s late and I’m distraught. I don’t want to mess up all the progress I’ve made with my mental health but I also don’t want to mess up a one year relationship. It’s been a rough ride getting back to where I am now regarding my mental health. I don’t want to police who he talks to, but it kind of disgusts me that the person I love wants to be friends with them still, even after knowing what kind of people they are. Part of me thinks he maybe never believed me, which is even harder but I’m not sure if talking to him about it would even help considering I already have.",22Oct2019,1

285,"I recently started work as a trainee pharmacy tech in buffalo and I am seriously doubting my employers intentions to pay me. 

Before I started work he said that he wanted to check if we were a good fit for each other and I didn't mind working a day for free or even two. But since it's pretty much confirmed that I am being retained for full time employment, it should mean that we are a good fit.

So I asked him if I should expect to get paid now that he has already seen my performance for a while and he said ""yeah hopefully but let's have you learn the work a bit more for one-two more days. I want to pay you after you have increased your speed and know how to enter insurances in the database."" 

Excuse me, wtf. I already process this stuff pretty fast and by the entire staff's admission am a very fast learner. I have learnt like 80% of the work and already know how to enter insurances in the database. 

He said he's going to START paying me after one or two more days which is still not a definite time period. Which means he is beating around the bush and is trying to make me do as much work as he can for free. I am especially convinced of this because the only thing he retained of me is my CV. He didn't check/want any official documents like my passport or SSN which means I am probably not entered into the business' employee listing.

I already worked 31 hours for this dude for free and he expects me to come Monday to Friday for 9 hours a day.
I really really really don't want to do that.

The worst part about this is they are hiring new people so I also fear losing whatever low chance I already have of getting any payment if I refuse to work and ""see if we are a good fit"" for longer periods of time.

286,"So basically I’m going to try to keep this as short as possible, but it might be hard. I (20F) was involved with someone who lives close to me (20M) our situation has been on and off for the last 2 years, many ups and many downs. Around 2 months ago, we had a major conflict which resulted in us no longer speaking. We had each other blocked on social media and moved on with our lives. Throughout this whole period of us knowing eachother, I confided in my best friend (22M) about what was going on and how I felt about everything. 

Fast forward to now, I had learned a lot from what we went through and I had grown as a person. I realized that throughout our whole time we knew each other we had both been in the wrong many times, it wasn’t completely one sided. I was starting to miss him a little, but I wasn’t about to go approach him or anything just yet. I was open to a reconciliation because I could see my growth and was hoping he had grown in the same way. After not seeing him for a really long time, I had started to notice he would stay around the area of my house and every single time I’d go outside he’d just be standing there, doing nothing. This happened countless times last week, he wouldn’t say anything but he’d just be standing there. It was obvious he was trying to make himself seem or let me know he was there, and I told my friend about this. 

Then two days ago I randomly got a text from the guy I was seeing. He said he was sorry for everything (even though he had already apologized back when everything went on) and I said I forgave him and that I was sorry for how I acted too. He asked me if I wanted to come over and I said yes. We ended up sleeping together, which complicated things further. Afterwards, we started talking and he said he still wasn’t sure if he wants to continue distancing himself from me or if he wants to be a part of my life. He kept apologizing profusely and said over and over he was sorry and that we were just supposed to talk and he wasn’t using me in any way shape or form. I made it clear to him that i’m open to reconciling with him or just being friends, but that I didn’t want to in any way impact his decision or make him feel forced into pursuing anything with me. He said something along the lines of “if I text you, I text you. but if I don’t, I don’t. and I’m sorry” which kind of hurt me due to the fact I was under the impression that if I went over we’d be on good terms again, but I just said okay and went home. 

Then I confided in my male friend about this. I was just saying how I was kind of hurt by this and how I’m confused as to whether or not he’s going to distance himself, because I felt as if he wasn’t going to due to the fact he had been going out of his way to make himself seen just a few days prior. I talked a lot about this with his as he knows our history and knows how I feel about everything that’s went on. Today we were just talking, and he randomly says he decided to msg the guy I was with and see what was going on. This immediately upset me as he didn’t okay it with me first and I felt like it would cause unnecessary drama. This basically resulted in the guy I was with telling my friend he doesn’t want anything to do with me because he knows he’s just going to hurt me. He also
implied that he never really cared about me. This has happened before around a year or so ago, he acts like he doesn’t give a shit about me then I accept it and start moving on and then he starts doing weird shit like wait for me to come outside so I see him and then he goes on a tangent about how he does care he’s just not used to someone like me caring so much about him, just to get back into my life. Basically, the part I’m struggling with is, I don’t know what he wants from me here. He says he wants me out of his life but his actions show the exact opposite, you don’t go out of your way for someone in the way he does when you don’t care about them. I refuse to beg him to stay, but if I start moving on he’ll start popping up again making himself known on purpose and it’s kind of exhausting. I don’t want to play these immature games, I just want him to be straightforward with me. I texted him before I even knew what was said between them as I wanted him to hear what I had to say FROM ME and said that I understand he goes through a lot but I’m still willing to be there for him because I care about as a friend, aside from all the feelings. I told him I want to be honest and straightforward with him but that I want the same in return, and that if he wants nothing to do with me it’s okay. He never responded to my text but decided to text my friend and tell him to fix it. My friend told him “if you really want her to stay away from you you’re going to have to do your part and not make yourself known to her too” and he just said “That’s just something she’s going to have to work with. She’s a strong woman”. then my friend said “if you don’t want her then why are you always conveniently by her house or walking by her or hitting her up” and he said “She’s making me sound like a stalker lol Anyways I agree with what you’re saying” basically ignoring the whole point. 

Basically, I’m as confused as ever. I don’t know what he’s looking to gain here. It’s like usually people say they care, but their actions prove otherwise but this time it’s vice versa. My friend thinks he’s just trying to get me to beg for him back cause he’s an attention seeker and wants to place the blame on me if things go wrong again, but I just don’t know. I’m just upset because HE is the one who approached me, and now he’s saying that I’m the one who has to move on when that’s what I was doing. He says he doesn’t want to be apart of my life, yet he’s going out of his way to make himself apart of my life. I was moving on completely fine but then he starts things up again just to end them and it hurts. I don’t know what to think or feel and it sucks feeling like I’m the delusional one when I’m not even the one who reached out to him to begin with.  I don’t know what to do or how I should feel, or how I should even go about handling this. The part that’s bothering the most is him saying he doesn’t care, because nobody wants to feel as though one of the people you’ve cared about most doesn’t feel any type of way back.",22Oct2019,2
287,"Hi everyone

My grandfather passed away last week and it’s the first major death I have experienced. I flew to see him and got to spend his final days with him. I flew home and he died 2 days later. 

I have decided to not fly back for the funeral- I am a graduate student and my course schedule is very heavy, plus I have two really important, potentially career altering deadlines this week that I can’t miss. Also, I’m still recovering from the travel (getting back to work and unpacking etc) from the last trip. My family was okay when I explained all of this. 

The funeral is tomorrow and my mom was sad that the rosary didn’t have a huge attendance (10 people- but we have a very small family and my grandfather was 83 so most of his friends / our extended family are old or gone) and I’m starting to feel extremely guilty. Was I wrong to skip the funeral? What if the attendance for that is low too?  I feel guilty that the lack of  my presence is felt, but I  at peace (mostly) because I saw him in his last days and helped be there for my mom and grandma at that time. I also believe that funerals are for the living and my grandfather wouldn’t be the type to be offended if I wasn’t there for him. I process(ed) in my own way. 

I just feel guilt and I’m not sure if I should feel this way. My mom misses me but she understands why I didn’t go.",22Oct2019,1

289,"Hi Reddit!,

I’ve been reading this thread and decided that i should post one.

For context i just moved to a different country, i’ve been described as unique, weird, introverted and different by my friends (that’s frankly true), i don’t have a lot of friend but the ones i have are loyal and we have each others back. So i just started college where i did not meet anyone from the same nationality  as me so i just pretty much stayed quiet, it’s not that i‘m very introverted, it’s just my brain have a pretty hard time adjusting to new social situation or it’s just anxiety but if a person starts talking to me i become pretty social until somehow i screwed up or do something awkward to ruin it, so basically if i wanted to make new friends i would piggy back on the ones i know and start from there, that’s how i know the friend i have by either being approached or getting introduced.   


Anyways, i finally met someone who came from the same country as me but since they already had their own social group it was hard for me to just wiggle myself in and i do come as pretty awkward or weird at first so i was never asked to come hang out even though i tried my best since i know it’s me because when other students from the same country they had no problem asking them. So the only thing keeping me floating is they video calls or chats with me and my friends back home and i feel like crap lying to them that i’m ok and pretending i’m doing fine, so any advice?.",22Oct2019,1

Not an exaggeration filth everywhere, bed in living room, even though they have 3 empty bedrooms, the children sleep on an air mattress, two dogs and one cat jumping around, dishes haven’t been washed to the point where mold covers them all and you get the gist.

292,"So, this is a throwaway but here goes.

The other weekend I was at a party with some friends at school. I was in the corner writing an essay while my friends drank and made merry as I had a 10 page research paper due on Monday. Not 20 minutes into being there, this girl who is a friend of mine but I’ve never spent significant time with comes up to me obviously drunk, closes my laptop, and begins kissing me. I think “we’ll that’s unexpected”, however I know she’s very drunk and I tell her I cannot have sex with her because of that. It takes some serious convincing but eventually she agrees. 
In the week afterwards, we go on a mini vacation and I don’t see her. I do hear from her friends that she thinks I’m “incredibly hot” and wants to keep this going. 
Here’s the thing

I’m not into sex. I don’t know how to tell this to girls without sort of scaring them off as potential partners. You might ask me “are you asexual/are you gay” etc and the answer is no. I like everything about relationships, especially physical ones, however the second that the train goes into the tunnel so to speak I lose interest. 
I have talked with my asexual friend about it and she gives good advice, but never having had sex herself she doesn’t understand the pressure that can be put on you to perform. I don’t know how to express this reality to this girl in a way that wouldn’t either torpedo the budding relationship or be incredibly assuming of me.

299,"ive been feeling really off lately, more so than usual

i guess u could call it dissociation, but idrk, just the constant feeling of thinking ur in a movie or ur not real and ur not urself and a lot of people seemed to relate so i kinda excused it but

i also go on spirals? i guess? idk how to explain it but it feels so weird and nauseating and scary and it mostly only happened when i really started questioning things and i could stop it by distracting myself but for the past few days its kinda become the norm and its kinda scary i really really dont like it but i cant stop it

along with that my entire view on the world seems to change once in a while and it makes sense bc im always growing and maturing but is it suppsoed to feel like im an entirely different person than who i was last week even though absolutely nothing changed?

 i feel weird talking to anyone at all except for maybe my parents, but sometimes with them too, and especially if im out in public. i know weird is a very vague term but i have no idea how to describe it im just not myself and they arent real existing people to me

point is idk what to do idont like this i dont know why its worse all the sudden ive cried multiple times today bc i just didnt know what to do or how to make it stop and if this all isnt a simulation then i am just insane

300,"I had a stupid falling out with a very good friend about 5 years ago.  I found out through her sister that she has stage 4 breast cancer.  It’s now in her lymph nodes.  Chemo had to stop bc her white blood count was dropping. She’s getting surgery next week and then 35 rounds of radiation.  

I live in Hawaii and she lives in Texas.  I have a 3 month old that I breast feed.  My husband said it’s up to me if I want to go and he can take care of the kids.  But the only window I have is from Saturday and come back by Monday.  So basically 24 hours in Texas with her.  She thinks I’m crazy to do that but I want to spend time with her before she’s basically bedridden.  

I’ve gone through this with my mom but my friends cancer seems at a worse stage.  Should I book a flight and just see her for the 24 hrs or hope for the best and wait til she’s hopefully better to go? 

Issues are scared my baby won’t take the bottle, such a short amount of time, and I know it shouldn’t matter but the expense will hit us a little hard.",22Oct2019,5
301,"So they me preface this by saying that I have 2 kids, they’re both very young. They are the light of my life I love them very much and most of this is probably me being scared that I’m not going to be able to provide for them and support them 110% because they deserve absolutely NOTHING less than the best from me and their father. 

I thought I wanted to be a mom with a nursing degree and a man in the army, (like my mom except she’s a teacher and my dad got out a long time ago) 

Recently I’ve started to feel like an “imposter” in my relationship with my kids’ father, I don’t even want to call him my boyfriend or significant other anymore because now I feel like we’re just roommates more than anything. I used to think I wanted to marry him but now I almost vomit in my mouth when I think about marriage. 

I actually think I might be a lesbian, bisexual at the very very least. I don’t know if it’s because I had to go through hell with my first delivery (my son and I could have died), or the fact that my second pregnancy rendered me absolutely useless due to the hormones exacerbating my anxiety (I developed agoraphobia) but anytime I think about our sex life, it makes me sad because I’m not getting the satisfaction that I need out of it. (And I hate to say this but I really think it’s because of the size, but at the same time I’ve only ever been with one dude and so I’m not sure what I’m comparing it to) and I fantasize more about women than men. 

I also want to vomit when I hear people talk about Jesus. I grew up Christian but I am so utterly disgusted with the Christian faith and how they treat people who don’t think like them. Not just the LGBT community. I’m talking about EVERYONE. 

My parents pulled my college funding when I decided I didn’t want to live in the dorms anymore, they know I couldn’t afford to go to school on my own so they basically just dumped me on my boyfriends family and I just had to live with them for a while, when I had my first son, we eventually were able to move out and live on our own.

I was in the maternity room holding my second kid some time later and instead of thinking about how beautiful they were, I was thinking about how I should go find a recruiter because I still have a lot of youth left and if I join now I could make my ten years by 31 and I could have help going to school and supporting my children on my own without the help of their father (who’s in the army but he’s reserve) 

So I call this a life crisis because:

A. I’m pretty sure I want out of this relationship 
B. I’m not even sure I’m straight, like 95% sure I’m not.  
C. I don’t regret having kids. But I do regret and resent not having a degree first and not being able to afford a degree without having to pull massive loans out. And I’m really pissed I even let my parents help out in the first place, kids if you’re reading this, keep your parents financial involvement in your college to a minimum, remember if they can give it at will, they can take it away at will too.
D. I originally wanted to be a nurse, now I can’t see myself doing it, not sure what I want to do now, other than be in the military and I’m hesitant about that too because of the basic training, AIT, and possible deployments 
E. I feel like if I tell my family (or family “in law”) any of this they’re going to kick me to the curb

What do I do? I don’t want to be in retirement age and look back and regret NOT doing the things I wanted to do and see how I wasn’t true to myself. 

Note: I work on campus at a university I WISH I could go to. I WISH I could afford to go there. Everyone there is complaining about having to study for midterms and I just want to punch them all in the face, I would KILL to just go home and study and go to class and not have to worry about bills and insurance and things like that.

307,"Earlier this year after a fight with my mom (she called the cops on me twice), I left home for the first time. I moved in with my aunt and her family, 2 hours away. 

Currently I am on SSI. I don't think I have enough money to live alone in my state. 

* My aunt, uncle and I smoke weed. They insist on rolling blunts (big cigars) each time we smoke and as a result they will usually spend $60 a day (until the money runs out) plus gas getting to and from the dispensary

* My aunt is the only one who cleans up after herself, aside from me. Her older son is disabled, his sister doesn't clean at all due to her various excuses, and my Uncle just flat out doesn't care.

* The house is infested with roaches. It drives my aunt nuts, Uncle doesn't care because he is used to it, and only seems to care when my aunt is upset. My younger cousin (mentioned above) complains about it endlessly but leaves trash everywhere, cooks elaborate meals and doesn't clean up or even rinse out her cups/bowls.

* Half the time when I wake up, it's because my aunt and uncle are arguing about their baby, her car, or her suspecting him cheating. Their arguments are rarely violent, highly one-sided and explosive. 

* We owe thousands to the electric company and have recently had our power shut off because they left the air conditioner running all summer. Now we are scrambling to figure something out.

* My aunt constantly leaving decisions up to my Uncle, who is practically incapable of making a decision by himself. The outcome of his decisions rarely bother me - it's his lack of one. It's irritating when we leave it up to you and you take 60 seconds before mumbling an incoherent sentence. This would be fine if my life wasn't directly affected.

On top of that there is everyone's attitudes. 

For the last two months, I have paid my way. Prior to that, I worked around the house in exchange for everything. Leaving my mom's house was a wake up call for me, so I worked my ass off. I have been living here for 7 months and I have not complained once about anything. All anyone else does is complain.

I have been here for 7 months and I want to go home but I am afraid I will regret leaving. I am afraid my aunt and mom will never speak to each other again on account of me. I am afraid that my aunt will lose the last shred of her sanity. It's already tough for her and I am afraid that if I leave, it will be the final straw. 

I can't talk to my aunt about this either, because she is very sensitive. She is known for her explosive outbursts. For example, I was helping carry groceries into the house once. As I tried to walk down the stairs, my younger cousin stopped in front of me, abruptly to fix her pants or something. I was carrying water and lost my footing slightly, so I stumbled on the landing. I was fine. My Uncle mentioned that I had fallen due to my cousin. My aunt's response was to throw a case of water down the stairs, rip my uncle's shirt off, scream at my cousin to stay out of everyone's way and then scream about how it was our fault because we apparently take the stairs too fast or something. All of that, and all anyone said was ""He tripped cause (cousin) stopped at the top of the stairs."" 

I feel like I have to walk around on eggshells in this house and I don't even know how to say it to them.

I have nowhere to go but back home and I am not even sure it is an option. 

What should I do?",22Oct2019,2
308,"last night around 8:00pm I received a text from an unknown 818 phone number that just said ""guess who"". This has never once happened to me. i also dont know a single f***ing person whos from LA or lives in LA or might even have an LA number. Thinking that this might be an old friend or someone I've lost contact with, I replied ""A butthead"", because I have a dumb sense of humor. The unknown number replied ""more specific?"", to which I replied ""nope"", again mostly because Im trying to imply that whoever this is, you are no more than a butthead and thats all you are. I am funny. 

In reality, I was very intrigued as to who was contacting me and was not only looking forward to the reveal of who it was, but i was more-so looking forward to some kind of cat-and-mouse style game of trying to find out who it was without them actually telling me. like 20 questions or something. I figured we could have engaged in some witty banter and I could slowly flesh out who it was after a few wild guesses and failed attempts. imagine my disappointment when the unknown texter simply replied ""oh well..."" and nothing more.  

so now a day later, I'm conflicted on what to do now. 30% of me thinks this is just a scam or a bot, 30% of me thinks this could be a long lost friend who i offended and now has thought better of reconnecting, 30% of me thinks this could be some cute girl I had previously gave my number to and now i ruined that, while the last 10% simply thinks it was prolly a prank or a wrong number. 

to top it off, I'm a little too prideful to go crawling back with a ""hey i actually do wanna guess who"" text. I was minding my own bidness, you reached out to me, mf! if you're not willing to play the game, don't expect me to reply back

313,"I sincerely think all of this context is needed for you to fully understand the story.

My brother-in-law is in the military and got orders to move very far away and very soon at this point. He married my wife's sister. We have 2 kids. They have a daughter, the niece mentioned in the title. He seems to be a very controlling person. They both are...I think. We can't tell who's the controlling one or even what the heart of the problem really is. There is a ton of passive aggressiveness and really questionable behavior.

A year and a half ago, when they were pregnant, we lived in the same apartment complex as them. Right next to them in fact. I thought it would be cool for my wife and her sister to live so close. And I thought it would be cool to get to know my brother-in-law. They were the ones that told us about the vacant apartment next to theirs, so we thought we were super welcome. We made some attempts to get together a bunch since we lived down the hallway, but nothing ever worked, he never wanted to hang out. My wife and her sister might hang out during the day but when brother-in-law was home, she was unavailable. Or even sometimes earlier in the day my wife would try to hang out but her sister would say she can't because she had to get dinner ready for her husband. And this would be like hours before he was home. Weird excuses like that. Anytime we went over to visit. he would just sit on his phone or play video games and pretty much ignore us. I try and talk but he doesn't seem to like me or my wife, or he's just really awkward. It's fine, we aren't entitled to any amount of attention. It was just very odd and unwelcoming around him at times. He has moments where he's pretty friendly, though.

But it got more weird when the baby was born. My wife was so excited for her sister to have her baby and for them to be mom's together, but we weren't really welcome to go over next door and visit them when the baby was born. They came over one day, and my wife asked if she could hold the baby, and her sister looked at the brother-in-law and he said ""I guess"". When this sort of thing was brought up, they said that it was because their daughter was born with some breathing issues and was in NICU for a little while. That makes it pretty understandable that they would be overprotective, I get it. But here's some other weird things. I was told not to tell any of the neighbors in the building how the baby was doing when they were at the hospital. We weren't allowed to update cousins when she was in labor with the baby, and got in trouble for doing so. The girls' mom was not allowed to hold her granddaughter for awhile after she was home. but the brother-in-laws' parent's were super welcome hold her or even babysit. Nobody was allowed to post anything on Facebook about the new baby. There's a lot of passive aggresiveness here too. Sister-in-law does all of the talking and explaining, but she points everything back to brother-in-law as the one who makes all of the calls. Then, when he's challenged, she gets super loudly offended and he never speaks. They moved out of the building and in with his parents shortly after the baby was born.

They are the parents, and nobody else is entitled to have any interaction with their kid. I get that. But there's a point where that would obviously become hurtful to other people. Like especially my wife and her mom, the baby's grandma. And for a year and a half now I've seen the relationships there become really strained because of all of the weird restrictions. But for a couple of months, brother-in-law was gone at basic training and tech school and things were getting a lot better relationally for my sister-in-law, wife, and their mom.

But then he got back a couple weeks ago, and I wouldn't say everything became dramatically different but it's like some of the restrictions and the control came back with him, even though he still never really seems to talk and it's sister-in-law who does all of the restricting. He got his orders and they are moving very far away, and there's been a couple family get-togethers to see them before they go. But it's like it was before - impossible for my wife to see her sister, and for grandma to have the relationship she wants with her daughter and her granddaughter. My wife will try to plan something and the answer will usually be something like ""We can't because (brother-in-law) has this going on..."" or what's been super annoying is we'll plan something and they will change plans at the last minute because they made their own plans. Grandma has been trying to get the whole family together to take pictures before they leave and they seem to keep doing what they can to miss that, or to make it very difficult. So, this past weekend, we all planned together to go to the pumpkin patch on Sunday. All the family would be there so that mother-in-law could get her pictures of us and especially the grandkids. It was happening.

Then on Sunday morning my wife gets this text from her sister that they aren't gonna make it because they're going to a movie instead. They argued, and so we met up with them as they were dropping their daughter off with grandma before their movie to talk about it. We argued that they can go to a movie another time, because literally the rest of the family was planning on the pumpkin patch. They said they already bought tickets and were going. I asked them to leave a car seat, so that we could at least take all of the kids to the pumpkin patch so that grandma could get her pictures of them. Sister-in-law looked at her husband and asked if they could do that, he didn't look at any of us and just said ""I want to take her tomorrow"" and I watched them walk out the door, completely just expecting the whole family to change their plans because they said so.

I immediately said ""we're going to the pumpkin patch"" when they were out the door. My wife said ""how?"" because they didn't leave a car seat, I said we'd make 2 trips with our car seats. Mother-in-law said that we shouldn't because they said not to, I said ""no they didn't!"" then mother-in-law said that they will be super pissed and I said that I would love to fight about this with them. I wanted to make them mad and I wanted to fight and yell at each other about it because it is such a stupid thing to fight about at all, they were the ones making this a ridiculous situation. Taking the family to have fun at the pumpkin patch shouldn't be an act of rebellion but they made it that way by being so ridiculously controlling and weird in the first place, and by being incredibly selfish and going to do their own thing and just expecting the rest of the family to just deal with it. So, yeah! We went to the pumpkin patch! My wife dropped me and my son off first, and then went back and picked up grandma and granddaughter. Father-in-law heard it was cancelled so he made other plans and ended up not making it. But we took some amazing pictures of all of the kids and their daughter had a great time! Mother-in-law said that we gave her an amazing gift by doing this.

So here's the aftermath. We did text them while they were at the movie that we all went to the pumpkin patch, because we weren't going to be deceitful about it, I felt like that would be wrong. Their phones were off so they didn't know until after the movie. Sister-in-law called her mom immediately after the movie to chew her out. We were back at the house before they got back. I was ready to fight about it with my brother-in-law. I'm tired of everyone just ignoring the weirdness and I want it all out there. I want to confront the stuff that I think is unhealthy and I'm praying for the right words to say. They get to the house, they walk in quietly and sit down in the living room. Sister-in-law calmly asks how we drove to the pumpkin patch without enough car seats, my wife tells her about the brilliant two trip idea. Then it starts escalating, but it's only sister-in-law speaking and escalating. He's just sitting there. I laid it out there, I said it was my idea and I just wanted their mom to have her time with her granddaughter. I pulled the trigger, and it's ridiculous that this would even be a big deal. The issue of being overly controlling was brought up. I was trying to get him to speak up, because I have this assumption (based on evidence, I think) that he's super controlling and selfish. But only my sister-in-law is yelling. Then her mom is yelling at her. Lots of arguing. Their main argument is that they wanted to take their daughter to the pumpkin patch and have that experience with her. They grab their daughter and leave. On the way out, he says ""I just wanted to go tomorrow"". That's all he said the whole fight. I wanted him and I to talk, that didn't happen. The rest of the evening, my wife's mom is in and out of crying. And as I write this on the next day, they are all still fighting and probably won't see each other before they head out of town. Was I wrong to take our niece to have fun with my kids and their grandma in spite of them?",22Oct2019,4
314,"So i’m (20F) a third year student at a university in my state. i’m an astrophysics major and have dealt with a lot of mansplainers and creepy men from the stem community. but i have never been so annoyed with anyone as i have with this one person. 

This has been going on for two years.

there’s this person (20, nonbinary, originally identified as F) in my little physics major group and they are the biggest bitch to me. I cannot for the life of me figure out why they hate me so much. I am a fairly pretty girl and i’m very outgoing compared to the rest of them. I like to laugh and share memes and the typical shit like that. the entire group likes having me around except them. and whenever i have ANYTHING to say at all and they are there, they always say some snarky fucking remark to me. and in the group message they either ignore me or again, be snarky towards me. every time they say something to me, i always snap back because i just do not have the patience for those kinds of people and it almost always shuts them up. they also love to fucking exclude me from everything.

and the people in that group never have my back except for one girl a couple of times. i’ve expressed the way i feel about them to some of the people and they’ve told me to just ignore it.
 
this  person is also a complete control freak. they made the groupme we are all in so they are in charge of everything in that sense but they love to be in charge of the entire physics group itself.  which is fucking weird because they dropped their physics major. but whatever if other people want to succumb to their bullshit, fine. but i am not the type of person to listen to others, unless they’re my work boss, family, or professors. so every time they try to impose some bullshit thing on me i always snap back and tell them to mind their damn business and i’ve told them to their face that they do not get to tell me what to do. 

for an example, i was dating a guy in the group for awhile, we broke up. he wanted me to be happy and find a new person. so i did eventually and i talked about it in the groupchat and my ex even liked the messages. everyone was happy for me. except that fucking bitch. they came up to me in person and told me not to talk about my new boyfriend in the groupchat because of my ex. i was dumbfounded that they would say something like that to me but after i collected myself i told them that they need to mind their own business, to not tell me what i can and cannot talk about, and that on top of that my ex was happy for me.

sorry for the rant, but basically can anyone give me advice on how to deal with this person??? i havent dealt with a bully since high school. it’s almost like they’re bitchy towards me because im a person with a very dominant and fiery personality. like they dont want anyone else to be on their level. and on top of that they try to make me feel stupid all the time and i cant help but feel it’s some kind of elle woods syndrome lmao. like this person seems to hate confident  women who have a personality other than their major.

TLDR: person in my colleague group is a complete and utter bitch to me, help pls",22Oct2019,3

321,"I work for an IT firm and texted the client (not the actual client but she manages a store and submitted the ticket) on-site that I was working with if we can grab coffee to continue our conversation. She actually gave me her direct number on a store business card incase I needed to contact her.

I basically confirmed that her new ticket request is being worked on. Then asked if I can bring up something off topic, she said yes. Mind you I asked because while I was working, we were talking about what I did for school, what she did and so forth but got into the topic of money because she has in MBA in Finance. I wanted to network and get some tips since I suck donkey balls with my finances and she had some excellent pointers. I legitimately needed help in this area because of my spending habits. But we got cut off with customers walking in to the store.

Conversation went something like this.

Me: Hey ClientB, just as an update we're looking into the printer issue sorted out for you. 

Me: I gotta ask you something.. A little off topic if that's okay? 

Her:  I appreciate it! Sure, of course.

Me: Anytime! Would you like to grab coffee sometime and continue our conversation? If not I completely understand. 

Me: I'm strictly being professional here, nothing else.

323,"Not sure where to start, so I'll start with me. 

A couple of years ago I invested my savings into a real estate deal with a ""friend"" to fix up a place and flip it for profit. After literally doing all the work fixing the place up with bathroom remodels, plumbing, painting and whatever else the place needed. It was sold and I get my check for a pittance of what I invested. Coupled with ten years of hard work trying to become very good at a trade, that I chose over going to college to get a degree, and never making enough to really get by, I had a mental break. I broke down. I quit my job, put all my stuff in storage, then moved back in with my parents. 

After moving in with my parents I used what little I had left and fixed up their house because it had been seriously neglected for almost 20 years without much maintenance other than what was absolutely needed. For three months I did nothing but work on their house, vehicles, whatever was needed so that I didn't slip any further into the blackness of life. Then I got a job at a local place for paying my mother rent and still helping out around the house. That was three years ago this December. 

20 years ago my parents decided to buy a business that my father would run while my mother worked at her career. They went into a large amount of debt. The first year my parents owned the business, natural disaster decided to rear its ugly head and basically made the business that my parents just bought fall flat on its face. When your in the recreation business and everything around you is shut down due to forest fires, no one is doing much.  There were huge losses the first year and never really recovered after that. 

My father was a bad businessman and couldn't come back from it, but he would not let it go. He's been riding the spiral down ever since. Sold off everything of value, except for the little he has left now. Still has the business, but even referring to it as that is a joke. You would have to have customers to have a business. It's basically just a hideout for him and his friends at this point.  Had to sell off the building that the store was in because he couldn't afford the payments and now resides in a rental space. It doesn't cost much, but he plans on closing it down for good this winter. 

My mother has been basically busting her ass all my life to bring my brother and I up proper and take care of everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, that we needed. We grew up poor, I didn't really realize it until I went off to try and make a life for myself, but I never felt poor because of my mom. Whatever we needed, she somehow found a way to make it happen. Birthdays, Christmas, sports, school, and everything else. She always worked hard and got very little reprieve except for a vacation that we would take as a family during the summer. For this week she would really be happy. 

After I went off to make my own life, I was the youngest, my mom decided to pursue her education as well. She got a couple of degrees, while working full time, and moved into a career that she loved. She was in Dietary Management and became the head of it for a hospital and nursing home. Then the hospital was sold and her job was taken out from under her and given to the director's sister who was fresh out of culinary school. After almost 20 years of working her ass off, she lost the job she loved. She broke down, had serious depression for few years, but made it back. She now works for the state. Doesn't make much, but enough to get by. Doesn't have much for retirement and if something isn't done, will be working until she dies just to get out of debt. 

My father has never really helped much to the betterment of our life or situation. Don't get me wrong, he did help, but the minimum he could do is what we got. It seems most of the time, he would rather help his friends with whatever they needed help with, rather than help around home. I know he loves my mother, but when it comes to things around the house, he just doesn't do anything.  He spends his time between his ""business"" and coming home to sit in his chair, smoke his cigarettes, and stare at screens. He started collecting his Social Security a couple of years ago, very low because after 20 years of not paying into it he doesn't get much, and uses that for himself. Has no retirement. Even bringing up finances make him angry. Can't count on him for anything at this point. 

I have no problems helping my parents out, but we live in a small town where there is no opportunity. I work in a job that I hate and really want to leave. If I want to make something of myself before I die, I need to get out and do something about it. I feel wrong leaving my mother to take care of everything, but I'm losing my will to live by staying where I'm at. I really don't know where to go from here. I have a constant war of wanting to leave and pursue something, but at the same time not wanting to go so that my mother doesn't have any more stress added on to her. I turn 40 next year and I'm starting to completely freak out. I can't really go back to my former career due to physical demands of it. It almost ground me into the grave before and I don't know if I could even do it at this point. I have no idea what to do with myself anymore.  Where do I go from here? Do I pursue an education again?",22Oct2019,1
324,"For the past 8 years, I've been driving a 1996 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme. It's my first car. I paid for it myself, at 16, with money from my first job. It's been a part of my life for such a long time, and I really, really don't want to let it go. But a few weeks ago, the power steering broke. My mechanic tells me he can fix the steering, but it wouldn't be worth doing, because the car's condition is such that it'll have other serious problems soon.


This might sound silly, but I'm actually feeling grief over this. It feels like losing a close friend. I want to save the car, but I don't know how. I don't know anything about cars, so I can't fix it myself. The mechanic said that getting it into full working order would cost over ten thousand dollars, and I can't really afford that. My parents have told me that they could help me out with it if I *really, really, absolutely must* save the car, but it's pretty obvious that they don't want to do that and think it would be stupid, so I can't ask them to do that. I think I might have a rare collector's item around the house that I could sell, and combined with some of my savings, that might cover it, but that's a really long shot.


So, I'd like to know if I have other options. If anyone knows anything about saving old cars, I'd appreciate the information. I just don't know what to do here. From what I remember, the mechanic said the car's underbody is rusted, and I think he also said there were problems with the exhaust and the hydraulics.

My manager seems unlikely to help me develop any particular skills and the though of ‘still being there’ in even five years is depressing. 

I also work as a restaurant manager each evening and on weekends. I’m not passionate about hospitality but I find this job much less stressful and it can even be enjoyable.

I would greet her and not even get acknowledged at all. I’m well aware that she revealed everything to the rest of our group and has talked behind my back numerous times. She tends to have a bad temper and it feels like every conversation I have with her she talks down to me or low key makes fun of me like I’m stupid.

337,"On mobile, English not my first language. TLDR at the bottom.

Insight:
My country is on a state of emergency. People has been discontent over the years of how the past and previous government have handle public welfare and resources. The people got enough of it and started a revolution. At the sight of riots, protest and caos the government decided to send the military for public welfare but my country military has very bad reputation because of the past dictatorship. There is also been a curfew for the past few days. This started around Friday 19 until now.

My problem:
There has been a massive amount of videos of violence at both sides. People burning subway stations and supermarkets (is why the military went off) and also police and military brutality to the people. I have friends and family that have been sharing constant amount of video and information, many of them are brutal. Some of them have different opinions but for over all they all want the same for my country, democracy, peace and respect to the people. I have terrible anxiety (I have therapy weekly) and after a few days I had to delete my social media because it was getting to me. So much information, so many stories and they are all different. In conclusion I don’t know what to believe. People are asking for the resignation of the president (in which my opinion wont change anything since he is just part of the whole bunch of people from both sides that decided how to manage the country and what gets approved etc etc). 
I am afraid for my family, my friends and what is happening on my country. I don’t know how to handle all this information and caos since I’m not there to see, act or be part of to actually form a real opinion and stand. I don’t know who or what to believe, some videos are from other or past issues and other are from recent events. Some people say different informations and is hard to tell what is going on.

What can I do? I close my social media for mental issues but I still get family messages and videos through WhatsApp or other ways. I don’t want to go NC since is the only way I can know if everyone has arrive safety to their homes.

340,"A situation from my past has been haunting me lately and I could really use some perspective. I definitely did something bad, but I'm not sure whether it was assault.

Over a decade ago, when I was 15 and in high school, I went to a party with some friends. Alcohol and drugs were involved. At some point during the night, I hooked up with my friend's girlfriend, who was 17 or 18 at the time. She was lying on a bed (awake) and I laid down next to her and we started making out. She put her hand down my pants and I did the same to her. After a few moments of this I remember she muttered her boyfriend's name, which made me realize she was very drunk. I stopped what we were doing, and she then asked me if I liked her. I gave a stupid non-answer and she became upset and left the bed.

The next day I felt horrible for betraying my friend's trust, but didn't think much beyond that since everything with her had seemed consensual and I'd stopped as soon as I'd realized she might not have been fully aware. But, she ended up telling her boyfriend that I'd taken advantage of her. I didn't have any contact with her after that. 

At the time, this made me feel even more terrible and caused a lot of problems at school. Now, almost 15 years later, I'm finding myself in a spiral of thinking about it and feeling very guilty and confused. I have been (unambiguously) sexually assaulted myself, and am just now starting to deal with that in therapy. I know how painful and traumatizing it can be to be touched without your consent. The thought that I might have done the same to someone else makes me feel awful. But, I really didn't think anything was nonconsensual at the time (just a stupid drunken hormonal mess up). At one point I even thought it might have been me being violated. since she escalated to genital contact and because I was so young and also drunk. Now I'm just questioning everything.

Which is true but I told her I don't like knowing that mutual friends can see it but I can't. It kind of makes me feel least of a friend. So I ask if she had free time we could meet up in person and talk about it but she refused to. So we haven't seen each in a month and see just leaves me on read.

So my question is I'm I at fault? Or does she have right to be mad at me? What should I do?

342,"I usually don’t go searching for help because I tend to think of myself as a fairly independent person, yet I don’t know how to keep going. No matter how many therapists I see, doctors I go to, courtrooms I sit in,or worried adults talk to me I never seem to stop spiraling. I don’t talk to my family or any of my friends about my mental state. I guess from a logical stand point early childhood trauma has left me with an  evil pessimistic person buried inside of me. If you ask my friends who I am, they would say I am the most determined successful person they know. On that note, I have never told my friends a single true thing about myself. They do not know who I am, i just keep playing this character even when I don’t want to. I just got into running start; a pre college program I qualified for this quarter. Even though I have worked hard to get to be in this program. I can’t help but repeatedly self sabotage my success. I find it harder and harder to talk about how I feel and know who I actually am. Gradually, I have begun to feel sick and trapped inside my head. I find it hard to touch base with what is reality and what isn’t. Instead of trying to fix my never ending problems and destructive thoughts I push everything and anything away. I’m shutting down more and more. I know I should feel  lucky to have a mom who cares about me enough to always tell me she’s worried about me. Yet, I can’t help my urge to want to rip her throat out. I hate talking to her about anything. As for my dad I have completely  disowned him from my mind as a father. I can’t stand the thought of communicating with him or treating him as an actual human being. When my sister talks I just have bursts of outrage even if she said nothing wrong. I do things to hurt my mom and I know I should feel guilty but I just don’t. I don’t know if I actually have something wrong with me or the fact that I’m self aware completely debunks that theory. How do I make myself less angry? How do I give myself motivation to keep trying in school and not give in to so many urges that I can’t help but act on? I need answers. I need help.

346,"So I used to fight a lot with both my mother and my brother.It got to the point where I almost got into a fist fight with my own brother. My brother said he was fed up with how angry I would get towards him and my mother. He would constantly ask me what my problem was. I couldn't tell him or our mother but for a long time I couldn't wait to get away from both of them, as they were controlling and overbearing.

My brother has his moments where he can't mind his own business like our mother. The difference is that he is slightly less overbearing and nowhere near as controlling as my mom. He suggested that I get therapy. I actually agreed with him on this as I was working out a lot of issues on my own, and I wanted to fix these problems so I agreed to his suggestion.

My mom was guilt tripping me though saying I don't need it and that I have a family that loves me and calling it a waste of time. I was angry because I feel like my mom was both assuming she knew more than professionals and stopping me from bettering herself to shield her own self esteem. I've had problems with my mom before, and some were much bigger than that, but I feel as if she tried to stop me from getting health to protect her own feelings and the fact that she would do that gets to me.",22Oct2019,1

349,"I think I have a fairly open and honest relationship with my 10yo son. He has an iPad and access to the internet but he doesn’t use any social media and is very open with me about how he uses the internet. We often have casual discussions about what he does on the iPad and he will use it while I am in the room, is not secretive about it etc and we have had discussions re internet safety. I trust my son to make smart moves to keep himself safe online. So far so good... 

This weekend we went to see my 10 yo nephew, whose mum is less strict about his internet usage, It was just me and the kids as she was out. I find him quite secretive and in the past he has made large purchases on his xbox using his mum’s credit details without her permission. He streams his game footage and has streaming app accounts. I am not sure if he is using social media as yet but I don’t think so.

I overheard the kids discussing YouTube; I am happy for my son to use YouTube and he generally just watches the same content most kids his age access. However, I over heard my nephew asking my son to not tell me about his YouTube Chanel... After we had left I asked my son about it and he was obviously not keen to betray his cousins trust; I explained about how I just wanted to keep my nephew safe and make sure he was only uploading things that would not give away his identity or location and make sure that he wasn’t giving out that information in the comments either. At this point my son confessed that he had been a little uncomfortable when him and his cousin were discussing YouTube and that they had been making a video to upload (it was mostly streaming some game they had been playing with a few vocals. My son says that he thinks his cousin used his first name). 

My son gave me the username and requested that I didn’t tell his cousin that he had told me. I have scanned the profile and watched all the videos and I can’t find anything bad (the video containing my sons name has not yet been uploaded - and even if it is, I’m not sure if I am worried about it, providing it’s just his first name and no location has been given?) however I am still uncomfortable about it because of their young age. 

I don’t want to do anything to jeopardize the trusting relationship I have with my own son (as he did ask me not to tell my sister) but on the other hand, I do want to keep them both safe. I’m leaning towards monitoring the account myself to make sure it’s all above board and if it starts to go too far, explain to my son that I need to tell because his cousin is not safe? Is there anything else I should be doing? Watching for? Parenting a preteen is obviously not easy and I’m still VERY new to this... so I’m turning to the wiser world of reddit for help!

352,"Long story short; I am 17 years old and just bought my car in full by myself about a year ago. So far just some minor repairs and regular oil changes that I’ve figured out for myself. 

My current situation is a misfire in cylinder 1, I took it to my friend’s mechanic shop and they gave me honest advice to sell it. I’ve tried this and the reason no one will buy it is because I have no registration for it.

Here’s the catch 22; I can’t get registration because I need to pass an emissions test, but I can’t pass the emissions test with a check engine light, and I can’t get rid of the light without fixing the car, but the cost of fixing the car is more than what it’s worth (2006 Audi A4). 

I’ve tried clearing the codes and selling it to different buyers, I’ve tried trading it in but they only offered me 1,000 dollars which is way too low. (I paid 5,000).

353,"This is going to be sort of a long one, and I don’t really expect anyone to read this, it just feels nice to have some sort of repository for my thoughts 

I recently moved to a college very far away from home, and am in about the 9th week of the first semester. I’ve been having a lot of trouble making any real friends (Who actually would like to hang out outside of like class or projects) and am not sure where this came from. I was pretty fairly popular in high school and felt pretty confident in my social skills, I could make friends with most people pretty quickly. I’ve never had a relationship before, but i could always pick up friends pretty quickly, but now I don’t really seem to be able to do that any longer. I feel like I lost something in me when i moved here, like I’m not a wholly functional person anymore.  


I really don’t want to waste my “golden years” watching anime in my room and making small talk at parties no one really wants me at.  I have four other roommates and while most of them are alright, having the threat of another failed social interaction with people I don’t even really like outside my door at all times makes me feel incredibly isolated and insignificant. I’m in one club with some pretty cool people but we only meet once a week and they’re mostly juniors and seniors, and all seem to have much more important things to do then hang out with me elsewhere. 

I do have two friends in my life right now, one is my best friend who is as close to me as a brother, but he went to a college incredibly far away from me, and is having the exact opposite college experience then me. We talk regularly, but I have begun to get scared that we are getting less and less close, and that by relying on him as a source of friendship rather then making new friends, I’m becoming stuck in the past. My other best friend goes to another college in the same city as me, and has tried to get me involved in her friend group, but I end up feeling awkward and alienated every time i accept an invitation because of the severe differences between her friends and I. She has saint-like patience with me, but I always feel like I’m an intense burden on her, like she sends these invitations out of pity and obligation

I don’t think that getting a girlfriend would solve all of my problems, I just really want to have someone that would make me feel alone, but i have no clue how to start. I can keep up a conversation fairly well, but I always feel like i would come off as a creep if i talked to a girl in my class out of the blue, so i always end up keeping my distance. I think I know what to say to a girl, I just have no clue what the setting where it is appropriate to talk to her is.

355,"My life hasn't been very good. On my family side of things, there's consistent fighting going on between my grandparents/parents/auntie/uncles, I'm dealing with caring for my grandma who has schizophrenia and Parkinson's, and my mom constantly bugs me about my work and school and it gets overbearing. I've had several traumatic events with my grandma in particular getting violent due to her religious hallucinations.

With school, I never really had many friends. People would come and go, and for the ones that seemed to stick, I would never commit or go all the way. I had terrible social anxiety, and would make whatever excuse to weasel out of events like birthdays and get togethers. Inviting people over wasn't an option because our house is tiny and my familial problems made it hard to justify inviting people. High school was pretty bad. I never joined clubs, participated in anything extracurricular, or went to any events. Most of the time, I'd get through classes, go home, play video games and repeat. 

That was my only form of peace, video games. Along with music, too. I'd go over the same media over and over again until I get sick. I didn't have many hobbies because of the lack of money and it was too much effort. It was easier to go through the motions and let the games and songs consume me and make me desensitized. 

Fast forward to today, and I'm feeling slightly better. Depression/anxiety have been kept in line due to medication and I've been off it for a while. A big problem though, is that I still feel socially inept. I don't watch the shows that people watch, listen to popular music, play any thing that most people play.

She said she never wants her sister B (under 10) to have to go through that. A has put off moving out of her toxic family home for B's sake.

I'm really struggling morally. I know many people would say it's none of my business. I personally don't understand how I can know something horrific is happening to a child and not try to stop it. How can I just ignore it? But A's concern about DCFS making things worse gives me pause.

This is especially difficult for me because the person who abused my brothers was never brought to justice. It makes me nauseous knowing that he might still be abusing children. And maybe in this situation I can make a difference.

366,"I live on the first floor, about two months ago we got new upstairs neighbors. Our old neighbor was a single older woman with a son who stayed with her occasionally. Our new neighbors are two obese people with two kids. I’m pretty sure the landlord changed out the flooring from carpet to laminate without notifying the HOA or getting it approved. I think this because the noise these people make when they walk around their place is otherworldly. I’m fine with hearing steps or the occasional loud creak or stomp. But our whole house shakes and booms when these people walk. It sounds like someone is dropping medicine balls, and if happens through 3 and 4 am  and all throughout the day. I am losing my sanity from it. To make matters worse, We are looking to sell as well and I just cannot, in good conscience, sell this place to someone with this level of noise currently existing.

368,"Using an anonymous account for this.

I used to be really interested in a girl in sixth form (years12-13 in the UK), and I started to get into selfimprovement because I orginally wanted to get with her. As time progressed I started to realise how this came out of a place of scarcity and as I met more girls i started to develop an interest in other girls; however, like the fool I was I didnt get with other girls and 'chose' this girl, even though we didnt even know each other very well. Part of my selfimprovement was doing 'nofap' - where I abstained from porn, masterbation and orgasms - as someone whos been addicted to porn for a very long time.

I believe that my friend/others may have told the girl to wait for me. 
As I was extremely horny due to nofap and meeting girls, I really wanted to get with other girls; furthermore, the girl I was originally really interested in got together with someone at a party, and I wasnt that interested anymore as I had started meeting lots of girls (not dating or sexual relationships though). At this point I got with other girls.

I feel as if the original girl had some interest in me, I didnt want to straight up tell her that I liked another girl and intended in getting with the other girl i liked so I pretended as if her getting with someone else was a really big deal, in a sense it sort of was because i finally realised that I shouldve gotten with another girl a long long time ago. Later on though, I was thinking about getting with her but thought she wasnt interested because I used her getting with someone else as an excuse to get with other people.

People started to spread rumours about me being a psychopath, initially I was really worried and ended up getting tested from a professional. Despite not actually being a psychopath, literally every single person in my school believed it.

I had to walk on eggshells, things I said were spiced up and gossiped about, more extreme parts of my personality were nitpicked and all other aspects of me were ignored and disregarded. Luckily I made new friends outside of my secondaryschool and they even pointed out to me that I treated my 'friends' far better than they treated me. 

I believe the entire year in my school were gaslighting me by saying that 'nothing was up', even though almost everybody was ignoring me and giving me dirty stares. 

I experimented a bit with psychedelics which brought great introspection to my life but I experienced what the psychiatrist I saw, descrived disociative identity disorder - which I thought was schizophrenia. 

People talk about how Im extremely manipulative, but I felt bad for the girl so I didnt speak to other girls in school - which I regret. There was a period of time where I felt so bad that I never left the house and wasnt eating properly. I would flush extremely hard and would have social anxiety, im assuming people thought that I thought i was grandiose and thought I was thinking I was better than everyone.

In the past I was very violent and narcissistic but I began to feel really bad for it around year8 and I became your stereotypical 'niceguy', which I could tell people didnt respect that much. I didnt stand up for myself because I felt bad for the girls and others, but now Im taking a stand because I cant live with others bullying me anymore.

Honestly speaking if my school friends really feel like I want something from them or are manipulating them I dont want to be friends with them, but almost all believe that Im a psychopath. I am currently sober and really unsure on what to do, my current new friends are telling me to let go of the past, but thisll make everybody in the past think im more of a psychopath, or something else thats been twisted.

373,"I'm an international student \[25F\], graduating soon and hoping to find employment in the country I'm studying in... However I'm facing my own uncertainties and anxieties in regards to the future.

Starting from high school I've always wanted to be a graphic designer, but my parents were against it, quipping that graphic design was a unstable profession, and told me to go into architecture, which I was already making plans for the year before. Honestly, I only planned for it because I knew my parents would prefer me to be in a more 'prestigious' profession. They've always expressed their disdain for 'artsy' trades, especially because they wanted me to succeed in migrating to another country. 

I've already been through my Bachelor's and stupidly continued with my Master's right after just because my parents said they'd paid for it, even though I had always been struggling to enjoy architectural design. I'm always so tired of making design decisions and I feel super anxious and even fear working on my projects, because I feel like my design decisions were never good enough (and they really were). 

I've interned before and I know that I didn't mind working in this field, so I couldn't reconcile why I was struggling so much in my studies. Only just a few weeks ago, I realised it was because it was so easy to become disillusioned in schoolwork, because there's no one else who can share the burden of designing an entire project. Schoolmates didn't help because ultimately we were doing separate projects, this drove me to isolate myself more and more away from everyone, schoolmates, teachers, friends and family alike.

I'm very anxious for the future, because right now, I'm not sure if I'll even pass my finals, or graduate, or fail, will I be able to find employment in another country, find a new place to live, figure out adulthood and ultimately be happy? I don't know. Right now I just know that I wanna walk away from all this, be a different person, and maybe find myself again. But everyone just tells me I don't have time for this 'soul-searching journey', that I need to find a job ASAP or I'll miss opportunities and that I'm not getting any younger.

374,"I'll start by saying that this is a genuine question and I personally don't think being a workaholic is good. However, I can't really place my finger on why it's a bad thing.

I just started a new office job at the same time as someone else, but she is, without a doubt, a workaholic. Even with no one giving us any real expectation to work weekends or late nights, she is consistently doing so. My guess would be that she's working 60+ hours per week, but I pretty much just work the 40-42 that I need and go home, so I really can't tell. I'm pretty sure it's not just a fear of inadequacy either, because she has scolded me on more that one occasion for ""trying to sneak out early"", which was really just me going home after 8 hours of work.

The closest I've gotten to a reason that it's bad is because it can put undue pressure on everyone around you and generally produce a more stressful environment. I also think it's probably detrimental to her health and home life, but I don't think she cares about that anyway, so I'm only trying to put together why it might be hurting those around her. Maybe it's not really a bad thing overall and I just have a negative outlook on someone who wants to go above and beyond, but I wanted to get some other perspectives.

377,"Context: She's been my classmate in college for 2-3 years now and I was always into her. We're friends and we've gone out many times with our mutual friends. Since she had a boyfriend for most of that time I couldn't ask her out, and to be honest I'm not the type of guy for relationships anyway. But recently I've learned that she's single now and I thought this might be a good time to ask her. Also next year our BA course will be over and I might never see her again after, so I fear if I don't tell her, I'll regret not getting down with the girl that I liked for so long.
Do note that I live in Asia and girls here aren't as open and easy going here as in the West, so there's a good chance that she says no, although she is open to such things.
So what do you think I should do? Should I ask her honestly for sex or not?",22Oct2019,0
378,"A lot on my plate! My internship position is in the field that I want to make a career out of one day and typically takes 30 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes a day to complete. The position is remote and I can work from anywhere I want. The internship does not pay and lasts for 6 months.

As for my full time job, it is slightly flexible but its required to work 42 hours a week. It's a position not in the field I want to be in one day, but its still a job that pays well, is close, is something I'm good at, and something that I feel good about doing. 

The college I go to is completely online and the classes I'm currently taking are pretty easy and can be managed with about 5-15 hours a week.

I'm so excited for everything. I feel like I'm finally getting somewhere in my life. I'm excited for the internship, schooling, and full time position. I hope that after a few months I can finally become fully independent and move out.

I live together in my apartment with my adult sister. For the record, she's not paying anything and I only contribute sometimes to help my parents pay things. 

Yesterday her boyfriend visited with my somewhat tacit consent. I'm like that because she previously snuck him in and I caught them while coming out of the toilet at 3 AM. 

Last night at 2 AM I heard her leave the house and return later. I knew she had to be up really early to go to work, but today I found her still home.

I knocked on her door and tried to go in only to find it locked. I knock again. Eventually she comes out, but closed the door behind her. I of course ask why she locked the door. She deflects by saying she didn't want for me to hear her in pain. I don't know about you, but that's the last thing one should do when ill. She's telling me that during the night she started feeling sick and that her BF came and got her some meds (and left). 

What makes me suspect he is in there is the fact she's trying to urge me to go grocery shopping to also get her a few things. She's also not staying in her room like she usually does. I can't understand how a small couch can be more comfortable than a bed.

Now I might be totally off but considering past experiences I don't want to take a risk.

392,"Hello there friends, I am trying to keep this as short as possible, Tl;dr at the bottom. 


My boyfriend (24) and me (20) have been living together for two years, everything is great and we finally decided on adopting a cat. We don't want to buy from a breeder because kittens are expensive and much work and we would like to give an older cat a new home. First we started looking at the local shelters but we had no luck there, apparently even older cats get a new home quickly which is very good! So we decided to come back later. Meanwhile I talked to my mom about us getting a pet, she was fine with it and really supporting. We started looking online at offers from private persons who had do give away their cat because of allergies, moving, work, whatever reason really. Coincidentally we found a married couple that lives about 15 minutes from us and had to give away a five year old maine coon mix cat because the woman developed an allergy. We met them and they were really friendly, they had a clean home. The cat looked healthy and was curious but a little shy, nothing out of the ordinary. You also could tell the couple really knew and liked the cat. We drove home after hours of talking to the owners, answering questions and getting to know the cat. After discussing everything and a night of sleep to think about it, we decided we would really like to have that cat and we could pick her up almost immediately (which is in no way a reason why we want her, really). Now to the real problem: the owners said on the website where we found her that they want 90€ for her. She comes with all of her equipment though. I thought of it as a protection fee like the shelters have, the other cats we saw on the internet had those too so it didn't strike us as out of the ordinary. My mom however is really suspicious about it and says she finds it weird to profit from giving away a loved pet. Again I did not understand the money as 'profit'. She keeps telling us we should think about adopting from a breeder instead because you never know what those people are hiding from you. I think she's afraid that we're rushing things but if we adopted from a shelter it would also take like a week until we could pick up a cat there and we wouldn't get the cat until next week anyway because we have still things to prepare for her arrival. I was so excited and happy but now I'm overthinking: can I trust those people? why is my mum suddenly against adopting an older cat?
i hope someone can help me sort my thoughts a little, thank you for reading until now.

He gets more drunk until we leave and our Lyft refuses to drive to us. Fuck it, we call another. We argue the whole way home over what is NOTHING. We both get inside and he starts telling me that all of the problems that I have at work are my own, I'm a toxic negative bitch, and he wants nothing to do with me.

So basically me and my dad have not been the best of friends the last months and for the first time in my life we have been screening at each other at the top of our lungs. We have always had a good relationship and never really have any argument. This all started when he and his wife meet. This woman got my dad to kick out my older sister about 2 years ago. Everyone he and I knows thinks my dad has changed. About a week ago he kicked me out of the house and i'm now living at my moms.

Today he told me that he hates me and I can just fuck off. I love my dad and that will never change. These last week's have been hard with  averything going on and I have already accepted that our relationship will never get better.

I'm just looking for som advice on how to forget or stop thinking about it. I can't stop thinking about it and it gets in the way if my life. I can't get anything done in school and on multiple occasions I've had to get out of the classroom because I can't hold my emotions down. I just feel like shit all of the time even with my sister who went through something similar and my mother trying to help me. I've never really felt this way before and I don't know what to do.

P.s last month he told me and my brother the electric bill was 700$ which I don’t know how?!!!

Water is one of the cheapest bills too? Is it not? What do I know..

When I try to call them, they never have time, never answer! Always excuses why they can’t pick up the phone. But I also see them on Snapchat with pictures of the kids on restaurants or doing stuff! I get that I’m older now, but when I have bad days and just want my parents to talk to me, it’s like I’m not even there! Just air. And it hurts me.

My dad took responsibility for my money for some weird reason, refuse to give me money for important stuff like razors, intimacy products and so on! It really hurts how he think he can do this to me knowing I have no way of going against him in any way! Over time this have made me resent my dad! To the point where I actually hate him. It has been going on for years and has been building up to resentment! I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve been talking to my boyfriend about this, but since he’s been living in another country! I feel helpless.

TL;DR My dad have been keeping my money and over time denied me my money to buy intimacy products. And treat me poorly compared to my siblings since I was a child.",22Oct2019,2
411,"Hi guys, I work at McDonalds. Two weeks ago I got the stomach flu and had to two three days off of work. 

Then I woke up two days ago with a cold. Like, sore throat, and coughing up mucus. Feels pretty deep in my chest, and my grandpa passed it to me. But the other day I felt like I couldn't even breathe because my chest felt so congested. 

But now I woke up this morning with a terrible sore throat. I should probably call out, right? Considering it's contagious? It doesn't seem like enough to call out imo.",22Oct2019,1

But my SO and I think it’d be great to start saving now for another place once the year lease ends.We’ve all heard/told that basically anywhere in the boonies is about the same rent for a house as an apartment is here. We’ll go just about anywhere in the US to find a place. This idea has been talked before amongst us but I’ve only really looked into it until yesterday. Our max rent is $1,100, not counting some states because of their higher pay. Out of the four of us my SO is the only one payed with a salary (40k) for underwriting. The rest are working on minimum wage or just about. Another issue lowering our chances of getting a house for rent is our over 50lb “aggressive” breed of dogs. Our friends have a Pitbull and so does my SO. They’re timid dogs because of their shitty past but absolute sweethearts. Majority of places i’ve seen up for rent now across the US say they have aggressive breed restrictions. I feel like they wouldn’t even give us a second if we asked if we can show them how they are around people. And even if we got a place we still need to find places to work.

I met my male friend, whom we will call “Mike” through my boyfriend, who we will call “Tom.” They are relatively good friends. Over the last year or so, Tom and I have suspected that our friend Mike has been interested in me, but neither of us is completely certain. One time after Tom and I went to wedding together, Mike said to me in a sort of joking way that “you’re wasting the best years of your life with Tom.” It was posed as a joking comment so I didn’t exactly take it to heart. Now, just recently when hanging out as a group, my boyfriend stepped away for a moment and this time Mike said “When are you finally going to break up with Tom? It’s about time.” Is this a normal way to joke or is this something a guy would only say about his friend if he has an agenda - i.e. he’s interested in me and wants to end my relationship. I told my boyfriend about it and he doesn’t know what to think either, other than Mike is a real asshole. What do you guys think of this behavior from Mike?",22Oct2019,3
424,"I have had a crush on this girl for about two years and last spring I confessed and she rejected me. I've been trying to move on but when I am in a very small school and she's one of my 4 friends then that makes things difficult. I very awkwardly acted like a gross perv, by very shittily trying to flirt when she wasn't at all thinking that way (and whenever we make sex jokes I got horny like a dog). For a long time before this though, she claimed to not even be sexual at all. Whenever she made a dick joke or something, I thought she was opening up more to screwing around with guys.

Many things wrong with all that but I learned that and tried to move on. I talked to her about all the ways I've been a gross asshole (getting childishly mad at her when she would refuse to tell me something). For the past few months I've stopped all that shit but a part of me still liked her.

So cut to yesterday, when curiousity got the better of me. I knew her phone password from looking over her shoulder once and she left her phone and stuff next to me to go do something. I snooped. I went through her discord. Bad on me, the guilt is eating me up.

I found that she was sexting another guy. And from what they said, it was implied that they meet up sometimes. For sex, probably.

So here I am, feeling guilty, in pain, and in shock. I confessed that I looked and saw that and all she said was ""aight"" and went offline. I feel guilty because I looked through her phone. In shock because this sweet, chasity-belt girl that most people would see as innocent (I used to view her as innocent too until she made a lot of sex jokes and expressed a lot of knowledge in all that 8 months back) actually turned out to have more sex than me. Or at least hit on people when I don't. I'm known for joking around a lot and a good portion of the time I made sex jokes, not so much anymore though. And in pain cuz it's the final nail in the coffin forcing me to accept she never once entertained the idea of going out with me.

As well as this, it asks for your location. This is the only ‘odd permission’, the rest make sense.

this has been going on for almost a year. every time they get in a bad fight i have to drive 2 hours away or pay for her uber to get her out of a bad situation. jen keeps getting sarah kicked out by everyone that has let them stay with them. sarah was sober, about to have full custody of her kid, but once all of this started with jen, she's lost everything. but sarah will not part with jen.

well, jen just gave sarah a concussion and a sprained neck. in two days, jen is trying to bring sarah with her to a reservation states away, because jen is part cherokee. i don't know much about that or how they will afford a place because it's my understanding that they'll still have to pay rent. sarah doesn't know anybody in that state, and will be completely isolated and relying on jen. i'm trying to convince her to leave jen and stay here, but she is adamant that she can't leave jen because 'jen has cancer and she'll stop being aggressive once she gets treatment.' this has been going on for years, and i don't care what jen's dealing with, there's no excuse for a fucking concussion and a sprained neck. she threatens sarah's life regularly. i don't want my best friend to die. i'm terrified of what will happen when i can't drive to her or uber her anywhere because she won't have any friends' houses out there to spend the night.

i tried to get her to let me pick her up and let her crash at my place like before but she only told me i could come visit for a day before she leaves. i want to see her but i don't have a lot of money to afford gas and i kind of don't want to go. i don't want to go frustrate myself going in circles with her. sarah is deadset on moving with jen. i told her she could stay at my grandmother's, i know she'd be more than welcome, but she still says she has no options. and if i see jen i'm catching a charge.

440,"I’ve been working at this hospitality job that caters to give you smoothies, juices and crushes with any healthy snacks or protein balls. Currently working over a year now, I get along with most of my work friends except for my Team Leader or supervisor. Her personality is not compatible with mine, my issue with work is that I feel like since she and I don’t get along, she is purposely targeting me to get me fired.

Or prolonging my experience to learn anything new, for over a year I haven’t learned cash handling, preparation of fruits, knowledge of how to open up the store or anything that’s essential in any workplace. 
(I’ll refer my team leader as Cass - fake name)

I feel so much anxiety or discomfort anytime I’m working with Cass, she has this two-faced attitude. A bit egotistical since she’s in a higher position, and never interacts with me except for the rest of my work friends. She’ll only tell me to do stuff or lecture me on something I didn’t do/it’s all your fault attitude. One time, I was enjoying my day with my friend in the city, suddenly via text, Cass would lecture me saying I did poor service, working at this job is a customer service job and I’m the reason that I’m costing them money. Never explaining what I did wrong.

If I did do something wrong, I will remember it since whenever something bad happens, I feel guilty if I’m involved. I nearly had a breakdown from trying to figure out what I’ve done wrong, instead I thought about how much of a mistake I am.
________________
Another case was that I was closing with Cass, she made me upset on that day, she gave me a strike for using my phone to play music in the storeroom. Something to keep me focus since I have horrible attention span, instead of giving me a verbal warning I already gotten a strike. She didn’t even give me room to explain, what’s worse is that it happened at 4:30pm. Cass left the stall by itself, where we are still open all alone where some stranger could steal, she’s a team leader and it’s a duty for team leaders to always stay in the stall in that period. 

I was confused cause she only came in while I was doing the last store run, just to take pictures for new delivery. Now I only have 2 strikes left or I am fired.

After the store run, I just chose to tolerate her until it’s closed. My sister wanted to have a drink at 5:20pm, 10 minutes before closing drinks, she asked for a family discount to Cass. We don’t say family discount, it’s either “centre discount” or “mates rates”, Cass had an exasperated expression and refused to give the discount. it’s the attitude she gave to my sister and drew the line for me.

During that time I couldn’t hear my sister, since I was washing up the equipment slowly for closing, I knew when she called out my name I saw and felt my sister’s annoyance. You know that sibling senses. I was pissed off at the treatment my sister has gotten from Cass, she was rude to my sister for no reason then Cass went all nice for the next customer. Especially with my sister, not towards other customers who were in line, Cass was deliberately being rude to my sisters and I. 
________________
Then we have the recent case, I had sprained my right ankle including My huge wound on my left knee from falling  and scrapping terribly. I had to work 2 long shifts, I told everyone that my ankle is injured and that I can’t lift heavy objects, squat or anything involving heavy movement. Cass chose not to remember until my work friends told her, since she tried to make me do a store run 40 minutes after I told everyone.

When I did recovered (only a few of my muscles were still bruising dark purple patches) Cass asked me to work 4-7:30pm on Friday. I said yes to help them, but when Friday rolled by, I was in such I rush to school that I negated my own safety. I made the sprained right ankle even more worst, like I can hear my bones pop each few steps, I was a limping mess. So immediately I texted to Cass on a media app since, my work must be active daily in this app for any important notices or issues. After 5 hours in school, Cass didn’t read my text about my injury so I copy the text and send it to her phone number at 1pm.

I didn’t get to see my phone until lunch time. Checking to find, instead of Cass understanding my predicament. She chose blame me for giving out a late notice, I ask if she saw the text send her early morning in the app for work, she didn’t and instead lecture me about how I shouldn’t use that app to notify her. I explain myself clearly that since it’s a messaging app my work and you have to be active on, I assumed that after it sent, it should have cause your phone to make a notify sound. I explained that I’m at school, I gave it a few hours to see if she read it, and told her I won’t the luxury of time to be on my phone, solely because of school.

Cass flips the “argument” to her stating she told me her notifications didn’t work on that app, and saying please remember important detail about work. At this point I’m pissed, she didn’t told me that her notifications don’t work on that app, and using that excuse is not good enough compared to mine. 

(Partially that anger was her shoving her own way down my throat, when it’s all a lie for her to get what she wants) So I just said that I was not informed of this and that I was serious. After that, she didn’t give me shifts for 2 weeks right now, I already noticed my other team leader their starting to hate me, because of Cass told them something negative about me.

My sister told me bluntly that my work especially with Cass running it, has poor management, lack of compensation for outside work injuries and didn’t like her attitude in work.

443,"This dude and I have been texting since the start of July and almost every day since the middle of August. I spent a month abroad and we kept in touch the entire time, actually ended up snapping, messaging, etc. even more surprisingly. I've never been in a real relationship and I've never had to confess my feelings for anyone so this is totally foreign to me. We've hung out a few times in groups before I left and since I've been back we've hung out just the two of us as well. While I was gone we made lots of plans to hang out and each time we do hang out we both text that we had a good time and enjoy each other's company specifically.

When we're together in person however, he isn't very physical. While at a movie he didn't reach out to hold my hand or anything, but I sat closer to him just so that he could. I even had to ask him to kiss me at an opportunity when I could tell he really wanted to. 
I'm wondering if he's just apprehensive to do anything since we aren't official; and since I really like this guy and have a really strong feeling that he's the same, I figure things could come easier if we both know the status of our relationship, at least for his sake, idk. Even if he doesn't want to start a relationship just yet, I honestly just appreciate his company, and if all else fails I think he might feel more comfortable with me if he hears me confess me feelings directly for him, and it's no longer a guess.

444,"So I did my research already so you don't think I have no clue what I'm talking about- I went through multiple websites and videos and I just wanted to ask for help, just in case- you know.  
I came here because ""apparently"" people are worried about my mental health, so I did research and one of the topics that I found I had the most in common with was psychopathy, sociopathy and antisocial personality disorder and I found out that my brother and I have very similar traits considering this. p.s there's a summary at the bottom if you want. Any help at all will be helpful even if you're not a professional I just kinda wanted to rant:)

  
Most of these though are signs for kids because before the age of 18 it would not be called anything yet but there might be a high chance of getting any of the disorders above. Quick thing when we were younger we had asthma but my brother had lots of allergies, ADHD he has Gammanorm now which is immunoglobuli G, and its call gammaglobulin (my mom's a Pharmacist but studied to be a doctor not entirely sure what that means though)

  
**Apparently bedwetting is a sign of trauma (not all cases some are just because of a weak bladder)**...Okay, I wet my bed after seeing my mom strangled (still alive) when I was 4 so it doesn't count and my brother wet his bed more than me but it's probably his weak bladder as I mentioned earlier not sure if it has anything to do with it but otherwise no trauma activities. 

  
**Destructive behavior, such as arson and vandalism.** Mkay, so what we were interested in fires? We lit as many candles as we could and went to huge bonfires as well as lighting the fireplace... kay we didn't set fire to the house yet but now we're more interested in other things so we're good there. Well... I'm still interested in fires but all the videos I find are boring so I gave up this year. Vandalism? Do they mean breaking tons of stuff and intentionally wrecking somebodies lunch box? No? okay then no we did not. 

  
**Aggressive behavior, such as cruelty to animals.** hahahaaaaaaaaaaaa yeah well about that... um well, I wanted to learn how to wash a baby bunny, I asked my dad who taught my brother not me so I taught myself, grabbed a cup, filled it with water and- well you know... shoved it in. I can't remember how they reacted but I do remember my dad saying something like ""that's not how you do it"" and my brother said something like ""oh, you killed it"" let's just say I never washed a rabbit again. Man, that was dumb (how would normal people react to killing a rabbit? Or see someone kill a rabbit? Would they just kinda go ""oh"" and move on?)  
7 months later we're trying to catch one of the rabbits and I forgot who's idea it was but someone thought it would be a good idea to catch it with a broom (come to think of it I think it was my idea 'cause I spotted the broom first and then showed my brother, saying we could use it to block its path) but after few minutes of waving the stick around my brother started hitting it till it stopped and we caught it. As in stopped moving. So we took it to the vet find out we broke it's spine and had it put down. (again how would anyone else react? Would they just go ""oops"" I did it again?)   
Oh and that one time when my brother was 2 (aka the year before I was born) we ""had"" a hamster... It was dead the next day. hurting or killing small animals? Check. oops... oh well we forgot their names anyways and we gave them a proper burial. Stuffed animals? Didn't make it. One lost an eye another an ear and the others just beat each other up- fight to death sort of stuff. P.s. we never cried maybe we were too young but whatever.

  
**Fraud or manipulation.** haha... I totally didn't lie to everyone all the time... totally. Now though? oh all the time, it's so easy to just lie to people. Me in first grade? forging my mom's signature. Manipulation 100% and my brother also lies a lot but nobody believes him but he is really good at manipulating- he taught me well because my manipulation skills are on point.

  
**Cheating, friends, family and individuals who are neutral. Stealing toys?** Yep. My lego pieces always ""missing"" somehow ending up in my brother's collection. We steal from each other constantly, even recently. We know that the other has taken it. We yell, cause a fight and stuff but in the end, we steal it back. Yes, we stole from friends and family friends- we even had this mini heist going on to get that lego rabbit from our cousin. It was successful but eventually, we lost it so that was useless but we convinced our parents to buy more lego with bunnies so yeah. I've got 7 he's got 5. Stealing money? No, because well no. Convincing our parents to give us money though? Yep, much easier. Stealing collectable coins? Oh, yeah. We collect coins and occasionally we have an auction with each other but sometimes I've caught him stealing my coins so I kinda stole them back:)  
Oh and my brother manipulates my cousin a lot and steals his toys as well, I kinda see my brother with a few mental problems while I see my cousin as someone who's probably going to be on drugs at an early age- you know homelife and stuff mainly my aunts fault along with his ""friends"" basically they'll probably be doing drugs with him one day. When I see them together their personalities just shine it's really fascinating and annoying at the same time to hear my cousin crying all the time and them making up the next day or few hours... My brother still does this and he was 13 but after we moved away he has no one to steal from but me although he doesn't do it that often so neither do I. He doesn't steal from me I don't steal from him.

  
**Reacting to a crying child.** Seeing a child crying???? What the heck am I supposed to do?? Like seriously I don't get it? So naturally... I walk away. Yep, avoid confrontation at all costs and if the crying gets annoying I'll go ask someone else to help. There, problem solved. I'm 13 and still have no clue what to do if there is a child right in front of me \*insert slapping the kid out the way vine\* (if you get any of my references you're cool:) 

  
**Dominant with an authoritative figure...** Another funny story- basically all the time me yelling at adults who *are* in the wrong and refuse to believe a *kid* seriously?? Oh my gosh that ended with me slapped but oh well I guess the emotional trauma I put them through after that and me telling them that they'll become abusive parents- mentally scarring them 'cause they're sensitive about that topic (aka my 29-year-old cousin) but her husband I understand- he grew up with abuse but maybe she's just emotionally weak- apparently being a gynaecologist makes you ""*emotionally unstable*"" or was it her ""*trauma*"" you know, 4-year-old sister dying when she was 6 **-**or her parents divorce before they were married and *before* she was born- or was it that she made up her mom and grandparents to be evil for the divorce in her mind causing her to forget all the good things her mom (my aunt) did for her while she went out with her friends till midnight without informing them keeping them up all night and then calling them to ask if they could pick her up? I don't know- I just suggested they go to therapy and not some ""radio station"" venting out their problems?) -\_basically I insulted her making sure that if they ever have a child they might prepare a bit more mentally so I was trying to help and got slapped for it. Great, but I *know* what I said affected her, which is great- maybe *now* they'll go to therapy. Oh, and when we were both little we would fight so bad our parents had to drag us apart causing us to fight against them and basically beat them up sometimes to get to one another. My brother still does this to my mom sometimes when he's mad and my dad does nothing (**COughidiotCouGh**) so I step in and my mom yells at *me* for basically saving her from bruises... Thanks, mom.

  
**Attacking a teacher?** No. Plotting ways to get back at them or make life difficult? Oh yeah. Maybe just a little bit on planning their death on my part but otherwise we kinda hold a bit of respect for teachers 'cause they have to go through hell on earth every day and deal with us little devils for sometimes more than 6 hours a day. **\*press F to pay respects\*** Although there was that one teacher I *really* wanted to kill. I didn't but she had no respect but eventually, I gained her trust and talked poop behind her back:) Wouldn't believe anyone who told her that *I* told them? Me? Miss goody-two-shoes insulting the teacher? *Never.*

  
**Trouble with the Police?...MAYBE-** okay you see... I was at a place called ""Bounce"" it's a trampoline place and I was there with my mom who watched. I was playing dodge ball and some kid ~~prick~~ decided to cheat and made fun of me being a girl while doing it. I got irritated, threw my watch at him and kinda kicked him through the net- only running when he said his mom worked there. SO 5 minutes later the times up and we have to leave- he calls his mom and I'm waking away blending into the small crowd with my mom on our way to the bank going into an area where there's nobody and as I'm walking back to the car park I see the kid, his mom and 2 policemen waling to the place we were 1 minute ago. My brother? No, not yet. There's a lot of respect and hatred for them at the same time. 

  
**...Attacking anyone?** **:)** plenty ranging from my brother to my dad to the ""big bad bully"" to those annoying kids in class- did they provoke me? Yes and no. My bro and every other kid who annoyed me got a pen, pencil, splinter, or a ruler heading at them:) #NoRegrets. I've also attacked random people whom I think deserved what they got. As far as I can tell the only people my brother attacked was the school bullies and some dude who picked on me and him- THAT was the  ULTIMATE takedown- my bro held him back and I kicked that idiot in the balls- let's just say I played a lot of soccer and I know how to kick :,) memories. Although my brother did attack him by himself a few times along with someone else it was *well* deserved.

  
**Getting in trouble with the law?**  we don't want trouble with the law. Too much of a pain. **Peer pressure?** Nope, we volunteer. It never works on us it is just to prove that they don't have an advantage over us.

  
 **fighting and bullying?** Well you see, funny story actually. In my old-old school, there was a bully and my brother often got into fights with this person. While this was happening, I convinced a bunch of first graders to chase my brother while I getting into people's business and trying to stop fights, I don't know why though but it was more interesting to fight than to sit and read. I came across friends but I hung out with anyone in my grade in all the different groups- people who: played games, played sports, were older, gossiped, pulled pranks, read etc.. I knew everyone and everyone knew me. I also hated the people I hung out with- I didn't want to be alone and not know what's going on.

  
**Deceitful behavior, such as shoplifting and lying?** Kay maybe shoplifting once (not caught) but that was a while ago but lying? All the time.

  
**Violation of rules, which may include truancy and running away from home?** We break the rules so many times there are no rules- bad I know but honestly, I don't care. Staying away from school? Well if you include ignoring homeschooling till last second then okay. Running away from home?... Yes. I was annoyed at them- went to my gran's sisters house next door without telling anyone after they took away everything because I was *too slow cleaning my room.* I'm still mad at that and they proceeded to blame me and when I stood up for myself the slapped me in the face. As I mentioned before I ruined their mentality.

TL;DR I have destructive behaviour, a fascination with fire, aggressive behaviour, (killed a few animals,) Lie and manipulate people along with forging my mom's signature, steal toys with no remorse, hate crying children/people, ruined many adults mentality, plotted some teachers deaths, got in trouble with the police, attacking random people because they deserved it along with friends and family, became a bully to the bully, lied to all my friends that I enjoyed their company, stole a toy from the shops and lie constantly, break the rules, and ran away from home.

445,"Hi. I have an issue that I call upon reddit to solve for me because my brain is starting to over heat. 

So a new girl (LL) came to my school 3 months ago and we became really close friends. She is openly bisexual and has dated a few girls. I (OP) on the other hand say I’m straight and that I’m into guys. 

Um yeah maybe not. 

You see I have been questioning for a while now and I have come to the conclusion that I am also bisexual. And that I like LL but I don’t know if I am ready to say anything.

446,"I've been out of the dating scene for 3 years and I could use some advice. 
There's woman at  my job I started 3 weeks ago, from a different department.
We started having intellectual conversations, then we realized we think on the same level. She would always tell me I'm flattering her,when I give her compliments about her mind.
She then asked my opinion on her writing, before showing me her poetry on her phone.  
She finds an excuse to talk with me at random. Even when I don't initiate the conversation. She tells me I'm funny and laughs at my jokes(The one's she understands,she's Albainian) and last week she made a joke about previous relationships I mentioned. I noticed her smiling and making eye contact with me, despite talking with another co-worker. She sticks up/defends to said co-worker, who is also Albainian. He gives me a hard time because he doesn't speak English well and we sometimes fail to communicate because he's training me.
She shares her snacks with me in the break room, without me even asking. Yesterday,as I is happen to walk into the break room. She was there and said ""This is what time I eat lunch""  I notice she's normally very reserved and quiet. I don't want to rush it nor talk to long and get friend zoned.",22Oct2019,1
449,"I have anxiety and it causes me to have catastrophic thoughts. I keep thinking people have seen me on the internet and when I graduate university my employers will Google my name and then find out about me. 

I posted about this months ago on Reddit. Most people were saying horrible things about me, but some where helpful. I was told that I made a very minor mistake, it's not going to affect me at all and that I'm being irrational when I'm saying it's going to ruin my life. 

The problem is that I can't get this out of my head. I'm going insane thinking about this. I believe I made a huge mistake and that I'm being rational, but people are telling me otherwise. I was also having a mental health crisis almost a week ago and I'm getting close to that feeling again. 

I went to the doctor today who put me back on meds and is sending me to a psychotherapy. 

The meds will take a few months to work and the psychotherapy will take place in about 4 months.

I desperately need help. I don't like going outside because I keep thinking people have seen me on the internet, especially if they smile at me. I can't look anybody in the eyes. My doctor smiled for some reason when he wasn't looking at me today and I thought it was because he's seen me on the internet. I can't convince myself that he hasn't.

451,"So I'd like to preface this that obviously nobody can decide this for me nor I want anyone to do that, but I am sorta looking to understand my &amp; their reasoning as I clearly understand nothing. (This post comes from female perspective btw.)

*(For the ppl familiar with MBTI he was an INTJ and she an ENFP.)*

* **Situation**: was online friends (mainly the guy, but the three of us used to hang out in vc / play games together) with two great buddies from US, they were dating &amp; living together, engaged, then they got into huge argument cuz the dude fell for some online chick in other country and wanted to move to her place, his fiancée found out, bam. 

* **My part in the story:** I found out about it only from the girl, tried to be emotionally supportive slash offering problem-solving/observations in an non-intrusive way (more with the girl as the dude clearly didn't want an outsider's help at that time at least unlike her - np with me), talked to both, was there for both of them, was letting them to sort it out on their own, np. But then I somehow effed up I guess?, because (idk what was my intention lol, probably none, it was more of an observation - it made me sad that she's sad, ez like that) I kinda mentioned to the dude she seems so sad and then he flipped. He stopped talking to me after that.

* **What went wrong on my part:** I asked him after weeks if it seems like we're not talking anymore? His answer was yes. So my personality kinda turned around and somehow I cut them both away (instead of engaging the situation and trying to trouble-shoot it - understand what I did wrong by making an innocent observation). Basically I assumed it's somehow over and I should gtfo, or whatever my reasoning was.

* **Now**: It's been probably past one year and I just kinda miss them I guess? (Checking out their FB they married and seem all good.) We had great vibes. I also feel uneasy because for me it's like an unresolved situation - did I somehow hurt him or say something rude from his PoV? Which means I am looking for closure/understanding. But on the other hand, based of previous experiences, people usually move on a lot after you disconnect. So it seems kind of silly for me to basically go ""back in past"". I am basically considering two things: a) approaching them to ask what went wrong and then leave them on friendly terms, moving on, or b) approaching them for closure BUT also to get back in touch. The second choice seems kinda silly though, I've done the reconnecting thing multiple times with various friends and sometimes, it's just best to let go.

454,"So, full context. We are a family of four, my 2 sisters and my dad. My mom died 7 years ago. I'm a male 18, working and also studying in uni. My dad is a very cold person who doesn't show much affection.

Around the start of 2018 I found out that my dad was actually gay. I found this out not through the best way. I had started to notice some changes in my dad's acting and how secretive he had become of his phone. He put a pattern lock on it and every time he would be using it and someone was around he would hide what he was typing or doing, etc. So when we were vacationing I saw that he was sending heart emojis to someone through chat, and my snoopy ass decided it would be nice to see if he was hitting it off with another woman, finally moving on from my mom which he had loved and it torn him apart when she died. So i decided to find out who it was. It was a man. I was surprised at first, but thought, what the hell, it's fine, if he has been repressing this for so many years it should be cool for him to finally live his true self, even though it means carrying a burden and hiding it from us. I didn't mind, I talked it out with my psychiatrist and it was all cool. So, after some sessions with my therapist I brushed it off and was happy about my dad being able to love someone again.

Flash forward to today. I hadn't thought much about my dad's love situation in a while, but after going into his room to search for some shoe-cleaner while he was away i found a second phone. This raised some suspicions on my side as I thought, ""why would he need a second phone if he is already hiding his main phone from us"". I snooped around again. His pattern lock was the same one as his primary phone so it led me to believe it was him. I found grindr as well as some private conversations where he hid his identity on it. I'm not sure if it's his phone, as he had a conversation with his main phone on it, so it could be someone else's, but the fact that it had the same lock pattern as the primary phone led me to believe it was his. He didn't use his pictures or his name and he lied about where he lived and all that stuff. Of course it was littered with his dick pics, so that wasn't a nice view, but I just had to know what he was up to before leaving the topic alone. 

So it seems that he is having 1 night stands with people from grindr wich I don't mind, but the lying and the covering of his identity has got me thinking about it all day long. Why would he do that? I don't know if he is talking to younger guys, and I'm afraid he could get into trouble because of it and, if everyone finds about this because of him getting in trouble it would be awful.

I don't know who knows about all of this, so i don't know who to talk to about it. That is why I came to you guys for help. If you need anymore info or if I expressed my self wrongly let me know so I can clear out any doubts.",22Oct2019,1
455,"She rang me crying around 4AM last night. She is staying in a hotel on her own in a different city as she is starting college there. She said a man was in her room and she woke up to him having sex with her. She was crying and she told me she’s kicked him out by screaming and hitting him. He left. She described his appearance and from what I gather I think she was drugged as she doesn’t seem to remember getting back to her hotel and doesn’t know how he entered her room and she doesn’t remember the taxi but thought she came home alone. 

I don’t understand it how someone could have gotten into a scan-only hotel room. Unless maybe he came home with her and she forgot. She said she didn’t drink other than half a bottle of red wine (not much for her) and one drink in the club. 

She refuses to go to the police or anything, not wanting to be ‘that girl’ and wanting to ‘forget about it’. I reached out to her this morning confirming I won’t tell anyone as she doesn’t want anyone knowing. She seemed dazed and lackluster on the phone last night after crying. I believe her story but I don’t know why she won’t get a rape test kit done as she is losing time. Also there would be CCTV in the hotel/bar/outside the bar. She had been with her friend who’s a girl but that girl went home with another man. And then she claims she got a taxi and woke up. We were on the phone for about 40 minutes and she thought it had only been 5-10minutes. I fear her not going to hospital/police to get DNA tested is a mistake a he might regret forever.

456,"So, since I was 5 years old, I've suffered with migraines. Usually it was about 2 every month or so, but recently, I've been getting them every other day (or week if I'm lucky). They seem to come in waves- like a month or two at a time. They're debilitating. 
The problem is that I work and it really affects my ability to do anything, including showing up. Luckily, I work with my family, so they're more understanding, but I'm still barely able to afford getting by. 
I've thought about getting on disability for it, but it takes like a year, and in that year, I can't work or I won't get compensated. I have bills and can't afford to not work, but my migraines prevent me from working. 
I'm pretty sure my parents aren't cool with paying me under the table for when I am able to work (haven't really talked extensively about it, but I just get that feeling). I'm not great at art or anything like that (not like I could make enough from that anyways).

457,"What is your advice when it comes to discussing “lease” terms with someone who has recently decided to divorce, and is escaping domestic abuse/violence? I have never been in this position, and although I want to be as lenient and sensitive as I can, I also have to be accountable as discussing the terms of their stay is inevitable for both parties.

Context: 

A friend’s friend is urgently looking for a place to stay since deciding to divorce/physically separate from spouse. The spouse had been aggressive towards this friend for a while (who knows how long?) and the last straw happened when they had a public altercation and physical fight. This is when the friend decided it was time to leave for good. I’m the only one they know close to their job with an available empty place and offered for them to stay temporarily. 

Question:

They originally said 2-4 weeks would be great, but then I heard from a 3rd source that they may need a couple months to recover until they find a new place, and get back on their own feet.

That’s where it gets tricky, since I may not have the same space availability at the end of December. 

If during the interview they say they plan to stay a couple weeks, then everything works out perfectly. But if they say a couple months, meaning past December, I would need to rearrange plans. (They are not aware of this, and I don’t want them to know so they don’t feel like it’s inconvenient). Also, even though they work full-time, I will not be asking for rent. Just utilities for as long as they stay. 

I’m hoping they are realistic about the timeframe they actually need and upfront with me, so we are able to work out a plan with the minimal amount of pressure for them, and changes on my side.

460,"I've been in multiple situations where people have been on the verge of tipping to your side in an argument. I've tried different things and looked up stuff, and heres what I found, and believe, are the best 2 tips to subconciously persuade. (Plus one to make people possibly leave)

1 - Dont. Get. Angry.

Clearly this can be hard, but being angry will completely destroy any argument you have. Find breathing tips, or practice question responses prior to the argument. (If it was planned)

2 - Mimic body language.

Mimicking body language makes a person subconciously more open. They think you're a lot like them, which allows them to open up. Just dontbe staring before looking at your own legs, etc.


Bonus - 3 - Staring at the bridge

If you're annoyed with someone, stare just above the bridge of their nose, which is right between their eyes, but not quite their forehead. For some strange reason, it makes people uncomfortable and self conscious after a bit. They may not leave, but they're more likely to leave you alone.",22Oct2019,0
461,"Hey what's up everyone, I'm a 24 years old Italian guy and I'm afraid I might have worsened my future career/life by choosing a non competitive master degree.

A little bit of backstory, I was a very bad student in high school, I even ended up failing some classes and had to retake them during the summer, in 12th grade I had the chance to do an exchange in the U.S. so I got my shit together and I ended up going. It was a life changing experience, I made a lot of friends, learned English, became a better student and I became more aware about world problems, so much that being the idealizer I am I thought my life goal was to change the world for the better.

I joined university in Milan but I wasn't sure about my choice so I dropped out, worked for 6 months pondered my decision better and enrolled in another program ""Economics and business administration"" at the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Milan (medium/high tier school in my country). I was determined to show myself and others that I could make it and I could really excel at what I did, 3 years of bettering myself in everyway and really believing in my goals and I was able to graduate in time with the maximum grade and a small internship experience in SME based in Lombardy. 

I really felt I needed a change as well and  I was ready to raise the bar and aim at a better school abroad (going abroad was my first intention from the beginning, I wanted to do an exchange but something happened and I didn't do it), I selected a few master programs at the Rotterdam School of Management specifically a Master in Management, mind I'm really not sure about the specific position I would like to cover in a company but I know I would like to get in the marketing area (analysis and strategy) of a company with values shared to mine and work in an international setting.

 I thought that would be the best choice to aim at that so in between exam breaks I got ready for the GMAT, the minimum score they were asking for was 600 so not that high but unfortunately I didn't have much time to prepare, I gave 100% but I scored 580 1st attempt and 460 (or 420 don't remember) on the 2nd, I was mortified, my score were very uneven (75-80 percentile on the verbal 19-29 percentile on the quantitative) I knew I was strong in the verbal and weak in the quant part but I wasn't expecting the results to go so down on the second attempt, I really don't know what went wrong, anyways that was my last attempt as deadlines were approaching fast so I picked myself up and made a decision. 

I always make the mistake to focus too much on one objective and not consider other option so given that I hadn't reach the minimum score to go to RSM I gathered information about other Italian universities that had more relaxed deadlines and I ended up deciding to stay in my uni and enroll in a Master's program (Msc in Management, MiM) in English.

Long story short  the program wasn't up to my expectations at all, we're talking about professors that don't speak English well, wordy slides, no good books, courses that seemed just credit fillers to me, the fact that I approached it as a step backward also played a role in making my experience bad. 

Everything started going south, everything that I was so proud of and helped me build my confidence over my university years started to deteriorate and go wrong, studying 

\- Studying, I stopped giving all of my exams and being on track, I was so unmotivated and  broken down for all of my hard work seemed to have been wasted.

\-Love, I started to date a girl I really liked and that was also giving me a lot of confidence as I never managed to date the girl I REALLY liked in my life, but then right after New Years eve when everything was at its worst with life doubts and school, it ended cause she wasn't into me

\-Personal, I stopped going to the gym and being healthy, I stopped caring, I stopped going to classes and I really beat myself down, I got to a point where I simply didn't care anymore.

I decided I needed to find a solution, I pondered a multitude of solutions and even questioned if I was really in the right major and If what I was doing was what I really wanted to do, I boiled down my options to two. I was either going to quit this program and start again in Copenaghen (Copenaghen Business School - top tier in Europe) to which I had applied in January  (Msc International Marketing) or stay in my school and finish my degree in Spain (with the options of taking all of my missing exams in the host uni ICAI-ICADE in Madrid).

I ended up choosing the secondo option and this is way: 

1) ever since I came back from the US I've been dreaming of going to another country and learning a new language (as I mentioned earlier I tried to do that in my bachelor but in the end I couldn't do it) 

2) My family financial situation has not been that great recently. My parents are divorced and my dad has to provide for 2 families and 5 children, two of whom are now living outside our hometown. Going to Copenaghen would have been great but it would have been very difficult to bear the costs of me being there, on the other hand Madrid is less expensive and I also got a small scholarship.

3) Spanish, speaking a third language would make me more competitive and career decisions aside I've been wanting to learn it ever since I took Spanish I during my exchange

I want to take a small break by thanking you, whoever is reading, thank you, it means a lot to me that you read to this point and using your time  to give me an advice on what I should do. I'm the oldest of five and my dad and mom can offer me little guidance at this point. I've also talked to my psychologist about it but she just doesn't have the experience/knowledge to advice on this case so I just don't know whom to ask anymore. 

Now. I'm here in Spain, I feel I'm finally getting back on track on so many levels. I'm learning a new language, meeting so many inspiring and funny people and doing many beautiful experiences, but I still don't know precisely what to do in the future. 

When I'll be over with this I'll have to write my thesis, at the end I will have a degree which will probably only give me some value in Italy but not abroad, and most of the jobs that I would be able to access will not be stimulating, at least that's what I've understood of my country, everything is competition and the people who get the best jobs are usually people who have done more than what I've done, it will be hard to find something exciting and for which working hard is worthed, very hard, and even harder since I still have no idea about what the fuck it is I would love to do with my life, I would love to have a vision, be excited everyday to work hard on something but I just don't know. I know who I am more or less, I know what I like, for what kind of companies I would like to work and in which kind of environment and so on but I don't have a plan, I don't know how to get there, it's like I'm short sighted and I don't have glasses to fix it, I can see something but it's blurred and the more time passes the more life will make decisions for me and I'll have less freedom in choosing where to aim and go, I'm so afraid I will end up somewhere not right for me, that I'll be sad, that I won't be able to do the things I love, and I keep going back in time and telling myself I could have done more and should have decided earlier by this time I wouldn't be so doubtful.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried to synthesize what my problem is. I apologize for being wordy and making probably, a lot grammar mistakes along the way. If you have experience or even if you want to share your perspective and are willing to give advice please do, everything from book reccomandations to a few lines of what you think will be appreciated. 

My best wishes

463,"a really old friend of mine has been super stressed recently. we go way back and while we're not particularly close, we do appreciate and encourage each other whenever we can.

she's super smart and this year has been really stressful for her ever since it started and she's terrible at taking care of herself as it is, and now that we're in sixth form she's in a position of huge responsibility and is the most stressed I've ever seen her. I saw that she really wasn't feeling well today and I want to help her out somehow.

I want to do something really encouraging for her to let her know I'll always have her back, and im really shitty at being wholesome and showing love irl, so I really have no clue what to do

anyway, if you'd like to help me out, do send something short and sweet that you wish someone would say to you whenever you feel overwhelmed by work or whenever you don't feel good about yourself, or just something you think people need to hear to lift their spirits up a bit and keep them going  


TL;DR my friend has been super stressed lately due to school and is going through a lot, I want to put together some encouraging words, so if you think you have any small wholesome message that could help out, do comment it ! 

~~aaa please don't let this flop ;-; I really would appreciate the help~~",22Oct2019,1

468,"I’m not doing well in graduate school and I want to withdraw the remainder of my semester and possibly next semester off. This means I get a W grade for withdrawal for all of my classes except for the one class that already wrapped up where I got a C+. At this rate, I will probably get another C grade for another class and do Bs for the rest. Otherwise I’ve been a Bs and As performer. 

I know grades don’t matter as they say but the thing is that if I want to leave phd option open down the line, I’m afraid the GPA I’ll end up with will rule that out. I’m a 3.4 now and will probably drop to 3.2 or 3.0 range if I continue at this rate. 

Benefits of withdrawing and coming back point to this decision (time to prepare for classes, recharge, work on mental health, possibly up my grades).

Downsides are pretty heave though (pay 60% tuition, not sure with loans, screw my research project team over by dropping, get Ws which I’ll have to explain, will have to withdraw from presidential management fellowship running, will likely need to explain education gap, and really being labeled as the one who dropped out bc I couldn’t handle it).

Sorry about the rant. 

Given the situation, I’m hoping for advice on how to frame this for my academic advisor whose permission I need (and also the dean). Do I go vague and say I have “personal issues” or “family issues” to work out? Or be candid and say that I can’t take messing up any more than I did this semester which is the only option now?",22Oct2019,1

476,"I am an 18yo guy who works at a cafe, and one of my co-workers (22F) is jaw-droppingly beautiful. We used to work once a week together over the summer. I’m terrible at initiating conversation with anybody new so she eventually started talking to me after we worked together for a bit. We got to know each other a little bit over the few hours we got to see each other each week, and she would occasionally light-heartedly tease me about certain things with other co-workers around, nothing special I think. 

I was planning to stop working when I went to school, and when I told her that on my last day, she told me she would miss me / that makes her sad / asked me why Im quitting. honestly I have no clue if this is just her being nice and I’m thinking to hard about this, or if she was genuinely sad. 
I go to school and boss texts me a couple weeks later that they are short on people and asks if I come back on weekends so I decide why not, can’t be bad. I think I had maybe 2-3 shifts with her after coming back on weekends, but then she got scheduled to weekdays only. 

The cafe I work at is very good so I go there with friends about once a week for a drink on weekdays, so I see my co-worker there when I go and I chat with her a little bit when my friends walk away. One time she mentions to me that her and other coworkers were talking about me earlier about how they wish I was there when it was busy (she has told me before this as well when I came in with friends that she was talking about me with other coworkers),and I teased her this time by saying something like ”you talk about me all the time”, and she told me she just thinks I’m really cool. I don’t know if i am absolutely clueless or something and she was actually interested in me then,  or if she was just being nice to me again, but I just shrugged it off as the latter and didn’t say much after that and went back to my friends. 

So I was kind of starting to have feelings for her at this point, I had a little before but they were growing after this, maybe I just develop crushes too easy idk. We worked together again recently because I was on fall break so I worked a couple week days with her, and after I opened the shop by myself each morning and coworkers arrived at opening time, I basically just talked with her until I was off because the shop was dead at that time. Of course I was too much of a pussy to tell her how I really feel about her. 

Our shop has a Facebook group chat that our manager sends our weekly schedule to, so I thought since I didn’t know when I would be working with her next, I would add her on Facebook. Did that, and she hasn’t added me back lol, maybe she just doesn’t check Facebook, who knows. But I have no idea what to do now since I don’t know when I will see her next and I still kinda have feelings for her. If any of you have advice or have input on whether or not you think she is just being nice to me or if she is actually interested me please let me know! Sorry for the long cringe post!",22Oct2019,3

After that I took a few months to find a new job with a lower stress level. (I live with my boyfriend and he can financially support both of us if I need it) I decided to try nannying/babysitting and applied for jobs constantly for about a month and a half, it took a long time because it was my first one so I had no reviews/references. I finally found the perfect job. Pushed through my anxiety to start something new and did it. Good money, good family, sweet kid, nice schedule. I was suppose to be working for them for 6+ months at least until the child started preschool. 
  Now, about a month into job, I found out the child got moved up on the preschool waitlist and will be starting in 2 weeks instead of next year; AKA 2 week notice for me. The Parent(s) gave me a good review on Nanny site, and also offered a job where one parent works in a salon as an assistant. I’m pretty upset because my anxiety makes new things really difficult for me and I had just gotten comfortable and was feeling happy for the first time in a long time. 
  Anyways, I’m wondering whether I should find a new nanny job, or work at salon. On one hand, salon job would be guaranteed and same amount of money and I could start ASAP, on the other though I left waitressing because of the panic attacks customer service gave me so I don’t know if going back into it would be good for me.

She was asking me for a lot of help with wording, so i offered to look over it and fix some stuff, and she agreed. I spent about 40 minutes looking over it and made some changes with track changes on, mostly wording, tenses, and word count. I looked back the google doc today and noticed that she pretty much ignored all of my suggestions. I'm not hurt that she did that, but I'm worried that she thinks that I dont like her writing.

499,"For reasons I don’t want to get into, my dad took his own life in the garage (all damage to the garage has been repaired and you wouldn’t know it happened) whilst the house was on the market. It’s now too big for my mum and my brother (I’m moved out), and understandably, she wants to move still. There’s also the issue of her not being able to afford to live in the house. An offer has just been made for the asking price of the house, but we don’t know whether to tell them. 

One the one hand, if they aren’t told and find out at a later date what happened, they may be upset to find out - it could have a psychological effect living somewhere where this happened. On the other hand, they might withdraw the offer if we tell them or lower the offer, and that’s the last thing my mum needs right now. She needs as much money as she can get to secure her future. She also needs to get out this house and move on as soon as possible. Since it didn’t happen in the house, there’s no legal obligation to inform them. 

Should we tell the prospective buyers?",22Oct2019,1
500," 

We've known each other since the beginning of the new school year, and have basically spent every waking hour of the day together ever since. I've never met a person who i can relate to as much as her, in my entire life. I'm terrible at small talk, but when i'm with her, it's like i never run out of things to say, and neither does she. We spend the breaks together, we eat together, we work together, and we take the bus together. If we're both at school, then we're definetly together. We also constantly text each other on snapchat for hours on end.

A couple of weeks ago she invited me to the movies, since her boyfriend couldn't come (from what she tells me, they broke up the day after, because he was a verbally abusive drug dealing stoner) and we had a great ol' time. I later invited her to have a cup of coffee with me, where we walked across town talking and having fun. We were together for about 2 and a half hours, and i was planning on asking her if she wanted to date, but the words wouldn't come out of my mouth. I had the feeling that she probably was into me, because she was talking about how she missed being in a relationship, and right after asked me if i've ever had a girlfriend. She has also previoulsy described what kind of guys she's into, and it sounds a lot like me (Tired/sleepy looking, pale and monotone). The next day, i asked her if she wanted to hangout during the weekend, since neither of us had any plans. She said yes, and we hung out for about 6 and a half hours. We were just walking around talking, we walked into a restaraunt at one point and drank a glass of wine, and after that we just talked till it got dark. It was cold as fuck outside, and she forgot her scarf, and was just wearing leggings and a dress, but never asked to call it a day. We got really deep with each other, and talked about the worst aspects of our mental illnesses. I told her that i constantly have this voice in the back of my head, that tells me that people don't like me as much as they seem to. And that i've only misinterpreted their signals, and that they in reality don't like me all that much. And i think that that's one of the reasons that i'm nervous about asking her out. Because i have this fucking voice in my head, that shrouds my critical thinking and makes me believe that she, and everyone else don't like me. Which is why i'm posting here, because i need people to tell me. Anyway, i called myself an idiot for thinking that way, and she said that i wasn't, she said ""I think you're an intelligent, funny, well put together guy"" or something along those lines, and that's probably the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me...

I wanted to ask her right then and there so fucking badly, but i just couldn't. It seemed like she was waiting for me to ask, the entire day, but i was too scared to ruin our friendship if she really just does like me platonically. We've been talking about watching ""Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind"" (a great romantic comedy that i love) together for a few weeks now, and i was thinking of asking her there, but i'm affraid that i'll puss out again. I've also been thinking about just asking during break at school, but i really don't know.

503,"I’ve got a roommate named Kenzie. our driveway is pretty long but it’s only 2 cars wide, and there are 3 people living in my house. She always parks on the left side of the driveway, which I and my other roommate, Hannah, don’t really mind, we just park on the other side of the driveway if it is open or park on the street. My mentality is that since we all pay the same rent, we all have the same right to park in the driveway if it is open. Yesterday Hannah and I went to the grocery store and since we had a lot of stuff I parked in the driveway to unload. Hannah’s car was on the right side so I parked on the left since Kenzie wasn’t there and it was the only driveway spot open. When Kenzie got home about an hour or two later, she parked behind me. She didn’t seem mad or anything when she walked in, so I assumed everything was fine until I went outside to get the mail and saw she parked behind me! I am a person who isn’t a huge fan of conflict so I really try to avoid it but I also won’t stand for being mistreated, so situations like this I have no idea what to do. And Kenzie has had a history of being passive aggressive and territorial sometimes. I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt and so I assumed she’d move it before the day was over, but she didn’t. I could probably maneuver my car so that I could turn into the other part of the driveway behind Hannah so I can get around her, but that is such a hassle and totally not fair, as I know that if I parked behind Kenzie she would be so mad. I know that if I woke her up and asked her to move it, she’s have a fit and would act in other aggressive ways towards me. is there anyway to handle the situation so that I won’t make her really mad but also deliver the message that she can’t act like she’s better than me all the time? for reference, we are all in our early twenties.",22Oct2019,1

He said he was using paper towels and I guess lighting the ends of them to light the bowl. He claims he did it for about a week and now it’s messed him up so bad that he can’t see colors properly. He also is recently claiming he has trouble breathing too. He believes his alcoholism from 2-3 years ago is contributing to this as well. He’s seen many doctors all of which didn’t find anything wrong, had a blood and urine test which all came back healthy. My friend since quitting alcohol goes for very long walks and eats really well. I honestly believe it’s all in his head but he refuses to believe that and gets very angry when you mention it. He also thinks because no one does something stupid like smoking paper towels that there’s “no research into it” and that’s why the doctors don’t see anything wrong.

(You know what happened) but I only did this because he said he’s gonna break up with her and he said he doesn’t love her anymore so I fell for it and yeah.

So then he didn’t even care tbh about what I felt. I felt so guilty not telling his gf so I did, all my friends said I should as well Becuase it was the right thing to do, as she thinks he proper loves her but he cheated on her. His excuse was “Becuase I was mad” 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️ so then he found out I told him and blamed me for his depression and how she’s gonna self harm and stuff, and just blamed me for everything and made it seem like I was the worst person here, when all I did was do the right thing, so he blocked me on insta and Snapchat, and today I saw him and we didn’t talk at all..

515,"I am an Eastern European university student in the Netherlands, my first year. My tuition is 2000 euros (11 000 for non EU citizens, this will be important in a bit), since I'm from an EU country. Life here costs about double what it does back home, since rent is disgustingly high (I cannot study what I am back home), which puts some financial strain on my parents, but nothing life changing though. I cannot start work yet, because studying is way too overwhelming by itself as it is, I will the moment I can afford to. Except from spending wisely, I think I can also save money in one other way. 

There is that one non EU guy who discovered that if he married an EU citizen, his tuition would go down to 2000 euros. So, he's searching preferably for a girl to marry and give some money to from the 9000 euros he would save. Should I marry him if we strike a deal and have him give me a portion of the money he would save from tuition? Of course, if someone (parents) or something gets in the way, I will probably immediately back down on doing such a thing, since I'm pretty sure it is fraud. The idea looks cool, but immensely stupid. Should I try to follow with it? And what are problems you immediately spot with it? Also, I don't care that it can be seen by whoever (the social consequences), except employers, would that potentially be an issue with them, both back home and here?

527,"I know she needs therapy. I know she needs help, but how do I get her the help she needs without her flipping out on me?

She gets suicidal when things don’t go her way. It’s a whole lot of threats, screaming and violence. 

Her thought process is so warped from all of the years of depression, she can’t even think properly. She told me yesterday that eating 100% organic is no good and that to have a balanced diet, I must eat junk food. 

She judges and criticizes everyone in her life. She even judges my baby telling her that she’s too fat and needs to lose weight. SHES ONE. 

If I have a different opinion, I’m automatically against her and I’m wrong and being “disrespectful &amp; talking back.” But i DONT talk back. All I do is respond to her opinions and assumptions with facts and will bring up articles to prove that what I said was correct. She gets furious. I just ended up learn to just stay quiet when she’s spewing her non-sense. She will bring up all of my past mistakes and shoving it in my face when I’m trying to explain it to her that what she said was incorrect. For example: we would go from talking about how she shouldn’t drink 8 espresso shots a day to why I called her a bitch that one time on a Facebook status when I was in middle school. All I said was ”my moms being a bitch right now” and she’s held on to that for years. 

She does this thing where she gets mad at customer service workers for not smiling consistently at her. She has literally called the HR of a Starbucks because the employee didn’t smile while helping her! I can’t go out one day hanging out with her without her speaking foully of someone she JUST MET or the employees that work in the store we were just at. She also spends majority of the conversation talking about how great she is, how beautiful she is vs other women, or how much other guys want her. When I just chose to ignore her and not talk to her, OMG I GET THE NASTIEST TEXT MESSAGES. The nastiest. “You don’t love me! All you do is care for your family. You never visit. You never have time for me. I knew you didn’t love me. I’m going to die. If I don’t hear from you by this Friday, I’m going to go through with it.” Or her favorite line, “I’m going to call cps and tell them you’re abusing your daughter if I don’t hear from you by tonight.” Things like that. 

It’s like even though I’ve moved out, she is still controlling me emotionally like I still live with her. I don’t want her to die, but I don’t want to be apart of this mess anymore. I have called the police on my mom a FEW times when she was throwing her “tantrums” but she plays victim so well that she had the police thinking I’m rebellious teenager that doesn’t want to listen to mommy. She would give her the whole, “I’m a single mom with two kids and work x amount of hours” story to gain sympathy and it works. Yes she was a single parent with two kids, but you know what these two kids were basically single kids. My dad was always out of the country with his new wife while my mom spent all of her hours after work to go gambling. We would not see her for weeks. We never had food at the house. Dinner always consisted of ramen noodles, eggs, and spam. There were times when we had nothing but I can’t believe it’s not butter in the fridge.

I literally can’t tell her to change or anything! I’m not allowed to have opinions of my own when speaking to her. She will get loud, violent, and nasty. I remember telling her that she’s needs to get help or leave me alone because I’m tired of her abuse and constant judgement. she literally lost it. Lost. It. I still remember that day like it was clear as day. She was screaming, throwing the biggest tantrum. It’s like all she heard was “you’re crazy.” It ended up with me having to physically stop her from leaving the house because she literally chugged the bottle of whiskey (I’m talking big gulps) and then tried to drive. ON PURPOSE. All she kept saying the whole time I was trying to stop her was, “it’s my car! Give me my car keys back! Idc idc idc idc idc (covers ears and screams into pillow) idc idc idc. 

And it’s so toxic! I have been dealing with this my whole life. THIS IS NOT EVEN 10% of the shit she does. She will literally take turns getting mad at her family. If she’s not mad at me, she’ll be mad at my brother, if she’s not mad at me or my brother, she’ll be mad at her “boyfriend” THATS A WHOLE NOTHER STORY. I feel bad for the dude. It’s just that whole cycle over and over again and it’s honestly so emotionally draining. It’s like we’re just not good enough for her. She’s always saying how she wished she never had us or she can’t wait until the day she finds a a rich man to satisfy all of her needs.

530,"So 2 of my classmates and I were fooling around and I said a very stupid joke saying ""I hope you live a short life"" after a funny argument (and the argument wasn't a serious one). Then I realized what I just said and I said, ""I don't know why that came out of my mouth"". Then she said, ""you're saying that to someone that just attempted suicide last week"". My eyes widened and I asked her if she was serious and she said she was and I told her I was very sorry and I take it back. I don't think she believes that I mean it knowing she said, ""mhm for sure"". I feel like shit and I don't know if I want to try apologizing again or just forget it and try to be more nice to her. I feel like if I try apologizing again, she will think I'm just trying to suck up to her, but If I do talk to her, what things should I say and shouldn't say?",22Oct2019,2

532,"Ok, how do I even start.


I have a friend whom I have known for many years. We always played basketball together, and we hung out. Then, fast forward a few years, he is a succesful businessman and programmer, and I am a loser without a job. This tips the balance, since now he is more valuable than me or whatever. This inferiority and ""mr bossman"" complex that I have next to him is also topped with his pushy personality where he is your best friend if you always agree with him and do what he says, but if you go against him or say something he doesn't like, then he will pout.



Anyway, I have helped him a few times with some stuff, and he tried to repay me I guess by ""finding"" me a job that I wouldn't let my dog do, that I cunningly got out of without hurting anyones feelings. I since got some additional education, and I will be starting a programming school in december. He, being proficient at programming, thought that it would be a good idea to tutor me in the same exact thing that I will be learning. He gave me some tasks, and told me to complete them, and that I should come to his office every day (which is 10 miles away and I have no car). I appreciate it, but I feel like this would be redundant, and he is also the type of tutor that will answer a yes/no question with a 30 min lecture on totally irrelevant and overly advanced topics that I can only nod at and pretend to understand. He told me that if I do well, he will employ me. That would be all good and dandy, but I like programming as a hobby, and the pressure of having to do everything right is just too much. Double so when the business of someone you know depends on the quality of your work. I don't really like working, and my dream job would be just having no job, and programming as a hobby and making games and open source software for people. And helping my friends and family because helping others makes me happy. 



I pretended to go with it for like a week, but he is so pushy, and wants to ""help"" me all the time. The first day I did the work at home, I accomplished 500% of the usual work because I dond't have to listen to irrelevant monologues, and I could just google my problem. Now he is calling me on the phone to talk about no idea what. Probably to ask me how it's doing. I don't think that he needs me, or gambles on me. I think that I just ended up in one of his obsessive compulsive episodes that made him become so  succesful. 



But I can't handle it. It's annoying.  It's too far. It's too much responsibility. It's like I'm one of those girls that says that I feel suffocated in a relationship and need time away.



What should I do? My plan is to not respond or respond late, and let things cool off if they can. Telling him directly what's up would seem ungrateful or whatever. And if I become a bum or something, then he will tell everyone that he gave me an opportunity, and I wouldn't take it. I can't give him that.",22Oct2019,1

535,"I'm looking for opinions / advice from professionals who work in the field of childcare in some capacity. We just found out that our daycare centre is closing and have scrambled to find an alternative for our child (2 yrs 8 months). Luckily, our very close 2nd choice (to our existing daycare) just so happened to have a spot for our child. We are lucky in that regard, as there are limited options in our area, and the other facilities that have spaces open are distant 10th place choices.

Our child is extremely shy and takes much longer compared to other kids to become comfortable in new settings. Part of this is likely due to the fact my wife was at home with them for 22 months before being able to find a new job. Our child has been at the current daycare for 10 months now; but it's only been in the last 2 months that they stopped crying every morning when we drop them off. We live in a quiet rural area (commute into a small/medium sized city) and the current daycare is a great match: it is small (40-45 kids in total - 6 rooms) and the ECE's are very compassionate. A big plus for us was the fact that the existing daycare centre does NOT have a ""no hugging"" policy. This means that for the last 8 months when we dropped our child off and the tears flowed, someone was able to comfort them. We now have to rip our child out of the daycare that they've finally adjusted to and put them back into an entirely new scenario. New ECEs, new classmates. While the new daycare is great developmentally and facility wise, it is also larger and therefore less intimate (the ECE's at the new daycare seem very professional/pleasant/upbeat, but lack some of the ""emotional quotient"" that led us to our current daycare). Any suggestions on how we can prepare our child for the change, or how we can minimize/manage the shock for them?",22Oct2019,1
537,"I’ve struggled with an on and off ED for years now. And by on and off I mean I go from eating well and exercising to feel good and be healthy, to feeling so incredibly disgusting that I won’t eat any solid foods. I will literally live off of Tim Hortons, water and diet soda, and become completely catatonic if my net calories are more than 500 after exercising. I’m trying to fix this and up until recently I was eating well everyday. But after going from 130 to about 147 after trying to recover completely, I shut down and started restricting again.

I try to stay away from all potential triggers. Because I KNOW that this is wrong. Even if I become extremely underweight like my sick little mind thinks is perfect, I will just gain it all back and an eating disorder is NEVER MAINTAINABLE. There’s one big trigger in my life that even after staying away from all those “ThINsPo” pictures, I can’t seem to escape from.

I have a naturally thin friend, let’s call her Anna. When I say naturally thin, I don’t mean a someone who takes care of her body and eats in a deficit and exercises to keep her figure. I mean someone who literally GORGES themselves everyday and never gains a pound. She is part of a few sports teams and she does exercise slightly. But she eats at LEAST 3-4K calories a day, and stays my height, (5.6) and about 95-100 pounds depending on the week she says.

I don’t have a problem with her being naturally thin of course. She has honestly told me that she thinks my body is absolutely beautiful and she wishes she could fill out more. So she’s probably not doing this on purpose. Of course there are days where I feel extremely jealous and act petty, but so do most women I know. 

The problem lies with her constantly talking about weight and how much she eats around me. At LEAST every two days and most often everyday while she’s talking with all of us she will talk about what she’s eaten that day and the prior night. Most recently she was telling us about how the night before she ate an entire pizza, 2 bags of Doritos, 4 cans of soda, and a homemade poutine. And then proceeded to say that she actually lost weight when she weighed herself that morning. She knows about my issues with food and that sometimes I go literal WEEKS without solid foods. I’ve politely asked her to stop it or at least not do it around me multiple times. But she continues to do it.

I know I’m probably overreacting. But it’s honestly so upsetting to me. I try so hard to eat as little as possible and burn it all off, and she’s eating whatever she wants and not gaining a pound. It’s not her fault she can’t gain weight, but does she really need to talk about her amazing metabolism around someone who has an eating disorder? Despite all this I love her and she’s an amazing person, but I don’t know if I can put up with this. What do I even do in this situation? I really don’t want to lose another friend because I don’t have many left.",22Oct2019,1

539,"My boyfriend and I recently looked into adopting a dog. We both work general opposite shifts, own our own house with a large back yard and had no kids or other pets - we thought we would be a perfect home. Leading up to adopting a rescue we did a lot of research, we spoke to families we knew that adopted, spoke to shelters and did a lot of googling. Finally we found a rescue in our area that had some dogs we were interested in, so we called and booked a visit.

Long story, we ended up finding a dog that we liked. They told us she was three, and was given up for adoption because she had had a litter, and they wanted to keep one of the puppies instead of keeping the mom. It broke my heart, she was so quiet and shy (we were told because she had just been placed, and was scared of her new home). We noticed she had a skin issue, she had dry bloody patches all over her and stunk. The rescue told us that it was because she had just given birth a few months ago and that it should clear up soon (they mentioned that the vet they took her to told them this). Skip forward a few more visits and paperwork and we bring her home. She is generally good, however, they told us she was house and crate trained and over the last two weeks, does not seem to be at all. She destroys our house, uses the bathroom inside if we are not home and we have noticed some small aggressive traits in things she does (but most of the time is very loving towards us). After weeks of begging we finally received her vet history and are... shocked. She was not put up for adoption, she was released to be put down due to a violent history of attacking the other family dog, as well as a few instances of biting humans. Also, her skin condition has been around for years and after an extensive medication trials, they still do not know what it is. Finally, we found out that she is not three years old, but almost six.

Now we do not know what to do. This poor dog who has been mostly loving to us has this dark history. Do we return her? Do we even bother asking for our money back (we saved to get her)? Do we try and work it out with her see if she adapts to her new life? 

I've never owned a dog, and my boyfriend has owned many rescue dogs but never encountered this.

541,"Okay so since the story behind why I cut her off is a long one, I'd recommend you [skim read this first](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ciwai3/my_best_friend_20f_lied_to_my_twin_brother_about/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share). If you don't wanna read all that, here's a TL;DR. In quick summary, I (male) developed feelings for my good friend (female, both 18 at the time) in March last year. I told her this, she didn't like me back, and we were cool with it. We just continued being friends. A couple months later, she started seeing my fraternal twin brother, except he didn't know I liked her. He asked her if I did, because if yes he would've stopped seeing her out of respect for me. She lied to him and told him I didn't have feelings for her. This seriously threw my relationship with my brother out of wack because he felt so guilty about it all for an entire year. Anyways, when my bro found out that she lied a couple months later, he cut her off completely. He finally got the courage to 'own up' to me about it a few months ago now, and at the time I immediately cut her off. We were already starting to drift away anyways but for all she knows, we're at least still friends. It also doesn't help that we still have a lot of mutual friends.

Now this is where it gets tricky. I'm invited to a small Halloween party next week with about 6 others there. The host is a good friend that I've been dying to see for ages, but she's also close friends with my ex-friend and has invited her. I really wanna go but I have no idea how to act towards/around her. I wanna say it's as simple as just not trying to make conversation but I know she'll try and talk to me since there's so little people there. What are people's advice on this? Do I go? Do I ignore her? Do I try pretend like we're still friends? I'm open to any suggestions, thanks in advance!",22Oct2019,1
542,"I think that my best friend and I are falling for each other but I'm not 100% sure and don't know how to proceed. I REALLY need your help and apologize for the long post, but I think the context is necessary.

**So for some background:** I have been BEST friends with this guy since college, so for going on 7 years now. When we initially met, there was an attraction between us (we are 100% each others types), and I was SUPER into him, but he was not interested in pursuing a real relationship and we just hooked up every now and then for a few years (no sex, just making out etc.) I was sad at first that he didn't want me in that way but I honestly got over it and was able to 100% respect his feelings and move forward with zero expectation that our friendship would ever be anything more.

Over the past 7 years, we have grown ridiculously close. He will text me first thing in the morning and we text each other all day long (response times within 10 minutes always unless one of us are in a meeting or something), we just really love being around each other. We have the EXACT SAME value system and political leanings. We have such a free and easy relationship. We can say to one another ""I need attention"" and the other person is on it. Or if we really need to talk, we can immedietly double text the other person to ""RESPOND RN"" and we are both happy to do it. It seems small, but they are just examples that we really feel at ease with each other and there is never any sort of judgement in our friendship, we say what we need and the other person is always willing to provide it. We are both very introverted, but not at all around each other and we make exceptions for each other that we don't for anyone else. For example: he's SUUUPER into gaming. Like RIDICULOUSLY so. He leaves work to play immediately everyday for hours. However, I just recently realized that he never takes more than a couple of minutes to text me back, which means that he constantly pauses or ignores his gaming just so that he can respond as soon as I text him. He has NEVER said to me ""can we talk later, I'm gaming."" Come to think of it, he has NEVER said that he needs to do anything else when I want to talk to him.

I can tell him anything and when we are together, its non-stop laughing and fun on top of our sexual attraction to one another, which we freely talk about. We joke around, make fun of each other, play fight, and we just GET each other, if you know what I mean. He tells me all the time that I'm his best friend in the world and he is definitely mine. I mean this guy has been through hell and back with me and has always wanted to be by my side, and I've done the same for him. Most friends would grow apart in some ways over a 7 year span (as things in your life change, and especially in the college to adulthood transition) but we have ONLY grown more compatible as friends and more attracted to each other.

**So 5 months ago:** I moved back to the city in which we attended college (he never left after college, it's a major city) and asked him out on a date, not looking for something serious. I had just gotten out of a long-term relationship and hadn't seen my friend for a couple of years (went to grad school in a far away city.) Honestly it probably wasn't the smartest thing to do, but after that relationship, I felt a bit of my feelings for my best friend coming back. He told me he'd be happy going on a casual date but wasn't looking for a serious relationship. No hard feelings at all from this, he actually hasn't dated in years. So we ultimately decide to just keep hanging out as friends, flirting, and things go smoothly, as they always do with him. I actually lost feelings for him entirely, to the point where I was excited to help him edit his dating app profile a few weeks later. About 6 weeks after that, I got into a relationship with another guy. My boyfriend was really awesome and fun, and he is an amazing human being. My bestfriend was really excited to meet my then boyfriend because ""he is really important to you."" My boyfriend and I got along well but after a few months, decided we weren't headed down the same life paths. My best friend helped me through all of this and even encouraged me to try and patch things up with my ex.

**Which brings us to now:** I cried out the loss of my ex for a couple of days, but overall moved on quickly. I mentioned maybe going on dates with a guy that I knew and generally started talking about guys as I was trying to move on. But I noticed his response was different now, before he never cared if I talked about men. This time, I could tell it was making him upset, so I stopped. About a week ago, I was dealing with those feelings of anger towards my ex, you know, just part of the normal grieving process. So I called my best friend. He picked up immediately and we proceeded to talk on the phone for 5 hours, until 3am on a weekday. He let me talk exclusively for the first two hours, just venting everything that I was feeling and supporting me more than anyone ever has.

For the next three hours we just laughed and flirted. He was telling me how he has all of the pictures I have sent him saved in his ""favorites"" folder, he has my picture as his lock screen, has my contact saved as ""bby"" etc. I was laughing at one of the pictures I had sent but he just wanted to talk about ""how cute my ear is"" or ""how adorable I looked"" when I made a certain expression. These seemed like distinctly different compliments from what he normally will say (things like, ""you're cute"", or ""you look good"") what he was saying felt more intimate. When we decided to go to bed, we said goodbyes and he quickly ended the call by saying ""love you...,"" and I said the same. We have never said that to each other before and he certainly was never the type to express those kinds of feelings (he's not the emotional or mushy type in ANY way). After we hung up, he texted me immediately saying how he wanted to kiss my forehead and cuddle me all night.

**So since then:** We have been flirting hardcore. Yeah, we have always explicitly flirted, but this is...just different. Before, our relationship was entirely platonic (calling each other dude/bro etc) except for the flirtation which was always strictly sexual, not romantic in any way). Suddenly, he is saying how ""he just can't wait to see me,"" he wants to do all of the things he knows I like to do, even things I know he doesn't like. He does not tolerate any of my normal self-depreciation (it's like he gets offended now when I say that I'm ugly or dumb, which I always do jokingly). He's letting me in on his gaming activities and his super close knit relationship with his cousins and other family members. He wants to spend a lot of time with me and wants to give me his favorite hoodie.

Last time I saw him, a couple of days ago, he brought me really considerate gifts that show he listens to and remembers even small things I said in passing months ago. We were hanging out at his place and I caught him staring at me a lot and he kept giving me kisses out of nowhere. It was all so sweet. I'm not sure however, that it felt ""romantic,"" at least not in the ""let me stare into your eyes forever and just the thought of you brings me to tears"" sort of movie romance. Perhaps it's just because we have already been so close for so long? We were basically your typical ""bros"" before. I do, however, remember leaving and simply thinking ""wow....I really am in love with him.""

Anyways, since I saw him 2 days ago, it's calmed down a bit, but he'll still do things like call me princess and tell me that I'm cute. I've talked to 4 of my closest friends (guys and girls - all of whom have known me for 10+ years and have seen the evolution of my relationship with my best friend) and even the one's who were warning me that he didn't want a relationship with me all those years ago and telling me to give up, are now saying that they 100% think he's into me and wants me long-term. They said it's simply obvious. He's in a different time zone for work rn and constantly around his boss so we are texting a bit less, which is giving me more time to think about all of this. So of course, I am turning to Reddit for help....

TLDR; I think that my best friend (M26) and I (F24) might be falling for one another... but because I've asked him out before and have been turned down, I'm not sure that I trust myself to see what is going on clearly and I'm not sure how I should proceed.",22Oct2019,1

547,"Good day Reddit. I first of all apologize for not giving this a great title or know of a way to title this. I would like to hear some outside perspective on somethings. So yesterday, my girlfriend (24) and I (25) had a real serious conversation. We have been going out for 2 years, we rent out a small townhouse apartment, have a dog and a cat. However not once has this conversation came up, she asked me a couple difficult questions that I couldn’t answer well or at all. Such as “why do I love her” and “am I with her for a safety thing”. Now I feel ashamed I wasn’t able to come up with good answers for the first one. I was able to say that she is a very motherly like person, a wonderful person to come home to, and is able to share interests with me. She also helps me explore new things like having a dog which took a lot of convincing for me to do, or to travel to different states. Now the second point is tricky. She thinks that I’m just “settling” and that I could find someone better. This is where my conflict comes in, part of me thinks that maybe there is someone better. However, part of me doesn’t want to take the chance and simply enjoy the life that I have now. That I should enjoy my life with her. Another issue is that I would see myself as a failure, and only giving up someone I enjoyed spending time to find almost the exact same thing. The only difference is that there’s probably going to be a couple things I don’t like this new person doing. She also made the realization that I don’t want to talk to her about her mother who passed away a couple years ago, or her abusive first ex. I admitted that  it makes me uncomfortable and I feel like I would only make the situation worse. However, maybe that’s not important and I should just listen. The good news is that I’ve made some realizations yesterday and even today. That I’m not going to worry about her friends and family opinions on this matter. Sure they are great people and I love spending time with them. However I wouldn’t be upset if the worst happened and they ended up hating me. Another one is that even if I am settling, then I would be okay with spending my life with her. I’m going to keep working hard and continue to think of reasons why I love her. I guess I’m asking if anyone has any bit of advice they would be willing to give. I know this is stupid and I basically revealed my faults but corrected them (or at least tried to). I won’t make critical decisions and any I do make won’t be based on the dog, or her. It will be based on how I feel.

I am an introvert, does not speak much. My performance is okay, however I have little trouble showing up my skills. Though I am hard worker. Whenever I see my CEO. 

1. He says hi/hello to my colleagues and does not notice me with deliberation.
2. I greet him most of the times, he just responds passively.

Off-late this has led me think, he might not like me being there. Should I leave this job and move on? I am feeling down after these repeated incidents. 

What should I do now? Should I neglect it or do something about it? Please advice folks. Thanks a lot.",22Oct2019,2
555,"I have been seriously considering suicide for awhile now. I have been suicidal since I was a kid and now I am considering doing myself in. I have it planned out somewhat well and I even written a letter detailing why I’m making the decision to end my life, but I don’t feel like it will mean much because I’ll die, have a funeral, and that’s it. Suicide itself doesn’t get solved this way. I want people like me, particularly young men, to stop this cycle of sorrow but I don’t see a way out. I don’t think people are ready to have this conversation and I also don’t think our society/economy is structured in a way that can make meaningful steps against suicide. I just don’t think it’s in our socio economic framework. 

What can I do to make my death more meaningful to draw attention to this issue? I’ll post my suicide note below to articulate specifically what I’m hoping to accomplish with my own death. 


Here it is: 

When I was a small child I had thought that the universe solely existed as a torture dungeon specifically designed to cause universal suffering. I thought that I existed solely for pain. This plagued me up until about 3 years ago, or maybe even 2. Perhaps even 1. It’s hard to say because my mind has gradually changed over time since I’ve made significant lifestyle changes, something I’ve had to do probably 3 times with much more to come. 

There was always this feint feeling of hope inside of me, the hope and the desire to change and seek out the life I want to live to become the best version of myself. I had a small hope that reality was actually something inherently good. I’ve actually worked on a theory and formula for proving the positive existence of reality but I’ve hit a pretty big snag this time around. I’ve had smaller psychological breaks before but this one might be the one that does me in. 

Perhaps depression is a self destruct mechanism for genetically dead ends. Perhaps if someone is born without their emotional needs met from a young age, and perhaps if they were never taught the tools on how to form relationships with other human beings, they enter in a self destruct mode (depression) and eventually kill themselves to allow up resources and social-emotional bandwidth to other better off people, or perhaps people inherently stronger than them, like a form of natural selection built right into our DNA. 

Perhaps depression and suicide isn’t abnormal, perhaps the very fact people like me were born is abnormal and depression is the breakdown of our psyche until eventual course correction (suicide). 

To put it another way, the very fact that someone is depressed is natural and their death is assured via psychological natural selection. Perhaps this process is supposed to happen to people like me. I’m the error. 

I have struggled with depression since I can remember. Probably elementary school or even preschool. I was very alone through my entire life. In preschool id hit kids because they wouldn’t hang out with me, and they wouldn’t hang out with me because I hit them. I can feel the echoes of this well into adulthood. Maybe this is why I’m still lonely, maybe this is why I am unloved. Perhaps I was never to exist in the first place and suicide is just course correction for my bloodline; perhaps I am to stop here. I hope I’ve explained this well enough but it might be a bit esoteric. Basically, if you’re suicidal, you’re supposed to die. There isn’t a struggle with depression because you’re supposed to succumb to depression and die. Trying to live is what’s abnormal. 

Every time I see a large group of friends, usually on social media living the lives that I want to live, or a happy couple enamored in romance, I’m hit with intense, unending jealousy. I always wanted to be loved... I always wanted to be apart of a bigger whole so I could never be alone again. Since I was in middle school I always dreamt of having a wife and kids, nothing makes me happier than thinking about a married life.... something so simple as grocery shopping with my wife or playing with my kids on a beach seems paradisal to me. It’s the highest pleasure that I can think of. But it isn’t meant for me. That kind of happiness was never to be mine. Given my depressive state, I’m not fit to be a parent even if I was graced with such a miracle. 


I had fought this my entire life of 27 years, and maybe it’s a sign from the universe telling me to bow out. This is my self destruct mechanism. It certainly seems like it, why else was I born this way? I never consented to existence anyways. It’s just a prison of isolation.

The ups of life are just a ploy in an effort to cause maximum despair. I’m only allowed to have positive life experiences so that the next negative experience can crush me even harder than the last. It’s a process of entropy to completely crush my soul. 

There’s no shortage of young men who feel just as I do. If you’re wondering why all these school shootings happen, look to this African proverb: 

“It takes a village to raise a child. And if the village rejects the child, the child will burn down the village to feel its warmth”. 

It’s no secret, it’s plain as day. Young men do these things because we feel isolated and unloved, and uncared for. The isolation gives way depression and jealousy. Jealously gives way to to anger, and anger to hatred,  not of other people (technically), but at the structure of reality. These mass shootings are like a twisted way of showing God how awful they feel inside, it’s an expression of dread more than anything. 

I’m not like that though, I don’t hate people. I love humans more than anything, that’s why I hate being at home all the time. I want to be surrounded by lots of people all the time. I want to be one of them. I want to be a human too. A human that can enjoy life, can enjoy compassion and love, that can enjoy acceptance into reality. Instead, I feel as if I was cast from heaven straight into hell. The love of the universe was never something I could have, it existed to torment me. 

My depression was a sign from God, a sign that I was never to exist in the first place. 

I’ve written more about this in the past and maybe I didn’t get everything out. But I feel so cold and alone, loveless, weak, and in pain. I’m tired of the sorrow and the dread. I am tired of fighting for my life. I’m tired of working meaningless jobs with shit benefits. I quit my job and am currently in community college to transfer to a university. I can’t help but feel like I’ve made a huge mistake by chasing my dreams. I can’t get a full time job, I’ve sent out apps for part time jobs with no reply, so I’m broke. I have no money. I’m couch surfing and have a weeks worth of oatmeal for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. And I have no healthcare because it’s too expensive and isn’t offered to part timers. I’m tired of living like this. 

That’s why I want to end it. I’m the genetic error, I’m the thing that wasn’t supposed to exist. That’s no ones burden but my own. 

So I will bow out. I feel like I should say thanks to everyone who’s helped me come this far, but I don’t even know if any of it was real or not. Maybe this is all one grand illusion. Maybe my life is just one long nightmare. 

I’m sorry if my death causes you pain. But please understand that there isn’t any other way. It’s time for me to say goodbye. 

Thank you. 



Hopefully that letter highlights what I’m going through and what I’m hoping to accomplish. If anyone has any advice as to what I can include in my letter I’m all ears. I want to do something right for once, and I don’t want any more people to suffer like I am.",22Oct2019,2
556,"So I've been in a new work placement for 2 weeks and I'm really impressed by the level of support given to me so far.

My manger and the service manager is always willing to get me involved in things such as meetings, talks and other events. 

However, when it comes to the work my service manager has asked me on three occasions for my comments on high level documents which are not in my field of study. I currently work in Public Health and studied psychology but my main project is on air pollution and climate change.

Despite this not being my area of expertise I have been doing research at home and have signed up to multiple online courses to learn the fundamentals. 

My service manager knows its not my speciality but on three occasions he has emailed me important documents and asked for me to 'make comments'. Am I overthinking this or being stupid, or should I be able to make comments on these documents which will be published?

Is he testing my ability to adapt or am I just dumb? Everytime he's asked me for comments I've tried my hardest to add valuable comments and have research other organisation documents which are similar but there's not much I can add. I really want to work in this area after my placement but at the moment I feel like I'm letting myself down.

Wtf should I do?

TLDR:

I'm being asked to comment on high level work I don't know much about by the service manager. He knows it's not my speciality but continutes to ask me anyway. Wtf should I do without messing up a chance of being employed full time?",22Oct2019,3

563,"
So the Saturday of the weekend before last, as in about 1.5 weeks ago, I (29F) spent the night at my boyfriend's (42M) apartment.  Of course I was sleeping in his bed, he took his usual side and I slept on the other side.  It was dark in the room but when I got into bed I took off all my jewelry and set it on the nightstand on my side.  


When I woke up in the morning, he got up first and showered and went into the kitchen to make me coffee.  While he was making my coffee I started getting up, got dressed, and went to grab my jewelry... it was light in the room now so when I went to grab my jewelry, I saw right under all my stuff, a girls hair bow that didn't belong to me.  Right in the same exact place I had taken off and set my jewelry the night before. As if another girl had done the exact same thing before me with her hair bow.


I grabbed the bow and walked into the kitchen and held it up, and said, ""What's this???""  He immediately responded with ""Isn't that yours?? I found it under the bed and I thought it was yours.""  I said no it's not and also I don't wear cheesy shit like this, and I threw it down on the table.  Then of course he was saying everything, such as he swears there's been no girls at his place in a long long long time, it probably belonged to his ex wife and got stuck in his stuff and fell out while he was unpacking (he did recently move into his apartment a couple months ago), he still finds his ex wife's stuff stuck in his things all the time, if he was trying to hide it why would it be right out on the table, etc etc. 


I was not buying it and he kept kissing me and hugging me saying I should believe him etc.  Eventually I just went and sat down at the table and drank my coffee with him, and acted like nothing was up, and then left.  Since then he has only reached out to me 2 times, both times I gave him very cold responses so I'm sure he knows I'm mad and is avoiding me.  I have a feeling he'll be up my ass soon though, and I don't know how I should respond.


We have had the talk and agreement that we are not sleeping with other people, especially because we are having unprotected sex.  So if he was with someone else, not only is it a heart break, but it was not fair and totally disgusting to disrespect me and put my health at risk like that.  I feel very hurt and also upset because we have been friends for years before we ever started hooking up, and I don't want to believe that he would lie to me and do something like that.


I don't know what I should do.  This seems like a pretty obvious scenario- I don't want to be an idiot and ignore what happened and try to make everything ok in my head.  But I'm wondering should I give him a chance and believe him since this is the first time anything like this has happened, and because he's been my friend for years before this?  Should I give him the benefit of the doubt this one time and trust him because he has earned some of my trust over the years?  Maybe this was just an unfortunate mistake and he's telling the truth.... he did just move into his apartment a couple months ago so it's possible some things are a mess, and he was married before so it's possible that some of his ex wife's stuff was mixed in... but I don't know.  I don't want to be a fool.  The fact that the hair bow was on the opposite nightstand of his usual side of the bed, right in the exact spot I took my stuff off, is just flashing red lights to me. 


I don't know how to talk to him about this all or what I should do the next time I see him or talk to him.  I really need some other opinions and advice.  Thanks all.

TL/DR: I found something that belongs to another girl in my boyfriend's apartment, he said he found it and it probably belonged to his ex wife but I don't know if I should believe it.",22Oct2019,1
564,"So I'm going to try to keep this as short as I can but I bet that this is going to be a large post as I think a lot of these 'small' details are important for the full story.

About four months ago I met two new people in my friend group. Let's call them girl A and girl B. Girl A had just become the girlfriend of a good friend of mine. When I met girl A, the same time I started getting a crush on girl B. These girls were best friends (as I've been told since a few months/weeks). Anyway, after two and a half weeks girl A got dumped and got single again. This was around the same time that I asked out girl B and she said yes. So one night I got into a text conversation with girl A and we just started talking about her breakup and my soon-to-be date. A friendship grew.

Eventually, I and girl B stopped dating and continued as friends. I would vent about my feelings about this to friend A and we became really good friends over the summer break. This was because I was on vacation and wasn't with friends so I wanted to text a lot with my friends back home and she because she didn't really have a lot to do. In the course of two weeks, we had sent over 14.000 texts to each other, talking about literally anything and everything.

But as I got back from vacation, I was surrounded by most of my friends again and I didn't feel the need to text every day and so much with girl A. She didn't like this as it turned out she had developed a crush on me too. 

But at the same time, girl B wanted to date with me again and I said yes. This is where the drama started. I hadn't told girl A about this because I didn't want to tell a lot of people. But a few days after the conversation with girl B about starting to date again, I was gonna sleep over at girl A's house. There I eventually made the terrible and huge mistake to start kissing and we spent the night making out.   


This was all my fault and I'd taken all responsibility for it and thus I told girl B about it and explained the situation to girl A. What followed would be drama that would take months. 

Since both girls liked me, they became less good friends and eventually became two people who hang around in the same group of friends. Girl B had given me another chance for which I would ever be grateful but I took the decision to halt talking to girl A because I didn't trust myself. In this time I told the girl that I didn't want to talk to her. She spent nights writings letters of stuff that she wanted to say to me and tell me. Big things about her feelings and just things about her day. 

But we started growing out of each other. She had always projected herself as a sad, maybe even a depressed person but I started getting annoyed by it because she really victimized herself while taking no action at all to better her life. Even though we all talked to her about this and gave advice.

We eventually got better friends again but I told her that I didn't want to talk about feelings and such as it would annoy me and make things bad. But she kept victimizing herself, didn't stop and yes I exploded. We got into fights and I said some horrible things. We tried afterwards to keep being friends but eventually, I came to the conclusion that it would be better if we didn't. I told her this many times but she just couldn't deal with it. She just kept hanging on the friendship that we had during the summer break. She would constantly swing from mood and act impulsively. She would delete and later on add me on SnapChat and stuff like that. At the one moment, she said she didn't want to see me and five minutes later she wanted to stay friends. I had to deal with this for weeks and eventually it really just got too much.

We tried everything to stop the drama but talking about it wouldn't work and I told her to just let it go and stop texting me. But she wouldn't stop. Over the weekend she has sent me over sixty texts (of which 50% being long paragraphs). Because talking about it had never worked in the past and only resulted in more problems, I decided to ignore the messages.  I opened the messages but wouldn't read most of them. In some of those texts so told me she hoped I would die and wished horrible things upon me and a few minutes later she told me that I was a great person. She sent links of sites that said ignoring someone is mentally torturing someone.

Eventually today she sent me some texts again (this was the third day of ignoring her). She said that she had almost killed herself the day before because of how things are between us. She claimed that she tried to kill herself before. She also claimed to be depressed but my friends and I know her, we know her problems and are convinced she isn't depressed. Her psychiatrist says she isn't depressed. But if she truly were depressed and tried to kill herself, she would be the third in our group who would've tried to kill themselves. One of those already succeeded.

Now my problem is that I don't know what to do. I have tried talking to her before but nothing came out of it. I have tried ignoring her but now she claims to be suicidal. I feel like she's manipulative and victimizes herself a lot because she is addicted to getting attention. I don't want someone's coffin on my conscience but I don't want to keep going on with this drama. I suggested talking to her parents but my friends are convinced that won't help. All I know is that I don't need this on my conscience. 

She has been emotionally draining to me and found ways to piss me off as no one has before. I don't believe she is mentally crazy but I am convinced that her thought process isn't right. 

I'm not asking to be judged by previous actions taken by me or to be asked what's wrong with me. I just need help with this dramatically difficult situation.",22Oct2019,1

573,"My company went through an acquisition back in 2016 and acquired a small medical business in another state. This small branch sat for 2.5 years with no integration into the corporation and just this year they wanted to start enforcing/building the relationship with this remote office. There are a couple of issues that go hand-in-hand with this reintroduction to the business and they include: employee behavior issues, the operations manager exiting the company, and the only leader in the office is a BRAND new supervisor with no prior leadership experience. 

They put me in charge of this office from nearly 2k miles away and have put me in a position to learn all of the operations of the small business, manage these employees, learn their proprietary system, boost morale, do it with minimal staff, and limited resources, in the next six months. 

The employees are constantly expressing that they're overwhelmed and frustrated, but my sympathy has a short leash. My local employees can run circles around them and I'm honestly shocked that they feel stressed in their roles. The reality of their positions is that of an entry level employee, making inbound/outbound calls, with limited account management, and MAYBE some small accounting responsibilities. That's it.

He is very close with another coworker (let's say coworker B), they often drink together at his place and I see them and greet them from time to time. We get along well enough, or so I thought..

Well, a couple of years ago, coworker B was very drunk and wandered into my house. My front door was unlocked and I hear someone calling my name from downstairs. I come down to see him standing in my living room. He asks me if I'm the only one home, and mumbles some other garbage I forget about. I freak out and tell him to get the fuck out of my home, and never to enter without permission again. He drunkenly apologizes and leaves. The net day I confront him and he once again apologizes for his behavior. He said he was drunk and dealing with some things. Okay, then why come into MY house for no reason? And why ask if I'm alone?

I will say that, since I was hired several years ago, he seemed to make a lot of sarcastic jokes about how I was much younger than him, but in a higher position and being paid more. Now it seems they weren't so sarcastic, and not so much jokes.. it seems he legitimately feels cheated by my success, which is ridiculous because I work in an entirely different department. It's been years since the incident though and we seem to get along okay since then. I see him pretty often still as he continues to hang out and drink with coworker A. 

Well fast forward to last week. With the nature of my position, I must be told of employee terminations. It seems coworker B is upset that he didn't get a promotion and instead our company hired a new manager above him. Hes continuously insubordinate towards his new supervisor and so that supervisor suggested finding a replacement, which is now in motion. HR confronts me about this and make mes aware of his termination, and asks if I have any personal experience with him. I, being an idiot, told HR about what had happened at my house, but I assured them that we handled it and it's in the past. HR told me they are aware that he could become disgruntled, and specifically mentioned that he 'owns guns'. HR said they'd have a meeting with coworker B's supervisor to discuss how to handle this.  


Well, that got my anxiety spinning. And I followed up with HR today to discuss how their meeting went. She said they plan to terminate him. I told her that I hope nothing I said influenced their decision, they assured me it did not. However, they did say that my story came up during their discussion, which really bothered me. Now the supervisor knows of this incident that I told HR in private. Now there's a chance that it could find it's way back to coworker B, and he could easily take it as being part of the reason he was terminated. Now I'm at risk. He knows where I live, and has friends where I live.  


I'm a bit of an overthinker, so I'm hoping it's just all in my head, but my anxiety is through the roof. Any suggestions on how to handle this? If there's any candidate for a violent disgruntled employee, coworker B would be it. And HR may have 'accidentally' outed me as a cause for termination and he may or may not hear it from his supervisor who could try to cover his own ass. I'm legit afraid he'll take his aggression out on me and possibly others, but I could be reading too much into this. Just looking for some opinions to keep my thoughts grounded here. Thank you.  


tl;dr coworker about to be fired, has a history of weird aggressive drunken behavior including entering my home unannounced. My find out that reason fro termination is related to me and I'm worried he'll do something violent after finding out he lost his job.",22Oct2019,9

However, I’m thinking about leaving the sport because my heart isn’t in it, and I don’t enjoy myself. I can take the workouts, that’s fine, I can put up with working hard to get better, I do that and have noticed improvement in my strength, but every single day I dread going to practice. 

The team and coaches are amazing, but then I dread it so much that it’s the only thing I can think about all day. I don’t want to go to school because of it, and I don’t want to go home because then I know that practice at 4 am the next morning will come even faster. It’s not even that difficult for me during practice. 

I really don’t want to let down my coach since she was so excited that I joined (she knew my brother’s, who really left an impact) and I don’t want to let down my friend who convinced me to join, especially because she is my brother’s girlfriend, and she’s been telling him that I’ve been lazy since I haven’t been able to come to practices (which is not true, I’m also in another sport, but this season is almost over, Polo season starting Thursday).

Also, the polo suit itself was 80 bucks and my dad wasn’t too happy about having to pay that much for a swim suit.

581,"I have been talking to this guy for about 3 months. We met on a dating app. We finally met up and hooked up about 2 days ago. The date was fun, the sex was good. It was a great time. He told me he was interested in me and wanted to see where our relationship took us and then texted me later on that night and said he couldn’t wait to talk to me later on and that he had a great time. 

This dude is so perfect to me but he has a lot of baggage. As in, a jealous ex wife and kids. For most it’s not, but we are both in our early 20s and dating a guy with a family was never something I ever considered. She apparently blew up on him because she found out that he was with me. He’s also dedicated to his work and it makes communicating a challenge. 

Anyway, the last time I heard from him was when he texted me saying he made it home and that he couldn’t wait to see me again. That was going on 3 days. I’ve texted, I’ve snapped, I’ve tried calling. Nothing. I am so confused. It’s literally depressing me. I just lay in bed and constantly check my phone to see if I got any responses. He hasn’t blocked me but he just hasn’t opened anything I send. 

I don’t know if he just is going through some personal stuff with his ex, or if work has been challenging or if he just decided the next morning that I’m not what he’s looking for. I just need some closure, bc this shit is killing me.

but i've always been drawing and voice acting(both self taught) basically half my life. i really like anime and other weaboo stuff like that, because you know. they're just so cool. good voice acting and good art can move you. make you happy. and i really like when i do cool voices and make my friends laugh and stuff. i've been thinking about moving to japan after high school and going to a 2-year vocational school for voice acting so i can try going pro.

but problem is!! i probably won't be able to graduate high school right now, which is so stupid and horrible because i'm in my senior year. i've wasted 3+ years at this horrible school doing so much work. and now i won't be able to graduate within the school year (probably) because i'm so anxious to go to class. and i definitely can't afford to start trying somewhat now so i can graduate as a supersenior or whatever. i really hate living here and i've been counting down the years until high school graduation for who knows how long so i can run from this hellhole lmao

i know there are some places though that let you enroll even as a middle school graduate, but i don't know what all these schools do for international students and if they give scholarships and stuff(my family is pretty horrible and we're in debt because of stupid incapable people haha!)

i think what i need to do at the moment is obviously?? brush up on my stale japanese skills and take the jlpt tests for n1 and save up as much money as i possibly can. and stop being stupid


((yeah i know all this honestly?? might sound so stupid!! i know!! like actually becoming a pro voice actor is really difficult, i know, but i really want to do it. i've just been in such a bad place mentally since like. kindergarten. and i really just want to pursue something that'd make me genuinely enjoy living. i hope you won't try to lecture me on how foolish my idea is or whatever. thank you.))

Over the past year, I have been really motivated to do well in my studies and it has reap me several school awards(Eg: Top in Subject...).

Here lies our problem. Our son is now crawling and beginning to pull up on things. We are careful to make sure he doesn't bother the dogs, however, it is literally impossible to watch a tiny human 24/7. Our female dog usually doesn't like for other animals to get in her space and we've watched her closely with our son. Yesterday she was laying at my feet and our son came along to pull up on the couch near me. He got close to her so she turned on him and growled. This is not the first time. She's never made contact with him, but I'm afraid she's guarding her place near me. I cannot let my son be hurt, but I dearly love this dog also.

It's not the first time I've done this, but I told him I was breaking up with him because I couldn't deal with the distance anymore. Every atom in my being wanted him to say something like, ""Wait, I'm sorry, maybe I can make some time for you."" Or something like that. 

But i didn't actually mean it. I know it's such an asshole move but I got so tired of him, every time I even tried to make plans with him to visit, he would say he was too busy. All that told me was that he didn't love me as much as I love him, and that I simply wasn't worth him taking a few days off work, or even just chilling at his place at night and cuddling. 

Now he won't respond to my text and I feel like such an asshole and also like maybe he's never actually loved me at all. I told him I was sorry, that I was an asshole, and I feel like I've ruined things between us for good but of course he didn't respond. Idk.

He was so distraught and angry, understandably so, and we decided to go to my parents farm while the were on vacation to deal with it all.

 I was a mess, still am to be honest. I didn't want talk about what happened, how it happend etc, I couldn't sleep, I could barely eat. And all he would do was talking about what happend. After 4 days of him making me talk about it, I snapped and just said he needed to go and that I couldn't handle him not being able to respect my wish to not talk about it. I am so fucking broken and it felt like every new detail I had to tell him was breaking me more. So I broke up with him..

He didn't take it well, first he went to the kitchen and took the biggest knife and walked out. I was shouting and crying begging him to stop. I called two of our closest friends pleading for them to come get my SO away from me. After my SO realized I wasn't running after him, he came back but without the knife. I was so scared I didn't know what to do. After the friends came one took my SO outside to talk with him and the other one tried to calm me down. I explained everything that had happend and she was honestly the best. After awhile my SO came running up the stairs to the bathroom and locked the door. Then we heard a loud sound outside the house and I lost it. I thought he jumped. I was screaming and crying and our friends almost broke down the door trying to get to him. He had swung half his body outside the window trying to jump but changed his mind. After it all went down and everyone calmed down the three of them went home and I didn't know what to do.

I sent some messages to my SO asking what was going on and he just said ""why would you care?! You are just partying anyways so why would I tell you?"". I was trying to drown myself in the fucking pool and threw myself down the stairs, I'm a fucking wreck, I don't know how to deal with everything. And one of my so called best friend basically stopped taking to me to comfort my SO. And he told her all these lies about how I never liked her and what not. She didnt even bother to ask me about it.

Instead, I *think* she realized and thought that was hella weird. I believe this because she started like glaring at me whenever I walked by her. Then I intended to talk to her and if she said anything I'd apologize, but I'm absolutely terrified! I haven't talked to her for almost 2 months and I'm pretty sure she like hates me. Now whenever I walk past her she glares at me so I just look down and the opposite way. Sometimes I'll accidentally make eye contact with her and I feel absolutely terrified and feel dizzy; like I'm gonna pass out. I also have a class with her every Thursday, and the whole time I'll be shaking and can't think straight even though she is like 20 ft away. I feel really bad and like this shows I'm socially inadequate. How can I stop being afraid of people?",22Oct2019,1

I currently have a job at Kohl’s that will hopefully allow me to transfer locations. I am willing to move into the cheapest apartment I can move to (around 350-500 according to Zillow).

The worry I am facing is how to exactly set things up. Do I sign a lease for an apartment first or secure a job first? How do I get an apartment first if they require me making 2x the amount without securing a job first? All advice is appreciated.",22Oct2019,1

615,"Hey everyone,

I've started a job in June this year and as a coordinator, I have to work with different brands (two of them for now, it's not a giant business). I'm in the marketing department and each brand has two people working for them in that department, the brand manager and the graphic designer.

And since not long ago, I've been having issues with a coworker for one of those brands, the graphic designer specifically. She's been making hostile comments about my work to me directly -- for example today, as we were discussing the planning of our social media posts, she said outright ""I've told you already I need a calendar planned with deadlines, I've told you like five times, if I have to explain again I won't be so nice next time"". You can imagine the tone yourself. Not only is she taking me for a child, she seems to think she can unilaterally decide how we should approach the planning -- which should be approved by the brand manager anyway, who seems content in remaining silent and letting her go off and do her own thing.

It's not the first time this happened, and I've started notifying my supervisor this week any time she makes such a comment so that they're documented.

I called my supervisor today to report this comment in fact, and he suggested a few things we could do. He can contact her directly (they don't know each other very much, they worked together for a few months when she started but he's not located on our site), we can contact the brand manager who's also her supervisor (not sure about this, it seems to me she would take her side) who can then talk to her, go directly to their supervisor the brand CEO (who everyone think is incompetent and you can't trust him) and I said if I had to I would call the COO directly, who also doubles as the HR manager as it's a smallish operation. Though he's not qualified to be HR.

The problem from my end is also that if we have a discussion with other people present, I don't want to misrepresent myself and make the situation worse -- for me specifically. I started in June and that's why I'm not sure about involving directors (including the brand CEO).

What do you think I should do moving forward? My goal is that we can have a work relationship, basically we don't have to like each other, but we have to work together in some capacity. So while I don't particularly wish her bad, I won't tolerate any more hostility and all I ask for is that we can get work done for the brand in question when I need to consult her.",22Oct2019,1

I was done with her bullshit so I was going to leave and she grabbed me by the shoulder and slapped me. I pushed her to the ground and she grabbed a knife. Then I got a bat (fuck baseball) and hit her in the legs. As she was down I kicked her ribcage and left.

618,"So my dad actually bought a land to build a house a few years ago and it's quite big. His sister and her husband, wants to build one next to us, on his land but they initially asked their other sibling (who declined) so they came to us. 

I hated the idea. It was our own private space. There was enough space to play basketball and badminton with the whole family. I dislike her husband too. Her husband smokes. Hardly works at all, depends on his wife. I feel really uncomfortable around him. My dad felt sorry for his sister, so he agreed. She was the one who asked my dad, persuading him, her husband (probably whispering behind her ears) WE hated the idea. 

They wanted to build a house beside us and so they did, it was smaller than ours, but took up the space we wanted to play or exercise. I hate it. We NEVER open the window because if we did, we could hear or see them so it's really frustrating. And being someone who's an introvert, I really want to sometimes just walk around, breathe in the air and sing loudly but unable to do so. 

They're not in a unstable financial position, because if they are, they wouldn't have build a  house beside us. His wife gives classes for around USD30 each person.  You might think it's a small amount since I changed to USD but it's actually a HUGE amount in our country.

Oh yeah, did I forgot to mention that his ""things"" are still inside our house. His child toys, dumbbells, everything is in the room we wanted to make into a laundry room. We pestered our dad to tell him but he kept us from telling them since we are ""neighbours"".

So here comes the fun part. 

My dad agreed to let them ""rent"" the land for around USD146 and the funny thing is, they wanted to lower down the rent but my dad said a promise is a promise. I was pissed but whatever.

We ARE not rich. It's really frustrating because I don't know what to do. We are still struggling to pay the loans for the house and other necessities. If we are, I wouldn't be here complaining. 

 I feel as the husband is trying to use my aunt as like his shield or something because my dad will always help his siblings. 

And just now I  heard from my mom that they actually only paid USD73 for rent. I asked why? She told me that dad told her it was because they paid for electricity. I was confused. Why is the electricity counted in the rent? It's suppose to be separated. I feel like they're playing mins games with my family. How do I confront and ask my dad about this?",22Oct2019,1

623,"Hi everyone, I'm here to ask for an opinion: I'm starting to question my girlfriend's feelings, my friends and my mind tell me it's all good, but my heart is restless. We've been dating for nearly a year and a half, we just came back from a holiday together and we have another one planned ahead, we spend every second with each other and we enjoy it, I love her to pieces and, according to what she says, she loves me too. In August we had a small fight and for some reasons since then I can't help but thinking something's changed, we had never fought before. At the beginning of our relationship she used to post pics of us together all the time, captioning them with songs, she used to draw little love doodles for me and such. She doesn't do that no more, I dunno if it's all in my head but she doesn't seek physical contact as before. Sexually, in the first month we would do it everyday, but that soon changed as life got in the way and we went down to 2-3 times a week and that has been pretty stable and hasn't changed. This past week she has been away for a few days with her family and she came back this morning;  we were talking about when to see each other next, I suggested tomorrow and she agreed but later during the day I figured ""why don't I go today and surprise her? The sooner I see her the better!"" So I did go and we chilled for some time one her bed and she said ""Hey actually maybe we should stick to the original plan and you can sleep over tomorrow, I have training now, then I should get back home and wash my clothes and take a shower and have dinner... there'll be very little time left for us two before bedtime"". Seemed reasonable so I left and got back home, but later I started thinking that she never asked me to leave, even if she had a million things to do, so that sent me down once again to the ""she doesn't love me anymore"" rabbit hole. Apparently she noticed I was a bit upset by her statement so she kissed me and said ""hey I love you, don't ever forget that"". And with that I left. So, I know she said she loves me, but all these little things she used to do and doesn't anymore make me wonder; why do I still draw her things and why has she stopped? While do I send her love songs to listen to and she doesnt anymore? Is it the normal course of love? If it is why am I still behind apparently, why am I still stuck in the lovey dovey phase? This is my first serious relationship and I don't want to fuck up. I know this may all be in my head, and if that's really the case, I need help with keeping these thoughts away, I need help to stop thinking negatively or it'll impact my relationship, these thoughts make me act clingy and I don't want that, because that might very well harm my relationship.

624,"I am so tired of the people around me. Some background information: I’m in high school, a female, and I’m not North American. I attend quite a prestigious school and there are only around 60 other people in my grade. 


Here’s the thing: I’m losing more and more friends every single day. I don’t know who to be with anymore in school. Two of my closest friends (both girls) have been acting very unreasonably and it is really stressing me out. They keep cutting me out and they both act like a literal couple. It’s very irritating and nowadays, they prefer to talk to the guys in my class.

What’s so ironic is that they think I always try to be with the guys while I’m usually only minding my own business. They say that I’m desperate for attention, annoying, want-to-know everything,  the list goes on. I tried confronting them already, but I think it’s only making matters worse. When I did confront them, the one insisted that there are no problems and the other one acted dumb.

I tried to ask another girl for advice, but she didn’t really helped me. All it seemed to do is making it kinda awkward between me and her. She keeps on ignoring me when I’m just trying to strike a normal conversation. 

My whole grade is still very much childish for high school. They easily accuse one another, make stupid assumptions which results in huge misunderstandings, and there’s this group of “famous” jock guys that is sexist, immature, and I feel like they have serious toxic masculinity. The two girls that I used to be so close with loves playing with this group of guys and it seems that the guys do enjoy hanging out with these two girls. 

Thankfully, there’s this really nice guy (not from that group) who I can talk to that I completely trust. He gives me really good advice but I want things to go back to the way they were. There is also this girl I’m friends with that the two girls also hate. However. it seems like she chatting with the so-called famous people from upper grades more. But, I’m in pretty good terms with her.

I’ve thought about transferring to another school, but it’s very unlikely for me to move. I do really well in school, but it seems like all the two girls like to do is gossip on every single thing I do. They used to be super nice and down to Earth but they changed. They changed for the worse. Literally here, people follow what their friends do, no matter if it’s positive or negative.

Any inputs would be much appreciated :)",22Oct2019,1
625,"(27M) About 2 years ago, the woman with whom I've spent the last 9 years building a life with left me. I always took pride in having a communicative relationship that nurtures both of us. We never got mad when discussing hard-to-talk about subjects, we never told eachother ""no"" when expressing our wants or needs. We had our typical arguments which stemmed from foolish little annoyances, but they were few and far between. 
The difficult part was how she left. One day, everything was normal, the next was ""I need to be alone now."" As usual, we respected our feelings even though they weren't mutual and I let her go. The hardest thing I ever had to do. I mean, I fought for her...but in a way that wouldn't push her further away. That was until she blocked me on all social media, and my phone number. Funny thing was, for someone who wanted to be alone, she was on tinder a matter of weeks later, had a new boyfriend a month later, and has steadily dated many men since. She has effectively ghosted me from the day she left. I still don't know what I did, and have had absolutely no closure. I haven't slept with, kissed, or even flirted with another girl since. 
I am, increasingly, depressed. The hardest part is that I am an extreme introvert living in an extroverts social life. I am a front man of a psychedelic band, and an artist. This depression creeps into these realms, and as much of a spiritual, mindful, and self loved person as I am, I can't prevent this from taking its toll. Life is so grey. Nothing makes me happy, angry, or enthused. No matter what comes my way I'm just...numb.

A few weeks ago, after I played a show, a girl who I've known for a while approached me. Every time we see eachother we get into the best conversations that last for hours. I went home with her, we talked until 5am. I didn't even try to sleep with her, but we kissed and it was special. Following that night, I attempted to navigate the waters of courtship for the first time in 9 years. Things were well, we hung out a few times after. The conversation and emotions shared were increasingly intense. For the first time, I had hope that I could move on. 
This morning she broke things off. Atleast I got a reason this time...the whole ""you're an incredible person but I'm really busy"" bit. Which, again, I respected, thanked her for the moments we shared, and let her go. But I just feel this crushing load of sadness. I am an extremely closed of person, but I shower so much vulnerability around her because the conversation called for it. She never showed any sign of being put off by it, and always reciprocated. Now I'm left with this feeling of emptiness again. 

What did I do? Does it always hurt this much? Am I taking things to seriously or personally? These are the questions I keep cycling through, but I'm just so damn destroyed by it. 

I really don't know why I'm choosing to post this, I don't even know what advice I seek. I think I just needed to express it. The people I'm closest to, my bandmates, are all in amazing relationships with their soul mates and I just can't express this horrible sadness infront of that. The heroes journeys I dabble in once or twice a year, and ""hard"" psychedelics I choose to learn from, the methods of sobriety, meditation, mindfulness, positivity, Zen, every method I use to maintain a unique outlook or promote positive mental health just don't work in this realm. I mourn every day over the woman with whom I've spent 9 years. I was offered a window into what it looks like to be free from that, through this new woman, but that too was stripped. I like being alone, that isn't the department of this topic that makes me so sad. It's the lack of companionship. I have so much love to give...but why is it always a delusion of a constructed reality from the other?  I am being deceived into opening up, into letting myself love, only for it to be stripped.",22Oct2019,2
626,"So a little over a year ago I met a girl through a friend and over this year me and her became very very close.  I have always found myself to have feelings for her and I have always been very open about them with her though I have never acted on them outside expressing my feelings to her, she has never told me the feelings are mutual but she also always tells me that she doesn't know what the future holds for us.  She has always told me about how it takes a long time for her to develop feeling for people so she really doesn't know what to tell me because she has though nothing romantic about people before then years later it changed.

Now fast forward to the trip,  She had come up to visit me along side a few other friends (she lives about 18 hour away by car out of state).  I had offered her the guest bedroom but instead she decided to stay in my bedroom with me,  now we have always been flirty and made sexual jokes to one another but this time seemed different and the conversation that followed ended up with us engaging in sexual activities every night of the trip she took up to see me and during the trip we acted like a ""couple"" the majority of the time.

Now fast forward to the end of the trip, in the long conversation taking her back to the airport there was a lot said mainly by me and her interjecting here and there.  She told me that for the longest time she has seen herself putting up ""walls"" blocking out relationships with guys she would probably be very happy with and always ends up in unhappy relationships.  Even the guy she has feeling for now and has pretty much been a constant in her life for YEARS now she says that she doesn't believe they would work out in the end but she cant help feeling this way to him.  She told me that she went into this weekend trying to have some fun but she really wanted to give me a chance to prove myself to her, I did not know this and I just went about everything normally being my dumb self not taking anything super seriously.  She then followed it up with she believes she's going through a ""slut phase"" as she calls it and the only thing I could think to myself was how unfair I feel it was for her to ""give me a chance"" while she is in this said ""slut phase"" granted she said I'm the only one she has been with so far...

 Now that you have a summary of the story to where I am confused and could use some advice.  She told me that when we kissed she didn't feel anything, now normally that is a straight answer and that's fine  BUT she follows it up by comparing how she feels about me now to how she felt about the guy I just mentioned earlier saying that it felt the same between them when she first met and kissed.  Basically saying at least how I took it was ""right now I still feel nothing romantic BUT that's how it was with this guy I like now"" basically a full circle back to I dont know.   That isnt the only time she has compared me in this way and I'm not sure what to do,  should I wait it out a little longer and see what happens or move on? I'm not sure what to do because not to be cliche but she is the perfect girl at least in my eyes.

627,"My (26/F) friend ""Eliza"" (28/F)'s actions are getting on my nerves and I'm reaching out because I don't know if I'm in the wrong, or really how to handle this. A few months ago, my friend ""Bob"" (28/M) from childhood made it clear that he can no longer handle being friends with me. He had confessed to me earlier this year about his romantic feelings for me, asked if I felt the same way, and when I politely replied no, he took offense and gave me the cold shoulder for months. Ever since then, things have been uncomfortable between us, and a few months ago the last straw broke. I immediately called Eliza and told her what had happened between Bob and I, and asked her for advice. She said that I should no longer reach out to Bob. She said give him space. About a month or so later, Eliza invites Bob and I to the same party. I find it odd that she invited him, a friend who she met through me who she doesn't really even know that personally, but I let it go. I let her know that it's for the best I didn't go to the party because it would have been uncomfortable for Bob and I to see each other, since we don't talk any more. She ignores my text and instead sends me photos of her at a get together with Bob and other friends of mine from childhood, who I have introduced her to. They did not invite me. She sends videos and photos of them together. I don't know why she is sending me these messages when she is well aware that Bob and I are no longer friends, and that it's hurtful to me, so I ignore her messages. She then goes to the Facebook group I am in with a bunch of our mutual friends and she sends a ton of photos of them together (her and Bob).

It hurts me that my own friend can't respect my boundaries. I know that we have a mutual friend circle, but two of us (Bob and I) are no longer speaking to each other (on his accord, not mine). My friend Eliza is WELL aware of this, as I have previously talked to her about it in depth. She even told me it's best not to communicate with him. Yet to me, and I'm trying to not overthink this or seem petty, it really seems like she is trying to rub in my face that she's able to be friends with him, and that I am the odd one out.

What are your thoughts? What do you think I should do? I'm hesitant to directly ask my friend to stop communicating about Bob to me, because historically she is the type of person who will deflect it onto you and tell you that you're the one with the problem for not wanting to keep the peace. So, I'm tiptoeing around her, but I'm getting really sick of having a ""friend"" who seems to not understand simple personal boundaries.",22Oct2019,1

631,"So my dad, for the past 15 years has had this delusion that the lotto is fixed (which it might be idk), and he believes a computer algorithm decides what the winning combination will be and that he'll eventually crack the code.. and WIN! 

He's been ""studying"" it for years, filled god knows how many notebooks, yet he still plays the same combination every week, his ""observations"" and the ""connections"" he makes between numbers and how they correlate to one another ""in the system"" are nonsensical and listening to him trying to explain it was kinda heartbreaking.

 ""It'll be next week, for sure!""... is what he has been telling me since I was little, and rarely still does,  I used to believe him back then and pray that he wins since my parents have always been in great debt and life has been kinda difficult growing up. He has been unemployed for the past 10 years ( he might do a job here and there every so often but it's never something stable ) because he's betting on THIS being our family's salvation.

Of course, people around him don't believe him, our relatives, his friends, my mum or anyone for that matter nobody. I can tell everybody looks down on him and that he's perceived as a failure. And I can also tell that's what he thinks of himself too deep down. 

By this point, you're probably thinking he's a luny, but I don't think he is. I think he spent so much time and energy chasing this delusion that it grew to the extent that accepting it's all in his head would crush him and his ego. He says he has doubts every now and then, but still believes.  

Now my father's life has been filled with humiliation, failure , and betrayal by a friend of his in one instant and a family friend in another( I won't go too much into that). He has always been really stressed about the money part, no one believes in him, people have fucked him over, and I've realized there's a lot of self-loathing on his part too.  

I love my dad with all my heart, he's a great person and everything I stated above is the reason why I never confronted him on the issue. He thinks I'm the only one who believes in him. I'm very conflicted since we are in a really bad state financially, I can't go to college, I can't save money to do stuff for myself, seeing my parents so stressed about money is killing me. And the stress is killing me too. If I speak up and tell him, it might be a rude awakening, or it might crush him... If I don't, then I'm feeding into his delusion.

633,"Long story. I (17f) was at my boyfriends house, and we wanted to take a shower together. In hindsight, it was a bad idea to get high beforehand, but too late for that now. I stood up after...bending over for a while, got a really intense head rush, and then woke up on the ground. My boyfriend described it to me as falling down, shaking, and my eyes rolling back for around 20 seconds. I’ve seen enough Grey’s Anatomy to know what a seizure looks like, or at least I think I have. As soon as I woke up and laid down in bed, I was fine. Really sore, as I apparently landed on my head/neck, but no obvious issues that needed immediate attention. I don’t know what to do now, because I can’t talk to my parents about the circumstances and get in trouble. I could give them a more socially acceptable version of the story, but I feel like the truth would come out eventually.

There's a couple of [summarizing images](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EHZ0dlcXUAE3nfV?format=jpg&amp;name=900x900), of the causes leading up to the widespread crisis that has overcame the country, leading to mass fires in some of the biggest conglomerates, some may be off (education being the worst), but it  summarizes well the whole picture that made protests erupt so wildly.

Less than 1% share over 33% of the wealth in chile, because the constitution was left by the previous dictator Pinochet, [wiki link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Chilean_coup_d%27état), and kept because right-wing governments were covered as the left-wingers that opposed the regime (since they were forced to be, the only comunist government chile had was heavily targetted polliticaly by the US, given the whole context of the cold war, it's been proven that US funded the military to strike).  

Severe fires started by people, burning most of santiagos subway, most roads taken, people making noise during [Cacerolazos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cacerolazo), looting and burning of wallmart and other chain supermarkets.

Afther this, sebastian piñera used a constitutional power to declare an excluded state, and brought the chilean military to the streets, this is a serious deal politically and socially since there's over one generation that lived through the entire 16 years of military dictatorship (73'-89'), where a lot of people dissapeared, still missing, a lot of people were killed, and fear was widespread. Chilean people overtook big trauma during this time.

The militaryman in charge of the state of exception has installed curfews being 9:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. on the second day, on the third day of protests being brought earlier,starting at 7:00 p.m.

There's a lot of footage of police brutality, civillian killings on the streets (by chilean military), there's even TV footage of army firing war grade amunittion INTO buildings yesterday (most impressive thing so far, since chilean TV and press is owned by the same big conglomerates that store all power in the country, namely our president, and a couple of big families). 

People are in fear, state terrorism has been imposed, theres women saying that militaryman raped her and other    
arrested women, questioned people naked for hours, threw cold water at them, this revives most of the fears people developed during the dictatorship.

Now the ilegitimacy of the government that made this get so far is a big problem, there's a complete lack of disregard of the troubles suffered by the people, and every speech from the ministers and president have been an awful mocking during this time. There's a huge representativity crisis, for example, the same day the mass protests started and the president declared state of exception, he went out to eat pizza with his grandson and was seen in the middle of santiago, our transport minister told people to wake up earlier to catch the early bus so they get the cheaper fare.

He said that when in chile people work for even longer than 8 hour shifts, on places that may be up to 2 to 2 and a half hours in public transport from where they live. Where they have to spend around 15% of their salary (thinking minimum wage)  in transport. Not even taking into account any other expenses.

May i say that a degree in universidad de chile costs MORE monthly than the minimum wage, some careers are around double of a minimum wage each month. How can a working class person send their children to university, when first is hard that they get there given that they most likely were at a bad school, and that fellowships are few and far between (public schools in chile are really really bad in poor zones), how could they increase their wealth anyhow?

How could me, you or anyone help reshape the way chile works?

To add to that we are very different people and have very different goals. I love him to bits and I tried to make the “break up” as pain free as possible, what I really wanted was for us to just be friends and not talk about kids and marriage, which he would often bring up. He’s very sensitive and is very cold in his responses to me right now, which is understandable but worries me, as I don’t want to loose him. Is it possible to help him heal and be friends?

637,"Hi all, basically I left my old job back in August time, I was going to stay on as bank (picking what hours I want, what days I want to work etc) but because of an issue I had I chose to leave for good  (a higher up woman was very rude to me, which my manager held meetings about and generally sorted out I guess) I left on good terms.

I have just started my new job and.. I feel weird. Maybe it is a case of it being a fresh start but I can’t envision seeing myself being comfortable here, the majority of the staff are lovely some are a bit meh but that’s the same everywhere I guess.. I just can’t put my finger on what it is :(

My old friends are begging me to send an email to my old manager asking to come back as bank  but I don’t know what the right thing to do is as when I had a contract at my old job I was miserable because I had no work/life balance and the staff weren’t too great (they have since left) and I don’t know if going back bank despite picking my hours would make me happy, what if I’m looking back with rose tinted glasses?

639,"He dropped out of hs last year after a horrible group project that we both and two other friends did together. As it went on, I was under so much stress and very close to a burn out because basically I did all the work while he was home sick knowing he would drop out. By the end of the project I snapped at them because I was really pissed. But I could talk about it with the other two and they weren’t angry about it. The last time we talked, he seemed okay with it and we laughed together but a few months into summer, he blocked me. 

I was first a bit disbelieving because I had all right to be angry (plus I did snapped just at the two who actually weren’t dropping out) but he hasn’t talked to me since and I really miss him. 

My mother and his father had a thing for a while and they asked him to unblock me so I could talk to him but they weren’t really successful obviously. 

But she told me that he was in a bad place mentally. Yknow, we were both in an accident when we were driving to school with bikes like two years ago. He was hit by a car and if I were a little bit slower I‘d be dead rn. His foot needed surgery and he can’t do much sports now anymore. His father told me he barely leaves his room, he doesn’t go outside (because of the cars) and he isn’t close to him so I guess he doesn’t have anyone to talk with. 

Idk what he‘s doing, idk what he‘s exactly mad about so I feel a bit nervous apologizing for it and I really wanna see him. 

I planned out a lot of things. From showing up spontaneously all the way up to I write him letters everyday. The last thing that crossed my mind was making a photoalbum with like a bunch of memories, an apology/explanation what was up with me at that time and stuff that he should know that happened when we didn’t talked. 

But I figured, what if he hates me so much he doesn’t gonna open it? Or if it’s rude when he sees the stuff I did while he is so miserable and traumatized? Idek what reaction I want from him. I can’t expect him to leave the house for me to meet me at neutral ground and I don’t think he‘s going to forgive me that easy.

644,"Hello everyone, I wanted to make this post for a while now but due to recent events, I decided to finally push that button. Here goes:

I’m currently a student in college and work as a stocker in a grocery store. I love to be friendly and open to people, as I live and work in a small town, and word and reputation gets around fast. I’ve been working here for about a year-and-a-half, just using this job as a part-time gig so that I can pay expenses and whatever else is needed. I’ve made friends with a nice chunk of the staff there, but I began to realize early on that a big percentage of my co-workers are very rude and won’t hesitate to talk about you behind your back when you’re gone. I made a few close friends, about two that are managers and are about a decade older than me but are relatable. I’ve hung out with them outside of work, even went on a trip with them, etc. etc. However, one of them tends to show traits that could become comparable to someone suffering from bipolar disorder. He often changes moods at a drop of a pin, and will often take his anger out at anyone around. This has led me to ignoring/staying to myself (not being blatantly disrespectful) around him, just doing my job and getting back to whatever I was doing or getting to, to avoid interaction. Recently, he revealed that his wife was pregnant and I congratulated him, and throughout the weeks, have shown support towards their journey. However, his wife seems to always say something disrespectful and I always feel disheartened. I’m at a point that I wonder why I even am still “friends” with them. Yesterday at lunch, I was told many disrespectful things by the both of them and decided that I no longer want to associate with them, and would much rather stay to myself, however, I have both of their social media accounts following mine, the guy’s phone number, mutual friends, etc etc. so I’m asking: how do I cut them off without it backfiring at me within the workplace?

647,"As the title states i haven't heard from my therapist in a few weeks. I began seeing him through a charity organisation i was refferred to after i tried to commit suicide. At first it felt fruitless, but as time went on i felt myself stirring something deep inside. Eventually I came to terms with what had happened to me as a child and the severity of damage that had been inflicted upon me through years of sexual abuse. My therapist is the first person i have ever revealed that too. I told him because he wished to continue seeing me privately. He wasnt going to charge me for this. He told me that so lang as he had a practice i would have somewhere to go and he would never charge me even if my financial situation ever changed (I'm poor). I told him because i was scared that he was trying to seduce me. This is a fear i have with everyone. I'm incredibly paranoid and believe everyone has an angle or is playing a game, even when i logically know that to be untrue the feeling is still there. I continued therapy and i felt we were making great progress.
However, I was in london recently with my cousin and he revealed to me how my father had actually died when i was younger (I was led to believe it was a medical issue when in actual fact he had vommited in his sleep while drunk and choked). When i returned from london i spoke to my therapist on the phone and we made arrangements for our next appointment. I cancelled last minute, though. It isn't the first time ive done this. Over the last few months ive moved and its become more difficult to get therapy. He has asked if i no longer want to continue seeing him but i have been adamant that i do. It took almost two years to actually cry infront of him. The session that i cried was also the last time a saw him. As you can imagine im feeling incredibly vulnerable right now. The last few weeks i havent had the surge to kill myself but i am obsessing about it again and having disturbing images from my childhood flood my brain every now and again. Im feeling abandoned right now. I understand that he might want me to take the next step in therapy and take control but the last few weeks have been very hard and he knows this. About a month a go i was stopped by police. They triggered an episode in me (i also was returning from the pharmacy so I had yet to take my medication) as they were quite aggressive. I was charged with disorderly behaviour but i am disputing this in court next month as the incident took place on my property. My therapist knows all this but hasnt checked in with me in a while. It might sound silly but i just feel uncomfortable initiating contact. Im scared that if i tell him i need him ill be proven right and he will then try to take advantage. Sorry if none of this makes sense. I can't really make sense of anything right now.

But yesterday she sent one of her private snaps, which I responded asking her if she was still free Friday. She says she would but has to go doctor and said she knew why she was ill


And that’s because in 9 months time you know what will happen. Now I’m seriously torn. Like my mind is split into 2, if I do continue to talk to her on the level I have and it advances to a relationship stage. That would be my first relationship

Doctor was great and scar is minimal. I assume that any discomfort I'm feeling is very normal, but I keep wondering how much I should be babying my neck.
Most of the time, I avoid turning my head very much at all because I can feel muscle and skin stretch and it gets kind of sore. I can feel the soreness enough to be a bit concerned the day after being active in day to day stuff. Is it okay for it to get to that point or should I avoid being able to feel any discomfort at all as of now?
The wound is closed and I only cover it sometimes, but I dont want to stretch things if it means possibly scarring more or causing any other problems. It's still painful to the touch when washing and applying creams and whatnot.
Doctor said to start massaging it 2 weeks from now.
My lungs are also kind of sore from anesthesia and I'd like to start doing some light exercise because I've gained some weight. Just cardio or weight weights okay?

653,"Each week, my son's teacher sends home a homework packet. It includes a reading passage, followed by multiple choice questions, and then math problems. Parents are to sign that their child has read the passage 3x each day and completed the assigned math per day.  

  
During the first week, I noticed a lot of misspellings and typos in the reading.  During the second week, too. On the third week, I wrote the teacher I note. I gave her the benefit of the doubt and said she should be proofreading the source she is using, because it's littered with typos and grammatical errors. She wrote back (misspelling my name and another word, I forget which, which leads me to believe it isn't the ""source"" - it's her) stating that all of the fourth grade in the school uses this material and she will look for something else.   


Week four, less errors, but still errors. Week five, more errors. Week six, still errors. We had a death in the family and my child missed school, so I just told myself ""we'll see what happens next week...""  Next week happened yesterday and the errors are ever present. I'm beside myself with what to do. I wrote his teacher a note today saying how unacceptable it is for the errors to still be there, that it's clear she isn't reading the material... and while it may be easy for me to read through the misspellings, it is not easy for a nine year old to do so. One of the questions after the passage has an option for an answer of ""because the ship was not making enough montu.""  I knew from reading it that it's a typo of money, but a nine year old wont know that. -\_-   


I'm so angry that I threatened if she doesn't fix this shit by next week, I am absolutely going directly to the principal. Seven weeks of errors is enough, and it honestly makes me wonder A) What's going on in her classroom? What is she teaching there? B) After graduating college, did she drop her standards? There's no way colleges would accept this type of carelessness...   


What more can I do? I may have come off a little harsh in my note to her this morning, but I feel like I have been too lenient in general.

I currently live in Illinois and I'm attending a Community College here to transfer to a 4 year. I'm getting my associates this semester when I thought I was getting it next semester so I basically have the next month to sort out everything for my next college.

The kicker is I have a long distance boyfriend of 2 years that I really want to go to school with. However, due to poor mistakes in my past the school is out of my league and I probably won't get in there. If this is the case, I have 3 options:
-Continue my schooling here
-Go to community College for another associates there
-Go to a four year that's easier to get into there

My main problem is I have no clue exactly what I need to transfer to any of these schools. Even if I get in when I apply, I have no idea how housing and loans will work. I feel like time is closing in on me and sending emails to the school is painfully slow, and I have social anxiety so calling them is really hard for me (although I'll do it if I need to)

My main need for advice here is if I should follow my heart or my brain. I really don't like it here in Illinois and rather be in California with my boyfriend. However I would be in California for another two years working on another associates degree without even starting my bachelor's. However I think California has good opportunities for me that could make up for this, but so does Illinois in which I'd be working on my bachelor's degree at the same time. I'd also be with my parents at home so housing would cost nothing, but I'm kind of ready to go out and start my life. Both sides have pros and cons so I'm looking for advice on what's best for me.

I’ve had a binge eating disorder for probably 5 years now. I’m 17. I don’t know how it started exactly but for those 5 years i’ve been losing and gaining weight like crazy. In this time, my weight has never stayed the same for longer than even a month. I’m either binging like crazy and gaining weight rapidly, or eating nearly nothing and losing weight.  
This summer, i lost weight to the point where i felt actually comfortable in my body and told myself I would never let me be overweight again. But of course my eating disorder didn’t just magically go away and I gained all the weight I had lost back in just 2 months (13 pounds. This may not sound like too much but I’m very short so it gets visible quickly.). I’ve talked to my parents before, but this topic is very uncomfortable for me since i’m extremely ashamed of it, plus my parents are judgmental towards overweight people and I don’t feel understood by them at all. I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. This is affecting my school performance too, because I have zero motivation to do things for myself after a binge ( they have been happening everyday/ every other day).

I don't have any marketable skills or experience. I don't have to tell you how the search has been going. The one call I got for an interview (for an embroidery machine worker, which I actually *do* have some skills for, and they agreed to train) was done by a completely green HR officer who had no idea what she was doing. I've also applied for all manner of wage jobs... supermarkets, IKEA, etc. Nothing, I assume because they won't/can't hire someone with a college degree. Even field-specific positions I've applied for I know I'd be perfect for, despite not having the 1-2 years experience they want... no emails, no calls.

I'm a sociology major, I have studied the social context in which my generation lives, and I know exactly why this is happening. But my mother (whose 'job' is basically playing on Photoshop for a few hours and uploading whatever to the web, hasn't job hunted in 20 years) and stepdad (uni admin) seem to think I'm exaggerating and are convinced a stellar, secure benefit-laden career is just around the corner if I just applied myself. Just... aaaah! What the hell do they think I've been doing? My dad (majored in electrical engineering, got a job almost immediately after graduating in 1976, worked almost 40 years with that company, never had to job hunt) miraculously understands.

I tell them the hoards of research on why companies don't want to train anymore, how my generation is a liability for employers because of job-hopping, how their generation is taking all the entry level jobs because of previous training and  more valuable degrees, how the sharply increasing pool of college grads my age is diluting the value of newer degrees, how the extremely low unemployment rate means employers can afford to be as picky as they want. All in one ear and out the other... it's like they're living in 80s Reaganomics fantasyland where everyone has their dream job and they can still buy buy buy.

We get along really well and i know she likes me. We talk almost all day every day and we have a lot in common. But i am like fully smitten with her.... like i want to be with her more than anything... but i know she doesn't feel the same right now.... and it really hurts knowing you like someone more than they like you... and idk what to do to cope because I want to be with her but I just don't think she wants that at the moment... so yeah that's all I guess... just needed to get that off my chest...,22Oct2019,1
663,"I've been at this job for just a month. It feels like such a waste to walk away. I like what I do, I like who I work with, and I'm very much needed. A close mentor personally referred me for this position…it would be so shameful to quit.

But I'm extremely depressed. I wish I hadn't taken the job in the first place. My depression and suicidal ideation has been worsening over the past year as I faced significant changes in my life, and I was seriously considering seeking professional help and stopping the job search while I focused on recovery BEFORE I accepted this job. My parents knew I was suicidal at age 17, but since then I've pretended I was fine so they didn't have to worry. I was staying with them briefly while I found my current job, and I have no doubt they would have supported me and let me stay while I sought treatment had I decided to do so. I just didn't want to have to tell them I was this bad again.

I've been depressed and suicidal since I was 14, maybe earlier. I'm 26 now, in my first real job after grad school, and something feels different this time. I'm taking more steps to plan my suicide than I ever have before. I want to die…but I'm also beginning to be very afraid I'm actually going to do it. My sister is having her first child in January. I want to live to be an uncle to my nephew. I want to die, and I don't. I need to get better. But the thought of quitting and disappointing and inconveniencing everyone is so shameful…I'd rather die than deal with the fallout.

There are logistical issues, too. I'm stuck splitting rent, utilities, and other household expenses for the year unless I find someone to take my room. I start paying back student loans next month. I have an important medical appointment in 3 weeks near where I live now, and I'd have to find a new doctor ASAP where my parents live. My life becomes unimaginably more complicated the second I quit and move home. Worse, everyone will treat me with pity. I've hidden how bad I've been for years because I'm such a private person. I can't bear to have everyone know…but my life doesn't feel super survivable right now.

I don't know what to do. I feel trapped, unless I quit, and even then there are serious downsides.

668,"My girlfriend got her first corporate job a few months ago after graduating from college, where we met.

As far as I knew from what she told me things were going well.

She just came home saying she was fired for sexual harassment but then said that it was a guy doing it to her and he played the system as a privileged white male and framed it on her.

She showed me some chats where she is flirting with her male coworker but it is clear that she was only just looking for help with concepts she didn’t understand. She previously studied C++ and Java but at this job they are using PHP and MySQL. And he has the experience so she was just trying to get help from him.

Eventually he started turning her down for her help and that is when he reported her and tried to blame her for it because he was all butthurt about having to train a female employee. She also showed me his open Facebook where he has made some misogynist comments.

I am honestly a little upset about the flirting, but I understand. Being a woman means that men often won’t help out women when it comes to training and assisting them in the same way they do for fellow men, especially fellow white men.

I insist that we call a lawyer and sue the fuck out of them but she says that she wants to just move on and find another job ASAP instead of gaining a reputation as a lawsuit lady early on in her career.

My question is well, should I believe her? I think the facts line up but there is a 1% chance where maybe she did do something? Idk.

My girlfriend is 26 and has the WANT to move out but not the drive. I think she’s afraid to truly leave the nest but that’s not the story I’m here for.

Coming from being an only child and moving out at 18 this is like a culture shock to me. But I’ve always had the means to move out in the past. Now I have nothing to do a down payment and it seems like they’ve done everything they can to at least make HER dependent on them.

673,"Background information: I'm 21 years old in my fourth year of college. I'm majoring in elementary education. Last semester was rough-- I was working any time I wasn't at school, and it took its toll on me physically, emotionally, and academically. My GPA dropped to a 2.4, but I need a 2.5 or higher to get into the school's Education department. I can't apply for the education department this semester, because even though I'm doing much better now, my GPA is still officially a 2.4. And I can't apply to the education department next semester, because the semester AFTER next semester (fall 2020) is supposed to be the semester I do my internship, and it's required that students take a particular class the semester before their internship (so next semester, spring 2020, for me). And in order to be in that class, you have to already be admitted into the education department. So... I'm stuck.

Did all of that make sense? Please let me know if it didn't.

Truthfully, I hate college. I've hated every minute of the three years I've been here. For more reasons than just the academic problems I've already laid out. But I desperately want to be an elementary teacher, so I've toughed it out for three years. But now I'm in a situation where simply toughing it out won't do anything. Here are the possible solutions I've come up with, along with the reasons they likely won't work:

1. Register for easy classes next semester to get my GPA back up.

Reasons it's not ideal: My advisor and the other higher-ups at my school still won't think I'm education-department-material. And if, by miracle, they do admit me into the education department, they still have the power to pull me out if and when they do not see me as a good fit. Also, I'd be delaying graduation by a semester. I don't want to waste so much of my parents' money on a relatively unnecessary semester (although, after last semester's revelation that I was working so many hours at my job, they told me not to stress so much about tuition).

2: Transfer to a different college. This is the solution I like the best because I really just hate it here.

Reasons it's not ideal: In the vast majority of other colleges, you still need a 2.5 GPA. What if I don't get it back up? Also, I'm not sure how many of my credits would transfer over. And I'd have to deal with housing changes, but tbh I'd be willing to endure that if it meant all these other problems would be solved.

3. Drop tf out. Also fond of this solution, because I really really just hate the college I'm at.

Reasons it's not ideal: I'm either two or three semesters away from graduation. Surely I can tough it out till then, right? Also, I don't know what I'd do after I drop out. Get certified for early childhood education? Apply to another college? Get a job that doesn't require a degree? Travel/teach abroad? 

I truly have no idea what to do. I just want to graduate and be a teacher already. I hate it here, and I hate the situation I'm in. I don't know who else to turn to, because my advisor, the one in charge of all these decisions and the one who will ultimately let me into the education department (he is also the head of the department), has made it very clear that he does not think I'm education-department-material, and on the rare occasion he has answered my questions about what I'm to do, he has done so with annoyance/anger/disappointment in his voice and eyes.

Unfortunately, I probably won’t be going home for Christmas as I will have to be at work (in my country you get two and a half days off during the holidays, which makes it impossible to fly to another country and back).

677,"Disclaimer: This is my first reddit post so if I do something wrong sorry :) .

Disclaimer 2: Written on mobile.

I’m male 15 and all other people in this story are also 15.

So basically the new Star Wars trailer came out today and I know this girl (we will call her Lucy) who doesn’t really follow the internet and doesn’t find trailers to watch and stuff. Lucy loves Star Wars and when we were on better terms I sent her the first rise of the Skywalker trailer and we had a great convo about it. However we are not on the best terms now... 

Very long story short I used to date her best friend (Let’s call her Abbie) and she broke up with me. Then me and Lucy kinda had a thing but then Abbie found out and that kinda ruined it. Then all my ‘friends’ found out with my thing with Lucy and teased me about it borderline bullying. Then I had something with another girl in that friendship group (lets call her Nancy) and Nancy told her twin sister and then everyone found out and for some reason they thought I did something bad interacting with girls. I realise now they were most likely jealous as we go to a boys school and don’t have much interaction with girls (the girls were primary school friends and friends of primary school friends) . My ‘friends’ bullied me for months and even drove me to feel suicidal and like self harming (I’m sure you would be all pleased to know I never ended up harming myself in any way). So in September I dropped my ‘friends’ and made some new ones and I’m a 1000 times happier. Me and Lucy maintained a steady relationship.

However about a month ago Lucy started to be distant not messaging me as much or talking to me and blanking me a lot and being genuinely rude to me. I got annoyed as I didn’t have time for fake friends anymore and I basically told her to frick off and have a nice life (accept I didn’t use frick ;) ). We haven’t spoken for a couple weeks now and I heard she is dating one of the boys in my old ‘friend’ group. 

This brings me to my dilemma do I send her the link to the trailer and be nice or do I not. If I send it and she tells her boyfriend that could start a lot of bad stuff for me. 

If I do send the trailer I’m gonna send it with this message “Hey sorry Ik we don’t talk anymore but the new Star Wars trailer came out and you liked it last time so if you wanna watch it here you go”.

If you have any advice about what to do or what message I should send instead of the one I’ve prepared I’d be happy to hear it.

Case in point, I feel like we were both nervous about meeting an absolute stranger and how to socialise with each other or what not.

I’ve just started this very recently and have just closed my first sale with this method. But there’s an issue I’m thinking of. Usually when i buy something, they’ll include a paper in the box like a printed invoice that said the price, how many I purchased, my name, etc. How can I prevent this?

* They take my computer away
* They mock me/ make fun of me (My mom is taking a course and seems to be studying more than me)
* They call everything I do a waste of time
* They believe that I'm a bad influence

* They prohibit me from using my computer after a certain time, not even for homework
* They forced me to get a job, but they took my phone away so I can't receive any of the calls
* Since I'm in college I made my schedule so I have no classes on Fridays, this annoys them and they force me out of the house so I don't use that much electricity, though I really took the extra day to try and have more time to work on papers and stuff

I've thought about stopping before, because 
1) I simply don't really enjoy being in grad school. I don't like analysing journals that I don't find interesting and I don't like the stress of deadlines (albeit flexible for the school) and 
2) I got a promotion last year and my job is becoming increasingly more intense, making me dedicate more time to it. 

I have the option right now to end school with my coursework and graduate with a Post-Graduate Diploma, or to continue to start and finish the thesis/dissertation phase and graduate with the full on masters degree. 

The thought of pushing through and writing an entire Dissertation makes me feel sick, on top of new job responsibilities and my boss putting me through separate masters level classes to help with these responsibilities, but when I go to end it with the school and opt out of the next phase, I feel so disappointed in myself and guilty for quitting.

Today I left school on the later side as I was speaking to a teacher, so by the time I got to the parking lot it was pretty much empty. When I got to go in my car these two guys that I had never seen before but went to my school asked me for a ride down the street and I politely declined. One kid kept pestering me about why not and I told him I'm not 18 so I'm not allowed to drive anyone, and I shut my door and turned on my car.

This guy was a hell of a lot bigger than me, as he probably had several inches and at least 40 pounds or so on me, so I was afraid that if i said anything to piss this guy off I would get the shit beaten out of me, not to mention the fact that his friend was far behind.

This kid was still not satisfied with my answer, so he started shouting at my window to let him drive my car, so I lied and said this wasn't my car and I was expected home shortly. This guy continued to shout out me until I backed out and drove home.

I've had multiple chances with girls but I can't afford to go out on a date and pay for myself let alone pay for her meal too. I have to walk 3 miles (5km) to and from school everyday because we don't have a car and so I come home exhausted and barely able to study so I have bad grades. I'm sick and tired of coming home everyday to a small disgusting meal that I have to gulp down while trying not to vomit because that's all we can afford. How can I get myself out of this damned situation?,22Oct2019,3
698,"Okay, so I graduated from my MSc this year and before that I did my Bachelor's in a totally unrelated discipline, due to the market +  location I decided to switch careers. Now I'm literally ready to start work since I got my Msc and I've been applying for relevant positions I find myself looking at jobs from within my Bachelor's degree industry. Idk why but I randomly contacted someone in my network and asked them to forward my cv to their boss and got an interview and an offer for an internship that could convert to a full-time job in 4 months. 
Simultaneously the universe decides to mock me and give me an interview with something in my Msc industry which might convert into an offer pretty soon and seems promising. It's also an internship  but for a longer period and with the same offer of full time employment in the end. 

Now some other issues are the second company is quite far away by train and the first one is really close to where I live and this matters since I don't have a car and the station is quite far from my place. But somehow I feel like since I have the second degree I should take a job that is in that field instead of something else and I'd be regressing by doing this and making a huge mistake. 

Idk what to do. I might be overthinking.",22Oct2019,1
699,"This happened years ago.

I got picked up from my grandparent's house by my ex after eating steak. Went to his friend's house and smoked a camel crush cigarette(couldn't finish it). It was a very hot humid day.

I was standing and didn't feel right. I went to sit down. I closed my eyes, rested my head on my hands and started getting very sweaty and dizzy. I puked.

Ex tried to get me to the car. My vision was starting to go black and I could barely hear him. I ran to the grass and puked again. I could barely keep my balance while walking. (didn't help that he was getting pissed off at me) 

We get to the car and he turns on the AC. He said my body felt very cold.

After a little while I felt better again.

700,"I’m 22 years old, my 2 older sisters are in their late twenties one expecting their first child, the other a mother of 2. My mom has felt extremely disrespected and forgotten by my other siblings, while they have busy lives they often spend time with my father who left our family over 10 years ago. He maintains a permanent residence 30 minutes away with another woman who they share a 5 year old with. The relationship between my parents is not good. They are not allowed to be anywhere near each other and thus it’s the old fashioned split family (2 Birthdays, 2 Christmas spreads you get the picture).... my relationship with my father is not troubled or resentful in anyway however there is no question he did unspeakable things towards my mother which took me many years to forgive- this forgiveness varies between each sibling but my two older sisters seem to have made significant progress towards their bond with our dad. Anyway my mother feels heartbroken that over the years my sisters have chosen to spend most of their time at Christmas thanksgiving etc with our father and the woman he had a new child with. I don’t harbour any resentment towards that growth however it breaks my heart to see my mom squeezed in on Christmas Day or thanksgiving when she puts so much work into making it special. She is 60 years old and very old fashioned- Deep rooted family values and traditions so in her eyes this is a great betrayal. 

She pulled me aside and said she can’t bear to be at home for the holidays this year after being forgotten &amp; disrespect and wants to spend the 22-30 on a cruise in Miami and take me. While this sounds luxurious (our family does not travel often-or even spend a lot of money often) I feel this is more of a statement and she will regret it later... not that she doesn’t deserve a luxury cruise but she will miss one of her grandchild’s first Christmas, another baby could arrive while we are gone... I just don’t know how to tell her no. I also don’t want to miss these memorable moments !!! What should I do? I’m open should so just say yes and help make arrangements or should I try to talk to her ? What do I say D:",22Oct2019,0
701,"So this guy (let’s call him Mike) and his gf (let’s call her Joan) are in an open relationship. Me and Mike are really close friends, we constantly have deep talks, go out a lot, and share super personal stuff with each other. There’s certainly a connection between us. Me and Joan are friendly with each other as well, we chat sometimes and occasionally hang out.

At some point, Mike and I started to become more intimate, with Joan’s permission of course. It was a no strings attached agreement. But just recently, Mike told me that he’s fallen in love with me. He says Joan knows about it and is fine with it, but I honestly don’t know how I feel about the situation. I mean, I love Mike, but I don’t know if I’m in love with him. And I feel super guilty about everything, because Joan is a great girl and very loyal to Mike, I know for sure she has no intentions of looking for other guys despite having Mike’s permission.

I decided I wanted to stop being intimate with Mike, and when I asked him he said he didn’t want to stop, but he’d be willing if I really wanted it. At that moment though, I couldn’t end it because if I’m being honest, I’m very touch-starved and crave affection constantly, and our relationship really provides for that. 

But then the guilt of feeling like a side chick and the feeling of betraying Joan is really eating me up. Mike said that Joan doesn’t feel that way, and that they discuss everything that goes on, but the feeling is still there. I legitimately don’t know what to do now. Mike and I will be talking about things further, but I’m so confused at what I want that I don’t know what to say to him. What should I do?",22Oct2019,3
702,"Some backstory. We dug ourselves in a financial hole. By being young and dumb. I also destroyed my credit. 

This will fix itself over time (of course) but in the meantime. We are staying with a relative until we can get a place of our own (we can't get approved for any apartments due to credit). But. Of course when your a family, staying with another family member. Tensions are high.

But our question is. Should we save up and just wait a few months, then find an apartment. Or should we save up and buy a travel camper SOONER. And park it at a campground (with electrical hookups) or on our families land. While we save money for an actual mobile home on our own land. 

Which would be smarter? We don't think we will mind living in a camper that much. It will just be a challenge. And if we park it on our families land. We can always shower/use the bathroom in our families house. Then just sleep/cook/hangout in our camper",22Oct2019,1
703,"I always had pretty modest goals in life. In order of highest priority to lowest, my three main goals were always to have:

1) A cool girl to share my life with
2) Good friends
3) A solid career

Over the last few years, I finally accomplished #2, and I'm good friends with a couple, and I love having them around. Earlier this year, I basically got as close as I can get right now to #3; I don't exactly have a great ""career"" ahead of me, nor do I make much money, but I don't hate my job, which is more than I can say for the jobs I've worked for the last 10+ years.

Unfortunately, dating never seemed attainable to me, and even now, I still can't even get started. I don't think it's in the cards for me.

And to be honest, I kinda feel like I should be happy I even got to where I am now. I don't even really know that I feel like I earned what I've found, as I kinda fell ass backwards into both my job and my current friendship.

It's difficult to talk myself out of wanting #1 anymore, but I feel like I'd be ""greedy"" to want something more when I've already found things that I probably didn't deserve to have already.

This guy is a lazy asshole, his gf must work for both of them, he is a human waste. When I cooled down I thought about giving him a friendly advise that having this girl, despite his effords is his only achievement in life and he should get his ass thogether and make her life a happy one.

708,"I posted up a twin stroller to give to a local twin family in my community and several people replied. I know one family in particular had commented on a few other of the same strollers without luck so I choose them. I did offer to drop off at my convenience, I don’t live in town and I don’t have a set schedule on when I drive through town, just if I happened to be driving out whoever’s way I would drop it off. (I posted it in my local twin parent support group)

They don’t live in town either and in fact live across the border(province)  and asked me to plan a meetup in town for the free stroller. I said I wouldn’t do that, I have no scheduled reason to be in town ever, but if I happened to be in town and they had an address of a friend or family and I happen to drive by their area, I’d be happy to drop it off to them. I did reiterate that my offer of drop off was at my convenience. 

She then said she would get her friend to get back to me that night and they would just pick it up from my house on one of the days I told them I was home. (I gave them Tuesday til Friday this week) Which is also totally fine. That was Sunday, it’s now Tuesday and several people are still asking if the stroller is available. 

I messaged her hey did you arrange a day with your friend to pick it up from me and she replied any day. I replied yes, you were going to tell me which specific day. 

I now am a little annoyed, I know this stroller is in high demand, and her communication is frustrating. I am not frustrated she hasn’t picked it up, I am a little frustrated at her either not arranging pickup or not communicating that she was still working on getting it picked up

There is one thing that I haven’t been able to and I’m pretty sure it’s not anything that he would need or want to hear.

It’s the fun way to meet new people, getting to know someone, exploring and adventuring. I just can’t help that I miss those times. I know that I would never ever do something to cheat on him because I know that I prefer having this amazingly supportive and loving relationship over a few one night stands. 

I just don’t know if this is something I should bring up with him. I know that bringing this up could potentially cause him to be upset and even worry about me cheating.

The thing is, I've sacrificed most of me to get on the right track and actually pass exams: I don't go out but at night so that I have more time to study, I've stopped reading books and practicing photography because it was taking time off my studies, I don't bike anymore to keep in shape (even though I used to do that *after* I was done studying). Last summer was the first actual time I took a vacation in 3 years, otherwise I've spent summers studying while everyone else was traveling and having fun. I've lost two concerts of my two favourite bands when they came in my country because I had to study for some upcoming exams. I've sacrificed all the things I used to enjoy because of uni. And I didn't mind, because I started seeing some progress: I passed exams at the first shot, my grades improved, overall very good. I didn't mind, up until now. Yesterday, there was a graduation ceremony at my uni, and I saw some instagram stories about some people (that started at the same time I did) graduating. I didn't mind, I know I'm late but I'm doing my best now. Up until I saw someone's story. This person started with me and had trouble with some first year exams as I did (I noticed because I was preparing a particular exam the same time she was). And in the meanwhile, I saw that she traveled a lot and went out most of the time. I figured ""they must be late as well"". Except they weren't. They graduated yesterday, while seemingly giving up nothing. And I feel such a fucking failure right now. I've been feeling like shit for two days, crying at night both yesterday and today and I can't shake off the feeling that no matter what I do, no matter what I give up on, it's never enough. I gave up the best years of my life to be a secluded bookworm so that I could go on no problem, yet there's people out there my same age that have lived those years by going out, having fun, sex, new experiences, already have their piece of paper and can start working, while I'm sitting here crying, lost for being such a fucking pathetic sack of shit. God fucking damn it. 

I don't know why this person out of the hundreds that I knew upset me, it just did. I want to know if there's something, anything I could do to shake this feeling off.

718,"So my coworker started to fake a (bad) British accent 24/7. I'm not sure if it's just me but it is so incredibly annoying. He is from an East Asian country and normally speaks with fluent English with a slight accent from his home country. There is nothing wrong with a natural accent and no one should ever be bothered by it. Even though he is in America now, he became obsessed with British culture last year and talks about having an ""Anglo-fever"" all the time. Having a ""fever"" for another culture in such a superficial manner is already quite offensive in my opinion. You can enjoy and appreciate another culture in many meaningful ways; but to be obsessed with another culture because of their accent, how they drink afternoon tea (this guy now has high-tea in the afternoon at work with floral English teapots and cups), etc. is just so vain and stupid. Anyways, 1-2 months ago, this guy started to speak in a fake British accent around everyone, including in group meetings where our boss is present. He also started to spell in British spelling. His imitation of British accent is also really bad. All he does is dropping ""r"" sounds at the end of words, calls fries ""chips"", cookies ""biscuits"", etc, and speaks in a generally very singsong-y cadence of a bad imitation.

732,"This is my brothers situation, and I'm trying to figure out what to do about it.

My brother uses State (WA) Section 8 housing to live in an apartment building. He pays about 25$ or so a month. He's unemployed, and behind on all bills. The landlady lets him stay on as long as he contributes something, anything per month. He's given .25 cents before.

The Landlady relocated him to a new apartment. 2br -&gt; 1br. However, since he was behind on rent, and couldn't make the new deposit, she wouldn't give him the key to the new place. She kept that up right until the day a new family were in the parking lot, ready to move into his current unit. She assigned the family a diff unit, forced my brother into the smaller unit, and won't let him sign the lease. She's been absent from the office apparently, 90% of the time. The power company is also charging him for both units, not reading the meter, just charging a flat fee for the empty dark larger unit.

To top it all off, it sounds like (Per a letter he received) as if the land/apartment is being bought out, and this may or may not change the status of the apartments Section 8.

I guess...my main need for advice is: Is there anything my brother can do to fix the non-lease situation he is in at the moment? I can only think that legally, he's squatting, and the landlady is not cooperating at all with him. I'm sure some of these 'problems' are fabricated due to lack of motivation on his part to talk to the right authorities (Power company issue for one should be an easy solve, rather than letting them charge him for 3 months on a unit he's no longer in), but it also sounds like there's no management happening at this place.",22Oct2019,1

739,"Hi guys. We had to put down our dog of 16 years today. He had an injury which needed an operation to fix. Unfortunately he was too old to be operated on and given antibiotics to, so we were not left with much choice as the vet said even if he survived his quality of life would be so low.

As upset as I am myself, I’m more concerned about how our other dog is going to cope. He is younger and came in as a baby, so he’s always had alfie there. He’s never known anything else but constantly having his brother around. I’m so worried he’s going to get lonely and ill himself. The house can be empty for a long time during the day when everyone is at work, and I don’t have many friends to go on dog dates/walks with.

Apart from of course just giving him lots of cuddles and attention, is there any great tips anyone can give?

P.s rip Alfie. We’ll always love you ♥️",22Oct2019,1

741,"(Crossposting this from my post in r/jobs) as the title says, im moving in two weeks. ive agreed to stay at my current job until i leave so my last day would be next friday. the reason im moving and leaving/quitting is because i have been dealing with teasing and bullying from my coworkers for the last 6 or so months. ive been here for over a year now. and ive been considering quitting since march. and finally found an apartment with my boyfriend 2 states over and put in my notice at work about 2 weeks ago. so i had one more month of working to deal with.

in the last two weeks, i have experienced mental abuse and heartache you would not believe. my boss, who i thought i was close to and would often confide in, has outcast me. she doesn't talk to me anymore. she glares at me. has tried to (wrongly) throw me under the bus multiple times for errors that she made but tried to put on me. she rolled her eyes at me and groaned yesterday and was whispering with a coworker and when i walked up to ask a question she loudly asked my coworker ""how is the interview process? are we any close to hiring someone?"" (i.e. my replacement. cuz the plan as of now is i work remotely from my new apartment while they find someone to replace me.)

my other coworker (who is an assistant, and i am a coordinator, so he is a lower position than me technically) sent me a rude email. and when i forwarded it to the president (who i am close with) he called him in and had a talk with him and forced him to apologize to me basically. when i came in this morning i said goodmorning to him and his response was ""mhm""

im having my boss's work thrown on me with strict deadlines and i can't possibly do it alone. when i asked her for help on something that she is familiar with and told her ""i need your help with this please"" she rolled her eyes and said ""go to their help page or call customer support"" and shoo'd me from her office.

i told HR (which happens to be the president's wife) that i feel like im being outcast adn everyone is rude to me. and not much if anything has happened since i said that. and she is out right now so i cant even go to her right now and talk to her. i feel completely alone. i also dont have any friends in my town that i can confide in. im completely alone for the next two weeks and so depressed i can't take it anymore. ive had some really sad thoughts the last few days because of this treatment. it is abuse. it is bullying. i can't.

i have another job lined up in my new state. it's not official that ive been hired there but it seems very very very likely. i want to walk out of my current job but i assured the president i would be staying and finishing the next two weeks. can i just walk out and agree im fine not taking any pay but i cannot be here anymore and take this abuse? would that look bad on my record? i seriously, honestly, cannot take this anymore. i have cried at work every day for 2 weeks. i even went to HR and cried. im being bullied into leaving right now and i dont want them to win but i cant possibly do this for another two weeks. i still have to answer to my boss who is the base of the bullying and mistreatment and she won't even talk to me anymore. it's passive aggressive email only that's how she communicates with me now. and she is my boss. and keeps piling work on me when really i need to be cleaning up files and making a smooth transition for whoever replaces me when i leave. but no. she is putting all her last minute work on me. how can i be civil? im 1 more evil glare from just saying ""screw you im leaving""

the president seems like he is in a bad mood today. the woman who handles HR is out of the office all week. i can't wait until next week to talk about this but im scared to go to the president because he's in a bad mood and i dont want this to piss him off more. i want this to be my last week. what do i say. how do i leave. help please.",22Oct2019,1

744,"Hi,

I've virtually been masturbating daily for the majority of 2019. I'm in college and have reduced it because of school work. I noticed that the last time I masterbated I got off successfully (ejaculation) this was a day or two ago. When I masterbate I use pornography (online porn). I noticed that the time before (or the time before that) I couldn't get off because I wasn't in the mood / the porn was too soft (it was G/G which is what I watch when I feel like watching what I consider soft porn). I then remember watching a scene from the same genre (G/G) but I considered it harder because the content is from a fetish site. I also remember even when the fetish (the harder G/G category) wouldn't get me off I resorted to what I consider a harder genre (Male to female transgender \[either two or more of these type of women together \[M2F TG\] or a M2F TG with a regular female\]). Is there a way I can reduce masturbation / to stop using it as a stress reliever? The reason is that I'm trying a college study program and the creator of it says to do a stress-relieving activity minimum once weekly.

746,"Hello all. This is my first post. I'm in a low spot, so please be kind with responses because this is a sensitive subject for a lot.
My son (9) is turning into a bit of a bully at school. He calls other kids mean names, makes weird noises, doesn't listen and is disrespectful. At home he does this to a point but om a much smaller and less frequent scale. At home he's usually happy and funny and full of silly stories. It's just at school he struggles bad. 
I dont know what to do. He's in therapy. I try to talk to him but dont get far, we end up talking in circles. We are nice to each other at home (for the most part). The staff at school does their best but I can tell when I talk to them (which is a lot) that they dislike my son. This has been a recurring problem with schools. I even switched him last year but its ending up the same thing.

We left a severely abusive relationship about 4 years ago. After that his dad tried to kidnap him. And then his dad died 3 years ago in December. It's been a tough road and it's not getting better.
I've been through therapy which helped immensely, and so has my daughter (7). My son struggles so much, but he was older and saw a lot more and remembers a lot more.

I work full time. Dad died leaving me with nothing but debt. My options are to move him to a smaller school where he would be bussed (not sure how he would behave on bus), or quit my job live off food stamps and a few hundred in social security so that I could homeschool him. Or enroll him in special ed classes which I dont know what that would do to his self esteem. He already hates himself and talks about killing himself (no actual plan).

Has anyone been through something like this before? What makes it better?

I am getting desperate and my heart is broken,  for him for me and for all the kids he's being mean to. Please help.",22Oct2019,1

750,"For context, I'm a college student. I asked a girl I liked out on a date and we had a great time. We got dinner and went to a concert on campus. After the concert, we sat and talked on a set of stairs for almost an hour. A week later, I invited her to a concert in a nearby city and she agreed. We drove an hour there, saw the concert, got dinner, and drove the hour back. It was awesome. Looking back, I should have made a move, but I didn't.

The day after the concert, I texted her asking if she wanted to hang out, but she said she was busy with class. This continued for a few days. I gave it a week and invited her to another concert, but she said she was busy as well.

So here I am. I understand that I need to just give her space and see if she comes back. My only question is if I should state my romantic intentions before backing off, or if I should just continue doing what I'm doing and let her reach out to me if she is still interested in me.

As for the drums, because of how loud they are, I cannot play at home so my dad said he has a spare room in his factory, and we can place the drums there. But, it would take me 20 minutes for a trip from home to the factory. I'm too lazy for it. Also, factory remains open only uptil 9 pm which sucks because the night time is the time I'd be most willing to practice an instrument. 

I'd have gone for the guitar. But here's the thing, I want to play in a band when I get good enough. From what I've heard, guitarists are more, there's quite some good competition between them while drummers are quite less, so if I pick the drums it'll be less competition, easy to get in a band plus it kinda feels good to be doing something different than many others, ya feel me?

765,"Okay, I'm going to try explain this as best as I can. So I started uni last year and made two friends, B and C and decided that in our second year we would move in together and now we are sharing a house. 

Now, B and C have always had a rocky friendship and honestly I don't know everything that has happened between them and a few weeks ago C sent a message to B saying that she didn't want to be friends with him anymore. 

About a month into us living together C decided that she was dropping out of uni and because of that cannot afford to live in our house. I've tried to help find her someone to take over the contract but it fell through due to unrelated issues. 

Since moving it, I've felt like I've had the house to myself, as B spends his time between this house and his girlfriends and C dips in and out. 

Here's where I feel like I'm a bad friend or something.  C only comes and stays in the house with her boyfriend and they always hid up in her room.  Obviously, I understand couple time, which is why I leave them alone, majority of the time. 

I know C has got stuff going on and is finding the housing situation stressful, but whenever I tried to meet up or hang out, she would cancel or say she was busy. 

Skip to a few days ago, Me and B and a few other friends went out for drinks, I posted a picture of us onto snapchat with our drinks and C replied saying ""Where was my invite?"" I had been invited out, I didn't organise it and with how things are between C and B.

I said that B invited me. 

She said she was only joking and I left it there. 

Then a few minutes later one of the people there show me C's story, shes posted a picture saying ""life tip: never move in with pals if you have a bad gut feeling about it because it'll just get messy af. Not throwing shade just stating facts"" 

With the timing of the post, I felt like it obviously had something to do with me. So  I asked if she had an issue with me, she said no and the post was about the money situation, but obviously it wasn't because she wouldn't mention moving in with pals ? 

Anyway, more things were said and I finally said how I felt alone because she never wanted to hang out and she said she had stuff going on and that her boyfriend was the only one that understood her and that she wanted to be around. 

Am I in the wrong? Idk, if it makes sense but any advice would be gratefully received.",22Oct2019,1
766,"So to start, I'm an 18M who started his first year in undergraduate studies at university in September. 2018 was a very turbulent year and carried over into early 2019.. my father moved across the country for work and I moved to a more isolated part of my town which ended up pulling me far away from my friends. I was diagnosed with both GAD and mild depression during this time.. Basically things were pretty bad until this past summer when my life started to turn around and I was surrounded by a great group of friends and had my long-time crush by my side as I had finally had the chance to connect with her and ended up dating her for about 6 months. 

Ever since I got to university (2.5 hours from my hometown), things have been going downhill. I've had an extremely hard time making friends and my anxiety is almost constant to the point where I have now been put on medication. I became very dependent on my girlfriend which created a cycle of fighting, ultimately ending in a break up. I'm now in a state of extreme self-doubt which has led to self harm on two different occasions. My grades are absolute trash and I feel as if I am starting to slip into a dark state again. I feel like I don't belong at my university but every time I go home I feel out of place too as all of my friends have moved on. I have no desire to die but I can't keep living in this state. I've always dreamt about travelling on my own and gaining life experience but oftentimes my anxiety and past aspiration to become a doctor made me push those dreams to the side. 

There is little holding me back now and I'm not sure what to do. I am clearly not happy in my current situation and I have a strong urge to just pack up and leave one day without a word. I know I would like to finish the semester or possibly the year just so I don't waste so much money but I really don't want to be here anymore. 

Has anyone been through this feeling of wanting to just drop everything and leave? What did you do to combat the feeling and keep on pushing through miserable times? Maybe there's someone who has taken a gap year or gap semester before returning to school and completing their studies? If so, would you qualify it as an overall positive or negative experience?",22Oct2019,2
767,"Hello, since September I've had a very big dilemma regarding school. I'm 16yo (M) and I went to the 1st grade of high school (living in Poland, going the previous education system, 6 years of elementary school, 3 years of middle school, 3 years of high school after which you write maturity exam).
I chose biology and chemistry profile - basically med school.
I went there because of main reasons:
- I know people as this school was integrated with middle school to which I went before and almost everyone is in my class now
- there is a girl who said she loves me, we've been very close friends for a year and fell in love with her too
- my best friend went there (unfortunately he is in different class with physics, still, we see each other very often)
- I love chemistry and anatomy
- If I chose to write maturity exams from biology and chemistry I'm certain I will write them well as there are great teachers
- want to go to national chemistry competition next year, so in this school I have chances of achieving something
- money in the future of course

But there is this thing.

Since elementary school I've been going to music school. First on the violin, at the time of middle school I switched to the bassoon. I must admit I love this instrument. What's more is that I've been to many courses and competitions and world-class players say I have so much potential and can be a great player if I choose to.
I should mention that this music school has an option to integrate normal school with music (only music profile, no additional chemistry whatsoever)

The trouble begins here. For the past 9 years I managed to go to two schools, as there wasn't very hard in 'normal' school. But now things got different.

I don't have time for anything, I go to school at 8 p.m. and come back home at 8 p.m., I go to sleep at 2 am or not sleep at all, teachers obviously think that day has 30 hours instead of 24...
So either going full music or completely breaking with it.
And when it comes to the girl, she barely talks to me in comparison with . I said that we dont talk too much and I don't know what is going on with her but she doesn't see any problem and on the recess she talks to newly met friend (girl) or to a friend (also a girl) who doesn't talk to me but it's an entirely different story.


So in summary, should I choose music school or medical school?

However as I mentioned, social media is a big part of my life and of course I can’t get away from the occasional “How was your trip?” or “How’s it going with X?” But I don’t want my friendships to revolve around social media and would rather go for a beer or hang out to catch up.

I just can’t figure out a friendly way to say “Hey, I don’t wanna talk to you over some fake social media where I’m talking with a picture of you, so let’s meet up instead”

With my closest friends I’ve been able to get away with saying “Why don’t we talk about this over a beer next week?” which seems to work, but my problem comes with the people I don’t see all the time.

Just to be clear; it has nothing to do with the fact that I don’t like these people, nor that I don’t want to talk with them. It’s all about how fake it feels, chatting with someone’s photo on facebook, or a chat box.",22Oct2019,1

I tried it on- too big. Straps didn’t stay up  and I had to hold them up so as not to expose myself. I asked for a size 2. She said “I don’t think that’s going to fit.” She brought me the 2 anyways. It fit perfectly. She said “wow,  guess it did fit.”

Situation 2: I went with my boyfriend’s mom to a bra store and we were looking at some tank tops. BF’s mom is about my size, but I’m busty and she is flat-chested. My normal size is an XS, so I reached for the size S and so did she (they were out of XS) and the sales woman told me “you should try the medium. The S won’t fit you.” BF’s mom said “she likes her tank tops tight” (I don’t think she meant this in a harmful way, but it hurt my feelings). I ended up buying the S. Surprise, it fit me properly. 

Situation 3: Over the summer, BF’s family went to Paris. His mom brought me back a dress and a pair of shorts. Both a size 4. Both were too big when I tried them on. I didn’t want to say anything, but BF told his mom and she said “are you sure? I thought that’s the right size.” This happened in July but included it as it ties in to situation 2. 

How do I deal with comments like this? I know it shouldn’t be hurtful, but it really bothers me and I don’t know what else to do. I don’t mean to offend anyone by asking. It’s not my intention to lose a bunch of weight, but I thought I was in a good place body-wise and comments/actions like this make me think that maybe I’m not.",22Oct2019,1

It's hard and there are a lot of things to do in short time. The most important thing of course is your own safety and your teammates' safety.
But I have this one teammate who can't do anything (usually he just sits down and doesn't do anything and the few times he does something it is wrong or not safe) I've tried talking to him at him but he just stays stupid.
All the others in my team are really good... But this one teammate could be going to make mistakes. 
If one in the team makes a mistake, the whole team gets a mistake and if we get two, we can't pass the rest of the exam....
How can I handle this teammate? I can't always keep an eye on him, there is gonna be a lot of things to do

777,"I’ve been dabbling in making headbands, tutus, bibs, hats, and leggings for kids since I had my first daughter. Have recently been thinking about starting a small shop on Facebook. But since joining the world of small shops I see a LOT of drama with people saying other people are copying them. 

With 100+ shops each making the same items, how do you avoid being called a copier? Obviously don’t use the same fabrics / same type of fabrics as other shops around. 
But if all 100+ shops are making thanksgiving themed head wraps / leggings are people going to think I’m copying if I do the same?

781,"we went out over the weekend had a good time she enjoyed herself from what it seemed she laughed a lot. It was a good day this is our 3rd time going out we went out every week. So I asked her yesterday lets go out again on Tuesday cause I know she is free. She says ""I don't know we've been hanging out every week and I normally don't hang out with people that often my body gets tired and doesn't want to. Plus I probably won't go out at all this week."" I thought fair enough we talked on snap like normal. 

Then today I message her to come play a co-op game online which she normally would unless she is busy. She says maybe when I get home. I asked where she was going.

 She said the place one-word response.

 I then was like ""Who you going with school friends?"" 

She said ""nah""

I say ""care to elaborate?""

She says ""basketball""

Then I follow with a joke and say ""are you going by yourself?""

She says ""nah""

I have no where else to turn about this. If I tell my father and step mother I'm afraid things will turn violent. I've never been more scared in my life. 

Sorry for bad grammar, writing this on phone and hands are shaking.

So in July I started dating this boy, who is 16. I kept it a secret from my parents for obvious reasons. In my head I thought I was mature enough to handle dating a boy much older than me.

I was scared to do anything sexual other than kissing at first but slowly things progressed. Mostly just oral but one time in mid August we had vaginal sex. My period normally starts about on the 17th-ish and this was maybe the 10th.

It was in the heat of the moment so he didn't wear a condom and I'm not on birth control. He just pulled out and came on the floor.

My step mom had this stuff called Tranexamic acid and i read online that it stops periods so in a state of panic I took 6 pills hoping it would act as some kind of birth control. 

I had light bleeding like a week after (not even enough to fill one pad) and I haven't had any sort of period since. 

I feel like my stomachs getting a tiny bit bigger but I've been eating badly too.

I've been having kind of like this mild just feeling of being sick since September.  I don't know if i somehow messed myself up with moms meds or if I'm pregnant. 

My dad doesn't believe in abortion so I'm going to have to keep the baby. I've been feeling suicidal and like a slut ever since.

I don't know what to do anymore. I'm thinking about sneaking out and walking to get a pregnancy test but it's like a 2 hour walk.  My friends can't drive and my dad will want to go inside the store with me.

786,"My fiancé [31F] and I [28M] are getting married next year in November.  We are trying to finalize our guest list as we are sending out save the dates shortly.

My friend Kate of roughly 3 years, we’d like to disinvite.  Now, keep in mind we haven’t officially invited her but she’s under the impression she will be invited.  I know Kate from work, we worked on the same team for a while and went to the same gym.  It’s important to mention here that I am trans and came out last year.  When I met Kate I was a butch lesbian and she is a queer-identifying person.  It was nice to have those things in common and it still is.

 However,  over the past year or so her mental health has sort of spiraled out of control.  She stopped showing up for work, quit the gym, gained a bunch weight and made up lies and stories about things that ended up being not true or completely fabricated.  Being friends with her, I knew she had some chronic lying issues but they’re out of control.  How can I be a friend if you can be honest with me about anything?

So I confronted her on that, she apologized and agreed to be more honest and appreciated my support.  Has that changed? No.  I have a new job now so I rarely see her.

My lovely fiancé threw me a surprise 1 year on testosterone party in August.  Kate was invited and she came but stayed for about 20 minutes and my friends who made an effort to talk to her, she brushed them off or gave them one word answers.  It was weird as she prides herself on being so outgoing and being able to talk to anyone.  I was pretty embarrassed to say the least and so was my fiancé.  

In the past year outside of her mental health issues, the small circle that she did have, all ghosted her.  I am her only friend.  I’d like to think that she is the common denominator here.

I don’t want to seem insensitive or not compassionate towards her struggles but I don’t want that sort of energy at my wedding nor do I want to pay for a head that may only be there for 30 minutes.

I’ve thought about also ghosting her or having some sort of awkward convo about it.  

Any advice is appreciated or if someone has been though something similar, what did you do?

TL;DR how do I uninvite a friend I verbally invited to my wedding that’s happening next year?",22Oct2019,4

788,"Hi! I'm a fifteen-year-old living in England, and I feel like my dad loves my brother more than he loves me. 

My dad works pretty much every week, from Monday to Friday, leaving the house before I wake up and arriving home in time for dinner, and then he's too tired to really spend any time with anyone, apart from watching TV with my mum. I would occasionally watch with them, but now I have exams and I spend that time studying instead.

On Saturdays, he usually goes to the football game with my brother all day. He drops me off at maths tutoring in the morning, and then once I'm back home, he and my brother leave. They eat lunch and dinner out and by the time they've both arrived back my dad's tired again and he just wants to watch TV for a few hours. He gets irritated if I talk over the program, but I really just want to spend time with him. :&lt;

*(For context: My brother is autistic and is extremely, extremely possessive over my dad. He genuinely hates me, and he's cruel to me beyond belief. It feels bad to think this way, but I always feel anger when I see him and my dad going to football together, while I'm left at home with my mum after tutoring.)*

I've gone to football games before with them, but the large crowds make me anxious, and I don't want to deal with my brother's torment the whole time, which always happens because he's so possessive. 

On a Sunday, we usually go to my Nan's house, because she needs the company. Again, my dad doesn't really want to do anything, apart from maybe talking over dinner. 

We've tried to arrange days out when he's not going to football games, but it never materialises. I feel rejected and low when plans don't work out. The other weekend, for example, we were supposed to go to a Thai restaurant and then the local museum, but it didn't work out and I ended up going with my mum instead, a few weeks later than intended. It was fun, but she's not my dad.

Other prominent examples is when he used to go on overseas business trips, and bring me and my brother back a small, cheap souvenir. One time, he forgot to buy me one, and then after that, my brother started getting footballs and t-shirts while I was getting nothing, or maybe a bar of chocolate. That wouldn't bother me much anymore, but as a child, it was difficult to see my brother receiving things that I understood were expensive, while I would be receiving nothing. 

What can I do to change this? I don't even know how to approach it anymore. Any advice is appreciated :(",22Oct2019,1

790,"Hi there, I'm new to reddit so my apologies if I'm being a complete dingus and doing anything the wrong way. I'm definitely open to constructive criticism and that's why I'm asking for advice. I considered posting this story to r/badroommates and r/legal advice, but i noticed the first is more just for general ranting and the latter is for...well.. Legal advice - and the problem is i don't know if i SHOULD or even CAN get legal advice at this point. I'm mostly just looking for general advice from multiple perspectives and if need be I will continue my search in r/legal advice in the future.
      That being said, I'll try to stick to the story but this WILL be a long one. I honestly feel so exhausted just typing it out but I feel if I don't include all the details it wont be complete. I don't want it to sound too much like a rant but I want those who decide to tackle this novella to have as many pieces of the puzzle as they can to offer advice.
      I have a housemate I've lived with for many months now, let's call her ""Betty"". Betty has been my friend for many years and we've gotten very close. However, deciding to move in with her has proven a huge mistake. Since moving in there has been a problem around once a month or so, sometimes more or less. A problem that she's either created, instigated, or has with me and/or my boyfriend (lets call him Bob). The way she expresses her frustration is to not let anyone know we're doing something to bother her until she blows up with anger, or to be extremely passive aggressive. I've also learned by finally meeting her parents that she grew up learning that throwing tantrums gets you what you want and has carried that behavior into adulthood. 
      I don't want to make this sound like I have anything against anyone with mental illness, for I'm diagnosed with Bipolar II. I just want to include this information because obviously mental illnesses play a huge role in people's behaviors. I just want to state things she's done/does that I personally believe is making her mental state worse and also plays a huge part in damaging our friendship and house mate relationship permanently. 

Money:
      She has a huge problem with managing money which has also been somewhat learned from her parents, whom she often gets into screaming matches over asking for money where they'll say things like ""I'm not giving you another dime!"" And then the next day will give her 20, 60, 80, even a couple hundred bucks that she's asked for. She will go over to her parents house and if she sees money lying out (which they do quite often because unfortunately they are both alcoholics) she will just take it. She has a good paying job but somehow is always broke, and it's always a guess whether or not she has paid her own bills or her parents have helped or paid them in full. Her parents aren't rich by any means but they are better off than me and my boyfriends parents, who have been blue collar working class their whole lives. I don't mean this to sound butthurt, but we simply cannot ask our parents for financial assistance because they simply do not have the ability to do so. For instance, there was a situation where her car was needing hundreds of dollars in repairs and her warranty was up so her parents just paid for it. That ended up happening to us and we went completely bankrupt of all our savings to get it back on the road again. Her unsolicited take on that was ""why dont you just go buy a new car? If I can afford my car you guys can afford a new car"" but is repeatedly late on her insurance and car payment. Something we cannot afford to do. We try our best to be as frugal as possible, paying bills first and then seeing if we have any left over to have some fun or purchase an item that is unnecessary to own. We have no pets because we do not feel we are in a financial place to give a pet the care or time they deserve. She has multiple pets and has prioritized things like marijuana over them, feeding them leftovers and stuff from the kitchen until she can do uber to buy them food. And that's where we go to our next subject.

Weed:
I am by no means a stickler on marijuana. I used to smoke it daily myself. I have since quit just because I wish to live a sober lifestyle out of my own personal choice (I was an opioid addict for several years, then smoked a lot of weed, now sober). She treated me getting sober like it was some sort of emotional attack. She said that smoking weed is just ""what we do"" together and that its the way we bond and ""keep our friendship strong"". It's her choice how she spends her time but it's also my choice how I spend mine and she has accused me of being selfish because I don't want to smoke weed. She spends every day watching tv and smoking and on the weekends goes out sometimes usually to hang out and smoke with other people or spend money. I know this because I used to accompany her and she would accuse me of being selfish any time I didn't have money to go out or didn't buy anything. I do agree that marijuana is not addictive in the ways that heroin, coke, alcohol, etc. Are but i believe addiction is a mental illness and thats why there's people who can get addicted to things like on My Strange Addiction. She says out loud all the time that she needs weed to function, cannot go to work without smoking before, cannot go on break at work without smoking, cannot come home to no weed. I've seen her throw things around in her room and trash it because she smoked all her weed and has to wait a few hours to re up. Her dealer often fronts her for whatever reason and will give her multiple fronts without her paying. I've seen her owe her dealer anywhere from $20-$200 and throw tantrums when he's out of weed or is busy and can't sell to her or front her. She also throws tantrums whenever she has to pay him back and is stuck on an endless loop of all her paychecks going from around $750-$900 down to nothing after paying rent and her dealer. I've been around many types of addicts in my life and been one myself but I've personally never seen someone exhibit this type of behavior due to marijuana. This leads to the third subject.

Mental Health:
      I am not a doctor or licensed professional in any way. I've just had my fair share of years in and out of therapy and doctors offices for mental health so I get how the system works and how meds work. All the info about her diagnoses, meds, and therapy is just what she's told me (except that Ive gone with her a couple times to pick up meds or pay her talk therapist) . She has 2 therapists, one strictly talk therapist and one therapist that does hypnosis treatment on her. In my opinion her hypnosis therapist sounds terrifying unless it's just how she's describing it. She said he uses strobing lights and puts her in a room where he talks to her through headphones while she looks at the strobing lights and ""puts images"" in her head of her childhood. She had to get a new talk therapist because she told me she kept sneaking out without paying and owed them over $600 (i saw the bill but the reason is what she told me). She will often spend the money she is supposed to spend on meds on other things and is constantly going on and off her mental health meds if she can't buy a months RX. As I'm sure is obvious, being irregular with these things isn't great for your mental state. She also will skip buying her meds to buy weed. I do think weed can be a medicine but she uses it to avoid and escape her problems and emotions. I think her talk therapist seems great, but i just dont get it. She will often parrot things her therapist has taught her but will not apply it. She also uses things she learned in therapy to make excuses as to why she is allowed to be rude and hurtful. Which brings up the final segment.

Arguments:
She has multiple times now blown up and accused both me and Bob of stealing her stuff, especially her weed. Bob smokes occasionally but he buys his own and we never go in her room or take her stuff. I've been with Bob longer than I've known her and I have never seen him steal anyones weed or things and no one else has ever accused us of stealing. Her tantrums have gotten worse and worse over time. She verbally abuses Bob far worse than me, calling him all sorts of awful things and making fun of his family traumas. She tells him he's every cuss word in the book and that she hates him, literally for no reason, and says the only reason they know each other is through me (which is true) but then berates him for not being her best friend. If bob or I ask her to stop she says we're ""triggering"" her and ""disrespecting"" her. She also even before the biggest issue got caught talking about us behind our backs, making up rumors about us. She creates outlandish stories to instigate fights that we need to ""apologize"" to her for (such as saying we stole her stuff or accusing me of never doing dishes when I always do my own dishes, and ONE time had just cooked a huge meal and was cleaning my bathroom before I did the dishes - and then she broke the dishwasher in a fit and i had to fix it) and has straight up said she deserves respect as a house mate but does not have to respect us, then later says she has been respecting us. If we do not instantly comply with her demands she goes apeshit. Any time we try to confront her about her verbally abusive behavior, false claims, or passive/overt aggressive behavior she says we're ""gaslighting"" her even if we have proof she has blatantly lied. She says we tell her she's crazy all the time and we have never told her that. During the most recent argument (about a month ago) she accused us of stealing from her again and then was verbally abusing us both and then decided she would group text her awful BS to us because she ""doesnt like confrontation"". She has all the gall in the world when texting but will not say any of it to our faces and instead chooses to roll her eyes at us and talk to us with a bratty tone of voice and treats us like we're stupid. I told her I wasn't going to put up with any of this behavior and that if she wanted to respectfully talk about the situation like adults that we could. She declined by continuing to verbally abuse Bob and I in an endless rant of how she has ""trust issues"" and ""childhood trauma"" (she does have that but im quoting bc she said it) which she says gives her the right to talk to us however she wants. But no matter how calm we remain, use no insults, no verbal abuse etc. She just dismisses everything we say as lies or refuses to address it. She also has said her feelings are more important than facts and that she can prove we're lying because her intuition is so strong and if she feels like we're lying that means its true. No matter what we say she says it's a lie, and she will not let either of us talk without interrupting with screaming insults or stomping away and slamming doors/things. 
      
The most recent thing that has happened is she has accused me of keeping her pet in my room while shes away at work, after she asked me to keep him out of my room while shes home and i agreed. I wake up at very strange hours of the morning for my job and so often come home exhausted and take naps. She knows this. I fell asleep with my door open ONE time and the cat hid under my bed. She said I was lying that I was asleep and that I was keeping him in my room on purpose and left me a passive aggressive note telling me I need to keep my door shut all the time, even when she's at work and I'm home, and that I need always to watch him while she's at work so he doesn't go in my room. She's gone 10-11 hours a day 5 days a week and goes out almost every weekend. The pet is lonely and cries constantly whenever he is left alone so I often give him attention when I'm out doing laundry or cooking. I did not lie that I never purposefully put him in my room but I do give him attention and play with him because the only attention he gets from her is her sleeping, or smoking and watching tv. Any time I open my bedroom door he instantly runs in because hes lonely and craves attention. She will not teach him to stop doing this and says it's my fault because I'm ""putting"" him in there. Due to me falling asleep and him entering and hiding in my room without my knowledge ONCE, she has now said that almost every time she comes home she sees him running out of my room. This is physically impossible because i know exactly when she works and keep my door shut when shes coming home from work with him shut out into the common area. I also know when she comes home when she's out doing things when she's off because she stomps up the stairs and her car and person can be heard several minutes before she even enters the home. And she slams the door when she enters as well. He has never run out of my room besides that once. 

She leaves me passive aggressive notes which I have chosen to ignore because I told her I wasnt going to encourage or condone her treating me like that and that I would only talk to her in an adult mature manner. She constantly tries to tell me what to do all the while refusing to confront me to my face, and keeps piling on the lies. The worst part is i genuinely cant tell if she truly believes what shes saying. I have responded to her fits multiple times with calm respectful responses and every time have been met back with hostility and false accusations, or she just refuses to answer and starts yelling or leaving notes about another subject. 

I am worried about our lease being up soon because bob and i are trying to transfer to another apartment, but we cannot afford a 2br by ourselves and dont have anyone else to be a reliable room mate as all our friends and people we know already have their own homes or apartments. The landlord also said whenever the lease is soon to be up we will all 3 have to go discuss about what we want to do, and i have no idea if she will cooperate and even show up at all or perhaps make a scene in public (shes made scenes in public before for not getting her way). I cannot get her legally evicted without getting everyone evicted even though she is breaking the lease with her pets, the lease states we would all be evicted. The landlord is very nice and wants to help us get our own 1br but cannot do anything about the people already on the waiting list. 

Should i ignore her like you would a schoolyard bully? 
Should i try to confront her in person again about her behavior?
Should i try to build a legal case against her to get a restraining order? (If i need legal advice i will go to r/legaladvice) 

Should i try to find other room mates? I dont want this nightmare to happen again and it's been shown friends can turn into this so a complete stranger is even scarier! 

Should I try talking to my landlord again and give them more details about the situation? So far i have only told them it's ""not working out"" because we have conflicting personalities and that bob and i want our own place as a couple which is true. I just dont want the landlord to be unloaded with all this random stuff that doesnt concern them at all, is not their job, and rant to them. I want to show the landlord bob and i are valuable tenants as we pay our bills in full and on time whereas she is wishy washy on whether she does or not. 

I feel like I have no idea what to do because these are the only apartments in the area we can afford which is why we chose them in the first place. We have NO backup place to stay and would be homeless. We could possibly afford other apartments in the area with room mates, but the closest apartments to these are $400 to $500 more a month for 2brs because ours are low income apartments (idk why theyre really nice in my opinion but i grew up in a trailer so what do i know). These are also the only apartments in the area we can afford a one bedroom by ourselves. We are doing everything we can to work hard and make as much money as possible, but we can't afford to up and move to a different town/city right now and really need to have a place to live. I've been homeless before and have worked my ASS off to have a normal house and normal life and the thought of being homeless again brings tears of fear to my eyes. I trusted her as my friend and moved in with her because I didn't have anywhere else to go and now this. I'm worried she will either do something to get me fucked over or that just not living with her anymore will mean having to move in with complete strangers or worse, us not being able to find an available apartment less than 2brs, meaning too expensive. We both are constantly striving to move upward in our jobs and make bigger and better career choices to make more money but that takes time. Time that takes longer than what we have now which is only a few months. Bobs boss is talking about giving him a promotion and raise to salary soon but we don't know if it's solid yet. We both also do side jobs to make extra. 

What should I do?????? And sorry for so long of a post.
Sincerely,
A confused and exasperated human being",22Oct2019,2
791,"So my neighbour wants me to move out (im a friendly person but she wants to  ""out bucket covers"" \*me ). I have problems for 1,5 years now (not only me)

Examples (mostly happens when im alone in appartment with her) : daily music until 1 am, several times even later (3 am), using my stuff, badmouthing, insulting,  being extra dirty and forcing others to clean up her stuff, denying to do handywork or let craftsman in, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Ive tried talking with her ca. 10 times about her music. Didnt get better. House management sent her several letters (I had revenge actions like waking me up at 4 am and displaying the management letter on the fridge for several months)

Now we had a quarrel again. Usually she keeps the (only) post-key for several days and I cannot get my letters (which is ok for me). Im doing electricity bills managing for the appartment and we will have to pay extra money beause someone moved out (25€ which we will receive back). Shes was angry and hid toilet paper/my pepper/woke me up at 4 am again. 

This time I had the post key because I forgot to put it back. I had it from Saturday to Monday 12:00. She wanted to have it on Sunday 12:00 after she didnt let me sleep, because shes expecting a superimportant letter. I was totally wasted (too much alcohol + she didnt let me sleep that night)

Anyway She locked me in my room on monday and I called the police emergency, after that she came into my room without me wanting it and also heavily insulted me. 

&amp;#x200B;

6 months ago house management told me they cannot do anything and I should go to the police. I always tried to be friendly despite all this and didnt want to take legal action. Going to police would mean serious problems for her. 

Im scared because shes always shouting out loud like shes the victim and tries to blame me.

I dont want to be a victim anymore - would it be acceptable to sue her which would mean she would get into serious legal trouble?

We arranged a date tomorrow, thing is i didnt know how old she was, i looked through her fb and she put a post up just iver a week ago saying shes 18 in 3 minths. Problem is im a male, 20, and ill be 21 in 6 minths. I dont really know what i should do. Weve been talking for a few days and i do like her but the age gap has made me a bit uncomfortable, (i thought she was 18) ive already agreed to meet her tomorrow before i knew what age she was and i dont know if i should cancel and just stop talking or not. Like if she was already 18 and i was 21 i wouldnt have an issue with that. My concern is even though shes close to being 18 shes still not yet (i live in the UK so legally its perfectly fine) plus i am worried about what others would think, i dont want to get branded as something im not.

793,"Months ago, two of my friends came to me with a business idea. The goal was not to make a ton of money but more for fun. That went well for about a month, then the two friends, R and N got into a lot of disagreements about creative differences. At this point, I was highly considering bailing on the idea but N did it before I could say anything. Afterwards, R told me how betrayed that made her feel so I said nothing and stayed on. 

I don't want to do this business anymore. My original plan years ago was to stay home with my children until they started school and I just do not want to get into a more than full time gig running a business that started out as a fun project.

794,"So I apologise for the typos that I know will make their way  into this post. I'm typing with one hand out at the lake smoking a cigar with the other.

I'm in my late twenties, and due to medical reasons I had a late start on my adult life. I work at a bank, but it's the second lowest paying job I've ever had at $11 an hour.  When I was interviewed the manager misled me on the potential pay.

 I was told he didn't really need people but my background (sales,retail, management at two of the jobs,armed security, fraud investigation, and some warehouse work) interested him. He told me he knows the starting pay is low, but there is the potential to almost double your pay within 6 months-a year. I figured a 75% increase wasn't out of the realm of possibility as this would put me in the high teens, which didn't seem like a too good to be true situation since other local banks start at 15-18 an hour.

I'm a week away from my 90 day mark, and another new hire who has an even better background than I do was told he would be at the 18-20 range in six months. He started at $13 an hour and is about a month from his 6 month mark. He has exceeded his growth plan that he and the manager agreed on to hit that pay rate, and he is only at $14.25 an hour. 

We were told our sales of account upgrades was our main factor in raises, and the first month and a half I sold more than double the next highest seller (the other new hire, who also has a background in sales). Emails went out to neighboring regions about it since my manager likes to brag on good numbers. Whatever.. 

After finding out about the stuff going on with the other hire, and with him already exceeding sales goals by roughly 25% and the rest of the team borderline getting written up for poor sales it left a bad taste in my mouth. Where's the motivation to try and have good numbers when someone else is exceeding all required numbers for a good raise and still getting shafted?

Glassdoor has the average branch manager making ~$15 an hour. We have a former branch manager of almost ten years who stepped down to a loan officer making under fourteen an hour who works her ass off.

I'm honestly not sure if I like the job. The bank is near the ghetto and all we have is people coming in wanting their overdraft and trying to cash fake checks. We had one written in pencil a while back. ""If I can't cash this how you expect me to get high?!""  Turnover is very high, shocker right?

Here's the thing, my family wants me to stay atleast six month to get it on my resume. This $11 an hour is killing me.  I've debated on trying to apply at another bank that doesn't take me 50 mins-an hour to get to and doesn't have ten hour shifts, but honestly I feel like I'm already getting too annoyed with the thought of banking.  I found a job making $16 an hour near me that's part of a union just sweeping public buses after their routes are finished. 

My grandfather passed away in June and I moved in with my grandmother to take care of her.Bills and such aren't an issue for her (he left her over 200k after taxes, plus a few vehicles to sell, ontop of her disability check  and the partial one she draws off of him since he passed). She brings home almost twice what I do not counting what's in the bank so I stay there rent free for helping take care of her.

Right now after my car note, ins, phone, food, and ins I'm able to save roughly 400 a month if I'm really tight on stuff. If I was making almost 16 an hour I could manage twice that fairly easily, especially if I paid the other two grand on my car off.


I know what I want to do in the future, but I need money for land, two years funds, and a few k for start up. Cheap land can be had here for under a 5k down payment fha and roughly 400 a month mortgage. So there is 15k including two years mortgage, 10k for two years funds (will be high intensity micro- farming so food cost will be negligible). And 5k for my startup costs. So basically 30k or so to really get going. I can't wait 10+ years at my current pay to get to that goal. 

I don't think id like working at another financial institution, but I do have health problems that would make a  fast paced job that is physically demanding problematic.I mean I'm not thirty and I've had a few strokes and almost died a couple of times. It's not as near as big of an issue now but I have good and bad days.

Yesterday and today were my first times calling out of a job since March. I got physically ill from having a panic attack feeling trapped in this situation.  


It doesn't help matters that this girl I like confuses the hell out of me. I've known her probably a year now, and NO ONE can tell if she likes me. We assumed she did since she bought me dinner, talks to her parents and friends about me ""ALL THE TIME"" (their words not mine), she's tried going to work to see me (on my day off) and does other little things, like texting me if I don't come see her at work to talk to her. The rest of the time there is no texting at all.When I do go to her work(her 2nd job is a waitress at a place I've gone to for seven years and they know me by name) she will sit and talk to me for an hour or two and tell me about her day and such.

 She finally convinced me to church with her the other day then told me to sit 7 chairs away from her. Then she left after barely speaking to me. Didn't ask how I liked it or anything, and this was well after I told her I usually dislike church and hadn't been in eight years. She is so into church she goes on mission trips and volunteers 5-10 hours a week. 

I would text her but I don't think she likes me, I think she's just being nice (she's only 19 so me being around 8 years older and texting her could get really creepy if she doesn't like me). I haven't tried making a move for that same reason.Shits just frustrating.

There's other shit in life, but those are my only two things I've been stressing about. Any ideas on what to do?",22Oct2019,1
795,"I'll spare the details and try to be descriptive without them.

I'm a computer guy.  I work at an ""MSP"" (Managed service provider) - in short, we're the computer guys for companies around us who can't afford or don't want to hire their own.

In short, I'm an overthinking computer nerd. Not much on our customer's networks goes on without us knowing about it- but this isn't a question about their networks.

This is a question about OUR own network, here at our office.

I'm the busy tech here who works for two partners.  Small shop.

One partner is the ""go-getter"", the fella who doesn't know how to say no.  ""Heck yes, let's make this happen"". Like-a-bility: 11/10.

The other partner is similar, but doesn't actually do most of the lifting.  They're the more ""salesman"" type.

That ""other partner"" has spent most days for the last month, using a standard ""NordVPN"" sort of VPN client to download monstrous amounts of explicit material.  I can't outright see the exact domains they're downloading from, but we have remote tools that report disk usage.  Every day I see this happening, their laptop loses \~100GB of storage space and it's all in their ""temp"" folder, all with explicit titles.  Videos.

Now, I'm no idiot.  I know this happens all the time.  That said, I don't often catch ***my boss*** doing it.  That's the part I don't know how to properly react to.

I like my job.  I want to keep it.  This particular person is the ""top of the food chain"".  There's nobody above them to speak with.

796,"Hi everyone. The title says it all. 

I have been with this company for a little over a year and I honestly love my job. When I got hired, I really undervalued myself because I understood I didn’t have 100% the background they were looking for but I was willing to work hard and I also continued my education and got a certificate in my field (which set me back about $10k) so I could have the coursework that would directly help me with my role. 

I talked to one of my colleagues a few months before my 1 year &amp; asked his how raised worked. He said he had been there 2 years and hasn’t gotten a raise. You only get a raise if you get promoted. 

Since I started working here, I’ve taken on many many tasks that the person before me never did (and I know because she often says to me “Oh, I never did that when I was in that position”) and I know things are going well because I would’ve definitely heard about it if things were not going well. 

Today we had a benefits meeting and we’re all going to have to pay more for our insurance. My boss asked me after the meeting if everything made sense because some of it didn’t go him and asked me if I had any concerns about the benefits (they’re honestly not changing, I just have to pay more).

It didn’t dawn on me until I got home just now but I feel like now would be a good time to bring up the possibility of a raise? I just don’t know how to go about it. I was hoping somebody in this group has been in a similar position and could give me some advice on how they went about it.

He's stayed a few times and is staying again tonight, what do I say to her without being a dick? Me and her get along super well, we legit enjoy coming home after a bad day of work to just hang out with each other, we even do stuff on the weekends together, so this needs to be said in a calm, not possessive way... if that makes sense.

802,"My husband (26M) and I (25F) have been together for 7 years and up to this point have been in a solid relationship. About a month ago we were having some pillow talk while flipping through a book that had different sex positions and things to try. We were talking with one another about things we’d like to try and, to be honest, I felt very safe and secure sharing. We came to a page that talked about experimenting with a threesome, and he asked me if that was something I’d ever want to try. I had never thought about it before, so I was slow in my response so I could think it through before giving him an answer. I told him I would consider it with another guy, but it depends on who. He began asking me other questions, almost like he was interested, and I entertained them. When we really got into talking and I thought more about it, I told him that this isn’t something I feel is super proper in a serious relationship, but I didn’t necessarily oust the idea if that was something he was interested in. When I asked him his thoughts, he told me that he had never thought about it, and that he doesn’t have much of an opinion at the moment. He thanked me for sharing and we moved on with our day.

Later that night he told me that he was thinking about our talk some more and that he definitely doesn’t like the idea of sharing me, and also doesn’t have an interest in sharing himself with someone else. When he was saying that, he seemed very comfortable and confident in what he was saying, and I told him I had no reservations in that. He seemed almost like he had more to say, but we moved on again.

The next day is when things got tricky. He was noticeably upset and when I asked him about it, he said that he felt very insecure with our conversation and that he wished he never asked. He told me he couldn’t stop thinking about it, and that he is sorry for questioning me so much. He said he has a hard stance on monogamy and that the fact I could even consider something like this repulses him. He apologized for asking the question and reacting this way, and that he didn’t realize it was going to upset him so much.

Since then, he has been on and off. He seems very withdrawn at times, and other times he is completely normal. He has brought it up 3 or 4 times since then and honestly I just want to moved past it. I’m at the point now when he brings it up I just get frustrated because we’ve already talked about this so many times. I told him I don’t think it’s proper for our relationship and something that I have no need/interest in pursuing and he can’t seem to get that into his head.

When I met my boyfriend we were both pro-choice and believed in god but not to the point of letting it dictate our lives for us. However, over the years he has become a follower of God and is now like he has been brainwashed by his mum who is a Christian. He is now pro-life, doesn't believe gay people should get married even though his best friend is gay and has been gay before my boyfriend 'found god'. The cherry on top is he believes people who commit suicide go to hell which pisses me off the most as my cousin recently committed suicide and I believe that you never know what anyone is going through. 

This type of person is not him, he was understanding, wanted to help everyone and now it just seems like he has been brainwashed over the fear of what will happen in the afterlife and as well as how the world was at the time of him becoming religious due to terror attacks etc. I recently came out as bisexual to him, he was sceptical at first but is now okay with it from me explaining everything but I feel like he doesn't fully get it if that makes sense.

I knew his mum was a hardcore Christian from the start but he always played it off as 'my mum is away with the pixies crazy' type of religious and now he is behaving just like her. She is a Christian who is self-righteous but irionally can't go to mass due to being hungover. She goes to rallies for pro-life rights and even when she drinks she talks about her views which is a real damper on the mood. I have to hide who I really am as a person because I know she won't like me, I am bisexual, pro-choice , I was once Buddhist for a short time which my boyfriend told me she will never find out about, I was Wiccan for a long time like me and my mother were both Wiccan which my boyfriend mother will never know about. I don't go to mass at all. I believe in gay rights and marriage instead of a partnership.

His mum is too opinionated and it is driving me nuts as I don't trust myself drinking around her as I am afraid to mention me being pro-choice when she starts her 'Pro-life, against gay marriage, suicides go to hell' rants when she is drinking. I don't want her getting into my boyfriend's head with ""are you sure you are compatible?"" or making a big deal out of me not being the pretty woman for her son or whatever.

If I watch a movie, I always see what could have been executed better even if I enjoyed the movie. I guess I am realistic in that way. A lot of people around me complain I am too critical, correct other too much and too often and that I nitpick or am I pedantic.

I guess I have high expectations for myself. It makes it difficult for me to align myself with anyone or anything because I need to know all the facts before making any choice. A lot of people become upset with me because I am skeptical about what people tell me. I do not believe anyone or immediately. I notice a lot of people like to be believed without clear evidence.

I thought I would love it so much that I'd want to stay 7 months. Now I have a rental contract and everything, and I've told everyone it is 7 months long. I chose to miss out on some time at university back home, because I thought it would be worth it for the longer experience here. But I've been  here 1.5  months and I'm really struggling.

I come from really strictly-taught law classes back home which give me a great feeling of accomplishment and interest, but here I am not intellectually stimulated at all. This is a huge issue, and the courses sounded much better in the syllabus when I was researching them. I am also struggling to make any deep form of connection because most people here are party-oriented which I used to have the energy for but just don't anymore.

Honestly me in the past probably would've gotten along with them and had the energy to put myself out there, but the me that's a bit older doesn't seem to care to put effort in, which I know is my fault. It is just so tiring. I also did a month in Spain last year and loved it, which made me want to come again for a full exchange, and I feel like I'm just doing things I've already done and getting into a hole of 'what's the point'- I'm not learning anything, I'm paying a lot, I'm sacrificing time on my already very long degree that I need to finish back home... For example, I'm doing an exchange student trip this weekend to a place I already visited last year, with lots of partying for 2 nights in a row when I can barely handle 1. I'm scared of just breaking down and crying the whole time. I'm only 21 but wow do I sound old. I also really thought I'd become fluent in Spanish here- which is why I came- and I'm level B2, but I still cannot understand nor talk very well 1.5 months in. Added bonus: there are huge protests here and cars and streets close to my house have been set on fire and there is no telling when these things will end. Another added bonus: my stomach is disagreeing with everything here and I constantly need to use the bathroom (also scared about the exchange trip for this reason).

I am considering  leaving after 1 trimester (Just under a 4 month stay in total),  getting only some credit back home, and seeing my long distance boyfriend who I miss so much. I don't know- I am a really academic person and the lack of academics here, the idea  of partying all the time instead, is effecting me really deeply. But I can see me being really disappointed with myself for not sticking it out. Being disappointed with the trip would follow me forever. I also would have to continue to pay 3 months rent in a very expensive apartment (in terms of prices back home) despite not being there.  At the same time, the thought of being at home also depresses me, because I have 2.5 more years of my degree to complete, and I know that this is the only big break I'll ever get from my quiet home town.  


Thank you for letting me vent. I don't know, I just want some advice. I think I'm heading into a depression. My thoughts are constantly negative. Maybe if I stay it will get better. Some days I do like it here. Right now I feel awful.",22Oct2019,1
816,"So basically my sister lives on her own with her son and 5 cats. My mother and I have 1 cat, 2 dogs, 2 birds and a fish and our cat is FIV positive with immunity issues. Our pets are mostly rescues with some kind of health issues. 

Anyway my sister needs to move out. We have said we will make room here however because of the FIV cat we cannot have anymore cats (It's actually not allowed and we can get charged with allowing the infection to spread to other animals). 

My sister is acting completely unreasonable. She told us;

\- The cats can live in the garage. Our garage easily gets 40' on a 25' day. It's not safe and its not fair to the animals

\- She can live in the car with the cats

\- She is going to roll her car to the park while getting us to raise her son

We have suggested finding homes. She said ""These cats have been there for me when no one else was."" I am lost for words. I am someone who has gone vegan in the past and in my opinion she is risking both her well being and the cats just for the sake of the cats being her pets. 

I'm really not sure how to get through to her that she is looking at doing the worst thing for all three parties. We even found a fostering system at $12 a day per cat.  But she has decided that is $100 a day per cat for some reason. I have told her the pets are at risk with her plan. She just says I'm bullying her.",22Oct2019,1
817,"So i take a 6:30pm to 9:45pm chem class. However this teacher always gets us out by 8:30, sometimes even earlier. On lab days when we finish we can leave early.

He rushes every aspect of the lab, and the last class he quickly wrote down everything, rushed me to just ""take a picture"" of rhe data I had actually collected, then rushed out and left me with the wrong formulas to write on the class averages.

Hi Reddit. I (19F) need help/advice. I think I was sexually assaulted by my cousin (27M)  a few years ago. A part of me knows the truth, but the other part can’t fully admit it even to myself, let alone anyone else. I’m sorry this is so long, but I chose to keep a lot of details that I felt were important to this. This actually happened during Nov/Dec of 2015 - July of 2016. I grew up in a big family and all of the cousins were very close, like best friends. The cousin, let’s call him John, entered my life when I was about 4 when his family moved to my town. We lived together until I was 12, and although we fought a lot, there was nothing weird about our relationship at that point. John was always somewhat manipulative and very aggressive, but he was also “funny” and almost always got his way. His family moved only a few mins away, so it was very normal for me to go to my aunt and uncle’s house, and I would stay the night often because I couldn’t drive. When I was 15, my aunt &amp; uncle went on a trip out of the country for 30-45 days. I stayed over at their house a lot during this time because John (24 years old at this time) would not come home sometimes, and his younger sister (Bethany, 21) was bored and didn’t want to stay alone. I’ve always been very warm/hot, so I slept in the coldest room, which happened to be John’s room. He slept in his parents’ room anyway so this wasn’t an issue, or that’s what I thought. One night, I heard someone come into the room so I looked to see who it was. It was John, and he said he was cold so he came to my room. I thought this was strange, but I didn’t really think much of it. He lied down in bed, and I just tried to sleep again. Eventually, he got very close and put his arm around me and put his leg on mine, and I froze. He left after an unknown amount of time. The next night he came back again and did the same thing (cuddled up behind me - big spoon). He put his hand in my shirt this time, and his thumb was touching my underboob which made me extremely uncomfortable. I was 15, this was my first cousin, and I knew this should not be happening. A week later, Bethany was pretty sick so she was taking NyQuil every night to sleep. She was already a very deep sleeper, so there was no way she was going to wake up. John wasn’t supposed to come home that night, so I was relieved deep down. Well, he ended up coming home that night. He came into my room again, and did the same thing, except he just slowly grabbed my boob this time. I moved his hand and scooted away, but he just slowly moved back. At this point, I was absolutely terrified. He put his hand on my boob again and kept it there. I told him to stop and moved away, and he said, “Just 10 more minutes. I’m leaving after that.” A few days later, the same stuff happened but he put his hand in my underwear and just kept it on my pelvic/hip area. I tried to get up, but he just kinda held me there, not super aggressively though. I was scared that it was going to get way worse, because if he thought it was okay to touch his younger cousin like that, how did I know he wouldn’t try to more? Eventually, his parents came back, so I didn’t stay the night much anymore, but when I did, he would sneak into the guest bedroom where I would sleep on the pretense of being “cold” and sneak back to his room before his parents woke up. During one of these times, John tried to get me to sit on top of him and I just got up and left. I thought it stopped after a while, because as far as I remember nothing happened for a couple of months. He would randomly kiss my neck and pull at my shorts/underwear when I would see him, but nothing more than that until my cousin’s wedding in June. He came into mine and Bethany’s room while we were sleeping because he had a key (long story). I think he was drunk/high/crossed, and he did the same thing. For some reason, I had kept my bra on and he put his hand under my bra and said, “Ahhhhh, this is exactly what I needed.” I waited until he fell asleep and just went into the bathroom and cried. Either he had no recollection of doing this, or he didn’t see anything wrong in actions, just like all of the other times. I never said anything about this to anyone, and I tried really hard to not think about it. I didn't want to believe that someone who I treated like my brother and I trusted with my life would do this to me. I was depressed and shaken for a long time, but no one seemed to notice. I think this was too traumatic for my brain to process, and it was something that has randomly surfaced and I always just pushed it down. Am I overthinking everything, or did my cousin molest me? I need an unbiased opinion, and this might be the only place I can get that. 

Also, a lot of this resurfaced for me in the past couple of days and I’m still processing it (delayed recall). Please don’t suggest telling someone/my parents or confronting him. There's a very good chance I won't be believed and I truly don’t think I’m ready for that.",22Oct2019,2

822,"I like to know everything and to always be right. I am not exaggerating either. I become horribly embarrassed when I am wrong or when I am corrected. I hide my embarrassment through humor - I make sure to point of my flaws before someone else either through honesty or humor. How can I relax? I am naturally rather critical and skeptical. If I watch a movie, I always see what could have been executed better even if I enjoyed the movie. I guess I am realistic in that way. A lot of people around me complain I am too critical, correct other too much and too often and that I nitpick or am I pedantic.

I guess I have high expectations for myself. It makes it difficult for me to align myself with anyone or anything because I need to know all the facts before making any choice. A lot of people become upset with me because I am skeptical about what people tell me. I do not believe anyone or immediately. I notice a lot of people like to be believed without clear evidence. Just because we are friends or family that does not mean I have to believe you and this angers a lot people. Why I wonder?

824,"She didn’t message me for a month. I called her today and I also messaged her but she hasn’t called back. She did message me back she said she was busy with work and that she didn’t have  time to reply because she has to make time for her boyfriend. I asked her if she wants to meet up and she didn’t reply for 6 hours. I then messaged her “ it’s okay if you don’t want to meet up I was just asking”. She replied back “Oh okay”

We didn’t meet up in person for over a year. She would always say she’s too busy. I think I care more about this friendship than she does. She was never really a good friend but I hanged on to this friendship because she was one of the few friends I had. Should I reply back to her or should I ghost her?  

She told me that if she gets married she doesnt want her husband to meet me because she would get jealous. I laughed it off thinking she wasn’t serious, but I guess she was. In college I remember I helped her with her paper once and printed it out for her, but she never came to pick it up, she once made me wait for 30 minutes and she never came to pick it up . She never finished college. I know she’s not all at fault because I used to get passive aggressive with her. Whenever we meet up she would never talk like she would just stay silent and only respond to my questions.  She was nice but she never talked much

Anyways should I message her back? If yes what should I say? Or should I just ghost her?",22Oct2019,3

826,"I (27F) have repeatedly engaged in behaviours that would be considered sociopathic.. 
I've slept with taken men, as well as cheating on my own partners. 
I gossip and unable to keep secrets. 
I like to 'break the rules' - sorry for the cliche. 
I'm impulsive and rarely think of the consequences of my actions, until it's too late. 
I've accepted money/gifts in exchange for sex.
I'm an all or nothing kind of person.. extreme is the only way I feel anything. 
The thing is though, I feel shame, I dislike who I am. I've been trying to be a better person but I don't seem to be making better decisions. 

On the 7th of this month, I had a mental health assessment. They think I could have borderline personality disorder and attachment disorder. I have to have a more thorough evaluation to determine if that's the right diagnosis. 
Aswell as my mental health issues, I've struggled with my physical health, with no diagnosis to present as evidence of my daily struggles. 
I feel like a joke. 

I live in a small town, it's a fish bowl. People in this town will definitely have heard the rumours of my behaviours. 
I notice people side eye me, or sigh/huff upon my approach. 
I'm incredibly aware of a shift in peoples attitudes toward me. 

For the last 6 months I've really worked on trying to better myself. But I still fall into social mishaps. I struggle being at work because I feel like everyone hates me.. I say the wrong thing or let slip things I shouldn't. It's like I have no control of what I'm saying. 

It's like I subconsciously sabotage any sort of friendship/relationship. I push my family away when I have an emotional meltdown. And if someone does seem alright with me, I wonder why. I question their intentions and shut them out. 

So, socially, I'm at rock bottom. In a hole without a ladder. I feel it might not get better for a long time. I dont blame people for judging me.. I would judge me. 
Please be kind. I know some of my actions aren't the norm. I torture myself enough.

Her telling me, ""you're a cold hearted bitch""

2 years on, that one tiny sentence still drives me completely nuts and makes me so upset.  I constantly worry that people think I'm cold hearted  and it just.... It's frustrating and sad and honestly, pathetic and lonely. 

I'm sad and pathetic and a complete weirdo for *still* being hung up on this. Girl is not right anyway and had/has mental issues given I lived with her in a year of hell.

832,"This might look trivial but it's making me desperate, so dear redditors, please give me your views, I need an external opinion. I recently started at a new job and spent a month with an  introductory course with other newbies. Later we have been assigned to different departments. I work in a very small one where I have contact only with my boss and a couple of people. Usually every department takes a coffee break and go together to the company cafeteria, but my boss told me that she goes out for coffee with her friends (a couple of them happen to be the other colleagues at my department), so there is no ""official"" coffee break for us. She told me that I might want to have coffee with the other newbies (which was the case at the beginning), but I could join her if I wanted. I did it once  but I felt strange since it was all private conversations and jokes  among them and I felt I was inserting myself in their group of friends. These days the other newbies started going for coffee with their department colleagues and sometimes I go to the cafeteria and join whoever is there that I know, but as no one ever calls me for this and I'm not really close friends with anyone, I skip the break often. It seems that someone told my boss that I haven't been seen at the cafeteria so she told me if I  am not having coffee with the other newbies, I can tell her and join her and her friends; she says coffee break is mandatory. Now I feel trapped. I need to go for coffee or I will be labelled as unsociable or weird. The other newbies are very lucky that their colleagues look for them and go together as a team, but I feel uncomfortable showing up every day alone and uninvited to join the other groups. My boss' offer is kind but since she herself specified that what she has is a daily meetup with friends, I don't feel comfortable joining them either (plus, is she offering only to avoid office gossip?). This is the first time something like this happens to me, I never had problems to socialize at work and always did well in coffee, lunches or office drinks. I also have to say that I am one of the oldest newbies (40yr old) and it seems some of the younger ones don't want to socialize with me, so that hinders even more my efforts to fit in. This might seem a trivial issue but it's giving me high levels of anxiety. It's my situation that unfortunate or am I overreacting?

839,"I’m in my last semester of community college. I have a prof who teaches 2 of my classes and refuses to use canvas as it’s “not apart of her job” and that statement has changed  because the first 14 (1x a class for 2 classes for 7 weeks)  times I asked it was “I’ll see what I can do” I got accommodations for a semester long project (last week she finally settled on what it is and it’s due in 2-3 weeks or so). I finally flipped out on her personally (not my best moment) after going to 3 advisors and the program coordinator with no support or success. I told her I would be seeking assistance out from academic affairs at this point because she is refusing assistance to me. Today I got an email revoking my accommodation and to me it screams retaliation. 


I’m not a bad student I got accepted into our honor society and all that Jazz so I can definitely handle classes but it’s her attitude and refusal to post our assignments anywhere that I’m not meshing well with or being successful with (I normally do online classes but this wasn’t offered online). My professor also will sit and bash the teachers she works with because she doesn’t agree with how they teach (I’m an education major so this is bad) and it makes me seriously question my major which I have never done because I already work in my local public school system and love it. But hearing her bash other teachers makes me seriously question everything.


Like I said I’ve been in contact with not only her but multiple advisors and members of academic affairs since the first week of classes. (Lower members of academic affairs my next meeting is with the Vp of academic affairs and the next step is going to the President of my school)

Any advice on what I should do? Any advice what I should say to academic affairs, Because at this point I want them to 

A) make her do her job and use canvas correctly

B) transfer me to different classes

C) remove me from the classes and give me a refund for my professors incompetence and my wasted time.",22Oct2019,1

844,"I have had a thing for my my ex-wifes friend (Lets call her Jenny) for some time. I've known Jenny for about 4 years and hang out with her every few months or so (my ex-wife and I hang out with her together, I don't usually hang out with Jenny alone). After a few months into knowing her, I began to notice the desire to see if we would be good together. 

I should explain that I am still on good terms with my wife, I still love her as a person despite the fact that we didn't work out in the long run, and we still talk everyday because we click very well on a friendship level. It was my decision to divorce her, so I am grateful that she is able to continue to be friends despite that. I do think that she still has feelings for me though, at some level. She touches me in ways that I find too affectionate (which I have had to set boundaries for) and gets quite jealous when I talk about other girls, which she tries to excuse as just not liking other girls being interested in her friends.

When I began to notice feelings for Jenny, I soon after told my ex-wife since we have always been very open and honest with each other. She told me that she isn't upset, but that it would be very selfish of me to tell Jenny that I'm into her and that it would ruin their relationship, therefore I should keep it to myself. I decided to respect my ex-wifes request since I did not want to mess up their friendship. I began to distance myself from Jenny over time (making excuses whenever she asked us both to go out) but every once in a while I would hang out with her because I felt that I had gotten over her. But it would all come back to me once I was with her again and I would keep getting frustrated and depressed about not being able to pursue anything afterwards. It's not that I don't expect it to happen, I just kinda trick myself into thinking it wont be as bad this time. But it always hurts, It's a real struggle holding back the part of me that wants her to know.
 
Recently, for the first time, I went out with Jenny on my own. She had asked both my ex-wife and myself to go somewhere, but my ex-wife didn't feel like coming along. Despite that, she continued to ask for me to go with her, which I found exciting. I really liked that she wanted to be with just me. It was a nice night, I felt that spark more than I had before and found myself fantasizing of us being together even more-so than usual. I keep my feelings well hidden and do not do anything that I would consider to be a signal or a giveaway, but I have a feeling that she knows I like her, or at least suspects that I might. She often touches me or finds excuses for me to touch her and I have caught her glancing at me a couple of times, though I could be mistaken and misinterpreting things. After this last outing though, the aftermath was a lot harder to swallow. It stung harder than the other times and I really considered going against my ex-wifes wishes and telling Jenny how I feel. But I slept on it and again talked myself down.

Now I'm just left with this mixture of disgrace, frustration and sadness. I feel like a bad person for  considering telling Jenny how I feel without regard for the possible negative consequences. I feel frustrated and sad because I feel like I will never be able to see what Jenny and I could be, if anything. I feel as though my only real option is to cut myself off from her completely, but I don't know how to do that without her thinking she did something wrong. 

So, am I being a selfish asshole for wanting to try with Jenny? if so, how can I move on?

TLDR: I've had a crush on my ex-wifes friend for a long time. My ex-wife doesn't want her to find out and asked me never to tell her, since it would ruin their friendship. Yet, I often find myself coming close to telling her. Am I being selfish?",22Oct2019,1
845," 

It’s been a few days of writing this out and then deleting it moments before posting this. I don’t even know what I'm looking for or what I need. This almost feels like a last-ditch effort or cry of help than anything else.

6 months ago my boy had a major blood clot that ended up taking his life. I had been out when I got the call from my significant other that his legs gave out, and when we took him in finding out that the prognosis was not good. Ever since this has happened I have felt dead inside. I’m not trying to be overdramatic, but I feel like in this situation that would be the most ideal phrase, to sum up how I feel.

At one point I cared about everything and now I just don’t. I’ve been through loss before. Other pets, Grandparents, Uncles/Aunts, even a high school friend. Nothing has ever come remotely close to losing him. He felt like my son and was my best friend. He was my everything. We have another cat who I love deeply, but I feel like when he died I died with him. Nothing is the same.

I'm haunted by his last moments and being there with him when they put him down. His howls and how they slowly faded when they put the needle in him. I fall asleep sobbing every night and then wake up at 5 am when he would normally cry for food or jump on me.

My significant other took it hard as well, and she still gets sad, but not the same. I don’t know how to communicate with others about this, mostly because no one can give me what I want. I’m angry and sad, and I hide it all and I just don’t know what to do. I hate this so much. I also won’t take any drastic measures. My significant other suffers from depression, and there are too many responsibilities like our other cat, finances, friends, family and so on that chain me down.

I know grieving takes time, I know only time will heal wounds, but this feels so different. Its been 6 months and nothing has changed. Nothing has gotten easier. If anything it's getting worse and worse and I don’t know what to do….",22Oct2019,2
846,"My life really fucken sucks. 1.5 years ago my ex cheated on me and strung me into depression and anxiety. An anxiety that I still have to this day about how accidentally came inside her. She told me she had her period 2 weeks later, but my anxiety tells me that she (age 18) secretly gave birth to a child and is now raising it with her ex or something. No evidence through social media of this, except her taking a selfie with a baby 4 months ago (the baby looked nothing like me and it appeared to be Indian, I'm white and my ex is half Puerto Rican, and half Malaysian. She is brown skinned, and so was the baby. But the baby appeared to be slightly darker and did not resemble me or her. It also looked to be 6 months old). I now have crippling anxiety that she will knock some day with a baby or something. I'm 19 years old btw. 

After the breakup 1.5 years ago, I worked at subway for about 8 months until I quit because my coworker was verbally and emotionally abusing me and the boss did nothing after I confronted her. She actually told my coworker which got him more angry. So I quit and felt like a failure. During my time at subway, I spent about 2K$ on driving lessons and I took the road test twice and failed it. A few months after I quit subway (9 months ago), my best friend (and only friend) started making new friends and sent me text messages of him making fun of with his new friends (weird I know). My birthday comes and no one wishes me happy birthday, my parents actually forgot it was birthday. I was alone. Fast forward 8 months (present) and I still have no license, i just started college. I still have no friends and I still have anxiety over my ex and my depression is getting so bad that I have these weird painful emotional feelings (I cant explain it).

851,So my SO doesn’t think going to marriage counseling before we get married is a good idea. But a lot of our friends and family think we should give it a shot just to clear the air on any bad habits we have that anniy each other that we can change. She was more than willing to sign a prenup in case there was a divorce. But she seems scared to go talk to a counselor about us and try to clear the air on any bad habits. I’ve reassured her multiple times that whatever she says she doesn’t like that I do will not offend me. What is said there would stay between us and the counselor. No one else.

852,"My husband and I are buying our first home. 
We went through all the trouble of getting preapproved at 3 different banks before making an offer on a house. 

We love this house. We can afford the mortgage payments comfortably. Things have been going fine for us up until now. 

Today the mortgage company we were working with denied us because he is on a 1099 form from last year (had this job just over a year) and to claim 1099 as income he has to have two of those forms. 

Although he is technically an independent contractor, he is on a 4 year contract and we obtained a verification of employment from his job. His yearly income is $70,000 but he also has received some sizable bonuses this year. At this point his job verified that he has earned close to $90,000 this year alone. 

My income is significantly less than his and we were applying for the loan without putting me in it because for some reason my credit only pulls from 2 of the 3 reporting companies. Definitely something I need to work on/figure out but it wasn’t initially a huge deal because his income was more than enough to qualify us for the loan. 

When the issue occurred, my parents offered to co-sign with us in order to solve this issue. Yet my realtor said I would then have to be on the loan as well because they would not be counting any of my husbands income at all. 

This is not ideal because I need to quickly try to figure out the issues with my credit and add my two parents to the loan. 

This whole situation is very stressful and sad for me because we truly love the house we are trying to buy and we have already spent a good deal of money on it. 

I don’t know what the issue with my credit is and I a praying it’s a quick fix. 

But will no one really give my husband a loan with only one 1099 when we clearly have/make enough money to pay for this place and his employer has said his work is steady and his pay rate constant???",22Oct2019,3

855,"Full disclosure: I'm changing the names/details of this story since I want to keep everyone anonymous. The main idea is still there though.

I live near a bagel place owned by a guy named Hunter. I have gone to this place for a couple years now since the bagels/coffee are really good, it's a nice quiet place to study, and it's open 24 hours. Hunter and his employees are really polite. We have all known about this place for years. If you wanted a quiet place to study on Sunday in high school, this was everyone's place.

It has just come to light that Hunter is a registered sex offender. A bunch of posts are going around social media about how we should boycott the place and not keep Hunter in business.

I do not want to participate in this boycott, but I also am afraid that this will hurt me in the future.

I do not want to participate in the boycott for two reasons. (1) I believe in forgiveness and in second chances. Hunter did something horrible in 1983. He paid his price. He has not done anything like that since. My state has a risk assessment scale that says how likely someone is to re-offend and Hunter has the lowest likelihood. (2) This is a matter of principle. I know bagels are trivial but caving into a boycott you don't believe in says something about your character. If I had stopped going to Hunter's bagel shop because he didn't carry decaf coffee anymore, it would have been completely different. If I stop going because I'm caving into a boycott I don't believe in, I feel spineless.

If I keep going, I feel like this might hurt me in the future. I live in a tight-knit community. Someone is going to ask why I'm not participating in the boycott too. What am I supposed to say then? What if a social media post ties my name to Hunter's worst moment? One of the first things employers do to vet job applicants is google search their name. I don't want this to be something that comes up. I have also kept my thoughts off of social media for this reason.

What do you think, both on the ethical question and on the worry for my reputation?",22Oct2019,2

858,"Been asking myself this a lot lately.  I just feel like nothing is that enjoyable anymore.  I’ve been experiencing more bad than good, and this trajectory has been happening the past couple of years.  

I had a pretty bad childhood growing up.  My parents were young teenagers when they had me.  My mom already had a bad life from being poor, and from being in foster care because my grandma had to put her and my uncles in the system so they wouldn’t starve.  My mother was abused a lot in foster care and my uncles got involved in criminal behavior and have been in and out of jail my whole life.  My mom was not equipped to raise me as a 16 year old.  She didn’t finish high school.  She became very strict and religious (probably because she wanted the opposite for me).  But then her mental illness became worse and she was convinced that I was doing bad things that I wasn’t.  I was poor and sheltered from the world.  I didn’t know about periods when I first started mine, I had poor sex ed, and I didn’t even learn to drive until my 20s.  My teachers didn’t believe in me.  I was sexually abused and raped several times throughout my life.  Men took advantage of me because I was vulnerable and naive.  I got into bad relationships and sabotaged everything in my life.  I didn’t know how to talk to people or relate, so making friends was difficult.  I never really had friends and could never relate to other women, especially.  I think about who would come to my funeral if I died...not many because I just don’t really have people in my life.  

I was so much more optimistic about life when I was younger.  I thought I’d be free and able to achieve the goals I wanted.  Now, I just don’t feel happy about anything.  Nothing makes me excited.  I don’t want to do anything.  I have completely lost my sex drive because I don’t feel like there’s anything for me in life.  I keep gaining and gaining weight even though I’m trying to stay healthy.  I have nightmares pretty much every night.  When I wake up, the first thing I feel is sadness.  

I went to grad school and became a lecturer.  But I’ve quickly realized how terrible of a job this is (very little pay, no benefits, and no stability).  But because I’ve spent the past few years in this job, no one wants to hire me because they either think I’m overqualified or don’t think I have relevant skills.  

I’ve gone to therapy and was on various types of antidepressants for a while.  It just feels like there’s no point in trying to work this hard to make myself “just content.”",22Oct2019,1

860,"Give moral, legal, ethical advice---whatever you like. I used a throwaway for a reason.

A known sex-offender near me was just released on parole. I have sufficient reason to believe this individual is not truly remorseful, does not understand the gravity of their actions, and I believe is likely to reoffend...to give an example: This offender was a teacher who raped 3 students. A week after their release on parole, they made a Facebook and began befriending the friends of their previous victims, without actually friending the victims themselves. Not against parole conditions, but still odd.

I reported the account to Facebook, as sex offenders can't have a profile. Nothing happened.

I had the idea to make a fake Facebook of a teenager at a nearby high school, use it for a couple months, and then befriend the predator...start a conversation and see how they respond, just to see if they've changed at all.

Is this legal? I would have to basically find photos of some random teenager to use.

He was being bullied and maybe still is which I never really experienced, specially to that degree.

He's doing incredibly poorly at school and very much behind his peers I think he might be Dyslexic because of his descriptions when talking about reading.     

My parents have a strong correlation to all of this. I'm not going to lie. They have moved him all over the place (including me when I was younger, which led me to being depressed in the first place) to different countries and exposure to different languages. 

I've taken a cold approach, I don't know why. I try help him in a more practical way like tell him to ""do exercise because that's proven to help"" but I know that won't work because it never worked when I was in my dark stages.

863,"As a bit of backstory here, I’m 17 and a junior in high-school, she’s 18 and a freshman in college. Both of our families have been friends for quite a while.

We (our families) hang out together in groups, go to lunch and dinner occasionally, we’re at each other’s houses quite a bit, and generally we’re all pretty good friends. 

Her family is allot more strict than mine. She has two other siblings, both younger than her, and they live a much more sheltered lifestyle due to the way her parents do things. They don’t really have allot of freedoms (Can’t hang out with other friends unless their parents know the other parents. Can’t Drive themselves anywhere. Can’t go to parties or big social events without allot of convincing. Imagine the stereotypical very strict parents but on another level in some ways). 

We’ve always sortof been into each other but we only recently found out the feelings were mutual, and since then we’ve been talking more and it’s just been really fun. From everything I’ve heard she has really come out of her shell allot more in college and she’s thriving there. We talk allot and just enjoy getting to spend time over the phone and FaceTime with each other. 

Now for the part that I need advice on. We recently decided to tell our parents, and it went better on my side than hers. 

My parents aren’t nearly as strict and if anything they were just happy to know so much about her beforehand. They really like her and her whole family in general, so I’d say they couldn’t be happier about it. 

Her parents weren’t nearly as pleased, though. They immediately reacted by saying that it wasn’t ok and that we shouldn’t be trying to have a relationship at all. 

Their main arguments are:

Shes in college while I’m at home, and they don’t want her to feel tied down here. I understand this, but she has told me many many times that she is perfectly ok with it and that she’s happier now than she ever was at home anyways so she doesn’t see a problem with that at all. 

She’s older than me, and they don’t like the age difference. I personally don’t feel like one year is all that much, and that they’re just being super picky on that point.

They don’t want the relationship to mess up the family friendship. I definitely understand this, but at this point it feels like them not wanting it to happen is the only thing causing a problem because my whole fam is ok with it, and so is she, it’s just her parents that are making it a big deal.

Another side note is that her mom had a long distance relationship when she was in college that ended poorly. She felt very controlled and obligated to come home all the time, and the relationship ended up going poorly by the end of it all. We both think that she is just project her own previous failed relationship on our current situation now.

Basically, I don’t really know what to do to try and turn the situation around. I want to be with her, but I don’t know how. I don’t know if I should try talking to her parents, if she should, or if we should try something else entirely. What can I do to try to turn this situation around?",22Oct2019,2

Me and my ex best friend had been friends for 8 1/2 years. Keep in mind she is a year younger than me also keep in mind that she is a cheerleader and has been since she was 5. We had been so close anytime we went somewhere someone asked if we were sisters she was the friend i was closest to and told everything to nothing could seperate us we were like literal sisters nothing could break our bond or separate us. She was the best friend someone only ever dreamed of having we had a friendship you only see in the movies. everyone was so jealous of how close we were.  we did absolutely everything together. we were together all the time. we grew up together basically we met when i was 9 and she was 8. we grew up from little tiny kids to full fledged teenagers together. we went through boyfriends and break ups, family drama, school drama together. and then it was my sophmore year of high school. She was a freshman and she made the varsity cheer squad no doubt about it she had always been an amazing cheerleader. side note my parents are divorced  i met her through my moms boyfriend. my dad lived somewhere else so i was back and forth all the time. my dad got custody of me so i live with him anyways so me and her had always went to different schools are bond was still really strong. we obviously went to different high schools and i had been nervous for our friendship a little that it wouldnt last. cause you know high school is usually where you meet your forever friends i was always scared we'd make other best friends and drift apart. so anyways its my 10th grade year and she had just become a freshman and made the varsity cheer team. once she got to highschool and made the team she started changing she was becoming more grown up like kinda wild anyways she started getting rude with people. she became a bit distant in our friendship but we were still the best of friends. well soon she met this girl (her new best friend) and thats when she started getting really out of control and started cussing and acting even more wild she became a real b#tch. after her and this new girl had become bffs she started like cutting me out. anytime i'd ask to hangout she would say no but hangout with that girl. or she'd say no im with ""blah blah""  i would just strug it off because you know who cares i figured we'd make new friends. anyways one day i was watching their ""live"" on instagram and they were obviously doing makeup and i asked what are yall doing you know just to ask what they were up to in general and the new friend catches an attitude and goes off because i asked what they were doing and she said sarcastically were obviously doing makeup dumb b#itch and everytime after that when  i had an interaction with the new girl she was always so rude to me and my ex bestie let her be rude to me. One day i was at ex bff's house and the new girl calls my ex bff and at first my ex bff ignores then the new girl calls again so my ex bff answers and the new girl just talks to her about nothing like she just called to chit chat. as soon as my ex bestie says that she needs to go bc she is hanging out with me the new girl goes well i need to talk to you about something important so my ex bestie goes to the bathroom so she can let the new girl talk to her in private ( keep in mind she had been texting the new girl the whole time we were hanging out) so im just sitting in my ex bffs room waiting on her to get back finally after like an hr she comes back into her room and doesnt talk to me at all and then the new girl starts calling her again finally the new girl quits calling her but keeps texting my ex bff. i told my mom and she said that the situation was messed up but i strugged it off and said whatever. fast forward and im just sitting doing my makeup and decide to text my ex bff to see what shes up to and if she wanted to hang out soon. she says she is in kentucky with the new girl and im like oh okay and we just keep casually texting well a couple texts later i get a message from my ex bff and it said "" you're an ugly ass b#tch"" and i obviously get upset and im like what? she says sorry "" new girl"" took my phone and said that and im still in shock by the message but i show it to my mom and my mom gets super angry because i had been telling her all about how my ex bestie and the new girl had been treating me. anyway my mom flips out and tells me to delete my ex bestie and delete her number and that im not aloud to see her anymore. at this point i still dont know if my ex besties mom knows what happend or not. but it has been 6 months since i have talked to my ex bestie ( i have since moved again with my dad and now go to the same high school as my ex bestie) and we have seen each other 3 times now in passing and didnt speak to each other. it really hurt seeing her it made me want to cry it made all the memories resurface and everything. i didnt really want our friendship to end i mean i kind did bc of the way she had been treating me but then again i tend to let people walk all over me so i didnt bc i thought thats just how some friends are. anyways a couple days ago i found this letter she had posted. and it was a letter to her ""best friend""  and it said 

"" dear best friend, 

ill always love you. you'll always be my number one. you'll always be my best friend. No one can ever replace you. i love you from the bottom of my heart. thank you for everything you did for me you'll never know how much i appreciated you. you made me feel at home and you know i struggled with that a lot. thank you for all the memories and inside jokes no one will ever understand. thank you for always being there for me to hear the rants or for the tears or the dumb stuff i get excited over. i'm sorry for anything i have ever done but you'll be okay. it's gonna be hard but you're the strongest person I know and you can do anything you put your mind to. you're going to do amazing things in life. i'm always proud! best of luck to you. if you need me i'll always be here. ( with a broken heart emoji)"" 

i'm not sure if it was about me i feel like it isnt but then again some of the things she said made it seem like it was. i'm a senior i'm about to graduate and i feel like what happend between us was childish and even if it wasnt that i should try and clear my conscious and make amends and just like talk to her about things and make things right. I still love her and miss her like crazy and wish nothing but the best. ive had a lot of signs to text her and talk things through but i'm still on the fence bc what if she hates me now and she doesnt want to hear from me and that if i text her ill look dumb and desperate. on the other hand all the signs are telling me to do it that i may regret it if i dont and that she misses me too but is to scared to text me and or talk to me bc she thinks i hate her...

869,"Hello everyone. I'm a 22 year old college senior double majoring in history and sociology. I.'ll be done this coming June. My passion has always teaching, but the strange thing is that I feel as if that is something I would want to start a little later in life, maybe my late 20's. I don't know if I'm ready to jump into that yet. 

I've always wanted to be a jack-of-all-trades kind of guy as I have a lot of other things I'd like to to do as well. Aside from traveling, publishing some books, and pursuing interests of that sort, I really want to learn a trade. In particular, I'd like to learn carpentry or commercial painting while also obtaining my real estate license. A side goal of mine is to start my own business down the road. 

Also, in relation to teaching, I'm torn between getting a teaching credential and starting out by teaching high school then later going back to grad school so I can teach college OR just go straight to grad school and teach college afterward. I'm not entirely sure where to start but I know teaching is the goal. 

 I know it seems like maybe I want to do too much, but these are things I'm passionate about and won't compromise on. Just figuring out the order of when and where to do them is tough. Any advice on this?",22Oct2019,1

872,"I am one of one of those people who likes to plan everything in advance. Sometimes they can be a bit out there so when those don’t go to plan I’m not upset. Over the past couple years nothing has gone according to plan and I have to replan everything. I was planning on becoming a pilot in the military to do search and rescue. Turns out I have been medically disqualified and am not considered a viable applicant. In the testing portion I was in the top 80% too. Well now I have a decent job for being out of college and am taking flight lessons on the weekends so I can hopefully be an aerial firefighter. 

Here’s the problem. I’m scared. I’m scared of the future and what is going to happen. I knew I was going to be a great pilot in the Air Force and spend most of my life there. But it feels like life said “fuck your dreams and everything you want to do.” While all my friends are getting married, having kids, achieving all their dreams, I feel like I’m being left behind and life will just screw me over again. I know it’s not good to compare myself to others but how are you supposed to know how well you’re doing if you have no reference point. I feel lost.",22Oct2019,2

874,I’m in a relationship with this girl and we were friends and we both asked each other out. I’ve been pretty happy but I don’t know how to show her affection. I’m too nervous to hug her and I’m too much of a pussy to go up and talk to her while she’s with her friends. What do I do?,22Oct2019,1
875,"Okay. Firstly, I’m mainly only writing this to clear my own conscious. It’s funny how we have to do things in life to make you look back and say *”What in the flying fuck was I thinking?”* I just want to point out something’s before I explain how irrational I acted. I’m at a point now where i’m content with everything.

**1.** This was my first breakup. 
**2.** She was the first person I’ve loved in this way.
**3.** My emotions got the best of me, and I couldn’t control myself.

Looking back, I realized the relationship was very one sided. I even overhead her and one of her friends having a conversation about me. She said things such as “I’m not committed to him” “I wouldn’t care if it ended” and “this is only a temporary relationship.” I did confront her on this and she ended up crying because she wasn’t “in a good place emotionally.” 

Now I look back and see she only cried because I caught her saying these things. I should of broke up with her, but I was just praying she’d have a change of heart. There is **A** **LOT** more examples, however that’s not the purpose of this. 

On to the breakup and how I acted crazy:
*this all occurred two months ago and it was a LDR*

Two days prior to the breakup, I called her out on how I felt about the relationship. I told her I didn’t think it was fair that I gave 100% and she struggled to give 50%. She got upset at that and proceeded to not talk to me for the next two days. That morning, I sent her a text saying “Are you really not going to text me?” She then got pissed at me because “She didn’t feel like she needed to.” 

I was very confused and hurt. All I wanted was her to try harder. Then, she called me on the phone. She broke up with me and time just stopped. I started to cry and told her that I loved her and wanted us to work out.  

She blamed the breakup on her “Stress” she then told me she loved me and that this breakup wasn’t an “End all be all” “We could try again sometime” and “Shes going to miss me so much.”

Cue false hope. I can vividly remember thinking “phew, great. I can save this! She’s only stressed!” So two days later, I jumped in my car amped up on false hope and a mission. My intentions were good, I even bought her roses. I drove *nine hours* to see her.

Yes, go ahead and cringe. 

I saw her then gave her the flowers to which she took a deep breath and rolled her eyes. In a span of 5 seconds everything I believed for the past two days went down the drain. Thoughts of “Why am I here” ran through my mind.  However, part of me still hoped for the best so I tried my best to talk to her. She told me I ruined her day and she didn’t want to see me. That hurt. After 10 more minutes of me begging and being desperate it was time for me to leave. But, not before she came up to me gave me a hug, a kiss, she told me she loved me, and would think about everything.

what. the. fuck. False hope part 2?

I texted her a few times over the next couple of days to which she was very short, understandably. However, eventually I was getting annoyed that she kept saying she needed “more time.” Then, I called her out on that.
She told me to have a nice life. Haven’t spoken since. The break up to no more contact was about 2 weeks. A very eventful two weeks.  

I’m only writing this to say I understand I was stupid. I should’ve just accepted the breakup and left it at that. I shouldn’t have driven there. Life’s learning from all the bad decisions we make and i’ve definitely learned all that I could’ve.  Part of me still hopes she’ll contact me one day. I don’t know why I’d even want that. The relationship wasn’t even fair. Love is weird.",22Oct2019,1

He is now pals with the green men because he noticed how ecchy it is when the College Buddies are racist. He said he would turn himself in for the green man he killed. He invited some green men over to the house, and they were pretty chill dudes, they brought Doritos and talked with my brother about the experience of how it is to be a Green Man. Then he showed them some Nicolas Comics, and they deicded that Nicolas Comics were good over on their end too. So the problem is, my brother committed suicide last night, his body turned into a pasty looking substance. It wasn't blood colored, it was kind of the color of Micky Dolenz, if that makes sense.

879,"My co-workers have collectively turned what should have been a somewhat easy clerical job into something difficult. They all pretend to be friends, but talk shit about everyone. Constantly. They pick someone to focus on, target them, talk shit , and then pretend to be worried about this person who they're messing with, all to make themselves look good.

Since March, I have been at this job, and haven't been caught in the drama. The people there all seemed to think I was boring, and that I wasn't bothered by any of them. This changed when recently I was in a situation where I was scared that I wouldn't have a place to live, and I came into work desperate to take my mind off of it. But everyone was screaming to a point that I couldn't even do my job. 

When this happened I told my supervisor that I needed time, they then began to hear the commotion, and gave me an hour to collect myself. They understood because I never get this way, and they could tell that something was gravely wrong. They also don't appear to be very fond of the branch of employees. When I got back an hour later, I began to get underhanded comments like, ""Better now?"" from co-workers pretending to be concerned. 

I have now been asked various times since then if I'm doing okay, by co-workers who have largely pretended that I didn't exist until this point. My kid has been out of school this week, so I have had to miss two days of work. My supervisor understood, and I have been able to use what sick days I had. This afternoon I check my phone, and had two text messages from my co-workers. They all exchanged numbers a long time ago, but didn't have my contact info. Somehow, two co-workers texted me asking if I was okay, and I'm conflicted. 

I feel a little weird out and violated. They aren't my friends, but now they're texting me. I question if I'm wrong for seeing this gesture as insincere. And on the other end, I'm bothered by what they now must be saying about me. I went from appearing to them as someone who was well adjusted to a point that nothing bothered me, to now coming across as someone whose broken and at the edge, to a point where people need to check in on me. I don't think they care, and I don't want them to know anything about me. I'm okay, nothing about my life is any different than it was seven months ago when I started. 

I am a single parent whose close to getting more stability in me and my kid's life. Minus the drama that these people bring to the table, I'm mostly content with everything else. I just don't know how I'm going to be able to continue to face these people.",22Oct2019,1
880,"Backstory: I have one sibling. My sister is 10 years younger than me. Our mom died last year from breast cancer. My mom at the time was raising my only nephew (then) who is just an absolute joy. Long story short after my mom died my nephew went to live with my grandma. She has full custody. She is 71 years old. My sister went and you guessed it, had another baby. She has no motherly qualities. She is selfish. She is on drugs. Sadly, if it wasn’t for the government check she probably wouldn’t want the kid around anyway. On a daily she just parks the baby with my grandma and disappears for hours on end. We all live on the family property. I have a two bedroom house adjacent to the main house were my grandma lives. My sister decided to move from the main house into the basement because she can’t handle the idea of being inside with her child. Everyday my grandma and her argue and fight over this. I’ve had enough. I told my grandma today that if I have to take that baby in (which I never wanted kids but refuse to let it go in the system) she has to move out. It’s not right for her to have children and just jump ship and continue to live the good life not doing anything with her life. She has had it to easy. I told her I don’t want the government check I make good money on my own and what the government gives her monthly I can spend literally on a night out with co workers. I feel like I have to call CPS , but will they let me keep the baby until court or does he have to go into the system ? Any advice will help.

885,"My boyfriend recently started getting therapy and chose an older man (in his 70s). (Btw he is getting therapy to work on issues for making our relationship work.) 

When I asked him about the gender/age of his therapist, he said he intentionally chose an older man because his one previous experience with therapy was when he was 25 years old and the therapist was a 28 year old blonde female. He said “she looked good” and was unable to open up to her honestly because he thought in his head, “I can’t say that - I can’t get laid.” 

I got hurt/upset, especially because we have had turbulence in our relationship and had JUST been getting better. It hurt more because recently he has been intentionally avoiding giving me compliments because I claimed he “love-bombed” me and I fell for him b/c he made me feel “special.” He said he still stands by all the compliments he gave me before and still finds me attractive, but he wants me to genuinely want him for who he is, not because I love how he makes me feel special / fuels my ego, which makes sense. I do see where he’s coming from. 

Anyway, when I told him all this, he didn’t really seem sorry. His response to my hurt was “why? She had nothing on you” basically that I am more attractive. That actually made me more upset because that wasn’t the point. 

He also said he was talking about a situation from 5 years ago “so long ago.”

He calls me crazy and psycho for wanting to hang out on weekends now or talk on the phone when we used to do literally everything together. He’s been extra irritable for no real reason and simply blames me every time something goes wrong now. Not only that but every weekend he gets mad about wanting to hang out and tells me to leave him alone and he won’t text back for a day or two but this time he told me to leave him alone and it’s been more than just the weekend. I leave him alone during the weekdays so he can do his homework because he has a lot but it’s not like him to be like the way he is now. He says it’s me but I don’t think feelings would just change as fast as they did with the coincidence of getting on adderall...

891,"So, I will keep this short. I am a hs senior applying for colleges, and my parent is getting in the way. My single parent is a true-to-cliche abusive parent, having short-temper and unsympathetic and being a stubborn hypocrite. This is likely due to her own uncontrolled stress that she doesn't recognize is affecting her.

She does not recognize other's personal space. I have my own room, but I study in the attic. She will enter and then harass me for half an hour if I keep quiet (or she will try to hit me if I say anything and yell at me for a few hours). 

What I've been doing: For weeks, I try to do my work in the library or in coffee shops, but, I have to go back to the house and sleep. That is why I seclude myself in the attic when I come back. 

But, if her mood's not right, she will come up. Should I vary the places I work? I can work in the house's basement and then move back to the attic so that the effort needed for her to look for me is lower? I could stay at the coffee shop until 9, so that she won't have the energy to maybe hit me.

Her parents are very very strict, and her and her siblings don’t have allot of personal freedoms.

She’s 19 and she is now a freshman in college, while I’m 17 and a junior in high-school.

Our families are very good friends, and we do allot of things together in groups such as lunch, movies, etc.

Now the main issue.

We recently decided to tell them that we are both really into each other. It wasn’t much of an issue at all for my parents. If anything they were just happy that they already knew her so well. 

Her parents weren’t as pleased though.
They don’t have any issues with me personally, but rather the entire situation as a whole.

Their main arguments against it are:

We’re not the same age. I find this irrelevant though since it’s only a two year gap.

She’s at college and I’m here. They seem to think that I’m tying her down from going out and living her life in college. She has told me many times though that she doesn’t feel this way at all, and that she is very very happy now.

(Side note. We both think that her mother is just project her own previous experiences on us. Her mother was in a long distance relationship during her freshman year of college as well and it ended poorly.)

Our relationship will ruin the family friendship. They are incredibly concerned that our relationship will mess up the friendship between our families. I find this unreasonable though because in reality, the only thing causing a divide between the families right now is the fact that they are so against it. My parents are fine with it.

What do I do here? Can I try to do anything to change their mind, or are we gonna be better off to try something else. She has tried talking to them but they won’t listen. I don’t know what to do about it all and I really want to be with her.",22Oct2019,1

901,"Met a girl, got pregnant accidentally months in. Got married the next year. Finished school together. Got jobs. Bought a house. We’ve been “trying” for what seems like most of the relationship to work together and be on the same page but we are such fundamentally different people, come from opposite parents. More and more it seems we are just yelling and fighting eachother for the little time we are actually both at home not working. I feel like I have been slowly falling out of whatever love we had since we started dating. And I’m trying to convince myself that it’s just my young dumb brain telling me I shouldn’t have made these mistakes leading me into this deep hole. I love my daughter more than the world, and she loves both of us. But I’m afraid my wife and I not being in love and all of our arguments will be emotionally destructive for our kid. But also the thought of not coming home to her every night crushes me. 

Posting here for maybe a new perspective on the situation, or I guess any advice or comments on the whole ordeal. 

Peace.",22Oct2019,1
902,"I was recently told i will be needing braces and the ortho said that it was my choice in the end, however my parents are making me get them (told ortho, signed paperwork, got dates) and i really dont want them. Im really bad with confrontation and get really anxious and upset whenever someone mentions me getting braces, or the dentist, or ortho etc. Any advice as to what i should do?",22Oct2019,5

5 years ago a girl had a  crush on me and now she’s messaged me on Facebook (I don’t have a pic of me on there) and I’m scared she won’t like me now when she liked me first 5 years ago :/

A year ago I began crushing on this girl in my class and have been crushing even harder on her ever since this year began. As of recently I found out that before she started dating her boyfriend she had a crush on me too but never told me. Of course I would never try anything or intentionally flirt around with her while she is with her boyfriend because that is a sleazy move but now, part of me is falling apart because I know the likelihood of them breaking up is low and it kinda hurts but also I’m just really happy that she is happy. I wouldn’t ask her to go out with me as soon as they broke up, that’s completely inappropriate but I’m almost hoping for it? 
I’ve been trying to make myself get over her but it’s almost like every time I look at her she just gets even more beautiful, or hear her voice I just melt a little more. We are friends and talk a little here and there in class but really I try to avoid conversation with her so I don’t accidentally cross a boundary. I just want to stop feeling bad for something I should be happy for and to be able to find a way to get over her even just a little. 
Or maybe I don’t want to get over her, I’m not really sure. I just want to stop feeling bad when I see her and her boyfriend flirting and hanging out or holding hands.
We’re both seniors in highschool and due to situations at home I can’t talk to my parents about because we are both girls and they wouldn’t react well.",22Oct2019,2
905,"About two months ago I moved down with my biological dad who has 10+ kids (majority are in their late twenties. I am 19) and they all live far away and had told me he can be a lot sometimes so I shrugged it off because of course he can be he is a parent. Anyways, I am living here and at first it was great he was supportive of me getting a job and car and moving out asap. But then it all started falling apart about two weeks ago. I still haven’t found a job and I’ve been searching my ass off and when I’ve done 5-6 hours of job searching each day I call it good and play some video games to relax maybe watch some TV, but he has an issue with me playing video games and decides to turn off the internet. Which mean I only can rely on my phone to apply for jobs, no problem. End of first week. This is the second week and now my phone is about to shut off and I have no internet to use my phone off of because he has since turned it off. Still no job, no vehicle, nothing. I tried explaining id need the internet turned back on to continue career searching and he has become very unreasonable shouting he doesn’t use the internet so why should he pay for it, after I explain again to him I need it for job applications and resume sending he still says that’s my problem. When I have had a job interview he has told me he isn’t driving me and I need to walk. I live in Charlotte, NC, and all my jobs have been all the way across the city. I need out of this house though he is controlling, manipulative and very narcissistic. I have no idea what to do, and how to get out of this situation. 


TL;DR My dad is preventing me from job searching by turning off the internet and refusing to give me a ride to interviews all while telling me I need to move out soon.",22Oct2019,1
