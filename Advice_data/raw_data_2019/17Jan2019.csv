0,"So me and my girlfriend are both 18 and have been together almost 4 years and shes had a few positive tests, and ofcourse im nervous as hell but she dosnt even seem to be atall and she has told her mum and she was fine with it.

I just need help with what to do moving forward, basically we have non stopped argued, she seems to think she has the right to my contact with the baby and control my rights to go to scans etc. and shes making me feel as if she dosnt want me in the babys life.

It all started as i said i didnt want a baby as im not ready im only 18 still studying etc i never once mentioned abortion as if she has one then i have no choice i just said i dont feel ready and then she was saying how i could just leave and not have contact with either of them which obviously upset me, i have tried explaing that i dont currently want a baby but if she is pregnant the first thing ill do is a get a job to support them, and now she has just blocked my number so i have no way to contact her i have all these thoughts in my head, i cant focus on anything im just very scared

So im just lost i dont know how to move forward shes currently threating to tell my mum and family etc which i havent brought it up to yet as she hasnt had the first scan or anything, i think my mum would be really upset and im nervous to mention it and id rather tell her myself if anything",17Jan2019,1
1,"Hi guys, I've been out of school for around 2 years for reasons I'm not comfortable disclosing. I decided to get my shit together and enroll back into high school as a junior. I'm really nervous and not looking forward to any of this but I know it's absolutely necessary. Any advice on this would be immensely appreciated. I'm extremely shy and what I'm dreading most is definitely lunch. I hate eating alone. And the fact that I'm behind on many things in my classes is making me feel so overwhelmed ",17Jan2019,1
2,"I (22f) still live at home with my parents. I just started my first full time job so obviously I look forward to going home. On the drive home everything’s great and I’m excited to finally get to relax, except everyday my excitement fades as I remember that when I get home all I will hear are my parents bickering. The only time I am able to relax is when they go to bed. I am so stressed around them all the time. When they are together 9 times out of 10 they are either arguing or about to get into an argument. This has been going on for as long as I can remember. There is no time in my life where I remember my parents being happily married. I just moved back home after being away at college for 4 years. Being home and being around them is driving me insane. I have tried countless times to talk to them about their fighting but nothing ever comes from it. I feel an enormous amount of stress and anxiety when I am home because of it. It makes me very sad as this is my home where i should feel the most comfortable and secure. I have never felt that way. I never have friends over because of the constant tension in my house. Often times I lash out at them because their bickering causes me stress. Even if they are not fighting, my mom is running frantic trying to tidy up the house or cook dinner and she’s constantly huffing and puffing while doing it. She never relaxes, she feels the need to always be cleaning or doing laundry etc..My dad on the other hand has severe anxiety and is always stressing about something. I know their arguing adds to his stress tenfold. I cannot afford to move out right now, but I feel uncomfortable in my own home and I have no outlet elsewhere. I do not know what to do. I wish they would have just gotten divorced years ago like they were going to. “Staying together for the kids” has only made things worse. ",17Jan2019,1
3,"Today I was working out in the gym with 3 friends. One of them in particular has been annoying me for some time now (frankly I didn't even ask him to the gym he just tagged along...) 

Basically he points things out a lot and trys to make fun of people for whatever reason that might be. Anyways he tried to make fun of what I was doing today.

I decided to insult him back, he didn't seem to like it and continued to try and mock me, at this point in time I have had enough of his shit so I got really pissed off and threated him (to be clear this is completely out of character for me because I usually just try and defuse the situation cause I don't want beef lol).

He seemed taken back and apologised telling me he only meant it as a joke, but his ""jokes"" are just completely unnecessary. I did apologise to him at the end but I still feel really angry about it.

4,"Umm hi just wondering if anyone has advice on my current predicament as its really getting to me.
It started in September where I had to distance myself from toxic people in my life which led me to not having friends but as time progressed, I started to slowly lose interest in my hobbies such as gaming at this point i barely play them. Then I started to even lose interest in school and now my dreams changed to try and hope fix this which is to move to another country and forget my past.
 So yea any advice as I don't know how to keep moving forward in life. ( I'm not suicidal ) ",17Jan2019,1

6,"I have gay thoughts often. I'll admit it. And I do enjoy the thoughts. But the problem is I don't want to be gay. 

I'm straight and I've had a girlfriend for a long time. I don't want to leave her.

I don't feel romantic attraction to men and I couldn't be in a loving relationship with one. I want to get older, get married, and have my own children.

Just to clarify, if I was gay my family (non-religious and not traditional) would be supportive and they wouldn't stop me, it's just I personally don't want to be gay.

Is there a way for me to suppress these thoughts?",17Jan2019,1

8,"So, I have been looking for a job and have stopped smoking weed for several weeks. I'm actually on the path to stop entirely. I had an interview with one place, it went well, they said they would contact me in 3-4 days, but after a week and hearing nothing, I assumed I did not get the job. Fast forward to this past weekend: I had a moment of weakness and had a hit of weed. It was barely enough to get me buzzed; just enough to take the edge off and calm me while I was spiraling through an emotional storm. Well, I get an email today saying that I am going to be hired, and my start date in the 21st. However, there is a drug test that needs to be done before then.

I am a skinny individual (5'11; 145-150lbs), and I live an active lifestyle. I am walking 5-10 miles every day, doing light work outs, and drinking lots of water. Am I going to be alright for this drug test? I am going to ramp up my water intake and try to be even more active just in case. Is there anything else I should do to ensure I pass?",17Jan2019,1

12,"Just some context. I'm an 18 year old guy in my final year of high school. I get pretty good grades (mid 80's). I had been seeing this girl for a fairly short time (2 months) and things were going amazing. We were both really happy and enjoyed being in each-others company and things were beginning to get more serious. One day, she became very reserved and wasn't talking much so I asked what was up. She sent a whole paragraph about how she doesn't agree with my habits of drinking / smoking on the weekends and 'partying'. She told me she didn't want a relationship with someone like that, so things kind of fizzled out after that. The thing that bothered me is that I am only drinking / smoking with friends 2-3 nights every week, and I always made her a priority over all that. Anyways, fast forward 3 months, and I'm still missing her and feeling as though if I dropped these habits I could have still been with her.

16,"So, for a bit of background, I’m female [37] &amp; I’m an RN. There’s a student nurse on my ward at the moment, I’ll call her Jen. She’s, I think, [32] divorced with 2 young kids. 
I only met her last Thursday when we were on the same shift, &amp; all through the morning, she was going on about her bf, Steve [35].


She was blatantly showing off, telling us about the things Steve had bought her, (and telling us how much said things cost: cringe) &amp; how he was taking her on a trip to Australia...Then how much he just loves her, &amp; wants to get married &amp; have a kid. All this after six months? Woah. I was starting to feel a bit claustro, to be honest (but that’s my personal opinion of course). 


She also said how he sent her *Interflora* flowers, (yes, she specified) everyday for 2 weeks, until she agreed to go out with him. 
This seemed romantic when she first said it, but dig a little deeper, &amp; I realised, they met online, on POF actually, so...what? He tracked down her physical full name &amp; address to send her flowers. He works in IT somewhere too. 
Red flag. 


Anyway, to say I’d only just met her that day, she was telling us hella personal things, like how big his dick was, for example, along with showing us pics of what we (too late!) discovered to our horror, were *not* of his face! We were trying to do our jobs, but she was hovering, &amp; in our faces. 


I should add, that at this stage, we were in the treatment room (so nowhere near patients or relatives). 
In there, was Jen, Claudia (another RN) &amp; I at the time, &amp; I mistakenly thought Claudia knew Jen, &amp; that’s why she was being so open, but I later found out she’d only met her once herself. 


Anyway, the day goes on &amp; so does she, so I finally said to her, show me a pic of this Steve guy I’ve heard so much about (his *face* this time!). 
So she did, &amp; I immediately recognised him bc I had been talking to him at one stage, on POF...but it was ages ago (before they were together) &amp; I remember he was a bit intense, so I stopped talking to him. 

In fact though, intense is an understatement, he was full on right away, &amp; we’d not even met in person. I found him creepy &amp; needy, &amp; I’ve not got time for that shit. So that was the end of that. 


Anyway, as she’s showing me, she looked at me all smugly for my reaction, &amp; my face must have changed (or recoiled in horror, can’t be sure), but whichever, she noticed, &amp; asks me ‘what?’ 


I felt I had to say something at this point bc she could see I knew him, or of him, somehow from my reaction , &amp; I didn’t want her mind to runaway with her, wondering if anything had happened between us. So, put on the spot, I just said that I recognised him from POF, but that I hadn’t spoke to him in months, bc he was ‘a bit much’ (my exact words). I might have also said the word ‘intense’, but I’m not certain. 


I explained it was months ago, &amp; that we never even met in person, but she was weird with me for the rest of the day, &amp; avoided me. 


Didn’t think much of it, but then I’ve come in to work this morning, &amp; she’s apparently made a *massive* deal about it on Friday, the day after, when I wasn’t on shift. 


She told 3 of the other nurses, including Claudia, that I said Steve was ‘really into me’ when we were chatting (which I didn’t), &amp; even if he *had* been ‘really into me’, I wouldn’t say that to his *fucking gf*, would I?! 
I mean I suppose some people might, but I’m not that kind of person; and not even necessarily to spare her feelings, although that is an element, but I just *couldn’t* do it; it would make me literally cringe to say words like that, even if it were true. Nobody likes a bragger. 


Now, say if he *had* been chatting to me when he was with her, then I definitely would have said something, bc I wouldn’t want her to look like a mug; but he wasn’t, &amp; so I didn’t. 


I was told she was found literally crying on the staff toilet floor, saying it could be the end of them. Seems like she’s gone home &amp; for some reason brought it up with him (just why??) &amp; it’s caused a huge row. 


The only exception to her even mentioning it is, if she made a joke about it, he laughed, &amp; it was never spoke of again. Now, I’m not sure what *did* happen but I know for sure, that this did *not* happen. 


All I know is, it was Friday when she had her meltdown, &amp; the argument between them (still not sure why it had to turn into *any* argument) apparently went on over the weekend a bit, but I didn’t see her again from last Thursday, until this Monday. 


I mean, did she expect him to have never spoken to another girl in his life?? Surely *that* would have been more odd? 


She even asked Claudia if she should speak to Mary (my **BOSS**!!) about it!! Like what the actual fuck? 


As if Mary’s gonna care about our personal lives, when we’re adults, &amp; it has absolutely nothing to do with work, not to mention it happened well before she’d even met him.


Claudia said to her, she should just speak to me about it if I’d upset her, as she didn’t think I’d deliberately do that to her, but she hasn’t. 

She spoke to me on Monday as if nothing had happened (and at that point I hadn’t found out, &amp; she never told me). In fact she made a point of speaking to me &amp; being extra nice, in hindsight she was probably concerned I’d heard about her freak out, &amp; would want to save face maybe? 

She hasn’t been on shift today, so I haven’t seen her since I found out. So, I’m not sure how that’ll go. I have to work with her for a few more weeks at least, but I’m on leave next week so there’s a chance I can remove myself from the situation for 7 days.

I’m able to see now that there isn’t a lot I’m hurt about, therefor there isn’t a lot for me to express through writing or photography. Not how I know how to anyway. 

I was simply wondering if anybody has struggled with this before. It’s almost as if my life is good right now, and I’m longing for the days when I was hurt in order to do the things that I love.

20,"Bit of a tough situation here. Me and this coworker have become increasingly close over the past few months but never to the point in which we’ve discussed any romantic possibilities. She’s got social anxiety so she doesn’t really go out so we only ever talk at work or on whatsapp but when we are together we’re always laughing and having fun, but my biggest concern is that she definitely doesn’t feel the same way. Sure, we get along fine, but it’s hard to tell what her type is and I’m worried that if I ever told her my feelings it would either make her uncomfortable or the work environment unfortunately awkward. I’m not exactly handsome nor perfect in any shape or form, but I like to think we’d be a good fit... but there’s just a hunch I’ve got that she wouldn’t be interested in me in the same way.

So me and this girl have been dating for 2 months now, long distance. Essentially, a couple of days ago, she stopped replying to any of my texts/snaps. After sitting there for a while wondering what happened, I texted her and asked if everything was okay. She replied (after quite a wait) with a long text that explained that its nothing I did and her anxiety ""makes her push people away"". I tried to explain that I care about her and would like to continue talking to her obviously, but after that long message she sent back to me (and another one that claimed she wanted to see me again) - no more communication has occurred between us, even though I sent her a couple of tweets I thought she'd like and she ignored them.

30,"I’m a 15 year old guy, sophomore in High-school,   and this year, one of my long time friends (the girl in question) came to the school as a freshman. We pretty much just chat most of the time, walk to class, talk about school, etc. My friends saw this, and insist that I should get with her. They’ve said that she clearly has feelings for me, from what they’ve seen of us hanging out, and whenever she randomly comes up in conversation, they transition to asking me why I haven’t asked her out yet.

At first, I was pretty jazzed about this sudden revelation that she apparently “liked” me, since this was my first experience with relationship type stuff, so I tried my best. I’ve gone to multiple movies and events, spent more time talking to her, and learned a little more about her personally. 

It’s been about 4 months since I started this, and frankly, I don’t see anything. I don’t dislike her, I just see us as close personal friends. From what I’ve seen of her, it doesn’t seem like she’s interested in me romantically either. I don’t exactly regret the time spent with her, It’s just that i wasn’t more happy going to those things because she was there. I guess I could say that is don’t feel special, but that might be a bad way of describing it.

From the slight moves I’ve tried to make on her (sitting closer together, small stuff like that), she seemed to be hesitantly accepting of them.

A few months after that, we broke up amicably because we realized we had a number of different things that made us not compatible.

So fast forward to now and I am invited with my parents to a family member's wedding in that same vacation town. I honestly don't know how I can handle this, because every time I even think about that town I think of my ex and get emotional and sad...so I don't know how I can actually be in that town without breaking down crying. I miss that time we shared and that one vacation we had together and I never planned on going back to that town because I knew it would cause me heartbreak with all the memories rushing back.

I honestly don't even want to go, but as it's a close family member getting married, I know I'm expected to be there. And the fact that it is 2 love birds getting married will make it 100% worse for me. As if that wasn't bad enough, a small group (including me and my parents) are invited to a nice restaurant in town the day before the wedding...and it is the exact same restaurant I went to with my ex when we were on vacation there.

Any advice on what to do? I know if I go I'm going to be heart broken the entire time and I don't want to spend the whole time crying, but I'm not sure what I can do.

TL;DR: Invited to a family member's wedding, which happens to be in the same town I went on my first, last and only vacation with an ex many years ago and I know I'm going to be heartbroken being there.

Tl:dr- cancelling personal trainer costs almost as much as id spend finishing with their services. 

I have a monthly subscription to a gym training session ($50 a month for one 30min session) at a gym where i used to work. 

Ive recently left my job and am trying to cutback on expenses. So i called to see about cancelling my subscription. They told me that to get out of my 1 year agreement, it would cost me $350. 

Im still between jobs and thats alot of money. Letting the subscription run would cost me $450 total. I could technically afford to cancel right now, but it would cut into my savings and leave me with almost zero emergency funds. 

While i did know about the agreement, when i had asked about a possible cancellation fee they tiptoed around my question and refused to give me an amount. They said things like “oh you wont want to quit” and “well its hard to say exactly”. 

I know now that it should have been a red flag, but when i signed up i was still very overweight and was desperately trying to get to my goal. My fault. 

Is there anything i can do? Will i get in trouble if i just have my bank stop making payments to them? Is it worth it to spend most of my savings cancelling upfront or try not to notice and let it run its course?",17Jan2019,1

37,"Hello Reddit. I’m posting this on an account that I made a while ago for weed subreddits and I plan on deleting this post at a later date. 

Lately I’ve been feeling so down on myself. I’m not entirely sure why. To preface this entire thing; I’ve been trying(and occasionally failing) to lose weight for 3ish years now. My highest ever was 340, I’m now sitting somewhere between 250-260, and I want to weigh 200 or less. The reason I included that was because I believe this has caused serious self image issues over the years. The direct effect of this is me, now being in teens, never having had a girlfriend or even really having physical contact with a woman. And before anyone says it, it’s not because I didn’t try. If I had to give a rough estimate, I’d say in the past 3 or 4 years I’ve asked out a total of 10+ women, and subsequently never went on a single date. It’s started effecting my self confidence too. I just can’t shake the feeling like there’s something inherently wrong with me and I just can’t tell, or maybe I’m asking them out the wrong way, or possibly because I can’t seem to read women. In my daily life it’s hard for me to strike up a conversation with women, I always feel like I’d be perceived as weird for doing it. Plus, every time I’ve tried it nothing positive ever really came out of it.

Side note: By no means am I a supermodel, but I don’t think I’m particularly ugly either. Any advice is much appreciated.",17Jan2019,1

40,"So, I'm currently a first year university student living in Ontario, Canada and am looking for some outside opinions on my situation. I am in a good quality, 4 year, business administration program but am just not sure if this university is right for me. When I applied in high school I knew which school I wanted to go to, but I didn't get accepted. So I just decided to pick the school with the next best reputation, and didn't really pay attention to the atmosphere of the school and the surrounding area. I find myself spending a lot of time alone because all anyone wants to do for fun here is drink and smoke, which I don't really care for. This is probably caused by the fact that there is not much within walking distance in terms of entertainment. I also think I lack motivation, my first semester didn't go that well when a lot of other people finished with high GPA's. I know that I want to be in the business program but I just can't get myself to engage to my maximum potential. I'm also scared to make any commitments. My few residence friends are trying to find a house and I am not into it at all, just avoiding signing anything because I don't know if I can live here for 3 more years. On top of that, my residence life is terrible. I live in an old residence building where everything is falling apart and dirty. I've seen my friends rooms at other schools and they are much nicer. I live in a double room with someone from my high school who I just can't get along with anymore. He leaves his half of the room a mess, and yes I have confronted him about it many times. He used to take my stuff without asking, basically took advantage of my generosity and thought everything that was mine also belonged to him.

&amp;#x200B;

I have the opportunity to transfer to a school in the city I first desired and stay in a business program. I would be closer to home and I have some friends that go to school in the same city. I realize that transferring schools won't really solve any of my problems in terms of meeting people but maybe being somewhere that I feel like I belong will motivate me in both the educational and social aspects of my life. I have about two weeks until the application deadline then a couple months to decide to transfer or not. Am I being dramatic and should I just suck it up? Should I apply and consider it? Should I transfer? I just feel like university is a big part of my life so why spend it being unhappy at a school I don't love. ",17Jan2019,1
41,"Some background to this: My parents are physically and emotionally abusive to my younger sibling, I have had to intervene multiple times. Because of the abuse he has social anxiety and trust issues, but they will not take any responsibility for their actions. Nevertheless, they have never beaten me or been overly mean to me as I have always brought home good grades and been a good daughter. 


I am 18. I was dating a guy through a long distance relationship (we were together for a year, he bought me an enagement ring) . My parents told me to break up with him but I didn't, they found out. Now they have made me do it. They won't accept anybody who isn't in the same economic status as we are (well-off) and if they don't know his parents (I was in a LDR), or don't think he is up to my standard. His family offered to take me in. 

My parents have forced me to defer my university admission for an entire year (I live in a third world country and I wanted to go study to Europe since I have the nationality), and are threatening me with not allowing me to go abroad at all, or forcing me to go to the same university as my brother. I am also expected to have a tracker on my phone and cut all ties with my ex. His family want me to be there and they are willing to support me through anything. I am now able to go to them. I'm not sure of what I should do. I am sure that I want to get out of this abusive environment... however a part of me can't help but be sad about losing my parents, even after what I've seen them do, and how they have threatened me. I am afraid that I am too young to take this decision, but I know that it will not present itself again, and I have to either choose to stay, abide by their choice and give up, or take a stand and completely leave.

When were last off, I slept with a girl that I had been talking to. She told me last night she's pregnant. She also said she doesnt want my money, doesnt want me around the kid or her cause it was a one night stand and she knows I dont care. To some extent shes right.

I don't want a kid and have never been interested in them because I'm quite selfish and kids eat up all your free time and money. I know what you're thinking at this point, this guy is a complete dick. I am, yes. But I do need some serious advice.

So right now it is wednesday night and my first semester of Junior Year ends this Friday. I haven’t been doing very well in school this year, but have really stepped up and gotten organized over these last few weeks and it has really shown. Though, I am still in a bit of a predicament. You see, in November, before Thanksgiving break, I went on a school trip that lasted 4 days where no technology was allowed and when I came back I had TONS of makeup work. This immense amount of work caused for me to stress immensely and brought back all of the anxiety that I was away from. I began to start seeing my therapist again, but things were out of control as I just couldn’t even seem to look at my work load as it caused me to panic. I began missing school to try and catch back up, but only fell more behind. This leads to me just not doing 2 essays, one for my theology class and one for my History class, both barely started. I am really afraid to speak to any of my teachers as I really like the both of them and feel terrible about waiting so long to say something.

53,"My best friend, we'll call her Mary. Mary and I met my sophomore year of college, and have been friends for five years. We instantly clicked. We had a lot in common right off the bat, and I would consider her a big sister to me(she's about 5 years older than me).

Mary was in an on again off again relationship for 11 years. Her ex had a very negative impact on her. He would cheat on her, put her down. They're not together anymore and haven't been for about two going on three years. He definitely shattered her self confidence. When I met her they were on a break, and she was a completely different person confidence wise. Obviously it was hard to watch her go through such a bad relationship, but I was always there for her when I could be. A lot of her old friends deserted her during that time because understandably, they were tired of seeing her get hurt.

A few months after they broke up she met a new friend of mine and my boyfriends at a party. He was really interested in her. She was definitely really interested in him too, but I knew she was looking for more than a one night stand. She had just gotten out of a bad long term relationship, and I knew she probably couldn’t handle a one night stand. 

Because of this, I wanted to make sure he was a good guy. I asked my boyfriend and his friends about him, and if this guy was just gonna sleep with her and bail. They had only had positive experiences with this guy and said he was really into her.

I told her what I knew and one night at a party they left together.  From what I know, they were both pretty drunk, and he ended up raping her. I was so heartbroken when I found out for obvious reasons, but also because she had been raped before I became friends with her. Also I was raped in high school, so I could imagine how she was feeling. My friends are an important part of my life and I’m so protective of them and i know it’s not my fault, but I feel terrible that I couldn’t spot that this guy was a predator.

After she told me I did my best to be there for her, and be supportive as possible. She was and still partially is in a really fragile state, and didn't think I would believe her when she told me, or that my boyfriend or his friends would believe her. I spent so much time trying to convince her that if she wanted to come forward publicly with what happened, that we would all have her back, which is the truth. I just wanted her to feel like she had control over the situation because that’s what helped me cope with my rape. She still hasn't come forward, and I don't know if she ever will.

She did go to therapy, and it has helped her a lot. I was there for her so much during that time that I became emotionally and physically exhausted. I would stay up all night talking to her and supporting her. I was so exhausted and it started to affect my work life, my mental health, and my relationship. I decided to tell her that I will always love and support her, but it's a lot for me to handle on my own, and that all I can do for now is just tell her I have her back no matter what, but the long talk over everything that happened we’re becoming too much for me to talk about all the time. She was understanding and felt bad i felt that way, which was not my intention. I ended up not hanging out with her as much as I was in hopes of gaining back some energy/sanity/self care.

That was the last year and a half. So cut to these last six months. Since I’ve stopped hanging out with her as much, she turns to her coworkers for socializing. When she goes out with them she meets random guys, and hooks up with them. Which is fine, I want her to have a healthy sex life and experience the excitement of being single.

But it is tough to listen to sometimes because she’s in this constant cycle of having these one night stands that never lead anywhere, and she becomes heartbroken and super ""men are shit"" kind of attitude, which fair enough. I totally get it. It’s just seems that she’s now adopted sort of self destructive behavior. I want to help, but then we’re back to endless nights of talking about everything, and I’m back to being exhausted again. 

Also bc she was raped she has gotten into this headspace of overanalyzing situations and exhibiting very paranoid behavior. Which I completely understand. Obviously she will have trust issues that she can't control, but she takes things so personally. 

We'll be at a party and she'll pull me to the side and say, ""So and so said this, and I couldn't believe it."" When it’s clear that what the person said had nothing to do with her at all. I tell her that she's being paranoid and she needs to relax a bit and take it easy, which she is receptive to, but she still has these reactions all the time. And trust me, I don't expect her to just change over night. Rape causes trauma that you deal with the rest of your life, but it’s just that it has become so repetitive and exhausting to constantly reassure her that the world is not out to get her. I have to explain everything to her. 

I think because of all we've been through together, she's become really clingy. She always says I’m an angel in her life, which is so sweet, but it just doesn’t feel right to me. If i post an instagram story, she responds to it right away. And i mean every instagram story, even if it's a picture of a trash can. Whenever we do hang out she prolongs it, and whenever I say I need to go she tells me to stay. This used to be hard for me because i didn't wanna hurt her feelings and say, ""I don't wanna hang out with you anymore, i'm tired, i need to do other things, i wanna go home."" But I’ve gotten better at being proactive and exiting so I can get on with my day. But at the same time, whenever I don't hang out with her she hangs out with her coworkers who are super immature and love to party, and that's when she hooks up with these random guys, and then it's just a whole other slew of problems again. 

I don't want to stop being her friend, but I'm so tired of the drama, and keeping up with her needs. If she hadn't been raped by my boyfriends mutual friend, I wonder if I would
have stopped hanging out with her. But because I feel guilty/responsible for what happened to her, even though I know it's not my fault, I feel like I could never truly just walk away from our friendship. Which I don't want to just throw our relationship away, but at this point it's so exhausting for me and I'm dealing with it on a minimal level now, but it's still a lot.

It's also hard for me because she truly is such a nice person. If anything she's so nice that she coddles me. If we have opposing opinions and I tell her how I really feel, she'll change her mind to match my opinion. And basically her being so nice is what gets her into trouble a lot. She seeks validation from other people so much when really she should be content with who she is and not worry about what other people think, i don't know ... Which is ironic to me, because for someone with so many trust issues, it's easy for her to just run off with a cute guy one night, or agree with someone she just met because she wants them to like her.

I feel like a bitch typing this out, but yeah this is a lot to take in, and if you're still reading, thank you for hanging in there! Any advice, or insight would be greatly appreciated, or if you've been in a similar situation. Thanks, I just don't know where to go from here. I don’t want to end our friendship, but I don’t know how much longer I can deal with all this stuff. ",17Jan2019,1

61,"So let me begin my mentioning my history with the site. My first account was made in March of 2016, and was deleted roughly a year later. In September of 2017 I think, I made this current account. I mostly use/follow meme based subreddits (r/comedyheaven) and subs centered on my hobbies, such as r/Warhammer.  

Reddit has been a mixed bag for me. On one hand, I have had plenty of fun moments, laughs, and made a couple friendships via this site. On the other, Reddit has countless nasty undercurrents, and in one case, I actually ended up debating a Nazi. Reddit has become an addiction or crutch for me; I will often exit the app only to immediately open it up again, reflexively.  

If someone were to tell me ""just use different subreddits"", that doesn't really help. It's so easy to see someone link a subreddit in the comments, and click, thus sending me into a rabbit hole I'll spend too much time on.

So much so that I begin to think not only would she not even want to date, but didn't even want to be my friend. We've been talking for a few years now as friends.

I've always been fat but finally bested depression a few weeks ago. When I told her, she was really happy and it made feel really good. 

Gained a bit of confidence in myself and confessed to her a few days after despite her saying that she was on the asexual spectrum and struggling with her asexuality (knows she likes men and would like a romantic relationship some day but never wanted to). She said that she thinks she can see us in a romantic relationship and that's as far as she's gotten with herself now. 

This made me really happy and I want to change myself, for her and for her. I'm around ~280 lbs right now and I was on keto for a few days. To show I have self-control and that I can take care of myself.

For those few days, it was going. But today, I broke it HARD. After eating my meal, I decided to eat pizza, alfredo, and even a seafood boil with rice. Soda and desserts and all. Now my stomach hurts and I feel terrible. It's just so hard to lose weight, I feel pathetic.

64,"So i think i've had this problem for a long time but only now that i have a job it has manifested in full force.

Whenever i do anything that is midly important (in general but mostly work related stuff), for the following days and even weeks i can't stop thinking if what i did was ok or if i made a mistake on a number or a word or something. Even if my boss or my friends tell me its ok i cant shake the feeling that i might have screwed up at some point. It has gotten to the point where i randomly wake up at 2:30am to turn on my laptop and check something on the paper i delivered 3 days ago or whatever.

It's getting really hard because i beat myself too hard over the smallest things, and people praising me for doing well my job or something makes matters worst since i get this extra pressure for not making mistakes at all.

I've considered picking up a sport or do something that distracts me enough to not think about those things, but i dont know what to do really.

This post is me basically just letting off some steam since i dont feel like talking about this stuff with my friends or coworkers.",17Jan2019,1
65,"Getting right into it, my apt complex has changed hands at least 2 times in the past six months. The first time it changed, the Management company decided they wanted to completely renovate EVERYTHING from the clubhouse to the apartments themselves. Which was cool and everything because when they did so they decided to make the clubhouse (at least the part the tenants were interested in (game room, business centre, fitness centre, etc.) 24/7 which was great because that meant when I got off work at 6:30 PM, even though the office was closed I could go work out and I could let go of my Planet Fitness membership. 

Well I suppose management realized how expensive it was to completely renovate an entire apartment complex so mid renovation the complex got sold again to another company. I really didn't have a problem with this until recently when I realized that the company is attempting to cut costs by cutting off certain amenities of the complex (game room and business centre being two of them) and just completely disregarding the safety of some of the tenants. The reason why I say this is because the clubhouse can only be accessed after hours by a particular door and an electronic key that only tenants have. There was a small margin of safety with this which I was okay with especially since when I come home its pitch black dark. Once you were in the building, you had access to the amenities available and there were bathrooms in the building so you wouldn't have to either A) go outside to the pool bathroom, or B) go back to your apartment. When the second new company took over, they closed off the inside bathrooms by putting locks on them and made them ""private"" bathrooms for staff only. If you were inside the building you would have to go with option A or option B.

I feel this is a problem because, yeah the pool bathroom is available, but the pool gates are not locked along with the rest of the building. So potentially, anyone can come to the pool area and literally stalk unsuspecting females (or males) and attempt something. There's a level of safety that is removed with this, and I, being a previous sexual assault victim, do not like this portion of safety removed. It felt like if I was inside there was an extra barrier. True I'm not completely safe and the possibility of being sexually assaulted is not completely removed, but there was another level of safety there. 

I'm thinking about sending an email with my concerns to Management and asking them to reconsider this for safety purposes. Am I being unreasonable or is this the right course of action to take for this.

TL:DR

Apt complex has imposed something that is a possible safety hazard and I am wondering how to address it, or even if I should address it. ",17Jan2019,1
66,"At first I wanted to study journalism, but the more I think about it the less I want to do it. It’s too competitive, the salaries are low, and I don’t have the personality for it. I am quite a shy, awkward introvert so I don’t think I’d do well having a job that is basically to talk to strangers. But most jobs for awkward introverts are computer based, which I know nothing about. I am much better at, and more interested in writing, politics, history, international studies, etc.

People always say you should “follow your passions” but none of my interests will lead to a high paying career. At this point I don’t exactly care about “passions” because I just want to be able to afford traveling, and an apartment in the city. I just want to create the easiest possible path for this. I really wish I were good at math and science so I could study engineering or computer science and practically be guaranteed a living. I go to a pretty respected, prestigious university but I still feel lesser than for not being a STEM major.

Next semester I signed up for an intro computer science class to see if I’ll like it. I don’t think I will, but I’m tempted to major in it anyway, since it’s a strong major and probably more suited to a quiet, reserved person like me. I feel like I’m limited in my job options since I don’t think I have the right personality for a corporate job and office jobs don’t really interest me anyway. My professors tell me I’m very smart and bright but I sometimes feel like I’m doomed to live with my parents forever. I don’t know what to do. I am still a freshman, so maybe it’s too early to worry. But, is there anything else I can look into that can help me figure this out?

TLDR: everything I want to study won’t lead to a high paying job. I’m not smart enough at math or science for STEM either. What do I do?",17Jan2019,1
67,"So I am getting a lot of advice lately that I need someone in my life.

The thing is I am not interested in girls my age. They are like children to me.

Like, lets just say my life is complicated and if I am going to be with someone, there has to be like a connection. Like someone who can relate to me and what I have been through.

So I am thinking I need to be with someone who is older.

I see no reason though why a more mature woman would want to have anything to do with me.

I am 15. I have no job, no car, no money. All I think I have to offer is I have a good heart. Thats about it.

69,"Hi. I created reddit for this post alone. I apologize in advance if my grammar is bad, I’m not much of a writer. I’m gonna be as real as I can in this post and will just say it how it is. 
Growing up I lived a good life, I got what I wanted and was always super happy and full of life. I was not money oriented and my family didn’t have much but I was people oriented and experience hungry. Which I still am today. Once I finished high school I just bought a ticket out west and from there just lived life. I went from job to job as I explored, and just loved life. I was so wild and free, I did whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. I moved back home 6 years ago. Within four of those years I went to school and still had so much fun and always surrounded myself with friends. During my last year, I met the love of my life and married him right out of university. I’m very happy and love him very much. 
Here is where I’m struggling, I’m an extrovert and he’s an introvert. I always wanna go out and have fun and be free but he never wants to leave the house and never wants to spend time with anyone. It’s been about a year and I’ve given up everything for him my friends, my hobbies, my freedom. Just being real... I’m not able to do my own thing, on top of that I’m working a steady job and we just got a house. I understand everyone needs to grow up but I’m just not ready yet. I’m 23. I’m scared and nervous and so sad. I miss my life, I miss having friends and going on adventures. 
I understand I’m being selfish, and I understand I need to grow up. 
I just don’t know how and I’m having a hard time with it. When I try to do the things I love and when I try to be myself I find myself always conforming to his ways and his lifestyle. 
How do I still hold onto myself when I’m married and live with someone completely different then me?

I'm a bit chubby, but I have big legs and a really wide back. I told her that her assessment that I was ""obese"" was not correct and that her recommendation that I get down to 190 is not realistic for my body type because I carry a lot of muscle.

The boss was always on my case, he messaged me 24/7, outside of work, which made it feel like I was always on the clock and never had the feeling of not being at work. There was a high turnover and a few of my friends worked for the main business and got treated badly and developed high stress levels to the point that they left pretty fast. One collapsed and had to go to hospital after a panic attack and I also had a panic attack driving to work one morning.

The general atmosphere of work was quite negative. You'd come in and feel something come on over you and you'd instantly be stressed and anxiety ridden and if the boss was in and looming around it'd be tripled.

A month or so ago accounts weren't getting payed so I wasn't able to order in more stock to keep up with production and the boss expected me to keep on pumping out product despite. 

All-in-all it was just a negative job experiance and one of the worst I've had insofar.

Monday I started a new job working at a gas station. It's a major step down but I love the work. I handed in my notice last Satuday and have been trying to work two jobs at once while trying to train up a new person but it's too much. 

I'm just needing advice; I still have a ways to go but I'm wanting to just quit and leave it at that.

80,"Hi everyone,

I’m 24 and currently in my last semester of college and I already landed a solid job, my goal has always been to rent an apartment since I don’t enjoy living with my parents at all, in fact, I did an exchange semester and what I enjoyed the most was living on my own.

The problem is, if I leave the house I’ll leave my mom on her own with my dad who had a stroke 4 years ago. My dad had to retire because of his stroke and the right part of his body paralyzed, he has made great progress and currently teaches in college and can walk without a cane, no problems with speech etc..but he’s definitely not completely independent, my mom needs help with carrying groceries, carrying laundry, and basically everything that involves physical activity. My parents are aging, they are about to turn 60.

My parents plan was supposedly to sell the house (which is for 4 people, 2 levels), around this time (when I’m in my last semester of college) and buy something smaller and cozier for them, but they haven’t done anything so far. I feel like if I don’t force them to sell the house, they’re never going to do anything about it, but I don’t want to be a complete dick that tells them that they need to sell their house, it’s basically like I’m kicking them out of their own house. If I leave the house they are going to be living in a huge house for 2 persons and my mom is going to be needing help with my dad; which I think is worse. 

I love my parents and I’m grateful for all the opportunities they’ve given me, but come on, I want to be able to get home drunk, not having someone looking trough my stuff everyday, being able to spend some time with my girlfriend, smoke a blunt, invite some friends over without problems !!!

85,"So here's the background story. Towards the later part of last year, I (20f) went on a date with someone (20m) who I had a crush on for a while. We hit things off really well and although he was busy quite often (which was true, he showed me his schedule and we go to the same school so I know he was being legit), he would invite me to dinner or drinks/casual hangouts with his friends whenever he was free. We both told each other that we liked each other a lot, but as the casual ""relationship"" or whatever progressed, some things got in the way.

 On his end, he was just busy with work and school so there wasn't much room for the one-on-one time that I really value, especially since I feel like I didn't get to know him as well as I would've liked on an emotional level. On my end, I don't think I was in the right place to be dating. A few days after our first date, my best friend tried to kill himself and I was the one who helped him through it most, so a lot of my energy was being directed towards that but I of course did not tell the boy I was seeing what was going on. On top of that, I struggled a lot with anxiety that was coupled with low self-esteem, so looking back I feel like I didn't put in the effort that I should've been putting into communicating with him or seeing him. I just felt like I was bothering him or would come across as needy if I texted him, but now I realize that keeping in contact like that was necessary, especially since our schedules wouldn't allow us to see each other as often as we would have liked. On top of that, one of his close friends wasn't comfortable with us seeing each other, but we saw each other anyway since he said he would confront his friend about it and tell him what was going on between us, but weeks passed and he was too afraid of telling him which really irritated me. 

Anyway, that whole thing lasted about three and a half weeks before it just fizzled out. I'm in a much better place now and have been thinking about him lately and how I really enjoyed getting to know him and how much I enjoyed his company. Would it be weird to ask him out to dinner or something out of the blue?

Two days ago after a fight with my husband (it’s not his fault, I know it was extremely selfish to do this after a fight but something just snapped) I filled up the bathtub and cut my wrists. He came home early and stopped it all. 

I’ve been advised by family not to tell any health care professionals I tried to kill myself, because then child protective services will get involved and we may lose our kids. 

I don’t think there is anything wrong with our family life, it’s just me whose become a bit of a mess, the last 6 months I’ve developed anxiety, I have panic attacks and generally feel very depressed at how my life is going. I can’t drive anymore and I’ve given up my career while being sick and seeking treatment, and I feel like a bad wife and on days where I can’t get out of bed to play with my son I feel like the worst mum.

I talked to my GP today, I didn’t tell her I tried to kill myself, I told her I was feeling anxious and having dark thoughts. She sent a referral through to the midwives at the hospital so they can help me with pregnancy emotions. 

I feel like I should have told her what is really going on, but I’m terrified they’ll take the kids. 

I guess I’m asking if anyone else had any experience in this? Have you tried to kill yourself while having children, and if so what happens after you tell a health care worker? Do docs come to your home? My husband is the best father, our house is always full of love and laughter, it’s just me going through whatever the hell this is.

93,"I'm in Edinburgh Scotland and after googling for escorts, found an ad for a Japanese girl who listed her availability as 10 in the morning until late at night seven days a week. When I went to the building I was somewhat surprised that another (older asian) woman answered the door as if it were a brothel. The operation was clearly secretive: I was supposed to text her to open the door instead of knocking, and to walk in very silently and whisper. The girl herself was a different girl from the ad and was Chinese, not Japanese, and she barely spoke English. She laughed a lot and seemed friendly and pretty comfortable. She also gave a very good back massage at the end, not sure if this is an indication one way or the other. She did have a band-aid on her shoulder, for what that's worth.

I'm putting all these pieces together now and I'm not sure if it was a regular illegal brothel or something much worse. I've read that there are a lot of Chinese sex slaves in the UK. I feel horrible about my participation in this and I'm not sure whether to contact the police. First of all, I don't want to be arrested for solicitation, although I don't think that is a crime here. Also, if there's no trafficking I would feel bad having them bust it. If there is trafficking, I wouldn't want a gang going after the old clients knowing someone ratted.

Last night, my dad lost it on me. He told me it would be better if I moved out cause I “view him as only a check” (not sure if he means it). Now he wants me to come back cause he has gathered his thoughts after a day. I don’t want to live with him at this point, but if I didn’t I would have to do online high school while living w my mom. I can’t choose between my friends here along w my sister or live w my mom (who I have a pretty good relationship with). What should I do?

I can either stick it out till the summer, living with my dad in a strained relationship and see my sister along with my Friends from school

Or I can go to my moms and do online school and be able to live in peace  

All I see in my future is me, alone as ever. I can’t think straight right now. ",17Jan2019,1
95,"What you need to know:

•Parents recently divorced
•Their property hasn’t been divided yet including the house. 
•My dad was out of the country for about 6 months and came back yesterday. 
•They’re under the same roof at the moment 

So I’ve been notified by my oldest brother that my sweet mom called him in tears because my dad took they keys to her van from her purse. This van has been an ongoing issue within their divorce as they both feel they should own said van. 

According to my mom the court decided she will keep it. When my dad left the country she paid all that was needed to get it back on the road and in use (the van has been collecting dust in our garage for years because my dad already has a separate car &amp; due to the conflict they let the tags expire). The siblings were glad she did as she needs a reliable car and she purchased the van originally (although my dad took over the payments later on and paid it off). 

In order to fully understand the context I’d have to go on and on but essentially I’m in a position here where I don’t know what to do. My dad knows what the court decided yet refuses to let her keep this van that she could very much use and he doesn’t need. His plans are to take the van out of the country (too much to explain). 

All of the siblings feel that we need to take some kind of action here but we would like to keep it as peaceful as possible. My mom has renal failure and is on dialysis. We don’t want anything to disturb her as she is not the strongest physically. 

Anyone out there who has experienced divorcing parents or has been through a divorce that can help me with this? 

**also I just want to add that my dad is not a bad person in the least. He is a sweet man who has been patient and understanding toward my mom for many years. He has given her mostly what she has asked for and always what she needed. ",17Jan2019,1

I'm 21 years old, a Front-end developer and also one of the owners of a startup here in our area. But being one of the owners of a young (more than 1/2 year) startup is not enough to support myself yet. I just need an advice if I should continue studying still (which is like paying just to get a degree) or just focus on improving my skills and then finding a great job in the future. Also, I've been a developer for over 2 years now, mostly personal projects but I've worked with few clients before. I'm constantly learning atleast 1 hour of coding everyday just to develop my skills but sometimes school stuff (assignments or projects) gets in the way.  


I also have to mention that here in our country, people are mostly traditional that they will choose the person with a degree over someone that has the skills. That's also one thing why I want to improve my skills and get a job from other countries that prefer skills over a degree. I can send you my portfolio or something if you to check it.

107,"Update from earlier today: https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/agnhmp/how_to_pay_for_school/?utm_source=reddit-android

Had a semi-brief conversation about the course and how i could pay for it with both my parents. My mom had given me a raving text saying how much she thought it was a good idea, how id do amazing, how it would be great for me, etc. Then she barely said anything when i brought the subject up to them in person while my dad was condescending towards me (normal) and tried to discredit the course because 'why dont you have access to a dog? Seems odd' - funny thing is, if they did 'give out' or 'rent out' dogs to people in this course i wouldnt even be able to do that because my dad is allergic and if youre training a dog you should be with it for waaaaay more than an hour once a week or something.

I asked about payment options and they told me no, not because of my school history, but because i have enough in my savings to pay for it. Savings they always preach to never touch, to use only for their intended purpose (in this case a car i really need to be able to better service my business as rhe bus takes so much time out of my day and limits me incredibly), etc. They said i could pay myself back but i cant because of my freaking rent, i break even every month i dont have extra money for savings anymore. Whats there is whats there. I asked about a rent decrease (thats what happened last time i went to school) and they also turned me down on that.

They didnt even say if they thought the course was a good idea, only if i chose to do it that theyll then support me (basically they wont support me until i make a decision even though i already had and had made that clear. I wanted to do this course). I wanted their opinions because i respect them and they just tried their best to dissuade me without actually saying 'dont do it'. I honestly think they still hope that my business will crash and burn so that ill take a steady, reliable, wrist-slitting office job in a fucking cubicle.

108,"I'm 35 and female, for the record. 

Two years ago I got back in the dating game after ten years off the market, after a five year long-distance relationship failed and with it a failed plan to immigrate to start a new life. So, I decided to try dating apps for the first time...

There was this guy, he wasn't my type at all looks-wise (this is my type now!) but he showed a great deal of interest and was easy to get along with so I decided to give him a chance. At first the date wasn't great, I honestly considered climbing out the window to escape, but something happened to change that and by the end of the night we were kissing. He asked me to go home with him that night and that should have been a warning sign...but I thought that maybe that's normal for dating now and I shouldn't hold it against him. To be honest I did go home with him after date number two, and the sex was great. 

But soon it became more like a booty call, he slowly started to show who he was and hint that he wouldn't be one to want a relationship...despite his knowing that's what I wanted, he avoided being honest with me but I think I'm guilty of not being honest either as I convinced myself I could be casual to enjoy more time with him. 

It turned out he not only wanted casual, but he wanted to date multiple other women and even include me in sex with other women - 100% not okay with me. He also showed himself to be a narcissist and manipulative, I could go into a conversation with a clear idea but by the end be thinking completely differently. I tried to convince myself I was okay with everything and dismiss my increasing anxiety as just dating nerves, any time I did question how he treat me he'd twist me around again so I wasn't quite thinking straight due to his manipulation either. But I was so hooked. 

We were only together a couple of months but I was totally intoxicated by him despite everything. Over a year later I still think about him often, I bit on a couple of occasions when he tried messaging me on Facebook...and regretted it. A few months ago I saw him on a dating app again and we matched, I almost agreed to meet him again, he took too long to get back to me on meeting and so I thought better of it, I unmatched him but I still hope he'll try contacting me again...thus on New Year Eve I unblocked him on Facebook. I still secretly check out his social media too. 

I'm normally so sensible with guys, I've always done well to avoid fuckboys in the past, even when I've come across other douches I've liked I've not gotten hooked. But THIS GUY is so deep under my skin, I know he's terrible for me and I'd hate myself if I did get involved with him in any way again, I don't know why or how to manage how I feel.

113,"this is going to be long but i really need advice and to vent 


i am 17f. my boyfriend is 18m. we used to live in the same town, but he got in legal trouble and had to move a few states away. during this time, i was finishing high school. now i have graduated, and am “free” for the next 8 months until i move to my college town in august. for about the past year (we’ve been together like 15 months), i have been planning on moving away when i graduate due to a bad family situation and restlessness/anxiety about the future.

that family situation has gotten better. i feel more comfortable and loving towards them, and am not as hurt as i once was. situation with bf has been both good and bad. i really love him and i really want to be with him. i haven’t felt anything like that with anyone else, etc etc. i know i’m young. i feel like i am wearing rose colored glasses and not seeing this situation objectively so i am asking for honest advice. 

the plan has been for me to move to where he is, with his family, to start working and see how things work out. but i have such a great deal of anxiety about this for many reasons. 

one of the first reasons is that he’s ultimately screwed if he comes into contact with LE again. he’ll be arrested and spend however much time in jail. i will have to live my whole life, with him, like this as well. one of the second reasons is that i dont know what the best decision is for me right now, and i don’t have the one person i would need for this situation, my dad, because he’s dead, and has been since i was 13. 

another reason is that there’s 5 people living in a small house. it’s cozy and warm and safe but i feel like i am using and taking advantage of his family, and i want to feel the opposite, i want to feel independent. 

the main reason is bf’s mental health. as long as i’ve known him he’s had his own issues, but in my opinion they have worsened the past few months since he got in legal trouble. which is understandable. at this point he has told me many times and ways that if it weren’t for me, he’d be dead, and other times that he just needs to kill himself in order to ‘save me’ from himself. of course both of these things terrify me. i can’t be the reason for someone elses suicide, especially the person i’ve gotten closest to in my adolescent years, and i don’t want to leave him and contribute to his death. 

i am really at a loss as to what to do, i love him so much and wish i could just make all of this different but it seems that i must make a choice between go 800 miles away alone to be with him and give it a chance, or stay here and work and be with my family until i go to college. 

he has also told me that he doesnt think he would last until i went to college, which is when he could live with me, which is the main reason he wants me to come down there now. and i do want to go down there, its not like i dont, im just feeling so conflicted about this entire situation and i need objectivity and help from people who have maybe experienced something like this. if you read this all, thank you.

116,"Since I was about 6/7, I've never been all that emotionally close with my mum. Through years of therapy, I can now understand why. She almost completely invalidates every negative emotion I experience. If I'm sad, I need to get over it. If I'm angry, I have no right to be. If I'm being bothered at all, it's my responsibility to remove myself from the situation or ignore it. If i react negatively towards someone who made me feel sad or angry, snap at someone verbally, or hit my brother BACK when we were kids, I was the one who was souly at fault, never was any consequence held to original perpetrators. And somewhat I agree with this! You choose your actions, but all her emphasis was blame on me. This also put massive strain on my relationship with my brother. You know how brothers are. 

I've managed to go through therapy, and see her as a person, not ""mum"", which helped somewhat. But now I'm just mad.

Small exmple: I visited on the weekend with my SO. We were having dinner with mum and dad. My partner said something rude to me, mum laughed, I did too, and I said ""well now you don't get any of my pizza"". My partner jokingly looked upset, he didn't care that much, we play tease all the time. My dad laughed and said ""that's what you get"" But my mum chimes in and says ""oh look. You upset him. That's not nice pugblep"" seriously....like what he had said to me didn't matter at all to her.

Small example, but throughout my entire life. I just can't talk to her about anything because everything gets turned around to being a personal fault of mine. If anyone has any advice on how to move past this hate I'd love to hear, cutting her out of my life is not an option.

119,"Hello. So I had to move back with my parents 1.5 years ago because my life got ruined. I'm going to throw out my story in bullet point form to shorten this up a little:

**Prelude**. August 2015. Me and my girlfriend of 8.5 years moved out to the west coast for a 1-3 month adventure. We ended up loving it, so we stayed because we got jobs and were growing and thriving.

**2 years later**. June 2017. Still living on the west coast. At this point we have an apartment together. We also have a car. We also both have good paying full-time jobs. $10K in combined savings. We are happy. But, it all fell apart because she fell in love with somebody else. She moved out. Completely depressed, I quit my job (we worked in the same establishment AND her new bf also worked there). I lived alone for 6 months, jobless, depressed, wasting my savings on rent and alcohol. When I ran out of money, I asked my parents if I could stay at their place for a bit to get back on my feet. They said of course. So I moved back out east, to my parents.

**1.5 years later**. September 2018. I am still at my parents. However...

*This is where the problem occurs...*

- My parents' landlord wants to sell his house. He tells my parents they need to find a new place in 3 months.
- It's important to note that all of us live in poverty. Well, we're not dirt poor, but we all live paycheck to paycheck. Their current house costs **$850/mo** (Canadian dollars. $640.29 USD equivalent). It's just a modest duplex, however it was a 3 bedroom and we all lived comfortably in it. The bedroom I stayed in was just an unused storage room.
- I tell them, ""I don't have enough money to move out on my own yet but............ **please do not consider me as a factor while you are house hunting. In other words, realistically you will need a 3 bedroom apartment for you guys, my brother, and me. Of course, that will be more expensive, so don't worry about me and simply get a 2 bedroom. I'll sleep in the basement, or on the couch. Then I'll leave when I get enough money to move out. Also hopefully we don't get a house with a  lease......**"" I made it very explicit that I could leave at any point.
- So........ they ended up getting a **$2000/mo** (Canadian. $1,506.76 USD equivalent) town house!!!! Absolutely out of their budget. Not only that, but this new house has a **1 year lease!**

**4 months later**. Today. January 2019. At this point my parents still haven't told me up front that they expect me to live here for the entire duration of the lease (ending this year September 2019). However I am paying rent..... well I haven't paid January rent as I had to leave work due to an injury (ruined my back. damaged nerves). 

******************************

**So**

Here's my question to you all.

Am I expected to live here until the lease expires (Sept 2019)?

My question is, if so, then when will it end? They already said they will live here beyond 2019. ",17Jan2019,1

TBH i don't think we are close and I felt like my brother isn't my brother anymore.  I tried to open up to him and have a heart to heart but, he didn't listen.  My parents kinda of adore my brother (even more now since he is making money now.)  I slowly feel like I am drifting away from my parents (or they are drifting from me), I love my mother but, my father was always an abusive parent who I felt like never really wanted me.  I know how this sounds that there were a lot of bullies but, it was true.  I also know that maybe the problem could be me, which is also true.  I thought about this a lot over the years (even saw a therapist for a number of years).  I tired going to meetups, patook, and any other places to make friends but, everyone just flakes after a week or two :/.  I didn't make much friends even though I tired.  I felt like all throughout my life I never fit in a group.  I feel like in the future I am going to stop talking to my family completely.

123,"Hey guys first time posting on reddit

Lately I 19[m] have been really struggling in life. I don’t really have that many friends and I go to a community college, but all my classes are online so I can work more. That being said I don’t really meet that many people unless it’s someone at work who’s asking where the bathroom is. 

Most all of my friends go to a university and I always see them partying, having a good time while I’m stuck a work and  living at my moms house.  If I’m not at work, which is still a good portion of time, I just play videogames because I literally have no one to hang out with. It really sucks and it’s kinda embarrassing. I really feel like missing out on an important aspect of life. 

I feel like I’m just stuck in a rut in my life and can’t get out. I’m fairly social and most looking for a relationship with a female, but any friends is better than none right....

I kept trying to give them back and he wouldn’t take them😩.

I was joking, I literally told him a million times that I was joking. so he comes in like an hour later and brings me tacos againnn. I had a costumer &amp; was in the middle of a transaction so i couldn’t even argue with him lol. also, he’ll be like “I just came in here to stare into your eyes” &amp; yesterday he was like “oh you did your hair today, wow so sexy” but he says it in like a tone that makes me think that he’s just playing around lol. so i’ll just be like “shut up you’re dumb” &amp; every once in a while he comes to buy something he gets candy and then gives it to me.

He also tries to make me laugh, like he’ll say some dumb shit that he thinks is funny. but i can’t help to smile sooo much whenever he comes in like it’s ridiculous lol . so i just want your opinion cause idk if he’s being deadass with his comments or if he’s just trying to get a reaction out of me.

126,"I won’t say which year I’m in exactly, but I have the opportunity to go to another high school next year. I’ll provide some background on why I’d like to transfer. Basically, I grew up being very stubborn, difficult, and annoying. I’ll admit it and I definitely understand why people used to dislike me. I go to a special program which I’ve been going since 3rd grade, it’s for people who have an especially high iq and it’s really selective. However, I don’t feel right there. My personality has changed significantly over the past few years, yet due to the fact that I grew up with the same chunk of people for years, I have a bit of a reputation. No one hates me (though they used to), but I know a lot of people have strong opinions on me. I do have a lot of great people who don’t dislike me and an abundance of friends but i really hate the underlying reputation I possess due to the actions of my pre pubescent self. I’m a good student, and all the teachers seem to like me, and I do have success in school but it’s just, not for me. The campus is super gloomy, the community is filled with druggies, and I have to drive an hour each morning. Everyone judges one another and it’s just an ongoing competition that doesn’t need to occur. I’m being forced to pursue medicine and I just completely dislike the prejudice at my school. If I want to, I can transfer to an all girls school with an AMAZING campus, nice people, a fresh start, and a very good academic reputation, but I’d have to make a completely new set of friends, and I’d be giving up the label of my old school and it would be difficult to start over, and colleges could regard this as a bad thing I suppose. Should I say f it and transfer? Or should I stay in my gloomy school filled with very competitive smart kids who possibly dislike me??

127,"Do not read if easily triggered, nothing too graphic but not for you if you’re easily disturbed by mental health issues.

I had anxiety already but this is on a different level. I’m sorry I don’t even really know how to describe what’s going on with me. I’ve had panic attacks before but this has become like a dissociative episode or something. I’m spending more time in my day panicking than not.

It’s like I’m constantly on edge. I had a random outburst criticizing a family member and I don’t even really know what happened or what I was saying. I can’t think straight and I’m so distracted. I felt so bad for lashing out and I didn’t want to explain to them that I’m on edge because of something that happened so I just said nothing to them after that.

It’s just when I get overwhelmed by feeling panicked that I get snippy and short with people. I want to tell people to leave me alone but obviously I don’t because that’s rude.

I’m fine half of the time but I’ve been having hours of panic and/or crying and it’s really wearing me out. Not always about the trauma but also about other things going on in my life. At one point I got stressed about an ex and became very dissociated and thought I was loosing my mind.

I have also had a few extremely bad headaches from the stress. I have had no appetite.

I have regular counseling sessions scheduled. I started going to them last semester because I was stressed about relationships and school and normal things. I very much do not want to talk about the trauma that happened in counseling. I do not feel comfortable talking about it at all.

What exactly am I supposed to do? Should I suggest to my counselor that I may need anti anxiety meds?",17Jan2019,1
128,"I think I am having a quarter life crisis...

I'm almost a 25 year old male and still live at home. I have a full-time job that I've been at for almost a year, with good benefits, and in a field that I'm satisfied with staying in and advancing in, but don't make particularly much (a little under $30K), although I don't have any dependents to worry about yet. I plan to do two school courses, each starting in a couple of months, in order to move ahead in the field I have chosen. Luckily they are short, relatively cheap courses that I could realistically have both completed within the next year and a half, and then move onto a much better-paying job (+$50K). My self-esteem is okay, although I wish I were a bit taller (I am 5' 5.5'' in the U.S., where the average is 5' 9'' - 5' 10''), and I regularly get mistaken for being around 15 years old (not good). It doesn't help that I am only hardly established in the world.

This all does sounds fairly good, and I suppose that it really is, but aside from that I just don't have much of a life. I just go to work, come home, eat, surf the internet for a while and sleep, and then I don't know what to do with my free time on the weekends other than all of the above (minus work, of course). I have fantasies about starting a business, completing my education, and moving out on my own, and being an independent adult, but my current situation doesn't allow me to do these things, and everybody still sees me as a kid, which I hate. I also think I need a girlfriend or something, because I am getting older and find being without somebody to share life with increasingly unfulfilling and depressing. I've had a couple of opportunities through siblings' friends of girls who showed interest, but not for a while, and didn't know how to handle it at the time but wish that I did. I have a deep internet crush on somebody that I don't know and don't live around (one state over according to social media. So close and yet so far away), which depresses me. I don't know how to proceed from here in this aspect of life.

To be honest, I am actually doing a lot better than I was even just one year ago, when I didn't even have a job and was freaking out about approaching my mid-twenties with virtually nothing to show for it since high school other than the trade/certificate that I currently have for work. You can imagine how many times over that my restlessness, boredom, and anxiety were magnified (as well as my OCD, which I still struggle to deal with now, albeit to a much lesser extent today) at that time compared to today, when even now I still get regular flashes of mental stress over how quickly my youth is ticking away while further progress in life seems slow and sluggish, if not stunted and stalled out entirely.",17Jan2019,1

130,"I (21F) work at a coffee shop at a hospital and a doctor (69M) who is one of our regular customers comes by quite frequently. Apparently, I am one of his favorite baristas and I am also his friend. Today when he came by to get his drink he told me that he knew my birthday and I asked him how, since I never told him. 

The customer told me that he tried to look me up on Facebook (which I don’t have)  but couldn’t find me so he decided to look me up on a website (a background check website) called MyLife. At this point I’m internally freaking out because he knows my birthday and he knows the area that I live in not my exact address. 

He told me that that’s all he saw on the website and that he said that he would have to pay to see my entire background check. 

(When I looked myself up on the website I saw that it had my name, age, and the location that I live at right now. It also shows my parents names which I live with momentarily and the address which I live at right now, which is blurred out. Also the background check shows my neighbor and their blurred out address too. )

He asked me if I was upset and I said that I was weirded out by it and I told him that he could’ve asked for my birthday and Facebook and I would’ve given it to him (if I had a Facebook). I asked him why he needed to know my birthday and he said that he wanted to give me a gift for my birthday. And he told me that he apologizes if he made me upset, which I am. 

Also, mind you, this man has been telling me some weird things lately like, he spends so much money at the coffee shop to see me, he’s offered to take me out to lunch, and even offered to help me study for a test. He also told me that he likes watching porn and that he likes looking at pretty women.

133,"I suddenly got a call two hours ago, an uncle got me an interview tomorrow to work at a call center and I don't want to go. Yes, I'm looking for a job, that's what I'm supposed to be doing but I don't feel ready yet. 

I have clinical depression, I struggle to do basic stuff like waking up from the bed, cooking, concentrating... I already dropped college once because I couldn't pass the first semester, I failed all my classes for one or two points so I feel kind of proud for being able to almost keep with the rest of the class despite my depression.

I haven't gone to a psychiatrist before because I used to live in a country where medicines are scarse (ahemvenezuelaahem). I moved abroad with my grandparents who already lived here and I was planing to go to a psychiatrist before starting to look for jobs but I suddenly have to go to this interview and I feel so... overwhelmed, I want to be rejected by the interviewer so badly because I don't think I'll be able to keep the job. 

And that's something I don't want to happen because my future boss is a family's friend and whatever I do at my job he's going to tell my family, including failing. But I can't tell my grandparents about my mental health issues for many reasons:

- They have strong prejudices about mental health, until the point that they speak about perfectly independent family friends with mental health problems like if they were poor puppies that can't even walk by themselves.

- They're too overprotective, they treat me like if I was 14 and I'm 20, they don't understand how to treat me like an adult and I already accepted that they won't change, but my mental health issues would give them more excuses to keep being overprotective and asfixiating. I set boundaries with them everyday and they honestly try to keep them but they can't for too long, they can't run away from their own nature.

- They can't keep secrets, is like keeping the smallest secret overwhelmed them until they told someone else and I don't want my personal issues to get to some toxic relatives that always have wished me the worst.

So, no. Talking with my grandparents is a big no and my uncle is even less understanding than them. I have to go to the interview, work and try my best....

135,"All I want in my life is to be happy.  I don’t think I’ve ever been truly happy for an extended period of time for my entire life (this assumption is purely off of memory so it is possibly inaccurate).  My parents said I was a happy child and rarely cried so it’s kind of funny how I’ve been depressed for 2+ years (and that’s just the time I knew what depression was, so I could have had it for way longer).  Happiness is subjective, so I understand why many people cannot give quality advice to others on the subject.  That’s why I’m asking you guys because you’re likely to actually understand how I feel.  Most people just say, “You have to find what makes you happy.”  My response to that is I don’t want to rely on finding a “passion,” a pretty and sweet wife, etc. in order to become happy.  I just want to be genuinely happy with life in general.  I’m not expecting to be happy all the time, as that is impossible,  but I want to be happy more than I am depressed at the very least.  I know that genetics play a role in one’s happiness levels (happiness levels sounds really weird but that’s the best I could come up with 😂), but even if my genetics don’t favor happiness, I don’t want to give up and just be miserable my whole life and/or kill myself.

138," I started a new job at an auto repair shop as a lot porter in December. My job is pretty easy, I do some light cleaning of the shop, move cars, help when asked, etc. More or less a shop bitch, but sometimes...I run out of things to do.

I like my coworkers. But there's this one guy. He's an asshole at best, a bully at worst. He made the previous tire guy's life miserable, constantly shits on one of the car technicians, tries to get management to fire people and recently, he's started more on me. At first, it was just general shit talking, then it progressed to him stepping on the broom while I was sweeping...just slowly pushing his boundaries further. After the tire guy quit, he's been having to do them, which makes him angry. 

Last week, he decided to throw a tire weight as hard as possible at my ankle, bruised my shit up for a majority of the week. On Monday, my manager tells me I should stay away from the tire machine, because the higher up said ""I don't look comfortable"" around it, a few hours later, the guy tells me that he told the higher up that I need to stay away from the tire machine because I was to lazy to learn how to use it (not at all true, I stayed away from it because the last two tire guy's were originally porters who were ""only supposed to be temporary"", but got forced into it permanently without the proper pay bump).

Today was a slow day for me, not a whole lot to do, he was doing tires. He started in on me about being lazy, kept on asking me if I was going to do anything. I asked what should I do, since he got me banned from the only other thing I could do when things are slow. He has no answer, just kept running his mouth, telling me he's gonna tell the higher ups I'm lazy, that I go home and take 30 minute breaks when I'm clearing vehicles for inspections (which I have absolutely no time for when I'm clearing monitors). 

What the fuck am I supposed to do with this guy? If my job didn't depend on it, I'd of given him the beating he clearly missed out on when he was younger. Going to HR about this won't do me much good, will probably get me fired sooner or build a level of distrust among my other co-workers, and he'll get a slap on the wrist and make shit even worse.

Within a few weeks of moving in she got a very large German Shepard and put up a ton of cameras.  I assume the dog was for protection. I'm not sure if this is the reason but she has never been super friendly.

At first the dog had the whole back yard. Then she put up a fence on the side of the house.  Then she built a cage of chain link fence about 10x15 feet for the dog.  Most of the summer the dog was in there with no shade. Granted I'm not constantly outside, or looking to see what is going on in that side of the wall.  Near the end of summer she put a tarp over top. Last month the dog was able to tear it down.  I assume out of boredom as hes in there all day and night. 

We live in so cal so our winters aren't too harsh but it's been raining lately. And the dog has no shelter.  Hes on cement that is now wet and has no dry  place to lie down. Every time I take my dog out to potty I can hear her dog quietly whining. And it breaks my heart.

I called animal control so see if this is allowed and they didn't seem concerned untill I mentioned the cage and lack of any way for the dog to stay dry. But they needed her exact address which i didnt have. When I asked my husband if I should call back he said "" if you want to cause problems with the neighbors,  go ahead"". Her later told me to call because its wrong. I do NOT want to cause problems but i feel horrible for this dog. We also have 2 high kill shelters in our town that worry me if she just decides to get rid of him if animal controll gets involved. It's not like she has any connection with this dog.

I have a son who is going to be writing some major exams in 2 months. The problem is, he lacks motivation and his mood is always off. I've tried talking to him, in fact just got off from a lecture with him, but his response has been minimal.

He keeps showing signs of mild depression in his actions. He doesn't smile, he takes a bit too much stress. He's never states his preference in what he wants to eat. And worst of all, he keeps getting distracted even when he knows he should be studying for his exams. I need to find a way to get him out of it without external help. 

I'm not sure about the cause of this but it may be related to when we had to move to another country he did not adjust to that well for 2 years.

He never got good grades in any of his exams. He was always an average student. I keep telling him he's smart just that his intelligence is not directed towards studies. He's also extremely unfit, has a lot of breathing issues that come up when he's under pressure. 

One of his distractions is video games. I haven't spoken to him about this at all but I know he has been playing video games, occasionally, after everyone has slept. He plays till 3 am then goes to sleep and wakes up at 12pm. Which is probably the cause of his tiredness but I'm sure there is more to it. 

How do I help my son? He can't mess up these exams. Its the final major one that decides his future and what he's going to do when he grows up. I am very worried about this. I hope this doest get removed from here. Took a lot of time to write this out. 

Edit: it's worth pointing out he is kind of an introvert and doesn't connect with his classmates that well. He's very shy to approach them also because they are kind of spoilt rich brats whom I wouldn't want him to mingle with anyway. And they are smarter than him AKA get better grades. So there is some jealousy in between. ",17Jan2019,1

149,"Whenever I get nervous or anxious around others I have an involuntary smirk that shows up, and try as I might I can't get it to stop. It's happened ever since I was a kid.

This is annoying when I'm interacting with someone who holds a position of authority (like a doctor or cop) since it makes me look like I'm being disrespectful. It's also annoying because to people walking around or being around me they might think I'm smirking at them as if mocking them. The worst was when I was at a funeral for a friend and couldn't stop and people were looking at me thinking I was horrible... even heard one say ""What the hell?""

It sends the totally wrong message about how I am feeling, but I've tried everything from thinking of sad things, pinching myself hard somewhere, biting my cheeks from the inside... nothing stops it.

So I was importing some video files to final cut pro today, and a pop up asked me for permission to turn on my webcam and microphone. Without thinking I accepted both since I assumed it was asking in case I wanted to import a video straight from my webcam to final cut. Right after I clicked accept, my computer froze for a second and then I heard what sounded like fuzz/background noise and someone breathing really heavily. After about a minute it stopped. I immediately tapped paper over my webcam (I used to have something over it, but when it fell off I never bothered replacing it) and checked around for tabs I could have possibly had open that would explain what just happened, but I found nothing. Does that mean someone for sure hacked my webcam? Is there anything I can do to find out if someone did? Does anyone have general advice on what I should do going forward? Sorry if this is a very simple or stupid question, I'm not tech savvy at all and honestly, I'm still just a little creeped out. Thanks in advance!

152,"I posted this in r/legaladvice also. 

My cousin (22) has been mentally unstable since her early teens. Her parents really fucked her up and she had some awful shit happen to her which is a whole other story. When she was 14 she was in a relationship with a guy who was in his mid-late twenties. She has severe depression, body dysmorphia, and she has one of the worst tempers I've ever seen. She flies off the handle and squares up to and threatens to physically fight men, women, anyone who annoys her basically. I seen her go into her own fathers face and say come on and fight me then. It's sad because when she was a kid she was a goody two shoes, homework oriented, sweet and quiet girl. Anyways. 

She's currently living in absolute squalor with a guy (23) who has no job, has an extremely dysfunctional family/lifestory and he's the laziest dude I've ever seen. In their living room there is a busted up sofa with a small tv and a PS4 which he plays 24/7. They lie on a disgusting mattress on the floor as their 'bed'. There is literally no other furniture in the apartment other than the busted up sofa. The apartment is FILLED with rubbish and junk. There's plates lying around with moldy food on it that has been there for months. They had a dog, I say had because it is no longer alive, which used to piss and shit all over the apartment and neither of them would bother to clean it up. My cousin claims her bf killed the dog one night when he went into 'roid rage' as she calls it. He uses anabolic steroids and I have no clue where he gets the money for the steroids. When they eat food, they tear off the packaging and just throw it on the floor. The small balcony is overflowing with massive rubbish bags which there are maggots under. 

They never wash their clothes and wear the same few outfits again and again. They literally NEVER leave their apartment unless it's going to the local store once a week for food or when he goes to the gym. He beats the crap out of her and I think she's violent towards him too. She survives on the money her dad sends her and he is on unemployment. According to their neighbors who actually approached me as I was leaving their apartment one day  telling me they can hear her screaming/shouting/crying at the top of her lungs most days. I know they smoke weed, but I think they're using heavier drugs because of the amount of needles lying around. When I asked my cousin what the needles were for she said it was for her bf to inject the steroids he uses. I don't think they eat much food because they're both scarily thin. 

My cousin got pregnant and miscarried a while back, but says they both still want a baby. Yikes. 

They're both such unapproachable people, especially my cousin. She's not a very nice person, but who would be in these circumstances. Idk it's sad she was so pretty, she's a shell of her younger self. I don't know what to do because it's not like they're reasonable people to say STOP FUCKING LIVING LIKE THIS to. Any advice?

Currently, I'm being forced to go to therapy from my mom. However, in my state, I'm technically a legal adult since I'm over 13 and can make decisions about therapy. This hasn't stopped my mom.

The second time I went is because I wanted it and thought it would help me.

155,"So I'm currently in high school right now, and I've been dating this girl for over 3 months, I really like her and enjoy spending time with her, but I feel like I'm just putting in too much effort into the relationship compared to her.

So for the past 3 months, I’ve always been the one asking if she wanted to hang out, always to receive an “I’m not sure, I’ll check” or “No”. I always clear out my schedule on weekends even if she tells me if she might be free, and most of the time she just tells me (during the middle of the day she said she probably is free) that she's too tired to come, or she's baking something, so I'm just alone for the whole day (because I tell all my friends that I'm busy and they make their own plans), sad, lonely and disappointed

The reason I feel like a plan B is because she’s never told her friends or family that she was busy to spend time with me, it was always waiting for the last minute to see if anyone else wanted to do something with her and then if so, she told me she was busy, and if she really had no other option, she said yes.

I don’t want to make the list too long, but it also seems like she isn’t too proud to be in the relationship, she doesn’t want to tell her friends about our relationship, and even though she usually posts stuff on her snapchat story, she never does when we are together.

Also I try to be really sweet and make her feel happy and special in person, and over text, but she just awkwardly looks at me when I say something like “you look really nice today” or just replies with a “thx”. We haven’t really held hands or kissed or cuddled or done any of those “couply” things, we just act like friends at school, and even when we are “on a date” we never really do anything like that. Idk, even as the boyfriend, I want to feel loved and special in a relationship, but she doesn’t really provide any of that, and most of the days, I am left wondering if she even likes me or not.

We haven’t really held hands or kissed or cuddled or done any of those “couply” things, we just act like friends at school, and even when we are “on a date” we never really do anything like that.

I thought of talking to her about these issues in person, but she gets really defensive and tries to avoid a serious conversation, and I also understand that none of these issues can be just “solved” by just talking to her. Like if she’s not willing to put in the effort to spend time with me, too embarrassed about the relationship, or doesn’t feel comfortable with holding hands, hugging and stuff, I can’t just change that with talking you know?

I am posting this because I usually try really hard to see things from both perspectives and be as fair as possible, so do you guys think I’m being too selfish or ignorant on some of these problems? What do you guys think I should do about this “relationship” (if you can even call it that tbh).",17Jan2019,1

160,"So, a little context first. 

I was in the foster care system in SC for a while, bouncing between foster homes until I was emancipated in May. As I had been planning, I immediately left South Carolina and moved to Florida to live with my biological father, who I had been in contact and planned everything out with, and his new family (step mom &amp; brother).

However, upon moving in with him in May, the situation was different than what had been discussed, and I dont know how much of anything is true. He was the owner of a business and had been pretty well off, as far as I know, up until Decemberish 2017, when his business partner/supplier pulled out. He had apparently been living off of what had been saved up, and I moved in as the money ran out. 

We ended up moving out of the house he had been renting, going to live with my grandparents in South Carolina, which didnt work out, as they had a very small house and weren't easy to get along with. After we left there, we started bouncing around hotels in the area before eventually doing the same back in Florida. 

During this time, my father has allegedly been working on starting up a new business, of which I have seen little to no evidence of progress, there have been many arguments, and as we only have one vehicle, this has left little option other than for step mom to turn to unsavory means in order to keep the family off of the streets. 

We now come to the current situation: 

We're renting a house, using money step mom earns to barely scrape by. 

I've essentially had to drop out of high school due to breaking continuity.

I cant get a job bc I have no way to leave the house. 

My depression has come back with a vengeance.


I dont want to live here anymore but I dont know what I can do with no money, no method of transportation, and nobody I can rely on.

161,"


just for some background we were together for six months.  I’ve had relationships with other girls (longest was about four years) and had just come out of a relationship in March of last year . 

That girl who was the longest relationship I’ve ever been in , cheated on me a lot throughout the relationship and I didn’t find out until the last three months of it . But in the last two years of the end of that relationship we didn’t have much sex . It wasn’t passionate, we especially didn’t feel any love . We broke up on really bad terms and I stayed single for a few months . 

Months of being depressed , and lonely and never expecting to be with another again I met this girl where I work . We connected immediately and went out a few times as friends . Took her out for her birthday one night and we ended up hooking up.  After that we talked and spent time together and got to know each other inside and out ;secrets, desires, dreams, ambitions, goals . Everything ! We shared everything and we loved each other so Much and spent time together a lot and did so much for each other emotionally, physically , mentally and spiritually and on so many other levels we didn’t know were possible  .

I have never experienced anything like it before and neither had she. 
We were always open about our sexual past and basically literally everything else in our lives.
She catered to everything and anything I wanted as I did for her . We had sex so many countless numerous times way more than I can even say. But every time , it was beautiful. We felt our love growing and passion for one another and care and attraction for each other . We did things we never expected to do or share with one another or anyone and we prided ourselves for what we had found within each other as partners .

She brought me out of my comfort zone, opened my eyes, filled me with confidence and pride and admired me . I fell in love with her , not just because of our sexual connection, but because of the love and understanding and everything else we found in each other.

Fast forward to now , we’ve fought over dumb things , and are experiencing trauma in our separate lives as individuals and it has caused us to part but on bad terms .

Now usually, I wouldn’t care or complain or be hurt over a breakup or even care if the other person started dating anyone else . But this time, it terrifies me . I am only still attracted to her , I still only want to be with her , and I still only want to have sex with just her . Before the breakup became too much for us she did tell me that she wasn’t going to be with anyone and she would never hurt me like that or do anything with anyone else.. but she then blocked me everywhere and I haven’t had contact with her since . 

Am I selfish for feeling like this? Afraid of her being with someone else emotionally and physically?? 

I’ve never been in love before , and I know I am now because she has made me feel some way about myself that I never found with all of the other girls I’ve ever dated or hooked up with . It’s beyond just sex . I actually care about her and I know it’s real .....

What do I do?

I’m afraid/don’t want to have sex with any one else and I am afraid of her having sex with anyone else . Am I being selfish ? What do I do ?",17Jan2019,1

169,"Hi y’all, this is a bit lengthy, I apologize! I’ve just bottled it up for too long and oddly enough it’s more comfortable to send it anonymously into the internet...

I’m a landscape painter. I don’t know how I ended up in an animation program in design school, but it seemed like the most “career-oriented” path for me at the time. It’s my junior year, and I’m starting to feel an overwhelming sense of not belonging. For a bit of background, I grew up in rural NC. I have a deep passion for the natural world and the warmth of small rural towns—which may be contributing to my feeling of displacement here in the city. Most of my colleagues are from urban areas, and are in tune with tech, pop culture, etc. They all came into the program with a background in game design/animation/etc and at times I feel so lost when trying to talk to them. I hate the way people react to my southern accent. At first I brushed off the “country girl” jokes and did my best to fit in, but I’m starting to think I should listen to what my discomfort is telling me. 

Don’t get me wrong, I don’t regret coming here. I’ve made some wonderful friends and learned so much more than I could’ve had I stayed. But as scary as it is to finally face, I don’t think I want to work in this environment. The “crunch” attitude of the design field is suffocating. My eyes and hands are already suffering, and I’m worried that I’ll soon burn out from what was once my greatest joy.

More and more, I’m returning to an older career idea... teaching. The university asked me to teach a painting class for incoming students last week, and I really enjoyed it! I love sharing art with others, and I’m confident that I could cultivate a class environment where my students could find refuge from life in the artistic process (even if they don’t particularly like art). I love creating, but I think I love helping others find joy in it even more. There is no pressure of disappointed clients, tight deadlines, or 24/7 work mindset (not to mention the financial security of a salary rather than hunting for freelance gigs). I’m also drawn to the idea of being free to spend my off hours on personal work rather than taking client work back home.

I’m just a bit ashamed to be feeling this way? People don’t get to leave the town I grew up in this often, and I worry that those back home will be disappointed in me if I don’t land some prestigious design position. I wish I didn’t care so much what others thought, I just don’t want those who’ve supported me to think it was in vain. I was always ambitious, and I guess I’m struggling with the idea of abandoning the pursuit? 

Is there shame in stepping back from this? I feel like I’m too young to feel so burnt out.

170,"So tonight we were discussing something with our son. For the life of me I can’t remember the exact initial conversation but it veered and took a hard left when he said something along the lines of “well yea that’s the modern feminist for you who wants to kill all straight white men. Why do you think I’m worried about my generation. Which launched us into an argument about how while that may be true of some feminists it is not a majority, just like there are people in the world who hate a certain race etc etc.

So let’s start with some backstory, when he was in high school he was done in hard by a girl he liked. She lead him along, dated him, broke up with  him, got back together, broke up again, broke his heart. Stuff that all high schoolers have to deal with. But it triggered something in him. He has these delusional ideas that this is how all women act, that more often than not he is the victim. 

Lately he has started talking more openly about his opinions of women to both myself and my wife. Nothing aggressive or violent. (Just an overwhelming fear of them?) Neither of us agree with this, nor do we agree with his sources, which seems to be heavily biased from more of an incel point of view on how women are. He has this constant fear, to the point he won’t go out and do things, experience life, meet people or even try to date etc. He has very low self esteem. He is constantly tearing himself down or making jokes about himself (I don’t believe he is joking) Even when I/we give him positive critique on something he did. I would say it’s more about him being the victim to things that have not actually happened to him. Example: Fear of having a sexual encounter(fears/believes a female would say he raped her later down the line) 

 I’m personally at a loss on how to deal with this as a father. I’ve tried to impress positive role modeling towards females. I firmly believe in female equality and do my best to correct him when I feel he says something out of line or that is just flat out wrong. I can’t do the arguing back and forth anymore. I’m sad and heartbroken for him. To have this view on life and to be so utterly close minded that you equate some women who don’t like men to all women and then somehow warp that into you being the victim of an oppressive society out to get you is beyond mind boggling to me but I feel like I need to understand him more to be able to help him. We’ve suggested he speak with a therapist. We’ve looked up possible psychosis that would be similar. The closest I can say that explains some of his behavior and mannerisms is schizotypal personality disorder. He hits almost all of the key symptoms for it. 

Being 19 though we are left with few options as to him seeing a therapist, or being examined for the above condition, or any medical issues at all really. I guess I’m wondering or looking for advice from other parents who have had experience with this type of behavior and what did you do?

TLDR: Son has low opinion of himself/women or a warped sense of reality and applies the some = all mentality to most opinions. Which is causing him to not experience/fear actually doing things in life. Parents unsure best course of action but are trying to figure out where to go or if anyone else has experience with something similar. ",17Jan2019,1

I have a lot of reasons that I don’t want to get into (I’m not being abused or anything don’t worry).

Basically, every time I think about coming back for the summer and living at home for 3 while months I get really anxious and panicky. Being home for winter break has made me really anxious and depressed, more than usual. I went far from home for college for a reason, and now that I’m back it’s making me feel isolated, depressed, and like I’m regressing back into the person I was before college.

One of many examples: I had 2 female friends that I could talk to about my relationship problems. No other friends really understood me expect for these two. The ex wanted them gone because she thought she was the only girl I should be talking to, and gave me an ultimatum: them, or her. So I “befriended” those 2 female friends, and at the end of the first week after befriending them, my ex asked me if I missed them. I said yes, and she said that I didn’t get rid of them in the way she wanted me to. She wanted to control my thoughts, feelings, &amp; emotions... She manipulated me, lied, compulsively abused me, and so much more. 

So, I feel like I NEED to talk to my ex about those things. I don’t have the desire of hurting her, or making her go through what I went through. No, not at all. I just want her to know the truth about the past because I know she doesn’t realize all of what she did to me. I just want her to understand what she did to me and how it affected me. 

Is there anything wrong with this? Is closure really needed? Is there another way to go about it? 
I recently opened up to my closest friend about the things she did to me about a month ago; he and I have been friends since 2009 and I never told him or anyone about what she did to me until recently. I kept everything secretive for years... Am I confusing my desire to open up to other friends and my family for wanting to open up to my ex? Is there a problem with this? I even was thinking about how some people have sex with their ex and then are able to move on. Is this realistic?

175,"Me, my boyfriend, and my brother decided in July 2018 to rent a house together. All three of us signed our own leases, valid through July 2019. 

My brother has since befriended a woman that has stolen from my boyfriend and I, snooped through our things, and even enters the house whenever she pleases (with her own key that she denies possessing). My brother sees no problem with her comings and goings, and does not believe that she stole from us. (We do not have any hard evidence to prove she did, other than we saw her doing it, and even talked to her while she was doing it. She of course denies all accusations in front of my brother.)

We want to remove ourselves from the situation by moving out, but we're not sure if we can get out of our leases without hard evidence against this woman. But we KNOW she's guilty because we both saw her. We do not feel comfortable living in a house that she frequents this much.

Is there anything we can do?

182,"I had an unexpected medical emergency and ended up in the hospital for a week, had two major surgeries in early December and due to the nature of the surgeries, unable to work for 12 weeks, and then will need PT and more leaving me unable to take clients for 2 months total as I build up my strength again. I own a salon and I had a very large clientele of my own, in addition to my staff who also have their own clients. They all booth rent from me. I have medical insurance however the bills have piled up tremendously. With not working I’ll have no income other than my booth renters and that income will pay for my building rent, utilities, supplies, back bar etc. however leaving me with zero income for myself and unable to pay my mortgage, my own bills, and my medical bills. 

I’ve done everything I have found in the finance subreddit, called my mortgage, cc, utilities etc but they only do so much and for so long,before they want their money, rightfully so. I do not want to file bankruptcy, I have really good credit and have looked into loans, but because I’m a small woman owned business banks basically laugh at me. SBA won’t help due to the fact I’m “off” work for 2-3 months, and the only lenders are merchant lenders who take portions of your CC transactions which would incur ridiculous interest rates and dip into my business funds to ensure the business stays afloat, so those are not a solution either. 
What do I do? I have worked my butt off for years building up my business and have always been so proud to support myself, employ others and give back to our community by using local vendors and being a big part of our community volunteering at local venues, donating raffle prizes to help others, and more. 

I’ve gone through my savings, who would have thought $20k wasn’t enough savings? The medical bills alone and setting aside enough to keep my lights on and a few boxes of Mac and cheese at home to get by, and enough for my co pays for PT and prescriptions and doctor visits, sucked me dry. 

I’m heartbroken. I feel like an absolute failure, and I have no family to help me. Only child, parents in nursing home and no aunts or uncles.  A few friends and clients and staff threw together a donation drive when I was in the hospital and that money is all gone too, as it was amazing but only a couple thousand. I need $15.000 to get me through the next three months while I heal, and rebuild my strength and slowly start working again to full capacity. I am no stranger to hard work and when I am able I will get a part time job waiting tables or bar tending in addition to my full time job to build back up my savings, but in the meantime I wake up crying every-night and am so stressed out I am at my wits end.

Whenever I voice either side of it, I am faced with nothing but criticism and embarrassment. I don't know exactly how I came to these two viewpoints, just that they came from spending too much time on the Internet.

1) I am convinced that evolutionary psychology, and by extension a lot of talking points against egalitarianism, from the far right and the manosphere (incels, MGTOW, etc), is almost certainly correct to a significant degree in describing how the world works.

2) I am convinced that to allow society to be defined by evolutionary determinism or any of the above bigoted, archaic social norms, would be an evil, untenable, and shameful position (held only by toxic male losers on the Internet), and that we need to avert it by any means necessary to achieve an equitable society.

I can't really defend either of these claims, but they are deeply entrenched in me, and I do not trust myself to do any kind of research to determine which side is correct.

I can't simply stop thinking about them because I am a social sciences major.

I can't stop seeing how they might or might not be true when I am consuming media.

I'm somewhat obsessed with transhumanism now because it's the only way I could reconcile the two ideas, but everybody on r/unpopularopinion tells me that is just a dystopian fantasy.

185,"Using a throwaway for obvious reasons and I apologize for graphic detail in advance. 

First off, I was not intentionally disrespecting her privacy or anything like that. I think she was so caught up in her “alone time” that she wasn’t paying attention to anything else. 

I have 3 siblings, all older. One is away at college and the other two graduated college but have moved back home since and are working on saving up to move out. Today, I came home from work a little early and when I was walking to my room, I passed my oldest sibling’s room and heard her pleasuring herself (or at least her moaning). She was being pretty loud and I was caught off guard but I didn’t really care. Everyone masturbates. Went to my room, put down wallet and keys, and went to go back in the living room because I didn’t wanna hear her anymore than I already had. However, I was not expecting her to say my other sibling’s name during this and I know it was his name because he has a very unique name. 

My initial reaction was to almost throw up. I thought they were having sex but I knew he wasn’t home so that couldn’t have been happening. I think I’ve calmed down a little since but I can’t even look her in the eye anymore.  

What worries me more is that, after hearing that, I don’t think it’s too far of a stretch to think they’re sexually involved. They have the closest sibling relationship out of any of us by a long shot. Hell, I really don’t know any siblings as close as them. They always hang out together without my sister and I and up until now, I just figured it was them being the oldest or something. 

I have no clue what to do here. It’s not like they’re young enough for this to be some innocent crush and if they are sexually involved, it’ll absolutely ruin and already broken family. 

Should I go to someone about this? Should I just confront her about it? Or ask my brother first since he could end up being completely innocent here? ",17Jan2019,1

187,"My girlfriend and I dated when I was 17 and she was 15 and it has been a great experience for us since! As far as I know, people were really happy that we got together, and we both feel like we're perfect for each other, so the 2 year age gap didn't really bother anyone, as it really shouldn't.

Anyways, my girlfriend has a family friend (who was recently diagnosed on the autistic spectrum) and they've known each for a long time.

For the sake of the post, I'll call my girlfriend Zoe and the family friend can be called Kevin. When Kevin found out that she was dating someone two years above her, he wasn't really fond about our relationship. I remember having small talk with him once and Zoe had to leave, so I pecked her on the lips goodbye and Kevin expressed his disgust and frustration. When he recalled the event to Zoe's mom, we were basically making out in front of him. He has a thing against PDA so I tried to be better with that around him next time.

Fast forward to today, I'm 19, commuting to a college as a first year student, while she's 17 while she's getting through her junior year of high school. Zoe and Kevin don't talk much anymore, but recently, they shared a good conversation with each other, and our relationship briefly came up as well. He states that us dating is illegal in California  (assuming dating involves having sex) . Since I'm 19, and she's 17, I would be having sex with a minor. Zoe defends our relationship, saying it isn't that important but Kevin took it as an offense to him and told mutual friends that maybe she deserves to be tortured. She's already stressed with how things are going for her, and this definitely is no help at all. The school's taking care of it, he is suspended for a couple days, but she still feels uncomfortable and unsafe.

I'm not sure whether this would be better in r/legaladvice or r/relationshipadvice, so I'm trying my luck here. I'm asking for basically two kinds of advice here.

1. How do I make her more comfortable? As mentioned, she's stressed because she has a hundred things going on for her right now, so I'm seeing her less than I'm used to. I feel like the best I can do is just say ""Yes, go and take care of whatever you need to take care of, and let me know if I can do anything for you."" but I want to be doing more, especially during this time.
2. A question for the law people out there: I don't know much about those kinds of laws here in California. Every article I'm reading says something different, so is he right about me having sex with a minor? My friends have always made jokes about how I would catch a case in court for dating her, but they were always jokes, and a friend mentioned that I should be exempted regardless because how close the age gap is.

189,"This is my first time posting about something like this so forgive me if it’s in the wrong place. Maybe r/legaladvice? I don’t know. Anyway, I had this old friend. We were best friends since kindergarten. We used to know everything about each other until our lives split paths in late high school, but she ended up meeting a guy and getting engaged to him about half a year ago. They have a six month old daughter too. She barely talks to me anymore due to him “not letting her” or just for any personal reason, but I understand. So maybe like five different texting interactions in the past year and a half is how often we’ve kept in touch. My other friends who have been friends with her just as long, talk to her still and tell me how she has openly told them about times where he’s beaten the shit out of her and says such horrible things to her like it’s casual. He accuses her of things she’s not doing, embarrassing her in front of people, and even the baby cries a lot, so I’ve heard. Like my other friends tell me they’re worried about the baby because she cries way more than a normal baby should. So my overall point and question here is, what do I fucking do? I’ve told my other friends countless times “since y’all have witnessed this, why don’t you do anything about it?” And things along the lines of that. They always get quiet which I understand but the thing is, is it’s not MY place to do it. She doesn’t talk to me anymore. I don’t even know her anymore. I still care about her so much.

195,"So this story is a bit of a long one. Everyone's names have been changed for privacy.

Two years ago, I was in grade 11 at a new high school. I made fast friends with a boy named Alex. When I say we we're fast friends, I mean we we're texting until 3 am the first day we met. We told each other a lot that night, and I think we we're both amazed to find someone that had a lot of similar problems and experiences. 
It was a comfort, and for a lonely girl in a strange new place, it was amazing for me.
Needless to say, I feel pretty hard for him. Looking back on it now through, I see it was more because he was very similar to my ex, and Alex was someone who paid me a little attention. 
He introduced me to his friends, and they all assumed we were dating, or at least about to. 
He knew I had a crush on him, but he didn't feel the same way. He had someone else he liked. It stuff my pride alot at the time.
(Some of his friends became good friends of mine, and I am still close to them to this day.)
But we never actually dated. A lot of high school drama happened, and Alex and I drifted apart.
He began dating a girl named Ellenjoy that September. I dated a boy named Jordan. 
We didn't talk for most of senior year, only sometimes when we needed someone to talk to. I was over my crush on him by then, and just thought of him as a passing friend. 
High school has been over for a few months, I broke up with Jordan in July and Alex was dumped by Ellenjoy this past September.

Around Christmas I thought of Alex again, and texted him merry Christmas. He replied and we talked for awhile. Since then we have been hanging out often on our days off from work. It is generally the two of us, unless he tags along when I go to hangout with some other friends. 
Just a few hours ago I got home from Aquaman, Alex and I saw it together.
And I just don't know what I am doing. I can't tell if he has changed his mind, or if he just views it as two friends hanging out. We do flirt sometimes, but it is always taken as more of a joke over being a serious suggestion. 
My close friends say he probably hasn't changed his mind, and I shouldn't be stressing over it.
But I can't shake the feeling that there is an undercurrent to our outings. He never suggests inviting other people, and we never express any discomfort in being alone with each other.

I can't tell if it is me just seeing what I want to see, or me just reading into it too much.
I would just ask him out but, I have missed him being  my friend, I am afraid to break this fragile connection. 
Any advice would be welcome. Sorry for it turning into more of a ramble at the end.

196,"Hey guys, this is my first post here, so please bear with me/correct me on formatting issues. TL;DR at the bottom.

The long and short of the situation is that my grandma constantly shares politically charged stuff on Facebook. On the surface it’s not inherently bad, but a good portion of the things she shares are easily fact-checked through a simple Google search. Many of the things that she shares involve certain religions which I won’t name and only serve to demonize those who practice those religions. My only goal in correcting her would be to hopefully prevent her from being manipulated by obvious political propaganda. I also don’t plan on being a one-man Snopes, constantly fact-checking her posts for any discrepancy. I don’t interact with her too much, and personal politics never come up whenever we do talk. Though she never explicitly stated it, she makes a point to never bring up politics in person with family.

199,"So to start, my wife and I are expecting our first baby in about 4 months, and we're both really excited. We're doing pretty well financially compared to most people I know in my age group (24-25), so the idea of a baby isn't a huge stress in that regard. However, we're in the process of buying a home because our current landlords intend to sell the home that we're renting (another long story). We have a house picked out, a loan about 85-90% done, everything's good, BUT the government shutdown is preventing us from finalizing the loan which is USDA. My realtor and lender has suggested that we switch to FHA and pay 3.5% down on the home which would equate to about $5000-6000. We have the money, but that's a sizable chunk out of our savings and with a baby on the way we'd rather stick with the USDA loan which requires no money down. I'm really struggling with the idea of waiting because our landlords are somewhat rushing us out, and we want to be in our new home before the baby comes and who knows how long the government shutdown will last, but I really want to have as much money as possible for when our baby is born for unforeseen circumstances that tend to arise around having children. Not to mention that both my wife's and my car are close to 20 years old and could die anytime, we probably need a few new furniture items, and we'll be paying a lot more for a mortgage than we were for rent.  I should add that I'm contracted with the seller of the home we're trying to buy till the end of this month but idk if they'll stay with us after that. Does anyone have any advice about what they think I should do? Switch to FHA and just pay the money and hope nothing bad happens where that money could've come in handy, or wait and hope the government opens and our seller sticks around so we can save a ton of cash? This is all really new to me and I just want someone to tell me it's gonna work out and I'm doing the right thing.

203,"Hello! 

So, just to jump right in...I don’t know what it is that I am “good” at. Well, let me rephrase that...I do know what I am “good” at....I know that I am good at drawing portraits of people; I know I am good at analyzing films; I know that I am  a good people person such as being a good listener/empathizer/ and understanding; I know I am good at being a well rounded hard-worker and student...

Long story short, I know I am “good” at a lot of things....but I am feeling like I won’t ever find my ONE thing that I am a MASTER at! Does that make sense? I feel like I want one great thing  that I am SUPER interested in and love but can do very well at and be proud of. 

While I DO understand that I am most proud when I am being creative - mainly in film / illustrations / crafts, etc - I always seem to get my hopes up too high, or my confidence is shot down by someone who I believe (or perceive) to be better than me at [insert skill]. 
Don’t get me wrong, I am happy that the person is doing great!! It’s this icky jealous feeling in my stomach that makes me instantly want to stop what I am doing because I know that I most likely won’t ever get to [said persons] skill level.

My other personality traits don’t help this feeling either. I’m always at war with myself because I expect myself to be a leader - or have leading qualities such as being persistent, not giving up, and just being optimistic in general.  But to go along with this is my quality of wanting instant gratification with my work...I’m very patient with others, just not myself.

But most of all, I think I just want to show and/or prove to others (and MYSELF) that I am capable of having a “cool trait” or that my work can because as beautiful as others....I don’t even know if any of this makes any sense...hopefully it does. 

I’ve tried searching for hobbies - widening my scopes - and I just don’t know about, or have any interest in, a lot of things it seems. Has anyone else had/have this problem? How did you go about it?

I have yet to find a news channel or publisher that is not biased in one way or the other. I have had detailed viewings of Fox, MSNBC, and CNN. Unfortunately, news is split between two sides today: The left and the right. I am Republican, but have a neutral opinion on Trump. I like some of the policies he has come up with, but don’t support some of his decisions and behavior. If the mueller investigation proves he is guilty of high crimes then I’m all for justice or impeachment, but until then, I’m not going to accuse him of anything. The problem is, as I mentioned earlier, I cannot find a reliable source of news that is non biased. 
CNN and MSNBC are constantly attacking Trump, and while some of it is deserved, some of it is unnecessary. Most of them pick apart every little thing he does, showing hypocrisy by excluding the fact that other politicians have done the same, or even worse. Then they ignore the good he does, such as his enactment of reforms creating substantial economic growth. 
This leaves me with Fox News. I watch this more commonly as it actually let’s me know what good is happening around the world, and what good Trump is doing for it and our country. They aren’t constantly picking apart Trump, so as I said, I can see what he has actually done for us. I don’t care if he makes dumb tweets, I don’t freaking care if he orders McDonald’s and Burger King for Clemson. That is not important. I care about what he is doing as the president of the United States. But as I mentioned earlier, (damn I keep saying this 😅) Fox never says anything bad about the president. 
So the problem is, there is one side who only talks about the bad side of Trump. The other side only talks about the good. I make my judgements off of real facts and percentages. I DO NOT CARE if Trump is interpreted as a bigot, racist, sexist, whatever because of one thing he said that was completely unrelated. I want to know what he is doing, and what he is doing that we can do without.

205,"I need help. I just feel like there's something off about me, like bipolar or something of the like. Some days I feel normal and happy and some days I feel like the most emotional man on the planet, and sometimes I feel nothing. Like my mom could be getting stabbed right in front of me and I would have no emotional response, or my gf could say one thing and my entire mood changes and I can't even continue the conversation normally. I find myself trying to cry just to let some emotion out, but it's incredibly hard. I feel alone, but I have always kind of preferred being alone. I've always been quiet, an introvert. My parents divorced a couple years ago, my dad already remarried, I was a senior in HS I think, now a junior in college. I think this fucked me up more than I've ever let on to anyone, tons of kids have their parents get divorced, it's fine. This event really led into me having my first run in with depression. I don't even know who I am because I show a different me to everyone. I feel like I am destryoing my relationships. I regularly think about suicide and methods of it and what would happen if I did it. I know I need to make a change and do something about this so I can stop feeling like a piece of shit every single day. 

Should I see a therapist? Or psychologist? Or both? Should I go to my doctor first and see if he has any recommendations? I've been on anxiety and depression medication before, Lexapro and buspirone, ADHD medication currently, Adderall IR. I'm leaning toward going to my doctor and explaining how I'm feeling...

TLDR at bottom

I became friends with this guy at my college (call him Jim for reference), him, some of his fraternity brothers and me and my two roommates really hit it off at the beginning of the semester, like hanging out multiple times a week all together, going out together, etc. 

Since before break (about a month and a half ago) Jim has done a complete 180. He used to be charming, playful, and fun to be around has now turned into a complete douche with a massive superiority complex. Jim has made several passive aggressive finsta posts and subtweets about one of my roommates, and made a lot of jokes about my other roommate about stuff she has made clear she doesn’t like to talk about. 

He hasn’t said anything directly rude to me but I’ve been witnessing all of this happen and any time I call him out on it he gets all defensive saying we are being too sensitive. I feel guilty for wanting to cut him out and don’t want this to affect my friendships with other guys in his fraternity, because I know he could easily say some really petty stuff and they would most likely believe him over anything I could say to them. 

This all just blew up in our faces today over a group chat so now i can’t sleep. I know I should cut him out in supporting my best friends but I can’t help but want to just disappear and not deal with the conflict and just avoid everyone. Help me reddit!!!!

TLDR: a friend has suddenly turned into a huge toxic a-hole, don’t know what to do without feeling guilty no matter if i cut him out of my life or attempt to stay friends with him. ",17Jan2019,1
207,"So Im 17 and Im a junior and I have a lot of sensory issues/anxiety/depression. The depression was actually diagnosed by a doctor. The hallways at my school are crowded that I can't really deal with them so last year I was put into this program with like 15 other kids who can't deal with the crowded hallways. Basically we go to a separate building a couple blocks away from the school and do half of school there. Even only spending half the day in school is still a lot for me. I was diagnosed with depression a little over a year ago and when it first hit my grades took a toll. I haven't gotten anything above a C since I started becoming depressed. I know Im not dumb because I have a lot of curiosity about the world and the way things work but every time I look at my grades I can just feel it in my stomach. I almost dropped out of high school last year. I technically dropped out for a day but went back for a reason I dont remember. 

Last year I used to run away in the middle of the night and sleep in the forest because I didnt want my mom to wake me up and make me go to school. I know its a cliche thing to ask ""when am I ever gonna need this?"" But thats one of the things that makes me hate it more. Im there for so long for nothing. Im not going to college. I dont want to have kids and I just wanna live in a small apartment.

Im a band kid and our drumline has this winter program (WGI) and it takes up a lot of time and if I took my GED now and left Id screw over  a lot of people. So if I do it, it would have to be in April so I have time to think about it (though, Ive been thinking about it for a year now). Band takes up a lot of my time and I also have a job. And if you add up band, school, and my job Im ""working"" 68-70 hours a week. And its been pretty overwhelming. But I would be fine with it if I didnt hate school. I honestly love my job Ive met some great people.

Im sort of rambling but I just want whoever reads this to better understand me. I make about $1000 a month right now and if I worked 40 hours a week it would be double that. What I wanna do right now is get my GED in April, work more hours and then as soon as I turn 18 Im gonna move in with my sister and she will charge me $400 a month for rent. And while I live with her Ill learn how to cook and do laundry, learn how to pay bills and other essential stuff. Then after a while move out and get a 2 bedroom 1 bathroom apartment for myself. 

Idk is this a good plan? My grades are just getting so bad now and I just hate being in school. Not only do I love being at my job, but the woman I work with almost every night is the assistant manager and says shes been managing restaurants since she was 18 and Im one of the best minors shes ever worked with. I just really love working. I love working way more than school and Id rather just work

208,"I could write a novel, but I will keep it short for everyone's sanity. 

I'm 25. Psychology degree. Never went to grad school because I couldn't afford it and realized therapy wasn't my thing. (Been stuck with minimum wage jobs/jobs I hated). I just feel like im wasting my life away and not progressing and learning who I am living at home. 

Anyway. I'm miserable at home. I'm the middle child and the only one still living at home. Both of my sisters have boyfriends/husbands, renting their own homes, one has a child. They are fairly put together. What normal people are supposed to do. 

Then there is me. I'm just.. stuck at home it seems since I cannot find decent paying jobs after getting a psych degree. I feel pretty crappy about it a lot and just feel like I NEED to escape from my parents and just be me for once. Have a chance to breathe and live life as I want to. I have some money saved up.

I cannot decide if I want to move to Colorado or just out of my paren'ts house. My friend moved to Denver and RAVES over it and says I absolutely have to move there since it offers SO much more than our tiny, conservative, bible-belt town. (no offense to anyone, it's just not...me lol). I WANT to move out there and be on my own, but I'm scared I will not make enough since it's a struggle getting jobs here also. So my backup plan is to just find a small place in my current town so I'm at least out on my own and work my way from there. The job market here is really awful. So I know I wouldn't have a nice job that I enjoy, or that pays well at all. I used to provide therapy to children with Autism and was paid 12 dollars an hour for the MOST stressful job I've ever had. 


But anyway... Do you guys think I should just move out, and stay in a town that doesn't really fit with my personalty/ideals etc just to get away from my parents.. Or take a HUGE leap and move to a town that will more than likely provide more of a vibe that I enjoy.. But it would be my first time being on my own. And I'm terrified of not making it, breaking a lease, and owing on it even when I'm forced to move back home. 


And one thing I will miss if i moved would be the land/ amount of space here since it's countryish. If I got a place here, I could prob find somewhere that I could have my own yard, have bonfires on weekends and just listen to music and drink or something. Just relax out under the stars. That wouldn't be a real option in Denver because of apartment living/fire regulations. 


I'm extremely torn because my entire savings will be going towards one of the two.. 


tldr; Grew up in bible belt south. I'm bi. Doesn't fit me at all. Want to move out of my parents house at 25. Move to Denver for nice vibe, or just out into town to get away from parents and be on my own finally? ",17Jan2019,1
210,"So I (24M) have a big crush on my friend (26F) who I met like 2-3 months ago. She has everything that I actually like. We like the same stuff, like to do the same stuff etc. I don't THINK she actually likes me back, but that's kinda the problem. I can't really read her that good. And when I don't really know the answer I don't really have a peace of mind. 

In the beginning I've tried to suppress the feeling, but it's not that easy. I've tried to not message her, but then she starts messaging me. We actually now have a weekly meetup irl to watch some series together, as friends I guess, because she does that with other people too sometimes. So as I see it now I have a few options:

1. I can just ignore her and 'breakup' the friendship so that I get some peace of mind and don't lose face by expressing my feelings.
2. I could drop some subtle hints, but there are a few problems with that. I'm not good at doing them, and she's kinda oblivious for those things. We're both a bit ""socially awkward"", so she or me might not understand the subtle nudges. 
3. I could express my feelings towards her, so that I know for certain and get some peace of mind. But then I risk losing a friend.

I also overthink stuff, so that's also a downside. I really would like to know what I should/could do. Because I can't really stay in this situation, as my brain is constantly rushing between thoughts.

211,"The past few years have been a bit tough, this post is long so I’ll spare you as much as possible. I (23 M) lost my job a few months ago which has left me with no savings and no health insurance (didn’t cover any sort of mental health visits anyway). I’ve had a few interviews but nothing has pulled through. I’ve already lowered my standards to the point of applying for jobs that I know wouldn’t offer the healthcare I need (fast food etc) but still nothing. I have one person in my life who is able to help me and I feel I have overburdened her enough as it is. Asking her for a loan to see a psychiatrist (or whatever I need) is completely out of the question. All of my older family members are deceased or gone. When I tried signing up for my local federally assisted medical program, the website was down from the time I found out about it until the deadline to apply this year. I’ll keep this bit as short as possible but I’ll provide a little bit of backstory on myself, I know I’m depressed and perpetually anxious. I know my mom, her mom, her mom’s mom etc all have BPD, manic depression, schizophrenia (I know they’ve spent time in mental hospitals but the diagnosis are all from second hand sources). My great grandmother spent her final years in a state hospital. I fear that I may have one of the above conditions as well but I’m not a doctor. I saw my mother’s struggle with it first hand. I can’t even talk to her about it as she just up and left for Colorado once they legalized recreational marijuana. Last I heard, she called me from a mental hospital. I called back a few days later and they said she wasn’t there anymore. My worst fear is that I don’t see the symptoms in myself, causing what little I have in my life to vanish. I’m currently doing independent contractor work and what little income I have, doesn’t even fully cover my bills (and I’ve got taxes coming up soon that I have no idea how I’m going to pay). If it helps, I know a little bit of Danish and have a friend there that has offered to help if possible (I don’t even have a passport as of now). I’ve tossed around the idea of selling off everything that won’t fit in a carry-on bag and just trying my luck on the streets of a safer place. It just feels like I have no chance of living a normal life here (the USA, specifically Kentucky) or even an impoverished one at that. I fear that the climate around people with mental illness and no money is about to get much worse.

My friends want me to get into a trade such as being an Electrician and I kind of like the idea because I found that doing physical labor jobs as opposed to lab / office job was much more beneficial to my mental health. 

  
However, I'm not sure what to do right now. I always saw myself in grad school and in academia but now I'm looking at about 5 years apprenticeship that starts from early morning to late night for classes. It's quite a load of work. The pay in my state for union electrical workers is $45 an hour. Which is not bad at all honestly considering most work pull in overtime pay. But the thought of being locked out of academia for 5 years as I need to commit to becoming an electrician is terrifying me. I love school.

My schedule would look like 7 am - 4 pm for work and apparently some night classes for electrical work. I was hoping I could work on another degree while being an electrician apprentice. But it's sounding like that's not going to be possible. What do I do? I need a sustainable income and a solid career. 

Trying to get into school and being in grad school means I won't have a real income for a while... but if I go into electrical work I'll be locked into the career for a minimum of 5 years (that is the minimum for my state to get a journeyman license). How do I make this decision??",17Jan2019,1

217,"Hi r/Advice,

So this has been going on for.. the past seven months I’ve been employed as a contractor at this job. Some background: I do Quality Assurance testing through automation. 

Essentially, my boss is upset that my coworker and I haven’t been ”updating” our tests to match the latest changes deployed. None of our tests work, and they are planning for the upstairs team to execute these tests. The problem is that because none of it works, my coworker and I are in for some trouble. 

Here’s more of the issue, though. My boss seems reasonable at least towards me. He was very upset when chatting with my coworker on the phone (she’s been there much longer than I). I’ve told her several times that tests weren’t passing in the past and I didn’t know how to fix them. I didn’t know anything about the structure of the tool we used. She would constantly tell me we can’t say they’re not passing at all or we would be in trouble [for status updates]. We had to fix these ourselves. 

Three weeks ago our boss told us to learn and move to the company’s new automation tool. Cool, tests will actually work since they’re from scratch and run much faster. Why didn’t we remake the tests before? Because we don’t have time as she does one application and I do the other. It would take way longer to make 20 new tests and have them be approved before we run our big group of tests.

Anyways, my boss is clearly aware on the tool transition and I asked him last week about some concerns with him asking to see our tests from the old framework. He asked why and I told him that they don’t work as of the latest changes. He was clearly disappointed. I mentioned that “this is kind of why we need to move to the new test framework” and he disagreed saying we had to use the old one.

Today he asked if I had the test plan for our tests. It’s basically a list of what the tests do. I didn’t have it. I was never given one. I was replacing someone’s old role and all I got was the necessary files to run whatever had been left over. I had asked several times about it before and got no response. 

However, I fucked up when I sent my automation status for the latest round of testing. My boss told me to run a few tests manually and then send the status of it passed or failed. So.. I said I ran 100 tests, but there’s only 80. None of them work. Except four that I fixed for an automation tool I made for myself since the old framework was horrible. As a result, they were questioning it. All I remember was how I had been fixing the tests in the old framework two months ago (for a change that broke the tests) and it came out to 80 tests and I then had them numbered properly. Why did I choose 100 for the status value? Genuinely no idea. I wasn’t trying to purposely mislead anyone using that number. 

Any conversations I do have with coworkers are logged via Outlook from Skype. However, I don’t think any of them may be of too much use in the event I need to prove something.

tl;dr my boss is disappointed I “wasn’t doing my job” and my job may also be at risk due to several things happening. I don’t know what’s going to happen, but I can only hope. There’s not much I know of what to do about it either. It’s all over the place.

What should I do about .. any of this? I feel like I can’t do anything but watch everything fall apart. I don’t want to lose my job and I fear that trying to explain any of this to my boss(es) wouldn’t do anything either.

218,"Hey guys...

I've been debating making this post for about a week now and finally decided to make it... so here goes.

I'm a late 20 something and right now do not have a stable career, my own place or a significant other. All things I thought I'd have by now. I do not get along great with my family and to be honest, I am struggling a bit with depression. On the bright side I have a college degree (liberal arts related... not a super specific awesome degree like say engineering or nursing). I also am in great physical shape (so if someone saw me they'd definitely think I have my shit together, lol) and I get a long with most people I meet and have an ability to make people laugh. I gain peoples trust easily. I have a baby face... people always think I'm younger then I am, same thing with my voice.

That said... from a career standpoint, I'm completely lost. I don't really have a clue what to do. I'm good with writing and research and I'm a great listener. Not the best with science and math.

Another bright side is I don't have any debt. I'm basically a recent graduate with no debt/ work history. I feel miserable/ like a failure and good use some kind advice from my big brothers and sisters (aka you reddit reader/ poster reading this post :)).

What would you do if you were me? I want to change everything in my life and I'm just not happy with anything. I see all my friends kicking ass in life, getting married, promotions... kids even... and I'm just stuck and while I'm so happy for them, I want things in my life to improve so I don't have to feel embarrassed when they ask how are you doing and I laugh and say lets talk about you.

Thanks... be gentle but honest.

He complimented my appearance, said aggressive things about my boyfriend and to him when he picked me up. The last straw for me was when he touched my butt and pulled my shirt in attempts to look at my boobs. I told my supervisor, she was supportive and just let me switch students with my colleague. Unfortunately, same thing is happening with my new student for the new term. He told me that I was attractive, later complimenting me on my voice when I lectured. He made it very obvious that he’s looking into finding a girlfriend this term as well. He kept checking me out the entire lesson which made me feel super uncomfortable. After work, he texted me and asked if I had a bf. I said I did. I don’t want the same repeat as last term so I told my supervisor right away. She’s upset with me now. She told me that he’s just being friendly and that its not a big deal. Telling me to just set boundaries. I’m afraid that I’m coming off as the boy who cried wolf. She doesn’t want to switch around students because it was a lot of work the first time. She had to go through the parents/guardians, the dean, the professor of the students etc. But I am really uncomfortable with the student because he seems even more aggressive than the first.

229," I have decided that I really need to move far away and start life fresh. I'm 18, so I feel like its better to do this earlier in life than later. I was planning on taking a bus, or a train somewhere, and starting a new life for myself. I want to do this because I know that if I just stay here with my family I will probably never get out of the house or have any incentive to do anything with my life as I know that my family wont kick me out and since I'm already a deadbeat drug addict, who doesn't want to do anything with his life, I'll probably just take advantage of that and keep leeching off them. The closest I've ever come to actually doing anything to make a life for myself was trying to join the marines in high school. I like physical exercise, so that wasn't the problem(in fact, it was kinda why I went for it in the first place), but I didn't think I could stop doing drugs which is requirement for the military I'm probably guessing.

So realizing this, I though I would force myself to do something with my life by just leaving, instead of just letting the years pass by and realizing someday when I'm 40 something that I'm still living with my family and doing nothing in life. I know it's not going to be easy and I probably wont be ready for it, but I just have to try something at this point. I lashed out at my family today for example, and after that I admitted to them that I just leech off them and probably always am. I had to be taken to the hospital for going off(I didn't hit anyone I just threw stuff around the house) for a few hours. They let me out luckily without me having to stay overnight. This isn't the first time this has happened, and I'm sad to admit, it probably wont be the last.

Any advice on how to go about doing stuff like getting a job, finding temporary places to live/being homeless, getting cheap/free food would be appreciated.

Plan on leaving with about $300, so I'll be pretty broke.I could find a job at a fast-food place or something and I was thinking I could rent a cheap motel at first, and then seeing if I could find a roommate/less temporary place to live. That's about all I have planned. I don't plan on telling my family I'm leaving, but they know how to contact me, and they cant report me for running away because I'm 18.

230,I’m a sophomore in high school and have been thinking about it for a long time. So throughout my childhood I definitely had some traumatic events that I ignored for a long time because I just didn’t want to remember it but two years ago I had a huge breakdown which then sent me to therapy and then a behavioral hospital when they found out I had suicidal intentions. I was diagnosed with chronic depression and anxiety and for two whole years now I have basically been in a depressed/stressed state and it’s super frustrating. School causes me so much more stress and I’m seriously scared I’ll do something stupid that’ll cause my family pain. I want to drop out because I truly do believe it could help me a ton. I already know what to do to get a GED and I’m confident enough to pass all the tests. I really have no doubts but I don’t know how to even start talking to my mother about it without her thinking I’m exaggerating or just lazy about school. I need some advice. Not any advice on why I should stay in school because I’ve heard it a million times. ,17Jan2019,1
231,"Long story short at work today (I’m an elementary school tutor), I was working with a girl on a math test. After 30 minutes she finished the tests and I notice a quarter of her answers are written in reverse (17+1= 81 for example) and she gets a lot wrong on the test. So after the test concludes I go to my boss with the corrections and I softly say, “it seems like she may have dyslexia (which I meant dysgraphia because it’s math)” instantly my boss and another worker who hears go simultaneously “ WHOA WHOA WHOA NOOOO DIAGNOSING. Yea not in here. Whooooaaaaa. Not the lingo here” for like 30 seconds and I apologize multiple times. I was very embarrassed over this event but after ten minutes, I forget about it. Well, 30 minutes later that same dumbass coworker who overheard individually comes up to me in front of all my workers and goes, “Fritochipteeth, that was seriously inappropriate and very off color of you to say. I mean seriously she was right next to you? Never say that ever again, it was very rude, i mean were you even thinking?!?..” and he continues lecturing me for another minute. I apologize multiple times again and then finally defend myself and say ,” Hey I had no bad intent with the comment. It was just an opinion.” And he still continues to berate me loudly in front of 5 other employees who had no idea what the hell happened, and now I had to explain this bullshit to them. I’m so humiliated and I’m so angry and embarrassed and I never want to show my face in work again. I can’t believe these people took my observation as something so malicious and made a fool out of me in front of everyone. I am a Psych Major, and this ESPECIALLY hurts me. I would never ever want to embarrass a child or make them feel inferior, I simply thought that in this tutoring location, a location of learning, that I could discuss a possible disability. The fact that now everyone thinks I’m incredibly unfiltered and an insensitive idiot is so humiliating. How do I resolve from this? Happened 5 hours ago and I’m still fuming just as strongly as the minute it happened. Thanks.",17Jan2019,1
234,"Okay, so I know compared to a lot of post on this subreddit this is something that isn't that serious of that big of a deal. However, I suck at confrontation so here goes the story

I am part of an online community that shall remain unnamed but there is a digital artist that is part of this community as well. He has done digital art for several ""large/well known"" people in this community and I've always been a really big fan. As a christmas gift to myself I decided to commision him.  

So I messaged him through twitter and told him that I was a fan and wanted to commission him. He said comms were open and that he was free all week. He also told me that he would message me the next day to discuss what I wanted but that I could go ahead and pay (I've commissioned people before so paying ahead of time isn't anything new)

Well, the next day comes and he doesn't message me back. This was around the first of december, just to give a time line. So I wait a couple of days then message him asking if he forgot, trying to be friendly. He said no that he just had finals and got busy (which I understand because I'm a uni student) 

So I say okay, good luck with finals. He doesn't message me back for another week. The holidays come and so I'm not thinking about but on the 30th of December I did a claim with paypal because I was getting worried. He messaged me and was sort of sassy saying he thought it would be obvious that people are busy during the holidays but he got a bit nicer. He asked me to cancel the claim because it wasn't his paypal (which is weird).  I told him I really just wanted my money back because I felt like he hadn't been professional at all. Maybe he would have cared more if I was bigger in this community. 

I'm going to try to get Paypal to refund him but I guess my question is should I message him again or should I just try to get the money back without saying anything?

I hate confrontation and he is large in the community that I love so I'm kind of worried about that too. I have no desire to share with others the experience that I had with him. I just want the money and for him not to talk bad about me. ",17Jan2019,1

Our landlady is nice/fair enough but she's just 1 person with a handyman husband... not like a real estate company so idk what I really expect her to do about this.
Anyway, so this pare November I saw a mouse come out from under my fridge and back under. Early December it happened again. The first time I bought some traps from Home Depot and set them up around the fridge. So far, no luck with them. Neither time did I mention it to our landlady (idrk why... Maybe I thought it would do away).
 So fast forward to this week and I have been hearing noises in my room at night while I'm trying to sleep. Past 2 nights I was able to convince myself it was just stuff getting blown around by the heating, but tonight I couldn't. I sat up with the lights on for a bit and I saw a mouse run across the back of my closet. I heard it run around the outside of my room and saw it again as it went under the door.
Finally I decided to tell my landlady. I set up an automatic text message to her for 9:30 tomorrow morning as well as one to my roommate. I turned off the lights again, satisfied for now that it was gone and went back to sleep. I slept for maybe 2 hours before waking up again and hearing something under my bed. After lying awake for a bit I'm now confident it's back in the closet.
So I guess my question is 'What should I do now?'. I'm not going to be able to fall back asleep anytime soon but it's currently 2:50am and I have class at 8:30 tomorrow. Should I lay awake for 5 more hours? Should I try to find somewhere on campus to sleep? Should I go to a 24 hour Home Depot and get more traps? 
Since starting to type this I haven't heard anything but I know it's still in here and I'm almost positive it will start moving around again if I turn the lights off. Anything is appreciated.",17Jan2019,1

246,"tl;dr at bottom.

First off, wall of text incoming. So my girlfriend of almost 4 years cheated on me. It's been about a month since it happened. I found out by seeing her drive past me with a guy in her car 4 hours before she was supposed to be home from ""work"" (she had lived with me for about a month at the time). Obviously I freaked the fuck out and we broke it off. She voiced remorse over text and she kept saying she was sorry. This isn't the first time we have broken up though. On two other occasions she broke up with me and within a week fucked one of my friends. This happend both fucking times. My dumb ass took her back both times too. You can call me stupid and ignorant for trusting someone like that, and I'd agree with you. To cut to the chase I don't understand why I'm so stuck on this girl. I mean she was my first love. And being committed to something so young probably has a role in it. But I can't stay away from her. She draws me in and keeps sapping my sanity. Admittedly I would probably cave and take her back again... I can go into more detail if anyone wants to hear it. There's far more shit she's done to me. I need help getting over her and finding something more worth my time. 

tl;dr: My girlfriend of almost 4 years cheated on me. She's done lots of fucked up shit to me before. I feel like I can't get over her but need to for my sanity.

248,"Alright, so I know the title might sound pretty pathetic but hear me out. 

I found out my new classes for this year and I am most likely alone in a few of them.

I am afraid people will talk about me behind my back for being a loner, especially people who hate me. The people at my school are rude and disrespectful and say anything no matter how hurtful. I am pretty sensitive so even if I just get embarrassed a little bit in front of the class I want to cry so being alone will just make this 10 times worse. 

Everyone tells me to ‘just make friends’ and yes that’s a good idea except one again a lot of bullies at my school and just generally people who don’t just ‘be friends’ if that makes sense. I also don’t want to be rejected or something if I ask if they will be my friend.

The teachers always want you to have partners or be in groups for presentations, etc and I struggle with doing that even with my friends so that just makes it 10x worse that I’ll either be alone or with people who dislike me. 

Having to answer questions in front of the class: so embarrassing and I don’t want to be made fun of for getting it wrong because people do that. 

Teachers don’t care about anyone having not many friends or being alone, they just say suck it up. I should, and I’m trying. I know I need to be more sociable, it’s especially hard with the people at my school. 

Yeah I’m a sook, you don’t need to tell me I just need advice. I’m sure I’ll get over this phase soon, as my parents call it.

So: how do I become more sociable?
how do I deal with the bullies? 
what do I do when no one wants to be my partner for presentations?

He seems happy fine and loving life.

I’m at the stage where I want to tell her. It doesn’t feel right him being able to be all fine and great but I don’t want to hurt her.

251,"Hi,

As  per the title, I'm looking for some advice on my living situation, as  to whether or not to remain flatting with randoms from the Internet, or  to bite the bullet and start renting my own place.

I'm  a gainfully employed 30 year old making 125k a year before taxes. I own 60% of an investment property in a different city, with a family member owning  the remaining 40%. That mortgage is entirely paid off, and the property  is currently valued at 550k (this was largely made possible via an  inheritance my family came into). My brother presently lives in that  place and pays a rent for it, so I am not planning on selling it (and likely won't for a few years).

I've been living in the same two bedroom apartment for a while, which goes for 520/w. I have the larger bedroom so, when I have a flatmate, I pay 275/w in rent. The property is right next to a train line, though the rent is cheap for the area. When considering rent and utilities (including internet), that takes up just under 20% of my take home.

Were  I to move out, and live in something relatively nice, I would be  looking at paying 430/w in rent, with my cost of living going up to just  under 30% of my take home. Were I to also make changes in my lifestyle (not buying lunches, cooking dinners instead of buying pre-prepared, etc) and pass those savings on, my cost of living while renting alone  would come down to just under 25% of my take home.

At 30, living with strangers from flatmates websites is getting old fast,  but I can't deny the cost-savings that this allows. From your  perspective, wise and powerful redditors, is it time to get my own  place, or should I suck it up for a few more years and save enough to buy a new place (in my area, I would require upwards of 140k for a down-payment).",17Jan2019,1
252,"I think the title might be confusing or sound stupid but I didn’t really know how else to do describe this situation. 

I’ve been driving since I was 16, I’m 19 now. Let me preface by saying, I never wanted to drive. I never wanted anything to do with cars but I had to buck up and learn to drive because mom and dad weren’t going to drive me around the rest of my life. When I first started driving I had really bad anxiety, I think that’s pretty normal for any new driver, I eventually got over it and got more comfortable but I still never wanted to do it. However, I had to do it every, single, day. Never got a break. I had to something I hated every single day. 

Now fast forward a bit, I moved to a huge city a year ago. I grew up on a really small island, only two lanes throughout the entire island. I mean, those roads gave me anxiety but I thought I could handle city driving. At first, it freaked me out, I absolutely hated it. My boyfriend who grew up on the island also hated it and thought people were bat shit crazy but, we eventually got use to it. Things like highways became less scary but still having to put up with that bullshit made me so stressed. Especially since I have to drive every single day. I see so much, car accidents, road raging, getting road raged at, etc. It started effecting my sleep, I dreaded waking up and going to work. I started having weird thoughts like, “that car wants to hit me and kill me for no reason because he feels like it,” “that person has a gun and even though they almost just hit me, I can’t honk bc they will shoot me.” 

Last march, I got hit by a driver running a red light. Thankfully, I was ok and so was my car. A few days ago, my car was hit by a driver who ran a stop sign, don’t know if the car will make it through this time. The weird thoughts got worse at that. I think people are intentionally trying to kill me for the hell of it. I study all the road rules, I’m scared of raising insurance rates so I pretty much follow ALL the rules of the road. Stop on red when making a right turn, always drive speed limit, use my blinker, always leave a safe distance between cars, etc. I have studied so much on driving laws and I apply them to my driving everyday but yet, I still have suffered the consequences of driving(getting in two not-at-fault car accidents in less than a year) 

After the most recent accident, I have come to the realization. I’m only 19, I have to drive the rest of my life. Yeah, public transit is an option but at the same time my anxiety makes that an option that isn’t feasible. I need to have alone time before I go to work and have an almost ritual of at least 15 mins of alone time in the parking lot before I go in to prepare me for the day, I also don’t like to be at the will of others, like the bus running late, making me late to work. I like to hold myself accountable for those things and be in control of it. 

I can’t do this the rest of my life. I can’t have any more car accidents, I don’t want to deal with insurance, and paying for shit for cars like oil changes, tire rotations, break pads, tires popping, etc. I don’t want to deal with other drivers. I just don’t like driving, I never have, and I never will. I have tried relentlessly, make excuses for other drivers, make excuses for myself, tell myself, “everyone drives and its not a big deal for them” but its a big deal for me and I don’t know why. I dream of the days when I didn’t know how to drive and I could enjoy riding in the car with someone but now whenever I do, I can’t keep my eyes of the road, checking the mirrors, looking for cops, etc because since I’m not ignorant of the roads anymore, I notice things and fear that something might happen. 

I’m also coming to the realization that I’m going to have to work the rest of my life. Something, I don’t want to do. I am condemned to my paycheck but I have to fucking do it because life says so. It’s survival and life isn’t fair. Saying something like, “choose a job you love” isn’t going to work because the moment I’m forced to do something, I end up hating it. That’s always how I’ve been even since elementary school. 

So yeah, I don’t know what to do. It feels like the rest of my life is going to be me, doing things I hate, because I have to survive but lately, I don’t want to survive and maybe this last car accident pulled out this thought that I’ve been pushing away.  ",17Jan2019,1

Surprisingly she had an eye for me too and we as kids told our friends to tell each other that we like one another. In about a few weeks we eventually exchanged numbers and began talking. We had such a chemistry that it still brings back memories and gives me smiles, we eventually became bf/gf within a month. The only problem our relationship had was that it was a long distance relationship. We only saw each other on Sundays and every other Thursday. We hid our relationship from our parents till around the one year mark. My dad would then let me go to her house and we would laugh, play video games, and watch movies. I remember the shyness and nervousness we both had trying to kiss one another. Just writing this gives me butterflies because I miss her so much. Fast-forward a few months and I began talking to this girl at my local middle school and we hit it off. I took the decision to break up with D because we never really saw each other and I wanted something more constant, somebody I could see everyday. This broke D's heart completely because she would keep messaging me almost daily for the next say 3-6 months. I eventually did not last more than 2 weeks with my new girlfriend and I then got another girlfriend. At the same time D would message me about her problems and I would reply simply and rude. This did not stop her and she kept her routine of telling me everything. I eventually did not last very long with my new gf and I was in a pit of loneliness. I was experiencing the same thing D had experienced. I messaged D to get back together and she said that would but she couldn't because she could not stand another heartbreak of such magnitude. I tried and tried but nothing. She then deactivated her account and unfollowed me from IG and I now only have her on SC. In high school I got another girlfriend which I am currently still in a relationship with. I am now attending my first year at college at UCLA and D now has a boyfriend and works at a Starbucks near her house. We also view each others snapchat stories which kills me internally because she knows that I still exist but does not know the way I feel. Since freshman year of high school I think about D approximately 2-3 times a month. The great chemistry we had, the moments we shared, the kisses we had. I know I have a gf now and I should not be thinking of childhood memories but I just cannot remove her from my consciousness. I think of her more now since I now live in a dorm and have a room for myself which I can ponder and think without the disruption of family. What angers me the most is that I am well-off now, I am attending a prestigious university, have a bright future ahead of me, and I just cannot take her out of my head! Like I feel that if we were to get back together right now, we would have the world at our fingertips because I would fight like I have never fought before for our relationship. I just miss her so much and wish that we can be together again in the mere future. I don't know if to ever tell her how I feel and hope I don't get completely humiliated or to just throw in the towel which is very heavy...",17Jan2019,1
263,"I don't know how to budget. I'm planning on moving to a new city to start college. I know it's more expensive to move than to stay and attend college while living at home, but I have personal reasons for moving as well. I don't even know where to start with moving. Like what do I do first? There are so many things to consider: apartments, getting a job, utilities, food, and a million other things. Its overwhelming. And there's always something that you forget, you know? ",17Jan2019,1
264,"How would I go about asking my roommate’s friend to stop sitting on my bed because he keeps making a mess of it and makes it dirty. I sleep in the damn thing ffs, I just want somewhere clean where I can rest comfortably without smelling stinky socks. 

Contextual details:  
* The friend (let’s call him Bob) always just comfortably lays on my bed whenever and however he pleases, rubbing his stinky sock-linty feet all over my sheets and blanket, consequently making them smell in certain areas  
* The top layer of blanket (the exposed layer on which Bob is laying) is polyester, so washing it is inconvenient  
* Often times I find food crumbs and lint and whatnot scattered on my blankets  
* I have two pillows but only sleep on one at a time, so I set the other one against the wall when not in use and apparently that’s an invitation to please come sit on this bed set up perfectly for your sweaty shirt and greasy head to soak on  
* I previously made my bed every morning but apparently that was also an invitation to sit, so I’ve since stopped in an attempt to deter their efforts but alas, they will half-assedly ‘make my bed’ in order to sit on it  
* We have the option of making our beds lofted, but at an extra cost of ~100$; my roommate has a lofted bed so no one sits on his bed
* Bob sits on my bed because sometimes when theres more people over they run out of floor space and I’m at my desk  
* This might be my nitpicky germaphobe side, but since he’s always lounging on my bed for uncomfortably extended periods of time, I have a feeling that my bed has been farted on multiple times and that is not a relaxing thought to have when trying to sleep  
* Bob is constantly hanging out in and sleeping over in our room (essentially every day) despite having his own assigned room, roommates, and bed (he sleeps on an air mattress that my roommate *so conveniently happens to have*  
* Doing laundry costs $1.25 per load, twice, for washing and drying, and I don’t want to have to be spending that money to wash my bedsheets and blankets every two weeks in addition to my everyday clothes

Now I have been thinking about this for a very long time now, since last semester, and I’ve come to a solution that I could at some point talk to my roommate privately to ask him to ask Bob to stop lounging on my bed because I feel like he’s making it uncomfortably dirty. However, I haven’t done it yet because 1) I haven’t grown the balls yet 2) Bob is a generally chill guy but I don’t appreciate his unhygienic habits so I feel like directly asking this of him is offensive(?) or rude and 3) because Bob is hanging out all the damn time I haven’t had any actual chance to bring it up.

267,"We begin dating in early 2013 when we met through mutual friends at a house party. At that point we had already known each for a little while through other social gatherings and social media, but we hadn’t spoken to each officially at that point. We both admitted later on in our relationship that we had a crush on each other even though we hadn’t spoken , so the party was basically when began dating. 

In the first year or so in our relationship everything was magical. It was like discovering your best friend and wondering where have they been all this time. Although we both weren’t virgins at the time (I lost mine a couple of months prior and it was nothing to write home about), it felt as though I hadn’t even experienced how to really kiss a girl before her, if that makes sense. Anyway, in the first year or so felt like I legit met my soul mate, and I imagined that she was the one. 

The one thing that was content in our relationship and undoubtedly played a major part in the demise of our relationship was my extreme trust issues with women. 2 years before we even got together it come to light in my family that my mom has been sleeping with a guy from the gym for a couple of months. When that come out I witnessed my family dynamic, love for my mother, my dads happiness, and my world crumble before me. 
My dad tried to forgive her, but after a year and a half of trying he just couldn’t and filed for divorce. To this day I have a strong hatred for my mother. After the breakdown of my family, it put me in my first ever experience with depression. I dad noticed, made me go to therapy, and I was taking anti depressants. And still do to this day. 

I told Charlotte around the 3 month mark about it all, and not only did she except me, but helped me through that very tough time in my life. 

Don’t really need to talk about the I’m between that much. Our relationship felt serious from the start, after my mother moved out of the house my dad was pretty much gone most of the time, so Charlotte would sleep with me in my room most of the time, so it felt like we’d been living together before we officially did. 
She decided not to go to college so she could pursue her career in event planning full time. 
We talked about moving in together, but we agreed to wait until after I graduate high school, and so when the time come and I graduated, got into a good school, we officially moved in together. At that point everything seemed great. I was dealing with depression and slight trust issues, but I felt like everything was good. 

The issues in our relationship started to arise at the beginning of 2018. The events she was planning mainly consisted of parties. She did tell me her plan eventually was to get into her dream career of wedding planning, but that parties was the only way for her to at that point make a income. Which I 100% understood, but with stress from school, working my part time job, and the anxiety/wondering thoughts while in bed at night at what she was doing, who with, and whether or not will she be home tonight (she’d sometimes sleep at her friends house because she was too tired to drive home that late in the morning). So I can say that my own insecurities did bring a wedge in my relationship. She worked very hard, and i that she hated when she had to deal with my jealous insecurities at that point in time. Our sleeping patterns became very different at that point also, she’d sleep late in the afternoons and once up had to begin work planning again, so at that point most of our time spent together involved her at her computer while I would be studying, or her sleeping and me not trying to wake her up. We started to have a lot of arguments. Most starting with me asking questions like who she would be socialising with at the party, and in turn she’d get very angry with me because she I was making it seem like she was having fun and not “working her but off”. The only time quality time we spent together at that point was going to the gym, or watching a TV show together. 

This went on for around June. At that point we had a lot of unresolved issues. We were tired all the time, and we both became very easily argumentative with each other. Although we’d still cuddle in bed, we stopped having sex around early may. 

Now on to the cheating. 

So it’s around 10pm, June 18th and I arrive at my friends apartment with the expectation to play video games and just relax. After about a hour goes by he turns to me and says “hey bro there’s something I gotta tell you”. He looked serious and I legit thought he was about to tell me he was dropping out or something. 
He looks at me and basically says that last Saturday he went to a party that my girlfriend Charlotte was hosting, and although he didn’t speak to her that he witnessed her kiss a guy there and at one leave to the backroom area for around a hour from what he could tell. He told me the kiss was very passionate. He described the guy to me and I right away knew who he was talking about. At many of Charlottes events that she does many involve partners, and the guy is a “event promoter”. anyway, he told me he thought I should know. Now upon hearing this my heart completely broke in half. I can’t put it into words, but it felt like I just been told I have a terminal illness. I gave him thanks and quickly left. I tried to drive my car home but was too full of emotions to do so. I pulled over and not gonna lie cry’d.  I knew we had problems at that point, but I honestly felt we’d pull through it. 
When I arrived home i wasn’t sure on how to confront her, so I didn’t even think about it I just went in and hoped I’d do what came naturally. 
When I walked in she was on the couch watching Netflix. She quickly turned to me and offered me a seat to finish the movie with her, but in that right moment i just simply said “what’s been going on with Daniel”. I knew it was all true in shocked expression on her face. She tried to deny it, call my friend a dirty lier, started to cry, and then eventually told the truth. 
She told me that they had sex a total of 4 times over the space of 2 events together. And that it’d been going on for just over 2 months. She told me that she loved me, that she just cracked under the pressure that I put her under, and how it meant nothing that it was just a way to escape, that It didn’t make her happy, and she felt like trash because of it. 

To skip a lot of it, we argued with me packing my bags and heading back to my friends apartment where I stayed for the week. I blocked her number that time period, and told her to not approach me. Throughout the week away from her I did a lot of thinking. I ultimately come to the decision that I still deeply loved her and wanted to see if it could work in spite of what’s just happened. I went back home on Saturday where I found her eating breakfast. She come over and hugged me for around 5mins and kept whispering how sorry she is and how much she loves me. We went to bed and just sat together not really doing much talking. In that moment in time I felt like although what she just done was disgusting I still feel like she’s mine, but I did feel a little numb inside. 

A couple of weeks go by and although we seem to be communicating a lot of and things seeming to be going in a healthy direction. I still had this deep hurt inside of me that I felt like I was trying to hide. Our sex life begin to pick back up and she seemed very passionate about providing that she’s trying to repair the hurt that she’s caused. 

Now my cheating. On the outside things seem to be heading in the right direction. On the inside though I’m still hurting deeply. I’m feeling more jealous than ever, and I’m even feeling some anger towards women. My thought process in that time was like “first my own mother and now my own girlfriend”. I just felt betrayed by the person that thought knew me the most. She knew what my own moms affair did to me, but yet she still cheated anyway. I was also angry with my self for having caused it also. One Saturday Charlottes planning on having a girls night with her friends, so I head over to my friends apartment where more friends are waiting. I really did think we were just going to hang out, but everyone started talking about this party some other students were throwing, and I just kinda tagged along. While at the party to simply put it, I met a girl, started talking, noticed she was flirting with me, and I had all these emotions of hurt and I guess wanting to even the score, so I went along with it and by 12pm I was having sex with her in her dorm room. I didn’t even enjoy the sex (she wouldn’t stop trying to my her finger in my mouth). After it was over I quickly put on my clothes and dipped. I didn’t even bother to find any of my friends I just headed right home. Got home and went to bed saying I felt unwell. 
The next morning I awoke with her pouring water over me and screaming about the other girl. At the party some girl who knew one of Charlottes friends saw me and the other girl and told. When I got up with her screaming I quickly started to scream back. From there it just when down hill rapidly. This time there was no tears just pure anger from both of us. We both called it quits there and than. She packed her belongings and was gone within the week. 

And that was it. We both blocked each other’s numbers, social media, and stopped all communication. 

In the past 5 months since than I’ve gone from every emotion possible. It was pure hell at the beginning and I missed her like crazy. I mainly indulged in video games for a way to cope. I’ve also felt a calmness, like I’ve accepted it. It’s like I do still deeply care about her and dare I say love her, but I’m at peace with it being over. 
The contact (if you can call it that) I’ve had is snooping on her IG. Now I know social media isn’t the best place to see how your former partner doing since they’re obviously only showing the good moments. I have thought about her a lot over the past 5 months and slot of the time it’ll be when I’m in bed at night with nothing but my thoughts. I still miss the little things. And Christmas was very tough for me. 

At the start of New Years she texted me with a new number saying “hey stranger.....guess who this is?”  I finally realised it was her when she said mentioned “was the 8 year wait worth it?” I’m a big fan of RDR and RDR2 come our while we weren’t together, but I bugged her none stop about how excited I was for its release. 
Since than we’ve exchanged texts and some voice notes back and forth. She’s told me she misses me, and alluded to still loving me. Yesterday she asked me if I wanted to grab some coffee with her this Sunday, but I haven’t agreed yet. 

I guess I’m looking for advice on what to do? 
I do still love her. Apart from the horrific last 6 months of our relationship everything was great. And 5 years is a long time to be with someone for. But then again I do feel like if I go there’s no going back. 

I genuinely appreciate any piece of advice I can get, so thanks in advance.

269,"so it's the school holidays here in australia and me and my mum (who is obsessive over how i should present myself) and i made a deal at the start of the hols, that she would allow me to grow my hair out over the 7-8 weeks of holidays, but i HAD to cut my hair in the last week before i went back to school. to preface this, there is no reason to cut my hair. i don't need to for school, or for work or anything like that. there is no physical reason to cut my hair, however my mother hates looking at it when it's slightly too long so she forces me to cut it.

it's coming up to the end of the holidays and i LOVE my hair. the longer it gets the more confident i feel and i start to get closer to the appearance i've been striving for, and it genuinely makes me like myself a little bit more, which is slightly hard to come by at the moment as i grow up.

however, my mum is holding me to my end of the bargain and of course has booked an expensive haircut next week where she plans to cut it all short again, and she refuses to listen to me when i plead her to leave my hair alone. whenever i bring it up she walks away or shuts the door or turns the TV up or whatever, her main argument being that i have to hold my end of the bargain. i get it, it's fair that she kept her side and i'm trying to get out of mine, but she just doesn't seem to realise that it's MY HAIR. i'm the one who walks out with it everyday, i'm the one who has to talk to my crush with it, talk to my friends with it. i'm 16. i feel i should be allowed to dress the way i want and be the way i want, but my mum refuses to budge. and trust me, i get it. my mum is very neat, and a very clean person. i'm a scruffy teenager who just wants to be me, a messy and scruffy teenager!

271,"Hello Reddit,

I'll summarize this as much as possible.  


In the past 5 years I've been laid off 4 jobs for different reasons, and I'm not really sure what to do at this point, starting to wonder maybe this job isn't for me, or maybe I'm just not seeing the issue.

I've worked as an Account &amp; Team Manager in 4 digital agencies, which specializes mainly in Web &amp; Mobile apps development, and Social Media management.

I'll give a pass on the first lay-off as the agency was highly disorganized in basically all aspects, and the partners eventually split-up over investment related issues. - Worked there for 2,5 years -

The 2nd job started off pretty well until I went through I tough break-up and went through an on &amp; off depression which deteriorated my performance at work, and eventually got replaced with a female manager (which I still believe the only purpose she got hired is solely for her looks as she had no prior experience in digital agencies, and I hear she's still didn't get the hang of the job since July 2018). - Worked there for 1 year &amp; 9 months -  


The 3rd one was great, for 2 months I took charge of a social media team for several local accounts. The feedback from the team was great and they told me stuff have been more organized since I joined. I was also able to boost the performance of several accounts by introducing new ideas and tools.  
At the end of my 2nd month (still under probation as the probation period here is 3 months), I got the news that they don't want me anymore, reason mentioned: ""we have concerns and we don't think it's going to work in the future"".

  
Current job, clients are not really comfortable with me and freelancers don't like to work with me. - 6th month here -

I consider myself a hard working employee who puts his heart and soul into the job, regardless of whether there's a lot of overtime hours and the tasks given. I'm nice and fun to be around but direct, formal however respectful when it comes to dealing with employees, I just want to get the work done with no excuses and delays. But eventually I'm always the one to blame if something goes wrong, because, that's just the job nature.

Now I'm not really sure how to deal with this anymore, and how to fix these issues. And I'm not sure whether I should keep applying for the same kind of job again, honestly losing confidence.

Sorry for the long post, and thanks Redditors for the help.

Peace.

I am a little worried that this post is just me using Reddit as a soapbox for my problems but I really don't know where else to turn, please forgive me if I am burdening everyone with my issues. I am a 21-year-old female and I feel like I have become romantically isolated, I cannot imagine myself dating someone (I am actually a little fearful of it) and I also feel as though I am not attracted to anyone. I am quite happy being alone, I really enjoy having time to myself and I feel like a strong person who is completely capable of living my own life but when my friends talk about the men they are seeing or their boyfriends I feel like I am missing out and I fall into a pit of self-loathing and I become a little jealous because I feel like deep down I maybe want to have the experiences they are having and I am just incapable of actually making it happen like I'm defective or something. I need to stress that this is the only part of my life that I am having this much difficulty figuring out, I have nowhere near this level of confusion in any other part of my life.

Is this a deeper problem that I should be seeing a therapist about? Is this normal? I am not going to lie I really need help right now, I am really confused and I feel like this uncertainty is really dampening my self-esteem because I feel like I should just be more capable like everyone else I am surrounded by.

276,"The first time my little sister and I (M) met this guy was at about midnight during a school week like ok what? No introduction, no heads up, just a sleepover which is fine, I guess. But this becomes a normal occurrence for our small quiet family and eventually we're getting annoyed at this random guest, however it is our mother's home so what say do we have?

Slowly, during dinner, we start getting to know this guy but why he's staying over is still a ""eh I'm sure you can figure it out yourselves."" Now, my sister and I, we're ok with this because my mom hasn't seen anyone after getting a divorce from our dad and we truly want her to be happy so we bite down and accept that this is the new norm. Okay.

A few weeks pass. We're still having regular conversations with mom and being cordial with this guy. One night, I get home late from work; I'm buggered and hungry and moody and in a I need food and sleep zombie mode so I head to the kitchen to grab some food. Oblivious to everything else, I check on my sister and she's upset. ""Mom was shouting at the guy on the phone telling him to never phone this number again"". Wtf. I'm pissed off at both the guy for whatever he did and mom for doing this in ear shot of my little sister! This just brings up all the toxic memories of my dad and mom having yelling competitions while we play with the dogs like everything is fine trying to drown out the noise of swear words and stuff being thrown around the house with stupid conversations about whatevers on the TV. 

Our dog sleeps in my sister's room that night. Never heard a bleep out of my mom so figured that's the end of that guy. Thank God! Yeah but this is life and the universe likes having a laugh. Everything goes back to normal in our worlds before getting shat on my this guy coming back into our lives. NOW I am still pissed the fuck off from what happened with the phone incident so I am real cold with the guy, so is my sister. We still talk with mom but that slowly turns into snappy teenage responses translating to ""I'M SURE YOU CAN FIGURE IT OUT FOR YOURSELF MOM!"" 

Fine whatever. I'll finish school then work and move out. But what about my sister? She's still close with mom, for now. Months of this guy living with us on and off go by with my sister and I celebrating whenever he goes back to his house like it's Christmas! This is sorta okay now, just need to save up money and keep grinding, I can live with this. Enter this guys loud friends. Now, we're a very quiet family living in a quiet neighbourhood, besides the odd bickering from the neighbour and his adopted son, so picture a bunch of guys drinking and socialising at our house, sorry my mom's house, like they're still in college. WHILE THERE'S A CHILDREN IN THE HOUSE, TRAPPED IN THEIR ROOMS. What the heck? 

The fact that this guy now treats this house like it's his, as if he pays rent (which he doesn't, I would know because I'm the one helping my mom out with it!) or helps out with literally ANYTHING besides alcohol. For consecutive weekends their have been ""small"" get-togethers of loud drunk people at our house. During exams. The only peace we get is if we just take mom's car and drive around town or to the beach. Because my sister is closer now to my mom she speaks with her but that doesn't help as my mom now calls us selfish because she can't use her own house? ""Then go to your father's!"" if we tell her we don't like those people coming over. 

I'm getting worked up now, I'm sorry. Now my relationship with my mother has rotted away to me treating her like a landlord; here's your rent and extra money for the car. Done. That's it. My sister is becoming more aggressive with mom as she thinks mom chooses this guy and his friends over us. 

Question: I know I /we should speak with my mom but I am afraid she might take it as ""it's him or us, it's either you're happy in life or you're a mom"". Any advice would truly be appreciated, thank you.

291,"I recently applied for a really big opening in my university's student government, one of the positions that is contested extremely intensely during yearly student elections (vacant due to a resignation by a past office-holder). 

I realize stuff like this is meaningless ten years down the line after school, but for active students it means a lot, and comes with its fair share of responsibilities and perks.

My interview process was relatively straightforward - after a pre-screening, I interviewed with the current student body president and a faculty advisor, which went off more or less without a hitch. I made it past that, and then had the opportunity to give a pitch to the student Senate, who made the final decision as to who to hire.

And they picked me - that should be great.

But I find it hard to feel happy for myself - even though my friends were so pumped they bought me dinner once they found out - and instead am rather sad for the other applicant for the spot who made it to the final presentation.

While I have a lot of experience in the areas my position requires me to have experience in, it isn't because of past work in student government. I made it pretty clear in my presentation and following questioning that I had practically never interacted with student government itself in the past, which I tried to pitch as a plus - I'd be a blank slate, without any pre-held grudges caused by the chaos that led to the position opening up in the first place. 

On the other hand, the young woman who had gotten to the final state along with me had an insanely long tenure as a student government staffer - the longest of any current student at the university, including currently serving in the position that typically is the de-facto heir apparent for the spot she was applying for. 

When I heard her presentation, I pretty much abandoned all hope at getting appointed - and yet somehow, I still ended up getting the position. I felt kinda sick afterwards, and still feel like beating myself up over denying her a position that she's a great fit for (she's now one of the staffers I'm in charge of - hooray).

I obviously don't know the voting rationale of the Senate - the faculty adviser I'm working with hypothesizes it's because she was close with the past vice president who got forced you, or because they didn't want to show favoritism to someone how could run for the position outright at the end of the school year (I'm a senior and graduating soon, she's a junior and has a whole additional year remaining in student government). But between the Senate's vote and my performance in the prior interview, part of me grasps that I shouldn't be dwelling on this too much, since I wasn't the final decision maker.

But another half wants me to feel sad for her, and I don't know if this is normal, or if something's wrong with this creeping feeling of guilt.

She's been professional at work, but obviously that isn't enough for the fruitcake part of my brain still wallowing in mild paranoia.",17Jan2019,1
292,"One of my closest friends in school, T, is great. She’s smart, witty, and we have great discussions. But, she’s just so negative most of the time. 

She gets stressed about everything, especially school. Because of the immense pressure it seems her parents put on her (and she puts on herself) she thinks she has to get into the best universities, and she thinks that going to a less than top tier school isn’t good enough (we actually had an argument about the fact that she made it seem like she thought herself above those who go to state universities)

Even though she’s one of the best students in the school, she never sees herself as good enough, and she constantly brings it up all day. 

She’s also just generally a pessimist about everything, and that just drains me because I’m working towards being a more positive person. I’ve tried everything I can to cheer her up and help her, but she shoots down everything I do, sometimes in a way that makes me wonder if she even likes me.

Anyways point is I talk to her over messages and for some reason I think I like her. She clearly likes him and even though she keeps insisting that she doesn't.

296,"Hi. Okay I know I shouldn’t ask this here but I’m in a rush to find a sub/forum to ask this on.

Back in September, last year, I had a pretty bad fever. Obviously fever comes with a runny nose and a cough... after a few weeks I’m already well but this is a very persistent cough. I’ve drank medicine everyday but sometimes when I ran out I don’t have the time to buy another, I still do casually buy medicine and drink it for my cough. 

The thing is this I’m starting to think my cough is severe, even up until now in January 2019 I still have coughs and whenever I wake up I throw up heavily because I coughed too hard. Sometimes it’s starting to embarrass me during class. How do I heal this persistent one? Also my parents wouldn’t let me go to the doctor because they don’t have any time.",17Jan2019,1
298,"This is something I did to myself. I know I am solely responsible for the situation I am in but I am not sure who to approach or what to do.

To summarise, I am 22, 3,000 AU Dollars in debt, I've wasted 3 years of my life lying to my parents that I've been doing well in my Bachelor's of Information Technology course and they expect to see my results tomorrow.

Thing is I gave up on my studies 3 months in. I couldn't focus, I kept getting distracted, putting off my assignments till the day before it was due, never studying for exams or to perform well in the assignments I had to submit. So it's obvious I'd fail, I knew I would but I did absolutely nothing to change it or myself. I had no motivation and didn't know what I wanted to do with my future...still don't 

I wanted to reach out for help or talk with my parents but I couldn't bring myself to. Asian parents, they work very hard to provide for me, my dad was living alone in another state and K spent 3 years living with my mother, watching her slave away at her supermarket job, i wanted to kill myself everytime I saw her return exhausted from work. I'd avoid picking up my father's calls...we were never on good terms. 

My parents never had a happy marriage either, for most of my childhood and till date they would always fight. My father's the type of man who ets amusement out of looking down on my mother  making offensive comments, he'd constantly talk about other women from what I remember from my childhood. But that doesn't really classify as a reason... I've seen people love through much worse.

I've even helped some of my friends online who've come to me for advice regarding their life problems or relationship problems...I always felt guilty because I wasn't applying a fraction of what I advised them. But most of the time they told me my advice helped and their lives got better. Which made me really happy.

Anyways sorry for getting off track. My father's left his job for now and is pursuing a new prospect in another state. 

Tomorrow is probably my last day and since he's now living with us. Both my parents are expecting me to show my graduation certificate but of course I have nothing to show. I don't have any money saved up, I don't have a part time job and I spent all the money the government gave me to support my education on mobile games. I've already failed once before while trying to study Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering and now I've repeated the same mistake and I can't seem to go anywhere in my life...

I know that once they find out tomorrow, it'll be a bloodbath...my mother as much she loves me will lose all trust in my and my father will probably take this chance and abandon my mother.

I have no real life friends, no adults I can depend on, no where to go and no savings to support myself when I most likely end up losing both my parents. 

I've been avoiding reality and running from it by hiding in Manga or Novels...but it's banging on my door right now and I don't know what to do.",17Jan2019,1
299,"Hey everyone. Posted this on r/relationships a couple hours ago and it got removed for being a personal problem, so just copying/pasting here:

&amp;#x200B;

I think I just need to rant? I honestly don’t know what I need advice on, if this is the right thread or what, but I need peoples input. These are just the bare bones of the story. A lot more happened, I’m just honestly too exhausted to type it out. This will be quite long, and I’m a bit of a mess right now, so apologies. I’m 17, almost 18. I left high school part way through 2017, just after I turned 16, which I’ll get to the reasons soon.

In high school I was friends with a group of 3 others. For the last year and a bit, things were kind of a mess between us. In our group there was four of us (me, A, B and C). A was my best friend, and we would talk about anything and everything. A and B both got boyfriends, and, around this time, mainly A, started to ignore me. B had some health issues and family issues, which she was open to with everyone else in the group, except for me, but she expected me to know what was going on, and everyone would end up getting annoyed at me for asking what happened when one of these situations came up. I began to get extremely left out of the group, and it was like everyone had this massive secret which they were keeping from me.

A and B started going to parties, and Im pretty sure began smoking, doing drugs, drinking excessively, skipping school with their boyfriends, etc. I don’t have a major problem with any of this, I smoke and drink socially and have skipped school plenty of times, I just think you need to be sensible about it and they weren’t caring about their or anyone else’s safety. I’m confident B was influencing A to do this, and I know thats what A’s mum thinks. I honestly don’t even think A likes B, considering how much she would c complain to me. I made a comment to my mum about how I was worried they would slip drugs in my bag to get revenge for whatever reason. We all knew they were skipping school, and one day all of us were hanging out before class. I can’t remember what we were talking about, but A made a comment saying “oh I never skip school”. I joked, saying “don’t lie, you told me you’ve skipped every Wednesday since the start of this term”. She turned around, looking pissed off, and said loudly “NO! I never said that”, so I replied “yes, you texted me the other day”. A and B then started shouting at me, basically saying I had no idea what I was talking about and how I should stop talking. I rolled my eyes at them and said something along the lines of “Fine, I’m totally lying, whatever” and then turned and walked out. C stayed silent through all of this. At lunch that day it was insanely awkward, and I just sat in the corner while they all talked. It was like every time I talked, they would get annoyed and say I was wrong, etc. Slowly, they stopped coming to our meeting spot at lunch, so I just hid in the bathrooms at lunch.

I was telling my mum about what was happening throughout all of this, and she was just saying “ohh you’re just growing apart”. I started skipping classes, calling in sick constantly, and my mental health was awful at this time. Honestly, if I hadn’t left I seriously think I would have commmited suicide by now. I think my mum knew how bad my mental health was, even though I didn’t mention it, so she enrolled me in a course where I was split between high school and uni, as a way to pass my schooling quicker. My high school teachers were insanely unsupportive of this course, even though it was run through them, so I wasn’t in a good relationship with them either. I was assaulted one day at this course, and it made my mental health a lot worse than it was before. Around this time, I was going through some physical health issues, and over all was not in a good place due to school, etc. I couldn’t talk to A about anything now, so I ended up bottling everything up. I started threatening to drop out of school, so I enrolled in correspondence as well as continuing the uni course. From what I know, none of them asked why I left so suddenly, although I’m sure they know by now.

Throughout this course, which ended end of 2017, I couldn’t stop myself from going back and looking at their Facebooks, instagrams, etc. My mental health slowly started improving, and I’m generally ok now, but I was, and still am, so hung up on why A, B and C were ignoring me that I would fall back into these small depressions where I couldn’t focus on anything except for what I did wrong. I work in a store thats in the central city where we live, and A has come in with her mum a few times. She never talks to me when she’s there, but her mum is still friendly. Every time they come in, I have a panic attack and leave the checkout to cry in the back once they’re gone. My mum said that the few times she’s talked to A’s mum, she says that A didn’t realise that she was ignoring me, I was a great friend, and A’s mother misses me, and would rather see me back with A than have B hanging around her.

Even this far on, I’m still so caught up in why it was me who this happened to, that I really don’t know what to do. I’m doing a lot better, but I still want to know why. I don’t know how I can message her and say how much it hurt me, because I don’t want to hurt anything even more. A, B and C all ignore me completely now. The main one I care about is A. I don’t now if I should message her saying my side, or how much its affected me, but I want to go into 2019 fresh, etc. I’m honestly such a mess and I’m still so affected by it, as small as it seems. What do I do? If I do message her what would I say, and what are the pros/cons of doing this?

tl;dr - Group of friends at high school suddenly turned on me. it wrecked my mental health, and I'm still caught up on it, need advice on what to do.",17Jan2019,1
300,"Background: im 24, so im not sure if its ""lets not tell the kid anything so they dont worry"" or am i just misunderstanding. On the other hand, my brother passed away after battling depression for years, so its a sensitive issue in our household.

Mom brought home six packages of antidepressants (i googled the name). Yesterday i heard them talking about how dad should ""take one immediately since they dont start to work the same day"" - when i asked, they said they were talking about vitamin supplements.

There is a small chance that the meds are for my uncle who has a variety of issues (havent heard of depression being one, or even him seing a doctor, so i doubt it)

Im not sure if i should press the issue or just let them carry on by doing what they thing is best.",17Jan2019,1
301,"So, I turned 18 in October. It turns out that I was right to stress about that. My question is, what do I do about my father's constant badgering?

Before you ask, no. I am not being pressured to move out. I got a budget, but that's about it.

Well, my dad has been talking to me about work. Not retail work like Subway, but working around the house. He says I need to ""pull my weight"".

Now, before you flame me and say that my parents just aren't letting me do nothing all day while I consume all their resources, hear me out. It's not the work that's the trouble, it's how he goes about it. He talks about it as if he has no care for the whole ""you need these things for when you move out"", I think he's mostly chore-farming and using me as the combine harvester.

Ever since I had to do the dishes after dinner, the counter looks like it's been hit with a blitzkrieg. Before that, they would use as little plates and glasses as possible. They would reuse glasses to drink out of, all of that. Now that I'm doing it, boom. No care left. If they want another drink, they go and get another glass instead of using the one they had started with. They no longer use recipes that use little resources, as they don't have to clean up after themselves any more, so why should they care? I had to wash my dad's car for a week until it was dropped and when I had to do that, my dad would come home from work and his car would look like the creature from the black latrine. Before, he would think ""Right, muddy shortcut home or the clean, longer way? Eh, I'll play it safe."" In a bit of karma, though, he once came back from work with his car caked in mud because he forgot that he'd wiped washing his car from my chore list (which might as well be written on a roll of toilet paper).

That's not all he does. We went on holiday in August (Sorry if I sound ungrateful, just bear with me) and about halfway through, my dad complained that me and my brother had done absolutely nothing to help. My brother told him that he hadn't asked for anything, but he just told us that we could ask for work. While on holiday. Worse, it was petty stuff that he should be responsible for himself. He gave examples of getting documents that he left in the car, ordering stuff from downstairs, all things that he should be solely responsible for, since he was the one who left his documents in his car and he should be ordering his own stuff from the bar. After all, it's not like he has to make it himself.

One more problem is that he cannot stand being wrong or called out. One time, my dad insisted I get some driving practice by driving home from a long walk, but I tried to pass that up because my legs were a little numb and I was still a bit breathless. He angrily demanded I did so because ""I have such a lazy attitude"" and ""my driving test isn't going to pass itself"". He yelled at me pretty much the entire way home and that distracted me, so at one point I accidentally left an indicator on and didn't notice for a few seconds. He insisted I did it on purpose to prove a point. He always says that, but he does it himself. More often than he should, he pretends not to believe me and tells me that this is why no one believes me, I ""always lie"" (I do occasionally to prevent an angry outburst). Just a few days ago, I called him out on all this and he got all offended, saying that he's been working for me for free all my life, and that I should ""share the housework"". The problem is, I have a different schedule compared to my brother. His schedule is from Monday to Friday because he goes to school. I go to day college for Animal Care, so I go Monday, Tuesday and Friday. This means I do much more work than him.

Sorry about the length of this post, I'm just in a bit of a huff and need to know what to do next. Thank you for listening.

The answers by Reddit is similar to my everyday life.

&amp;#x200B;

I could never focus for long periods of time. When I try to focus really hard it makes my head hurt, not that bad but the pain is there.  Does this mean I have ADD or is it me just thinking too much into it? But even if I have ADD it doesn't really bother me much, unlike the anxiety that I may have.

&amp;#x200B;

I always think about small stuff like when someone looked at me for a second, when I wanted to talk to the cashier, etc. Every time those scenarios happen my heart starts to race and it feels really heavy. I'm afraid to get out of my room (I live alone in a dorm) because there might be people there that would look at me. And every time they look at me it feels like they're silently judging me. But when I hang out with friends I feel more social and those feelings are gone.

So here I am seeking advice about what is it that I have and what to do about it. If there is something to stop this I really need to know because my everyday life sometimes feels like hell and sometimes it feels like heaven.

314,"This is a mess and I’m sorry.  

TL;DR - I set boundaries with my blood family and now they won’t speak to me because I can’t send money or take full ‘custody’ for our disabled mother.  

This is a looooong post so thanks for sticking with me.  I want to preface this with a note to file: my mother and father are both addicts that haven’t gotten recovery.  My mother has been clean from meth for more than ten years but never got into any kind of recovery.  Additionally my family is very hush hush about their problems and it’s hard to get anyone to talk about their feelings.  I’m not close to my father (my parents split when I was a kid).  My mother is kinda all I had, addiction included.  Times were shitty but... family I guess?

Six years ago my mother was diagnosed with heart failure.  She lost her job and her car and eventually her place to live because she had to stop working.  My brother ended up taking her in, and he’s been her caretaker since.  *Every month* I was sending them a bunch of money so they could get by, mom could get meds and things she needed - it was important because she was not insured at the time.  I didn’t suffer too much because it was just a few hundred bucks and instead of saving I just sent them what extra I had.  My brother at the time worked making decent money and with my help and some times my sisters help they usually made it by.  Some times I had to send even more money to them for one reason or another. 

My mother is historically bad at money managing.  She falls prey to impulse shopping and just isn’t good at saving whatsoever.  My brother - kind as he is - doesn’t like to say ‘no.’  So they’re basically always running through their money.  It took a few years for her to get disability.  When she finally did, she got all her disability money paid retroactively to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars.  That money was gone in a few months, and it was back to sending them money.  She even gave me a couple thousand bucks, which I took and tucked away knowing she’d eventually need it, and every month until it was gone I just gave her the money back that she gave me.  But at least she was getting disability, food stamps and SSI right?  They still needed money but it was a little easier for them now that my mother had an income.  

My brother and I talked a lot about plans for our mom, and what the future might look like.  I’m the youngest of three kids.  The last conversation we had about moms care was me being very honest in that I’m unable to care for her.  My brother accepted that and said it was okay.  After that conversation we never talked about switching things up. Mom had a triple bypass in 2016 and then in early 2017 my mother was diagnosed with throat cancer, and then in July of 2017 she (a diabetic) let a cut in her toe fester and it got so infected that she had to have her leg amputated.  When it rains it pours, right?  

Well, September of 2017 rolls around and my brother had a seizure at work and hit his head so hard that he had some serious brain trauma.  He also found out he was HIV positive, and had been for at least a year.  I was still sending them money - almost every week at that point.  I felt guilt because I couldn’t rush in and save the day like I felt I should.  I’d already used FMLA for moms cancer treatment and had no time available to take off to care for them.  Things were scary for a bit because we didn’t know what was going to happen but thankfully he made almost a full recovery and was able to immediately get onto disability.  I say almost because now he is more impatient and reclusive.  So at this point they’re both receiving assistance and they have a room mate that’s helping them lease a house and everything is split three ways.  Combined they get about $2,000 a month (not counting the money I’d send, which my mother began to call ‘mommy support’).

I’m under no delusion that it can still be difficult for two people with two dogs to live off two grand a month given the cost of medicine and food and bills.  They live in a rural area and their bills are cheap compared to living in the city.  At some point after my brother was recovered I began to feel a little salt about all the money I was sending.  My own finances were suffering and I was having some costly medical issues of my own.  I was busting my ass at a job I hated while also maintaining my family and social life, my relationships and also trying to keep making art.  Meanwhile they’re collecting benefits *and* getting money from me and my sister while they sit around all day and do nothing but watch tv, and I’m not embellishing this at all.  My brother and mother still buy and smoke cigarettes (she doesn’t think her *throat cancer* was related to being a lifelong smoker).  They still impulse shop and would rather give people gifts than be able to self sustain (every year they buy me gifts on my birthday but still ask for monthly money - apply this to every holiday).  

It’s been more than a year and my brother is *fine* physically and doesn’t want to get a job because he’s ‘tired of dealing with people and has a short temper.’ (his words).  My mother sits in her room all day watching TV and chain smoking (her bedroom walls are coated with nicotine).  I do think they may be depressed or weighed down by how the past few years have gone.  

Because of the history of addiction and the way it affected my life I decided I needed to do some work on myself.  I was feeling hugely anxious and depressed so I got into therapy.  I began to realize that I was sending them all this money at a huge cost to myself, and that I was feeling used.  There would be times where I’d only hear from them when they knew it was time for me to send money.  So four months ago I had a big conversation with them and decided I couldn’t send them money anymore.  At the time I had a reasonable (and true) explanation about dropping down to part time at work.  

Wouldn’t you know that two weeks ago (after having a great Christmas together - even though they asked me for money because they were broke after buying everyone gifts and food) my brother starts hitting me up with these weirdly passive aggressive texts asking me to take over caring for our mother.  I tried talking and remained calm and tried to explain why I couldn’t.  I live in a two bedroom apartment with two other people, we don’t have the space, I don’t have a job, the list goes on... I was trying to be understanding and just,,, *good* - I was trying to honor my boundary.  

The last message I received from him was ‘eat shit.’ He’s blocked me on social media and hasn’t spoken to me since.  I called my mother to figure out what’s going on, and she guilt tripped me for not sending money anymore - she hasn’t spoken to me in a week.  

I feel like I was trying hard to be honest and to protect myself because I don’t want to resent them.  I told them many times I’m always here to talk, visit and whatever else I just can’t send money anymore. I’m not supporting them the way they want me to support them (monetarily) and now I’m a piece of shit because I can’t take over and assume full responsibility for my mother?  I don’t know what to do here.  

I’d love some thoughts and I’m happy to answer any questions you might have to provide more clarity.  I don’t know if I should keep trying to communicate or just leave it alone.  

Either way thank you for reading.  It felt good just to get this out.  ",17Jan2019,1
315,"Hi everyone, I hope this is the right thread. If not, please redirect me. Thanks!

For background knowledge - I am a 22 y/o female.. My best friend is a 25 y/o female, and she is married to a 37 y/o male. 

Last night around 3am I received a call from her.. I was half asleep when I saw the phone ring, and figured she just butt dialed me. I let it go to VM. When I woke up a couple hours later for work, I noticed she did not leave a VM, so I went on about my morning.
 
When I had time to sit down, I went on Snapchat to ask her why she called me so late (we mainly communicate through Snapchat).. When I opened the app, I did not have a message from her, which I thought was weird. Instead I had a message from her husband. I opened the message and it was a very long, dramatic, and excessive confession of love to me. 

Long story short - He is, and has been, unhappy with their marriage for quite sometime. He has always loved me, and he needed to be honest with me, his wife, and himself. 
As the message went on and on, I came to the end. About 1 hour after he sent that message to me last night, there was another message from him stating ""I am so sorry, but she went through my phone while I was sleeping and saw my message to you."" This explains the call at 3am from her. 

I love them both so much, and I want to explain to her I am absolutely at a loss for words; She will not return my phone calls. She thinks I have been doing things behind her back to lead her husband on. He texted me again about 30 minutes ago stating she is upset, but understands his feelings towards me.

Should I just leave it alone, and go my own way. Time heals type thing? Thanks for reading.

TL;DR - My best friend's husband loves me, and now she hates me.",17Jan2019,1
316,"so i’m currently in high school right now. it’s not too difficult and challenging. and the college i’m going to doesn’t have major requirements.

my problem is that i’m cripplingly irresponsible. by this i mean, i’m suffering in school, it’s affecting my moods, and it makes me feel awful about myself. 

now the obvious solution would be to start caring more about school and being more responsible. but for some reason, no matter what i do, i just can’t. i think i’ve narrowed it down to just being unmotivated.

and yes, i realize that keeping this up could cause me bigger problems and i realize that i’m probably hurting myself. i just can’t seem to find a point in doing it.

of course it isn’t just school i’m having issues with. it’s things at home, with friends, with parents, and just basic things in your daily life that you should be doing. 

and even after all of this, posting about it, realizing it, and wanting to fix it, i just can’t seem to have motivation to do it. what’s the point? ya know?

some of my friends blame it on depression or whatever, which i think is bs. they can’t diagnose me or anything. i have been dealing with other mental health issues, but i doubt they’re related. 

but ya know, i’m probably blowing it all out of proportion and making big deal over it. i mean other people have it worse. so i don’t feel good asking for help here but i am. i’m kinda desperate

318,"This might get long, so I'll jump right in. Bear with me as I'm on mobile.

My fiancé (25M) and I (24F) are stuck in a tough spot. We currently work for a factory that pays very well, but physically is pretty demanding. We only work 7 days in a 14 day period, which isnt terrible, but I have 12 hours of overtime, potentially 18 soon. Which would obviously reduce my days off and increase my physical pain and such. My fiancé works in a different department and isnt subject to the same overtime schedule, his is as needed. We work our shift, drive home together, sleep, and get up for work. We eat like crap, we dont cook, we barely spend time together and do things outside of function for work. We never see our friends, and since we work overnights, we only have 3-4 friends we can see regularly. We've been having fights more often due to our schedule and lack of want to interact. We're so tired and lazy when we have time off, especially me due to my overtime schedule. 

I should take the time to note that we both suffer very heavily from depression, ptsd, and anxiety. We also have 2 fish and 2 cats we have to take care of, and I'm heavily prone to upper respiratory sickness. 

My fiancé used to work as a bus driver, something he adored and was previously his only job for 5 years. While our pay at the factory is really good, we've been questioning if its worth our mental and physical health, especially since we are in the process of finding primary care for all our needs. He brought it up one morning on our way home, venting about how he hates our current job and how he wanted to go back. I had initially made a plan to leave December 2019. However he got excited about leaving, and has since made moves to leave sooner. Like, next week sooner. I've also made moves to leave based on him. I don't have my CDL, so I'm studying for it. The problem is this job is a massive pay cut. We have have a full 2 months where we'll lose out on pay. I've mentioned I could work a part time job on the side to supplement us, as I'd have time and energy for it, but we recently got slammed with a potential need to move. 

Our landlord has gotten a lot of complaints from our building and has threatened to evict us and other neighbors due to all the complaints- we havent complained about our neighbors once, we just grin and bear their shitty behaviour. But now that we're at risk of needing to move, I'm in panic mode. I've been out of work at the factory for 3 days (fucking sinus infections), and my fiance has stayed home with me. Hes going back tomorrow night, but I might not be due to being sick. 

I'm torn between these two options. Do we stay at the factory, who's only pro is the monetary satisfaction and safety; or do we leave, take the pay cut, but give ourselves the time and resources to manage ourselves better?

Please let me know if any other info would help with any advice you'd give, I'm trying to think of anything useful to add. I'll edit later if need be.

Thanks in advance.

319,"Basically the title. 

I went to buy a ticket for a Parkway Drive gig in Cardiff a little while ago and I might have made the mistake of being slightly intoxicated when I tried to get them. As a result, I ended up with a ticket for the Nottingham gig instead of the Cardiff one. 

I have asked on r/parkwaydrive but it’s a pretty quiet sub and  I’ve not had any luck. Are there any sites that deal with reselling tickets, or even anyone on here that would want it? It’s the one on the 31st of January in the Nottingham motherpoint. I’d be fine with taking the standard ticket price or even a little under, just to get rid of it.

321,"My fiancé and I found what we thought was the perfect apartment in October of 2018. We live in Astoria, Queens New York , which is a neighborhood not to far from New York City. 3 bedroom, 2 full bathrooms. $2500 a month. Probably more space then we need right now, but we hope to have children soon. 

So everything was good at first. When we first saw the apartment, the landlord, who is a 65-70 year old woman, told us we would need to put area rugs over 80% of the apartment to keep the noise levels down. She lives on the second floor, and our apartment is on the third floor directly above hers. We ask around, and that is pretty standard on a multi level building. 

So we figured everything was good. We spent a lot of money on rugs, signed a lease, and moved in. 

A few weeks later, we meet her son. He is in his mid to late 20s. He is polite at first, and tells me he can hear me play guitar sometimes, and that he himself just started taking lessons. Cool. 

A few weeks later, I’m sitting on the couch at around 2pm playing my acoustic guitar. I hear a knock on the door. It’s my landlords son. He asks me “if we can be more conscious of the noise we are making in our apartment”?

I say “what noise, I’m just playing guitar”

And not even that loud! And at 2pm in the afternoon!

He says “it sounds like there’s a banging noise”

I say “well it’s not coming from our apartment”

He says very annoyed “could you just be more conscious of your noise “

I say “ ok, but I’m not making any banging noise, maybe it’s coming from somewhere else “

And that was that. 

The next day my fiancé was home around the same, preparing some packages to ship. 

The landlords son knocks on the door again and says the same thing to her. She pretty much has the same interaction with him. 

Fast forward a few weeks later, the day after Christmas. I’m at home, around 1 or 2 in the afternoon, unpacking presents, and washing some pots and pans we got for Christmas. This fucking guy come up again to complain about noise.

I ask him to tell me what he expects me to do? We have to make some noise to maintain an apartment! At this point it’s starting to feel like harassment. I told him I didn’t want strife between or neighbors, but we pay rent and should be allowed to live in our apartment. 

At first I thought he was cool with my explanation. He shook my hand and that was that. 

Since then he has been rude to us every time we see him in the hallways. My fiancé said hello to him the other day and he scoffed and at her and didn’t reply. 
I just walked past him, he rolled his eyes and said something under his breath. Something like “fucking bullshit” or something. It seems like he really doesn’t like us. Like he doesn’t want to even look at us.

This sucks. We are both pretty quiet people, in my honest opinion. We keep our music and tv at normal levels. We don’t have parties. We just cook food, clean our dishes and watch old reruns of shark tank every night. We are boring homebodies. We are in bed by 10pm most nights.

I kinda want to go off on this punk. I’m not sure it’s a good idea though, because his parents are our landlords. They seem like nice people though. I had a few chats with the dad, and the mom even gave us a care package for the holiday.

322,"On paper I have a wonderful life; I live abroad where the weather is great, I work for a very cool, successful and well-paying agency, I have great qualifications for someone my age and I have a girlfriend that loves me.

The problem is, is that I absolutely detest my job as I'm literally just sat behind a computer doing jack all day - definitely not earning the inflated salary I'm being paid. I have never felt more lonely even though I have someone around me all the time; and to boot I don't speak the local language. And to top things off, all of my normal hobbies (sport, travelling and adventuring) I can't do at the moment because I'm in physiotherapy after a somewhat major operation on a sports injury.

I have tried taking up new hobbies that I can do in the meantime but it hasn't made things much better and I can't talk to my girlfriend about it because she's anxious that I'm going to move back to my country and it puts strain on our relationship. I'm also in between living accommodation and staying with my girlfriend at the moment because she wants me to stay with her permanently and puts lots of pressure on me to do so while I think right now I need to have a bit of space - but I'm also wary that this might make me lonelier.

I have spoken to my family about it but they struggle to understand why I'm unhappy given what I do for a living and now I feel like I can't talk to them again because I will be badgering them.

I feel as if I'm being pulled in so many directions and cannot find a path forward.

323,"Hi reddit, I have a dilemma that has been over two decades in the making, so I’ve done my best to summarize it as much as possible without losing relevant details. Sorry for the wall of text, I would very thankful for anyone willing to spit through it and give me their thoughts.

**My backstory:** I grew up in a rather rural environment, outside of America. I had a pretty healthy social life during elementary school, but grew disconnected with my hometown culture/friends starting high school, while my appreciation for pop-culture (movies, games, internet) grew larger. Feeling unable to express my hobbies and passions with my environment, I started spending my time more and more reading online forums and consuming media, which led to English becoming the dominant language in my head around age 15-16. I wasn’t completely socially incompetent and made some friends throughout the years, but never ones with whom I felt I could truly be myself with.

Now I’m 23, and I’ve since moved from my hometown into a nearby city where I’m doing an all-English study in game design. Most of the students on my study are international, and in the 1.5 years I’ve been taking it I’ve met a few really good friends there that I hang around with daily. 

Since then, English has not only remained my thinking language, but it’s also the language I speak almost exclusively apart from visits to my parents. This has of course done wonders for my English (which I now consider to be my first language), but has also had a regressive effect on my comfort in speaking my mother tongue. I’m increasingly forgetting words while speaking it, and more importantly I’ve lost the feeling for speaking it naturally / making jokes in it.  And after years of having to pretend to fit in with people I never truly felt comfortable or at home with, I’m left with zero interest in reconnecting with anything related to my heritage; I love my parents/siblings and we are on good terms, but other than that my native language/culture is little more than part of my unhappy history to me.

There’s a downside to my international friends also, though. Because they don’t speak the language here at all, and like me have little interest in dealing with the rural culture, we really just hang out with each other and no-one else. There’s not much opportunity for growing my friend circle with them, which is a bit frustrating because unlike me, they do have a home country with a social circle they’ll gladly visit during the vacations.

Now, here is my dilemma; I still get contacted by my old dutch friends from time to time to hang out, and while I on the one hand have little interest in rekindling those relationships, I also feel like burning whatever bridges have remained from 20 years of my life might not be strategically sound either. I can’t say I’ve never had good times with them, and the ones that still reach out have, for all the issues I have with them, always been loyal and decent to me. But now that I know what it’s like to be myself around people, and with my social skills in English having grown far stronger while the ones in my native tongue have grown rather inorganic, I find it very hard to asses whether it’s worth it to maintain these relationships. *Any advice would be appreciated!*

*TL:DR; Grew apart from home culture / language in high school, have since made closer international friends around whom I’m able to be a very different person. However, am feeling conflicted about cutting contact with friends from my past, and burning every bridge I built over my teenage/adolescent years. What to do?*

324,"I broke up with my Ex on Sunday after 3 months of being together. I cared for her a lot and it was really hard on me as well because I couldn't see a future with her no matter how hard I tried. We were just too fundamentally different and her depression, debt and pessimism was too much for me to handle and I quickly figured out I couldn't be the answer to her problems.

When we broke up she didn't say a word to me and started trashing my place yelled at me saying I was an asshole, then left my apartment. It was really scary and devastating that she took it so poorly. After she left I called her sister letting her know the situation and to check on her.

Today I get a text from her coworker that didn't know we broke up asking if she was okay and informing me she was in the hospital. I texted her sister in a panic and she let me know she was in the hospital due to attempted suicide and was doing better now.

325,"i live with my mum and younger brother (15) im a 23 yr old girl
our landlord has over the past few months (almost the time we've lived here actually, but has been especially mean lately)
evicted us because my mum disagreed with her on something petty, so she raised the rent more and more each week. my mum said that that is not fair what she is doing, she evicted us out of retaliation because of this. 

we had a hearing in court and stuff brought all this stuff but she lied and pretty much had no claim or evidence, was just making up stories and the edjudicator believed it, he took her side and used my mums illnesses against her. we've never missed rent and have improved many aspects of the house. 

she'd come in sometimes without notice and later we stopped letting her in, because legally landlords have to give a 24 hour notice beforehand. she would only give a few hours/ minutes notice.

shes debted from court money but is trying to find a way to snake out of it (not like she cant afford it, she's got a high up job and owns various properties, but she's acting like shes this poor older woman with nothing. she literally has thousands in the bank.) also she would have to take out an order to remove us from the property bc we are paying rent n stuff, she did the eviction wrong. 

we can stay a week longer but my mum wants move now, shes being verbally and emotionally abusive. yelling at me and getting annoyed when i get upset over the way shes treating me etc theres more but its a long list. she wants to put all our stuff in storage and stay in a motel/hotel until we get a place, which would be stressful for me as im autistic + have severe anxiety + other mental issues (look at my page if ur curious)

we've applied for housing, and too get me a flat to live in alone and hope it gets done soon. we hot a drs rec and spoke to people to try snd speed it up. 

i cant live with her anymore, this is hurting me. 
she causes daily anxiety/ panic attacks for me and sometimes it triggers my psychosis.
i want to move out asap, but it's about how long the housing will take. 

i dont have much money, im on disability payment and cant work.
i cant rent an apartment or stay in a different hotel. 
her behaviour makes me suicidal, countless times something shes said has made me want to kill myself. 
shes rude to family all the time too.

326,"my ex broke up with me about a month ago, we have decided to keep talking as friends. Whenever we talk in person he always brings up this one girl (know they're just friends, shes one of my sort-of friends). He used to talk about her when we first dated and I told him that I didnt like how much he compared me to her and we actually had a whole entire deep conversation about that type of thing. 
So he is aware that him talking about her bothers me, and even at the end of our relationship I asked him if he ""talked about me as much as he talked about her"". So yes, he knows that bothers me. Yet, he brings her up constantly when we talk. But he was never the jealous type when we were together. Like never, at all, not very possessive either like ""you're my girl"" type of stuff. 
 Then yesterday, we were eating together, first time we have since the breakup, he pulled out his phone, and I could see that he was texting someone on snapchat. 
he then asked ""do you know ****"" and I said ""no?"" and then he told me how he met her the day before and ever since, shes been hitting him up. He said he didnt know her that well but they had been talking. I ended up asking if he liked her and he said ""I dont know"" (I mean cmon how do you not know). He then asked why, and I said ""well obviously you do if you're asking me about her"" then I explained how I dont really want to hear about girls hes flirting with, it just makes me sad. Then he got defensive and said ""I dont know means I dont know. Talking is not flirting"" to which I just asked him again to not talk to me about his love life, he said okay. 
Is this his way of trying to make me jealous even though he knows I miss him? or is this more of a ""I'm moving on, you should too"" type of thing? or a sucks to suck, I'm happy you're not situation? thanks for reading and hopefully giving me some advice!",17Jan2019,1

328,"My girlfriend (27yr) and I (27yr) have been looking at houses over the past couple of months. We take in a combined 8k after taxes, med insurance, and 401k contributions. This house will cost 2.5k including taxes and mortgage insurance. We have enough saved up over the past couple of years for a down payment. We agree we can handle this financially, but I'm not so sure about some aspects of the situation.

First off I'm 1.5yrs out of college and I just transitioned into a new position 6 months ago. She has been out of college for 5 years and really has her footing. I feel less secure about trying my wagon to a large purchase like this considering that I don't come from money and I have seen many people over commit to big houses and then end up losing them.

Beside me feeling insecure about proving my ability to consistently provide financially, they seller is asking 325k and the interior of the house could use a good 40k put into it to make us happy with it. This is above the price range we agreed upon. My gf agreed to put in an offer at 290k and not go much higher, but even still with the cost to update this feels like more than I bargained for.

On top of this I'm feeling pressure from her and her family to make a decision, but I just feel like I can't decide. She seems 100 percent sold on this property and I am just not as convinced.

329,"Okay just some backstory, I’m gay, and I’m in my second semester of freshman year. On move in day I met a guy (let’s call him Dave) and I instantly clicked with him, we became best friends from the get to. Dave knew I was gay because I told him at the beginning of our friendship and he was fine with it nbd right? So we started chilling and getting drunk together and the stuff he would say and do made me think that he was attracted to me. I started becoming more and more attracted to him. The problem? He has a girlfriend lmao don’t get me wrong she’s super nice, I’ve never tried to break them up they’re pretty great together. Dave would stroke my legs when we were drunk and like slap them and say “yeah give me that shit” like every time we got drunk, we snuggled a couple times, he told me he wanted me to suck his dick (once sober and once drunk). When we were high together he kept starting at me then the next day he told me I had the most beautiful eyes. He also said he was going to buy a flesh-light and asked if I wanted one and I joked and said I was broke, he said we could share one and immediately stepped back and was like “Wait that’s weird” when we were drunk. So essentially he was insanely flirty for a straight guy with a girlfriend and I started really falling for him. It was really hard on me emotionally to be so attached to a guy and think he feels the same while he’s in a relationship. This one time he was super anxious and he came into my room and I hugged him for a good minute to calm him down and tell him to focus on his breathing. When I got him to sit down I got close to him to reassure him and he looked at my lips and licked his I was sitting there like 😬 aight. I started getting more and more depressed because I was in a weird ass situation and couldn’t do shit about it, so I told him that I liked him. I poured my heart out into a text (confessing attraction as a gay guy is scary af I don’t want negative responses like violence) about how I like him but I get that he’s straight and has a girlfriend and that I’m glad they’re together and all he said was “I know” you knew??? What do you mean you knew?? It’s crazy to me that he knew I was gay, knew that I liked him, and he still did all of that stuff. We’re still best friends but he’s way less affectionate now I think he started realizing that his actions were affecting me more than he thought. We would do all this shit when we were drunk and just never talk about it because I thought it was bc we liked each-other there wouldn’t be a reason to talk about it. So was I led on? I know he has a gf and it was stupid of me to like him in the first place but I can’t control how I feel. Did he even like me in the first place or did he use me for validation. So now I’m stuck still attracted to a guy I’m forced to get over because I got rejected, he’s less affectionate (which sucks because I’m affectionate with all of my friends) so I feel like I didn’t help myself at all here. Over break he was super distant, he made plans multiple times and then he blew me off and the only time we had real conversations was when he needed advice about his girlfriend. An ounce of me wants to believe that he is somewhat attracted to me and started to push those feelings away when they became valid once I told him. I hope he doesn’t see this because he is on reddit too lmao I might delete it after a while. ",17Jan2019,1

337,"Hi guys, first time poster. I've got a conundrum and I need advice. I have two jobs but I really want to quit one. 
Scroll to the end for the TL;DR cause this is kind of long.

My first job I really loved at first; it's retail but I love what I sell and the customers are amazing. But, my boss really dislikes me, to the point where he barely talks to me and I never hear about things happening within the store. He plays favorites with the other staff members, and he dislikes me more than the employee he's been wanting to fire since day one. I only make $12/hr, which is minimum wage even though I'm a sales manager. I've asked him about a raise but he's said it's out of his control. I get about 22-32 hours there, depending on how badly we need to clean the store, which is a lot.

The second job is great. Again, it's retail but I sell what I love and even though the customers kind of suck I'm very happy there. I used to work for them but for reasons I had to leave for a while. That's why I now work at the other job. I have a crew that I adore and I get along with the management team, including the store manager. I've even picked extra hours when I can, doing doubles especially during the holidays. I've applied for a vacant merchandising manager position, and the store manager has expressed interest, but she's dragging her feet on the interview. The problem here is while I make $12.75/hr here, I only (at max) get about 20 hours, but mostly because of the other job. I've told my store manager that I'll gladly drop hours at the first job for more hours here, but she's hemmed and hawed at it.

So here's the major issue. First job SM puts out the schedule every week on Saturday. He's supposed to schedule three weeks in advance but he never does. Everything is last minute with him. Second job SM schedules three weeks in advance, and thankfully keeps my hours to my availability so there's rarely if ever any conflict. 

Earlier this month First SM dropped on me that inventory is coming up, on a day that I'm scheduled at second job. He knew for a while but forgot to tell me before I could request the day off from second job. I talked to Second SM and she gave me the day off but I'm working super early then next day. That was the trade off. This is not the first time he's done this either; it seems like he's constantly dropping surprises and I have to work around them. 

This morning I got a text that inventory has been pushed back a week. Again, I'm already scheduled at the other job. So now I'm out a shift at both jobs and have to talk to Second SM about switching around a firmly scheduled shift. The weather is to blame for the pushback, so it's not his fault, but I absolutely cannot work inventory and I know he's going to throw a fit because we're a small crew and it's all hands on deck.

I'm so done with this, Reddit. I know this time is not his fault, but in the short time I've been at first job this is probably the sixth or seventh time I've had to drop shifts at the second job to cover his butt. I know my Second SM is getting frustrated by this, and I want to stay on her good side because I'm holding out for this full-time position.

After everything I've said, should I just quit the first job? I think if I do, it'll show my Second SM that I'm more dedicated to the job. It's such a risk because neither job pays me enough to have a lot of savings, and I'm basically dropping to a single part-time job, but anything has to be better than being pulled between a generally lackadaisical SM and a better but kind of flaky SM. 

TL;DR: Should I quit first job with a shitty boss for potentially more hours at second job with a decent boss without a safety net of a backup job and savings?",17Jan2019,1

340,"Hello there,
I moved to an apartment with my brother and a couple of friends to start my freshman year of college 4 months back. We moved into an apartment with 4 bedrooms. My brother out of his own choice choose to stay in the smallest room (fits a queen bed and a desk to study only) to pay the least rent.
After I moved in I setup my gaming PC and personalized my room and since my brother's room is small I told him he could setup a closet in my room!

This the first time for me to live with flatmates so anyhow after the first month everything was fine... But slowly I feel like my brother is not taking responsibility for his own stuff he is dirty and doesn't clean after himself even after making a meal for him wouldn't care to do the dishes. He then started playing on my PC which  I didn't mind at all! Then he started smoking in my room while playing leaving dirt and letting my deskspace get dirty it's where I study and spend my free time.

He broke his laptop and now he is borrowing my laptop to study (I also need it to study). I always do him favors but never says thank you. When ever I ask him for something he gets an angry tone.

After a short while he started playing everynight even when I go to sleep he would keep playing i told him numerous times if he wants to play just keep quiet so I can sleep (he didn't) then he suggested I start sleeping in his room. I said no but sometimes I would go to his room to sleep!

Now it's finals and I study in my room that's where I am comfortable but he would still come into the room smoke and play on the PC for hours distracting me from my study! 
In the last 2 months I have not used my PC for more than an hour a day because he would come in and start demanding it's his turn.

I thought about moving to his room and keeping the PC there but I don't want to live in a small space also it's my stuff he has taken over... 
I talked to him about this stuff and he says he does me favors all the time and sacrifices so much for me (this is not true from my perspective). He is one year older than me.

What can I do? I know next year I'm not taking him as a roommate.

Thanks to everyone sorry for the long post",17Jan2019,1

342,"I’m a senior in high school, and I’ve been caught cheating many times... once- by this calculus teacher (on a take home quiz)

Today, I was making up a calculus test that I missed two days before. I was taking it in the testing center of my school, and some seats have computers. I chose to sit at one of the computers- not knowing I would be asked to move. One of the proctors came over and told me to move, my test key was under my legs, and I panicked because she was just waiting for me to stand up. I stood up and picked up the piece of paper and she saw. 

She said: “what is that”
I replied: “Uhhh, it’s just my note sheet”
Proctor bitch: “HAnd it over”
Me: *hands over the answer key to the test*
Proctor bitch: “this looks a lot like your test”
Me: “it has nothing to do with the test”
Proctor bitch: “who’s your teacher”
Me: “Ms. ********”

She walked away and I did horrible on the test, I don’t really care about the grade I get, I would take a 0% for all I care... but I wanna finesse my way out of discipline.

The teacher doesn’t have a lot of forgiveness (at least that’s what I think), so I’m not sure if apologizing is the right move... that’s would I usually would do, but this is different because I had the entire test key printed out...

I have been brainstorming for when she confronts me.

345,"I’m not sure if this would be in r/legaladvice only because I’m not sure if I should even get legal with this.

This morning I was fired. Word for word this is what my manager said, “So, it’s become increasingly apparent that you’re unhappy here and for that reason we’ve decided to part ways.” 

And then our HR person walked me through what happens now. I get one months plus one week’s pays as severance as well as one month of virtual outpatient services (help to find a new job with resume review, interview prep, etc.)

So nothing was said about my performance, in fact, in October I was pretty much promoted a step up in my career path. By pretty much, I mean that I was hired (in April 2018) for the “Level 1” role but based on performance, was placed at the “Level 2” role when the company was determining the current employee structure, and given a small raise.

I had no indication that they were unsatisfied with me or my work during weekly updates or otherwise. The only record regarding my “unhappiness” was that I rated how I was feeling for the week on our weekly update software consistently as a 3, which is neutral. I didn’t really understand this portion of the update as I normally am just a very neutral person. Was I rating my feelings towards my work? My environment? Overall? And yes, I asked about this and they just said, “you know, how you’re feeling! About work, life, your role, etc.” (so not helpful) 

Showing happiness isn’t “my thing”, I’m pretty reserved, non-expressive, and introverted when it comes to my feelings in my work environment where I think professionalism is you know, keeping your emotions out of things. Sure I didn’t agree with some of the decisions that are made but I wasn’t constantly arguing or going against the grain, if anything I avoided conflict because I knew it was above my pay-grade. 

So I guess I’m just asking, what now?  Can I/should I ask them for a recommendation letter so to protect myself from the inevitable questions I’ll get as I’m looking for a new job? How do I explain in interviews that I was fired for “unhappiness”? Any other general advice on what to do now would be helpful since the future is pretty open.

Background on me, I’m 23F (soon to be 24), I have a bachelors, I triple majored in international business, finance, and marketing and minored in German. I work in social media/marketing. Relocated to Florida for this job but I’m originally from PA. I have rent paid for February and my lease is up March 31st and I have a part-time remote job doing social media with another company but I’m not sure if I can go full-time with them because they want someone in Santa Barbara CA. So in all honesty I’m not too worried about money, more so of how can I best put this whole situation to bed so it doesn’t bite me in the butt and what to prioritize to do next.",17Jan2019,1
346,"Hello guys,

I'll try to make it short and succinct. So. I am the oldest child, and we lost our parents when I was 11. Now I'm in my mid 20s and have been studying in the US for 4 years. I got extremely lucky that I received a full housing and tuition scholarship. I am poor even by my third world country's standard so I could not go back home for 4 years now. I'm finally going back home soon. Since my parents' deaths I have always had suicidal thoughts, the only thing that's stopping me to act on it is the fact that I don't want my siblings suffer again. So here I am with no will, no goal, and no motivation to live, but can't off myself. Since I am stuck here another 20, maybe 30 years, I think I might as well lead a decent life but I have no motivation and goal at all. So, here I am. How do you find motivation in life? What do you think I should do? I fell in love with girls couple of times and never asked them out, but I told them that I liked them expecting no answer in return, which makes me relieved and helps me move on. Usually it goes like this. I like a girl, but my mind says you are shit and you are just make her life worse with your negativity and your presence. So I distance myself from the girl. in a way biological me and mental me oppose each other. I just don't know what I should do, and not sure if it's right or not. I have so much in mind, it's all scrambled and going crazy. Sometimes I feel like I just might go crazy.  Any advice small or big?

Right now I have three in mind:
-Power Engineering
-Software Developer
-Digital Marketer

Right now I’m taking a course in for power engineering that if I do decent in will get me a 4th Class Certificate of Competence. If I do really well I could get be halfway getting a 3rd Class Certificate of Competence. Basically it means that once I’m done high school I don’t need to go to a post secondary school. Now this might sound great but problem is I hate it. Believe me I tried to force myself to like it, I enrolled with an open mind but it didn’t work. What I’m learning doesn’t interest me. It’s boilers this and boilers that. The only reason I started taking the coarse was because having a 4th Class Certificate of Competence meant I could work when I got out of high school with a decent pay of ~35,150. My parents told me that I should just suck it up and continue anyway because of the high pay and no cost education, as the coarse is in high school. 

I am also taking a coarse for computer science both at school and my free time at home. I have more passion for coding and technology itself, then I currently have for maintaining the safe and efficient use of boilers. There’s no special coarse for computer science like power engineering so if I do choose to pursue computer engineering I plan on going to a trade school or take an online course or two.  Unfortunately when I told this to my parents they turned me down saying I should just do it on my spare tome as a hobby, and focus on power engineering. 

I just came across digital marketer recently. Long story short I want in. Unfortunately there isn’t a coarse in my school for digital marketing or marketing at that. There is however an entrepreneurship course, but I can’t take that till next grade. I haven’t talked to anyone about digital marketer so it’s just a thought right now. Even though it’s just a though it interests me to consider taking an online course about it.

I have lost multiple nights of sleep over this as I don’t have any close friends, I have anxiety talking to teachers, and my parents can’t seem to empathize with me. 

TL;DR
What should I pursue?
-Power Engineering
-Computer Engineer
-Digital Marketing

My sister, the older one, was given the opportunity to move to Ireland when she was about 12 and the same offer was given to me when I was 12 but I declined because I had time to think about it, the time when I actually had to decide seemed so far away but now I realize that I’m running out of time to decide.

A few days ago, I made a post titled “I think my son is gay”, I said that I wanted to get some time off work so that I could talk to him and hopefully get him to come out.

Here is a link to my original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/afp5jv/i_think_my_son_is_gay/?st=JR0QSZ28&amp;sh=ad7bd9c9

I was overwhelmed with lots of helpful advice and now I would like to share with the ones that are interested, how it went!

So in my original post I said how I wanted to get time off work to spend time with him but sadly I could not do this and instead I got permission from the post office if I can bring my son along on one of my deliveries which they said yes too. I talked to my son on Tuesday and asked if he would be interested in spending some time with me the next day and perhaps come to work with me. I said he could miss a day of school to spend time together. He was happy to spend time with me and he also didn’t seem to mind waking up early to come.

So yesterday came and we are both waking at around 6:30am we both get washed, have our breakfast and we get ready. We jump in the post van and we head to the post office. I noticed I had a bigger delivery than usual which was good because it meant I had more time to be with my son.

We begin driving and start our conversations small I ask how he has been doing at school and things like that (my son is 16). What I didn’t mention in my first post is that my son isn’t my biological son, his real dad left when he was 12 and his mother (my wife) died in 2011.

Eventually we came by a very convenient charity which was to help prevent violence against gay youths. I pulled over so that we could go check it out, I believed that if he saw me donating money and talking about how gay people should be able to be accepted it will help him think I’m open to gay people. I donated £10 and we got back in the post van and this is when he says “Tim, what made you do that?” I explained that I don’t think it’s right that gays are seen as different people and said that if my son was gay I would accept him and treat him no different. He went quiet and about 30 minutes later he says “Tim, I have something to tell you, I’m gay”.

I just stopped the van and began to hug him telling him that I’m proud that he has cane out and told him that he is very brave. We both did some crying and we celebrated with ice cream and McDonald’s.

After the semester ends I have finals for the whole week after and you guessed it, I haven’t been studying very effectively. I have tests in 7 subjects where 3 are easy, 1 is somewhere in the middle and the other 3 are hard.  I’ve been slacking off recently in studying and I havent been able to find the motivation,  willingness or strength to do it. I basically have a week off before finals (though i’ll have to attend some lectures bc of quizzes i have to take-another thing i have to study for) and I have to somehow manage to study for it all in 7 days (some of these books are over 200 pages and have a lot of facts to remember). I don’t know how to do it all, how to systematically organize myself and my work in a good way and then when it’s all organized get myself to actually do it and do it all effectively (aka not waste time). 

I’m already panicking a little on the inside and I’d just like some advice who have personally been through something similar to this or just have some advice that they think could help. 

I know a lot of it involves me getting myself to do it and sticking to what I’m doing but thats also pretty hard for me. 

If anyone reads this, thanks in advance ",17Jan2019,1
356,"This might come off as me seeking validation but I have been confused about this for a long time. Please read till the end. So I have a brother who's 25 now and we both live with our parents (we live in India so it's not possible to move out). He had a job for over a year or two and was good at it but is now taking a break so he could give some exam for higher studies. He constantly keeps putting me down because of my laziness and lack of work (I am in university and studying fashion) when he himself didn't pay for himself till he was almost 22. He keeps telling me that I am useless and will never amount to anything in a very serious tone when we get into fights over silly things like me refusing to go downstairs to give my dad a slice of pizza because I am tired (I always am #1 when it comes to helping my parents and he doesn't even call my mom when he's away for days when he knows she's worried. I always have to get his plate for him and give it to my mom to wash). He does no household chores or anything and neither do I cause even if I try my mom is very specific about how things should be made in the kitchen and I can't experiment the way I want to (she otherwise is very kind and my best friend but kinda is a health and cleaning freak). The reason I have still not gotten a part time job is because 1. Its something that won't pay enough for my groceries or anything and 2. I am in uni and also recovering from depression and anxiety. He keeps telling me that the reason I have problems with people is because I am a bad person and have an ego (I got bullied because of my mental health).
My problem here is that he keeps mentioning how I live off daddy's money and can't amount to anything which hit a nerve. I live a comfy life where I can afford to go out with friends and visit places that cost a lil bit of money(I am mostly introverted but sometimes visit cafes and museums) This is 99% of people my age around me. I feel like I am dependent on my parents for everything and have been reading about how college students are supposed to learn basic life skills and finance by this age. I absolutely don't spend money on alcohol or other things rather than food and my meds (sometimes clothes if my mom buys me something nice) but even that costs a good amount. Lately I have been feeling that I am somehow a burden and leeching off mom and dad and that has reduced me going out a lot. I am doing well in my studies and have decided to team up with someone to launch an online store to make a bit of money but I live with constant guilt whenever he says ""I don't even wanna talk about your behaviour"" when I do something like eat a lil bit extra candy meant for him (which he does all the time too). So is it possible that I am leeching off in your opinion and am the ass hole here? ",17Jan2019,1
357,"My boyfriend and I have been together for the past 10 months, with the last 5 months being (relatively) long distance since I started working towards my degree. 

During the past 10 months, he's met my close best friends and I've met his. My best friend's parents threw their annual New Years party and invited all of us, including my boyfriends best friend, during which he hooked up with one of my other close friends and have now started dating. We all get along really well, it feels like we've all known each other for years and I couldn't be happier because of it, this whole dynamic is a dream of mine. 

My boyfriend and his best friend have been talking about moving in together for a while, and since they met my best friend, they've offered to look for three bedroom places so he can move in. My best friend loves the idea, he really wants to move away from our home town and his parents house.

It's all gone extremely well, they've found a place to move to and have paid a deposit and are currently sorting out the paperwork. The place they found is wonderful and I couldn't be happier for them, they've achieved their dream and it brings me joy to know that they're excited to move to their own place. 

But it's really affected me badly, I want to move in with them so so badly and it really pains me that I won't be with them until holiday times. 

As I said earlier, my boyfriend's best friend is also dating my other close friend and, if it turns out well (which I REALLY hope it does), she could move in too. 

I can't imagine how nice it would be to live under the same roof as all the people I love and care about, and it hurts so badly that I wont be able to experience it the same way.

They all know that I'm quite upset about it, and they've all been incredibly supportive. My boyfriend I especially give credit to, whos been consoling me when I tell him how I feel. He also describes the house as 'our place' and he wants me to help him decorate to make the place feel like my own too. He also tells me to be excited for summers and Christmas breaks when I'm back home, how we can all be togther. I'm so grateful because of this, him and all my friends are such lovely people and this has, ironically, made me feel slightly more upset because it has reminded me how great they all are.

I also really hate university, the experience of it is nothing like I imagined. the course is harder than I thought, I'm not as motivated as I once was and I'm incredibly lonely. I have a few good friends in lectures but noone I can really speak to the same way I do with my friends back home. I'm also REALLY far away from home (relative to the UK) if the title didn't clarify. I want to move to a university closer but they don't have a course I like and my parents arent supportive of this.

I feel so selfish for feeling the way I do, I feel like I'm bringing their excitement down for being upset and the last thing I want is for them to have to keep reassuring me and constantly trying to make me feel better rather than feeling excited.

I'm dwelling in self-pity but I can't think of anything to help me feel better, is there any advice as to how I could handle this?

Sorry for rambling ",17Jan2019,1
358,"For anonymity's sake I'll call my daughter Rebecca. And for the sake of full disclosure and context, she isn't really my daughter. She's the daughter of my girlfriend who has been living with me for the last 7 years, so about half her life. We are her full time parents though. 

Anyway, back before winter break, rebecca's mom got a call from the police calling her to rebecca's school. Apparently Rebecca had been talked into sending a boy a naked selfie and he had shared it with a couple other boys. Rebecca's mom decides not to press charges, the boys were suspended and rebecca received no punishment from the school at the time of the incident. 

So we get back from our winter break vacation, check the mail and there's a letter from the company that handles the school's end of year trip saying they're sorry we decided to cancel and refunding half of our deposit. Mom eventually got in touch with the teacher in charge of the trip and learned that the teacher had canceled rebecca's trip because the incident had proven she was too impulsive and that there's absolutely no way rebecca will go on the trip.

From my point of view, this teacher is revictimizing my daughter. The most tangible thing she lost as a result of a fucking sex crime against her was at the hands of this teacher. Like what does this teach her about what she should do if (heaven forbid) something more serious happens to her later in life. My plan right now is to call the school and schedule a meeting between the teacher, the principal, my girlfriend and I. But I'm not sure exactly how I want to play that or if I have any leverage against a flat refusal.

361,"As the title says. Over winter break, or at least at the end of it, when I was very very well rested from school and such, I noticed that a lot of curiosity and creativity emerged, about physics mostly, but about other stuff too, to the point where I couldn't resist reading about them. 

Because I was interested in more complex topics I had to reread the same things a lot of times, but still, I kind of couldn't stop until my curiosity is satisfied, and of course mt creativity was at 100%, I even made reddit posts to confirm some things. I actually made reading and learning about physics kind of a resolution. 

But after school started, I just couldn't. I tried as much as I can, I made a daily schedule, giving me a lot of time to rest and study, I tried half-forcing myself to watch and read about the topics I am interested in but I couldn't, it seemed that my curiosity and creativity had just disappeared. 

My only explanation is that school either drains me too much, or forces me into a tunnel that I can only escape after a big rest (like winter break). 

Now, there is nothing I can do about the education system, but the absence of my curiosity and creativity is making me very bitter. What do I or can I do to ""get them back"" and make them stay even when I have school? If any of you had the same problem, how did you cope with it?",17Jan2019,1
362,"I've always been overly empathetic, to an exhausting degree. Literally my entire life I've heard my mom constantly complain about how she has no friends, no husband, is always worrying about money, etc etc. It gets to me because I love my mom and I want her to be happy. Right now she's going on to my grandmother about how only thing in her life that's a given is working, sitting at a desk. How can I be happy about anything or feel good about moving on with my own life when she's constantly talking about things like this, how depressed she is? I went to college and it was a nice respite. I graduated like 8 months ago, and I'm supposed to be moving away in a month. I just feel so guilty about it, though. I feel guilty about getting to do stuff—with my mother's financial help, because I have no one else—when she feels this way.

364,"I am female, 20 years old, Latina, and I get hit on often. The last time I was intimate with someone (even a kiss) had been three years ago (I have problems letting ppl in). That being said, my resolution this year was to be more open, and so when this boy came to my job and started flirting w me I actually accepted his number and did text him after two days of thinking it over. When we spoke I told him I’d been alone for a while, and he told me his last intimate interaction w another person was 2 months ago. He also kept repeating how he’s not one to lie and wants me to know he might not be looking for a big relationship. I took that as a good thing Bc I wouldn’t want to rush anything after so long. Fast forward to a few days later, he’s fting me w his friends constantly, talking to me about his family, inviting me to go with them paintballing, all that Shabang. After maybe 4 days of texting we plan to hangout over the weekend, he comes to my place we watch movies and we hookup. Keep talking the next week, we hang out again on a Thursday and hookup again- it’s cool. Now, Sunday comes and he went upstate over the weekend, I miss a ft call Bc I’m with a friend and I text back saying I can’t answer. Then I get a mini paragraph basically telling me “look I have a gf, she knows what we did, I’m sorry for lying but this is over”. Imagine my shock lol So my response was no problem. I give it a few days and when I feel cooled down and I see that he’s watching all my stuff on social media I reach out and ask if he has a n explanation. He says he already gave me one. I ask what happened to having been alone 2 months, not being a liar, and he’d constantly say all the other guys that hit on me were scumbags. His response was that he’s worse and he was going to just dead me but his gf wrote that message. Oh! And he claims he’s a sociopath 🤷🏽‍♀️ My response to that was you are not a sociopath you are just a self centered person, but I appreciate your attempt at honesty.

TLDR: Be me, be alone, meet sweet stuttering guy at work, he also is alone, he shows pics of his mom, talks to me constantly around his friends and invites me to his home. Hook up twice, and then be told he has a gf, this is over, and app now he claims he’s a sociopath.

I understand this isn’t a dude I have any interest in chasing, but do people really do these types of things? Isn’t that just in real shit movies? Also I know he wrote the message so I don’t get why lie, unless he’s doing that corny break her heart n she’ll hate you thing. Im not angry, im just kinda confused and feeling a lil insulted.

366,"In all honesty having her be my roommate was short sighted. 

- she seems to have no desire to be clean and uses every possible not to be. I've been trying explain to her why it's important we keep out places and the general house clean (keep away roaches). She says she gets it and still doesn't do it. We bought a calendar and set up a cleaning schedule. Her cleaning days come and she says I'm tired from work, but she will have energy to watch movies, go grocery shopping, and more.

- she seems selfish or has no little integrity. A while ago she was sleeping on air mattress my family lent me. She accidentally popped. She agreed to replace. Months go by. She gets new piercings and tattoos. When I ask what's going on with the mattress. She hasn't replaced it yet because she doesn't know how much it cost and because my mother told her not to worry about it. Idk maybe it's just me. I don't understand that if I break something that belong to someone else, even if they say don't worry about it, I go out of my way to make up for it. That wasn't even the only thing she broke. She broke my hallway mirror about a month ago. Since then she's gotten a new tattoo, taken us out to dinner, has gone clothes shopping, and has redone and restyled her hair.

- she seems to have no desire or ability to better herself. We've been friends for years. She constantly talks about problems and has little to no social intelligence. I've been trying to help her with these things (advice, suggestions, teaching her things I know) but whenever I do she's defensive and ready to justify what she does and the way she is that it seems pointless. It's at the long now where whenever she talks about problems I tune her out and when she asks for advice I say I don't know.

- she's been doing this little thing ever since we moved in. She'll talk about a lot of things and say ""we"". Examples: she wanted to go the store the other day. It was cold and late so I said I wouldn't be going and because I didn't go she didn't go. Another example: we were grocery shopping. We were buying our things separately. She kept saying ""can we get this? Can we get that?"" Another example: she asks if we can sell he bike in the living room (my bike) and get money for it. Idk this implicitly seems like she sees us as parent and child or as a couple or something.

Im not enjoying being roommates or the friendship currently. Living together and nostalgia are the only things that keep up together but shes oblivious to all of it.

Your opinion and an explanation as to why you think this is the right choice for me, is what i need right now. Im very young so i dont understand life that well, thats why im reaching out for some advice. 

Option 1: College 1 is the college that is near my home. Pros of this option would be: i dont have to pay for housing and food, tuition is cheaper so less debt later in life, i have friends who go to this school. Cons of this option are: School has a reputation of being a party school, i hate living with my parents, they get on my nerves daily, and im just ready to move on and live alone, I absolutely despise where the school is located, not only the city but the whole state aswell in every way. 

Option 2: College 2 is far away from home ( think 10 states away). Pros of this option would be:  Finally get to live on my own and get away from my parents/feeling like a kid, the state this school is in is my favorite and i have also lived there before so i know what its like, more opportunities to be successful (school is next to a major us city, unlike option 1). The Cons are: School is much more expensive, food sucks, ivy league price tag for an average education.

So my biggest concern is money and thats why im here. Loans scare the shit out of me and i dont know if ill be able to repay them. The fact that option 2 is very expensive makes me rethink attending that school. But other than that option 2 is what i want, but is it the best option for my life? Im not sure.

371,"I'm a 21 year old guy who’s quiet and can look nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it so idk. Also when I only got a pub job myself without asking for her help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done every time I see her. I was intimated by her because when she looked at me when talking to me she seemed to judge me horribly. All this in a bad way? When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way which confuses me because she gave me a furrowed eyebrows snobby look at me when she first called me over to the appointment which got me down.

Edit: she started saying the ‘awww’ from when I’d get up to leave at the end of every appointment since the time I failed an interview a few months ago for not having enough confidence but I usually would say ‘oh ok thank you’ when I’d get up to leave at the end when she said awww so it could be that idk",17Jan2019,1

So, i (17F) was at this party last summer with a bunch of seniors from my school and this guy (17M) was flirting with me all night.

He drove me to this abandoned parking lot and asked me to kiss him or give him a blowjob. I declined and he got very mad and put his hand over my mouth in the passenger seat, was yelling at me about how much he loved me and I’d never understand, and he was going over 40 mph over the speed limit. Fast forward to this party. It was on a campground, so we all had tents. I had been drinking a ton. He was flirting with me, there were no seats left, so i sat on his lap. He went to the tent and i said something mean about him so i went in there to apologize. He kept kissing my neck and i told him to stop multiple times, said i was too drunk. After he wouldn’t leave me alone, i agreed to give him a blowjob and that was it. I told him that i didn’t want to have sex. I still kept drinking and at some point, i started blacking out because i couldn’t remember much the next day. I didn’t even know if we had sex. So i asked him, and he told me he remembered everything and that we had sex. One of my old best friends told me that i ran into her tent asking if i could sleep there because he was chasing me around the campground and he told me that i “got up and started having a panic attack during ‘it’ “ my friend told me that she heard me telling him to stop. When i confronted him and said i felt taken advantage of, he changed the story and said that it ‘never went in’. Maybe this is crazy to ask, but do i have a right to feel violated?

This process usually takes 6 months. It's taken 2 years with the fact that everyone now wants to be a legal resident and applied. 

We've spent tens of thousands of dollars on a lawyer and the process. We were supposed to get assigned an interview date any time now, until the government shut down. We've been told that if this doesn't get finished by may, then we have to start the process all over again. The government is not giving out interview dates during the shutdown. Neither one of us want to live in Mexico anymore. There's a huge lack of opportunities and safety is not a priority for this country. In addition, we don't just have tens of thousands of dollars to essentially throw away again, hoping something comes of it. 

Should we just start looking for opportunities elsewhere? I'm a music producer and freelance writer and do pretty well.

382, My wife refuses to move my sister to live with us after the death of my mother ... What do I do? ,17Jan2019,1
383,"[M27] So to make a life story short, Due to some problematic times in my childhood I now have extreme difficulty forming a deep connection with romantic partners. I have been in quite a few long-term relationships that I just never felt anything substantial. So, I never been in love (I don't think.)  

I love my family, so I know that I can. But it took me well into adulthood and some personal growth for me to verbally communicate it to them. But with partners it's all different. It's like a wall comes up if I get close and I can't break it down. Which brings us to now. 

I've been seeing this wonderful lady for about 7 months, and there's something there. I want to include her in my free time, I'm happy when I think of her, and she makes me laugh so damn hard, and it's upsetting to think what would be if she wasn't there. But is that love, no fireworks, just me being content?  I want to be sure before I use the big ""L"" word. I take it seriously when I say it. What do you all think? Is it too soon, or am I being to stoic? ",17Jan2019,1
384,"This is going to be a longer read, but I would really appreciate some advice. My Father and mother were never married and broke up shortly after I was born however I always went to visit my Dad every other weekend. He was very good about buying me what I wanted and okay (not great) about paying my mother child support when I was young. I also have a half-sister (same Dad different moms) who was in a similar situation as me in terms of our Dad. For reference I am now 24 and my sister is 19. 

My Dad has always been extremely moody. He is a drinker (I would say a functioning alcoholic) and smokes marijuana, however he is very financially successful. Growing up he would be extremely angry to the point where I would not bother him. Then he would be extremely happy and buy me whatever I wanted. When I was young the angry periods would not last long and he would frequently go from happy to angry and vice versa.  As I have gotten older his angry phases seemed to get longer. He would e-mail my mother and my sisters mother saying how he was done paying child support or he would e-mail me saying I need to provide for myself (this was by the time I was in high school/college). 

After I graduated college my Father asked me to help out at his business until I went to grad school and I agreed. His mood swings seemed to be worse and he would often leave the store to get drunk and then come back angry and complain to everyone about everything. Over this span of time from my childhood to college graduation he was also married multiple times and had multiple relationships all ending in divorces/break-ups, essentially because ""he was too much to handle"". In addition there were many period where my mother, my sister, sisters mom, and I would not hear from him for weeks/months and he would not do anything for us or with us until he was ""happy"" again and then would call us very often, buy us things (including a car), and visit. 

Fast forward to last summer where my Fathers mood swings are even worse. By this time my sister has stopped talking to him completely. She never got along with him as well as I did. In an attempt to reforge their bond my Dad asked my sister to attend an event with him. She agreed and according to her it was a disaster. When they arrived my Father immediately lost her by walking to fast and was obviously drunk. My sister was alone the entire event and had to call her mother to drive three hours to pick her up. Since then my sister and her mother have been done with him. My mother was also done with him before this point because she couldn't deal with the mood swings and him yelling at her. 

A couple weeks after this event my Dad e-mails my sister and I saying he resigns as our Father. We didn't respond, chalking it up as another mood swing. Shortly after he began sending us more e-mails about how he is thinking about killing himself, how ungrateful we are, that we are not actually his kids, and how we can take care of ourselves from now on. I only responded to him once or twice as we still believed that maybe he would go back to his normal happy phase. By December the e-mails have gotten worse. He called me a pussy for not dealing with my very abusive step-father when I was a child, told my sister who has vitiligo that they are not related because he ""spoke to over 100 of his family members and none have the disease"", and loves to bring up the fact that I have gotten in trouble before and he had to hire lawyers to keep my record clean.

The worst one came a couple days ago where he told us all that he hated each and every one us because we do not care about him. Please keep in mind that the only reason I have not responded to him is because each e-mail was extremely mean and he never asked to talk (even after I offered). My sisters mother is also now suing him because he missed many years worth of child support and they cannot afford her college even after he agreed to help. 

I know I am not perfect in any way, shape, or form. I have been in trouble before which my father did help me through and maybe I could have been better by visiting him more or taking him out to dinner, etc. However at this point I just don't know what to do. I really want to have a conversation with my father, but I feel like no matter what I say he is just going rip into me even more for everything I've done wrong and how much he's done for us. That is why I am afraid to reach out. Because I am just tired of all the negative criticism. However I really concerned about his well-being and think he is mentally ill. 

Essentially I am looking for advice on what I should do in this situation. Should I  just grow a pair and go to his house or attempt to call? Maybe I should reach out to his side of the family (I attempted this with one family member, but they never responded. I assume this is because he told them how awful we are) or a doctor. What would you do in a similar situation?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you so much for reading through this!

TL;DR: Should I reach out to my mentally ill Father who as of recent says I am not his child and that he hates me?

385,"I was 15 and he was 20. The relationship lasted 2 years, and even though the relationship was very rarely face to face he was able to completely destroy my self esteem. To this day I still feel like other people's anger and sadness and annoyance are my fault. The relationship was during a time when someone very close to me died, my father was being an ass, and my moms alcoholism was getting more and more noticeable. At the time I thought he was a bright spot in my life, someone I could lean on.

What I fear in regards to telling people is the repercussions. My aunt, who is my biggest confidant, is certifiably insane. I genuinely believe she would track the guy down and kill him. In the other hand, my mother has been sober for almost 600 days. I feel that if she finds out what had been going on under her nose it might push her over the edge. It has also been 5 years since I escaped him, maybe it's been too long to tell anyone.

401,"I don't really know how long she's been smoking it in the same room as me. Probably for as long as we've been living in our room. I know she's injected it via needle while I was sleeping, since I've seen her doing that as well at one point when I woke up.

To make some points of clarification: we live in a dorm-like apartment complex (meaning our room is literally a single room with basic necessities and not much else, the bathrooms and kitchen are all shared), she doesn't know I've seen her do any of this, and has likely been on meth for years, though for how *many* years I can't really say. She used to be hooked on the stuff when I was a little kid. I'm not sure if moving back to the same state where she first began to abuse it was a trigger for her to start again or if she's been using for even longer than that.

I'm **quite a bit** upset over this. I'm both deeply worried for her health and very irritated because we're already struggling to get by as it is and I know that stuff can't be cheap. Not too long ago, she fell asleep while driving and I was in the passenger's seat, which caused her to total the car. I was fine (physically, from what I could tell) but she suffered a broken nose and *fuck* knows what else since she refused to go to the hospital.

I can't be completely sure about the validity of what I'm about to say, but I think I'm starting to experience some kind of ""secondhand"" effects. When she first started smoking next to me (the only places in the room she can sit down are either our bed or a comforter chair two feet to my right, where she normally smokes it), the sound of her lighter flicking on and off would wake me up but I was always able to fall back asleep within a minute or so. Thing is, now whenever her smoking wakes me up, I'm starting to feel little rush of energy and have difficulties going back to sleep. This could also be a psychological effect, but I find it a little odd that I'm only starting to feel that rush *now* rather than when I first saw her.

I'm a 22-year-old girl on the autism spectrum (along with other mental problems, both psychological and neurological). I have not been able to land or keep a job to support myself, the only friends I have are *dirt* poor, and what other family members I have (who've likely suspected she's been using for longer than I have, as they've all distanced themselves from her for a good while now) are either in far-off states, do not have the room to house me, or would be detrimental to my mental health to live under the same roof with, so I'm pretty dependent on her and cannot just leave.

**Any** advise as to what I should do would be greatly appreciated. I'll likely confront her about it at some point, but I'm not sure what will come of it. I doubt she'd just quit on the spot (or not *effectively* anyways) if she agrees to stop the meth abuse, considering how long she's been using, and I have a pretty good feeling that the vast majority of her friends also use it. I don't even know if she'll at least stop smoking it in the same room as me, due to the lack of places where she can smoke it without raising suspicion or risking a high chance of being seen.

We've been living in **shitty** homes in **shitty** places and surrounded by **shitty** people for **years** and **years** now, all because of that fucking drug. I want it to stop. I want the *both of us* to live a ""normal"" life with a ""normal"" family. I love her, but this can't continue.",17Jan2019,1

Ignore grammatical errors because I ranted and went nuts typing this at full speed LOL 

Hi Reddit it’s taken me a long time to actually want to post this as to my own shyness and reluctance to address the problems. I no longer can take it anymore and need advice ANY advice from any stranger since the people in my day to day life cannot provide anything meaningful. (*INCOMING RANT so I’ll have a little summary at the end that’s shorter if you don’t feel like reading*)

dilemma: 

I have been with my girlfriend for 6 years. The first 4 I was at college so we didn’t see each other a lot but it was bliss at all times and I became madly in love with her. I was never the type of guy to commit to a girl but she changed that for me and I was forever hooked. The last 2 years however have been utter shit. We fight about stupid shit all the time and she blames on the fact that I make more money. I haven’t even moved out of my parent’s house yet or gotten a newer car (need one) and she still makes me spend money on shit. She’s a student and works 1 job part time. She has MORE money than me in the bank but refuses to pay for stuff as she doesn’t make as much money as me and I should have no problem covering some of these things. Everytime I bring these issues I have up she just turns and spins and churns and all of a sudden I am the one to blame and I am wrong. For her birthdays I get hotel rooms at casinos, buy a cake, and take her out for dinner. I don’t get anything close to that. She has a few years left of college but I just don’t know if I can keep going about it. I hate that our issues are about money cause I find it so stupid to argue about something like that but she leaves me no choice. Do I have to support everything until she graduates? What about my dreams? My goals and desires? My parents already care more about themselves than me and so it’s all up to me. I thought she was my partner in it all but now even she’s starting to make me feel like it’s all on my own. She uses the past as a weapon to justify things but now i’m just getting tired of it. How many times will I hear other girlfriends say to their boyfriend don’t worry babe I got it tonight but when I ask her it’s a puss face and change of attitude even if the night was amazing. Her parents also pay for her and all her shit she only covers credit card bills (she created the bill so it shouldn’t count) as her only expense. 

She tells me she wants the best for me and to get my life going but she’s purely and completely inhibiting that. Sometimes i wish I just took a job far away and started a new life without anyone. 


To sum up: girlfriend makes me spend money all the time, and won’t contribute or help without being upset. Debating on moving on and just thinking about myself but I love her too much.

My best friend just moved away for school, and he is who I spend the majority of my free time with. Me and my next closest friend just got in a big fight, and I don’t really want to restart that relationship. (Not because I’m angry, because it happens all the time and he just isn’t a very good friend or person anymore. I’m tired of putting in the work to keep that relationship up.)
  
This leaves me with no close friends and therefore nothing to do.   
  
I do have acquaintances and sort of distant friends at school, but as I said, I’m on break from school. 
  
Also they aren’t people I normally hang with outside of school, and due to the time and effort that my previous two friendships took up I’m not used to breaking through that gap. Haven’t done it really since grade school. (Another reason I have to move on, my friend was tying me down in his drama)
  

 Perhaps I can find something to do once school starts, but for now I’m totally restless and need to find something to do.
  
Video games and tv are done. I’ve played out all my video games and don’t have a show to watch right now. Plus I’m just to antsy and restless from sitting around all day.   
  
I find myself posting on social media just to wait for reactions, like something to do. I’ve also been chatting a bit with old friends on social media and snap, but they’re busy and also that just can only go so far...
  
My biggest problem is I’ve kept my circle small, and now it just got smaller. I  never imagined anything could happen to my closest relationships and did not foresee myself being left with nothing.

They wouldn't even put a note in the system because I'm not authorized to call about the mortgage. I have a restraining order on my ex, we have zero contact except when he calls the kids once a week, if I ask someone to have him call hell refuse to anyway. 
My house is clearly lived in, my dogs outside, lights on, trash at the road, footprints outside all the time, etc etc. But because they come while I am at work and no one answers the door they deem it vacant.

419,"Help me please... In need of advice desperately. I apologize it's long. 

I have been with my boyfriend for 6 months, I'm 30 and he is older. 

Well a week and half ago I broke up with him and I didn't talk to him for a for that whole week and half.. I was so hurt because I really care about him and I knew that I have to move on. I tried going on dating site to get over him but he was still stuck in my head and my heart hurt.  So many guys on the site wanted to meet me that night or next day and I couldn't do it because I thought it would be selfish of me to go on a date and still be thinking about him.. So I just would just chat with them to keep me company and was going to wait till I was healed and ready to date. So no matter how hard I tried to cover it up pain I still couldn't get over him..

Well yesterday I went to my ex work and surprised him and wanted to talk to him about us and giving it another shot.. So we kinda talked and he kissed and hugged me the whole couple hours while we were at the restaurant. He told me to come to his house after work.. 

Night comes and I come to his house and it's a mess and he told me he hasn't really been home since we broke up and I asked him why, he I just went out alone everyday. I thought that's how he kept busy so he wouldn't think of me. We talk some more about how we can make it work and talk about our future together and how to prevent us from breaking up. He told me he loves me and he wanted to marry me and have kids, I wanted to make love to him and he was acting kinda cold, saying I needed to sleep because I wake up early blah blah, mind you he never rejected sex...

 He kept bringing up a story about girl at his gym and I was explaining me things and I said why do u keep talking about her.. Well it turns out, he went on a date with her and he had sex with her that day couple days after we broke up. He told me he was drunk and apparently he asked her to be his bf, per the girl but he doesn't remember that.. 

OMG y all I felt like I got punched in the stomach! That hurt me so bad and i almost had sex with him.  Wow I was so shocked I didn't want him to touch me or kiss me. I was so disgusted! I started crying so hard and became so nauseated because of the pain I was feeling.. He started telling me it didn't mean anything he loves me and he only wants to be with me.. I told him shows how you care and love me by moving on so fast! Here I couldn't even go on a date because I couldn't get over him and my heart hurt and this asshole moved on the second he got a chance. He didn't like that I was crying and kept comforting me hugging, kissing and kept apologizing and kept saying lies after lies just so I could stay. 

He told me we weren't together and he could do whatever and I told him I get that it's just the fact you moved on so quickly. He told me to give him a chance and he can prove to me that he loves me and told me that chic is crazy he told her to leave him alone because she had a crazy ex husband who would chase away all the guys she would see. But I couldn't help how I feel I just kept crying and then I thought it makes sense he hung out with her this whole time that's why he hasn't been home! 

I was supposed to spend the night at his place but I couldn't even see him, all I kept thinking was him having sex with this girl! I packed my stuff and ran. He told me he was going to plan a romantic date for me Sunday. I told him let me cool down because right now I'm really hurt.. 

Here is where I need help.. 
What am I supposed to do now? Obviously he didn't care about me or loved me right? Since he moved on that quickly.  I don't know how I will get over this.. Should I just move on completely? Is this my sign to run because I don't know if I could take him back without thinking about them.  What are your thoughts on this?  Am I making a big deal out of it because we weren't together he could do whatever? Please help me. I'm ignoring him now and thinking about blocking him completely and taking him out of my life but not sure",17Jan2019,1

421,"hi everyone. I was looking for advice on what to do. First off let me say a lot  of this is not her fault and her past is her past. Every so often I think about her Past boyfriends or her friends with benefits and it makes me really sad. The only thing that was her fault was she was WAY TO OPEN with her past relationships that were shit. For example she was going to show me her Hicks on her thighs from a past sexual partner and we just got done having sex.This has been a continuous problem for me. I told her that was really uncomfortable for me. Besides that all of this is my battle for myself. Her past boyfriends didn’t care because they were just there for the quick ride, but I love her and I really didn’t want to hear that shit. On top of this I was lurking on her phone and found an old msg feed with her past friend with benefits so that shit hit me hard. It was my fault but it feels like stuff she’s told me about us doesn’t fit anymore. For example she’s told me that when we first hung out she got feelings for me so I held this really high because it made me happy, but when I was lurking and seen the msg to the FWB it was a day after we hang for the first time. So now I feel like she was lying about having feelings the first hangout or there wasn’t a lot there. I’ve talked to her about it but she can’t really do anything about it. So I try and not burden her with it. Also she is my first gf and the one I lost my v card to. There a lot more I feel but this is the bare bones of it. Like I said this is my battle of accepting it not changing it. I would just like to know how to fight it because I love her and she loves me. Any advice would be very helpful. ",17Jan2019,1
422,"So I've always thought this lady was a little odd, but it never occurred to me to ever say something to anyone. But I've been listening to a new podcast called Broken Harts, about a family who committed murder suicide by driving their car off a cliff with their six children inside. They've basically concluded that the family dodged CPS so many times because neighbors and friends ""never wanted to pry or be nosy"" and thus didn't see years of telling signs.

So, onto my neighbor. I've always gotten a weird feeling from this woman. She's no younger than 50, maybe 55? Always has this really sour or exhausted look on her face. Usually looks disheveled, messy hair, raggy clothes, etc.  I mention her looks because I live in a big apartment complex, and while I don't know ANY of my other neighbors, I know her because she is _constantly_ walking. Just walking around the complex. And she walks in this insane way -- like she is FORCING her body to do it. Never have I seen such a pathetic, odd shuffle. Like a teenager who just got out of bed and his coming down the steps. She's maybe slightly overweight, but not obese by any means.

The weird thing: about half the time she's walking, she's pushing a child in a little pink stroller. A little girl, like 3/4? Just silently, miserably. She occasionally walks with the kid too, and the kid is on a _fucking leash_. 

The leash is the part where I first thought, okay that's weird. So basically, it could be a few circumstances: 1. She's an older mom, maybe younger than she looks, just exhausted from her small child. 2. She's a grandmother, maybe sick and tired of watching the kid? 3. She kidnapped this kid fam.

Should I actually call someone? I have literally no other reason to believe it's something sinister, and in fact, it probably isn't. But still! Feels weird. ",17Jan2019,1
423,I have been a pharmacy technician for about four years now. I have always been curious about working in a hospital environment as I have always worked retail. I recently took about a 4-month break from the pharmacy world and am now looking to get back into it. I have a friend that has offered to get me into a hospital as a pharmacy technician. Something that I have never done it everything would be brand new to me . I also have the chance to work in a call center environment where I know the system and am familiar with the inner workings. The call center is less than a half a mile from my home. The hospital would be about a 30 minute commute daily. The hospital job would pay about a dollar fifty to $2 more an hour.

I'm an asshole and a liar.

I lied to my GP years ago about having seizures.
I was young and hated my job and I wanted time off without them badgering me but also a way I could abuse it whenever I liked.

She sent me to a neurologist who then gave me an MRI and an EEG.
She found nothing wrong but decided to put me on medication for it just in case (which I did think was weird, but whatever).

Anyway, I was a lying piece of shit who was unhappy and wanted an excuse to get out of stuff. 
I hate myself for it and cant believe I lied for so long, but the last 10 months or so I have tried to turn my life around and I am now happier than I have ever been.

I want to try and make amends to what I have done and want to help people, so I want to enlist in the police or perhaps the army.

However, you can't get in if you have epilepsy...

So, I wanted advice in regards to having it removed from medical my history.
Is this possible and how would I go about doing it?

I have an appointment with my GP to discuss it but the earliest they can do is in 4 weeks - Love and hate the NHS!

I know I am an asshole and there are people out there who suffer with epilepsy everyday. I regret it so badly and wish I could take it all back.
I donate to a couple of epilepsy charities every month to try and make me feel a bit better about it all (Not that it does mind you).

First, I lived in Spain for a year and a half, then to Vietnam, then to Norway and now I'm in Sweden (age 23). I met an amazing Swedish man in Vietnam and he has become my forever home so Sweden it is! Before, I was just 'travelling' so although I was away from England for a long time, my address was still there and it was still my country of residence. 
So far I have got a personal number from Skatteverket and I have attempted to sign up with Arbetsförmedlingen but there was a mistake so this process is now starting again.
It would be really useful to know what I need to do in England. 
Do I need to tell anyone that I have moved abroad? Do I need to change my address to my Swedish one in England? 
Should I close my HSBC account and open an account with someone else or close it completely or is it better to keep it open for my visits to England? 
Maybe someone could suggest a good international bank here in Sweden.
I read on the news about swapping my drivers licence because of Brexit. Should I try for an international licence or get a Swedish one?
Should I pay NI? I haven't paid this since my last job in England which was a temp job after Spain to save money for Vietnam. I worked there for about 3 months. Someone told me that paying NI will ensure that I can still have access to the NHS (maybe useful if I get a deadly illness as I would rather receive care in England where my family is?)
What about insurance in Sweden? Should I have any? Which companies are best? 
Due to my erratic movements around the world I don't have anything in the way of a pension. Should I be thinking about this now? Do I need a private one?

434,"Hello dear Reddit. I have been lurking in this sub for a while. Mostly because advice is cool. 

But today, I have questions. Man.... I'm very conflicted. 

Up until a couple of years ago my mother was one of the hardest working people I knew. She's known she has had a chronic illness since I was little but that never stopped her from working full time. 

It's starting to but that is not the thing I fault her for.  We are currently living with my grandparents while I go to school and she tries to get on disability. 

The thing is she has never had a healthy relationship with both soda (yeah... Soda. Not the worst thing but still) or money. I need to address both of these for my post to make sense. 

The soda used to be no big deal, I mean it was her choice, you know? I didn't care but I was also a kid. It started bothering me because she seems to have started relying on it like alcoholics rely on beer. I mean she could go through a case in a couple of days if she wanted to. 

And she knows of no sort of portion control or...any sort of control she just eats whatever whenever. It's the same with her cookies. She can eat a pack of chips ahoy in one night. 

I feel like I shouldn't say anything to this because I drink soda and eat junk food too. The difference is I normally maintain healthy eating habits and know my limits on both. Plus I actually eat other things throughout the day. She eats nothing all day and then binges while she stays up late doing whatever on the computer. 

It would also be different if it were her money she was using. But she hasn't had money in a few years. It's my grandparents money. I think we should be respectful of using other people's resources, and only go to the store when necessary. She will make solo trips (making me go in because she hurts all the time) just to get soda and cookies. And I should say no but dammit she is so stubborn and so unhealthy! This happens a few times per week. 

Seriously... I am just... Frustrated by this. I mentioned she has a chronic illness, which I won't go into detail on but I know none of these behaviors are making it any better. 

The frosting on the cake is that there is very little I can do. I'm disabled myself and the messes she makes is overwhelming. The crushed soda boxes...the mutual depression... I am overwhelmed. 

Is there anything I can realistically do here? I know she is in charge of her own life but I also do not want to end up like her. I never have. I want to be healthy and junk. 

And so we are clear, supporting her behavior is definitely enabling her, right?

436,"Obligatory backstory - So I've been in a weird spot for 2 years now, arguably since 2014 where I'm just not doing the right things. I'm 24 now and I'm a (community) college drop out, I've been unemployed for over a year and I never learned to drive. I've either given up on all things that make a human a human or I just never started them. I haven't had a girlfriend since my second year of high school and I've only had one genuine friend in my whole life that I ghosted because I don't think I deserve to be around people, like I'm just wasting their time. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now that the backstory is out of the way, I had to say those things so you guys have a little more to work with when/if anyone actually responds to this. I've had a few therapists, all female, and I've been in and out of the doctors for various mental-things although for the past 6 months or so all of my visits have been obligatory ""is he dead yet"" check ups. I say that because they were originally set up so I go in every week or every 2 weeks (after I left my therapist) so I'd just go see my doctor instead (???) but as a test I told her (oh yeah, also my doctor is a woman, not sure where all the guys are at?) But I told her one visit that ""I felt okay today, maybe even a little happy"" and she was like ""great"" then got up and left. My next appointment was 2 months later and the schedulings stayed like that from then on.

I've never seen the movie but I'd imagine I'm like that guy with the volleyball in Cast Away or like that kid from the book Hatchet. When you don't interact with people for a few months let alone 2-5 years, you drift. A lot. I've been trying to pull myself back in but I'm not getting the help I need and I need something, man. So I asked my doctor to do something different to help me and she said she'd ""Look into finding me a life coach"" but what does that even mean? Am I just beyond repair? I've talked to so many people in a chair with a notepad and had nothing change that I don't even think I'm salvageable at this point. What do I do?  ",17Jan2019,1

441,"I'm a first-year graduate student in a humanities field, holding a GA position and completing Air Force ROTC at the same time. If all goes well, I'll commission as an Air Force officer and earn my master's degree, two of my biggest goals in life.

However, my serious boyfriend of 2.5 years (we went to the same college for undergrad and met on study abroad) moved to another state for his PhD in August 2018. He's very serious about pursuing research, as it's his passion. He is wicked smart, loving, trustworthy, and we have agreed to marry and want to have children years down the line. During any school breaks (Christmas, spring vacation, summer) I fly to visit him, since he is tied to year-round research work and can't leave his state often.

The distance in our relationship (12 hours by car) hurts me a lot. School, ROTC, and my job generally distract me and keep me busy, but I sometimes break down crying at night, feelings of intense grief and helplessness taking over. In those moments, I'm willing to give anything to be in the same state as him. I've been contemplating dropping ROTC (I will incur a 4-year service commitment upon commissioning, which might mean more time before we're in the same place). But I worry that I'll regret throwing my hard work in the trash.

We've discussed working to bring ourselves together, either by me requesting a base close to his state or him finding work close to me (once we're done with school/ROTC), but nothing is guaranteed. The distance hurts him, too, but not to the extent that it does for me. And we both know that our career goals are the single factor keeping us apart.

I don't know what to do and would like some advice other than my own inner thoughts.

442,"Throwaway, for obvious reasons, and apologies in advance for the novel (TL;DR at bottom).

This post is 50% rant and 50% asking for advice. I'm getting married this year. Since starting the planning process, my mother has been VERY straightforward about her desire to be involved in SOMETHING. As the mother of the bride, of course she’ll be honored/involved, but… she keeps throwing ideas out that I really don’t want to entertain (sometimes as a joke/half-joke, other times as a serious suggestion).

A little background about my mom for context: She’s a little… out there. She’s a recovering former member of a doomsday cult, is into crystals/homeopathics/ The Secret/ etc., and she literally does not get out often, so her social skills aren't the best. I love her to death, and don’t want to disrespect her in any way. But in recent years, she’s really lost her grasp on how to interact with others (i.e. can’t tell when someone doesn’t want to be conversational with her), her sense of humor is bizarre, and in general, people don’t like to be around her because she’s “weird” and doesn’t know when the conversation is over.

Keeping that in mind, here are a couple examples of her trying to insert herself into this process (thus far): 

1) My fiancé and I decided to book a night at a venue we were considering. Initially, he thought he was going to have to bail on this date because of work. I mentioned off-hand to my mother that there was a chance I’d be going alone (not really complaining or anything), and she immediately invited herself to go in his place. “Just in case he can’t come and you want company!” I DIDN’T want her to go, and I told her “thanks but no thanks,” but even after we confirmed that he’d be able to come, she STILL took off a day of work “just in case.”

2) Recently, she asked if she would be permitted to say/read something at the ceremony. I told her no, that the ceremony was going to be very brief, and that the only “extra” thing we wanted to do was to read our own vows. She was immediately upset about it (she didn’t say anything, but I could tell). I offered her the opportunity to make a toast at the reception instead, but she didn’t seem happy with it. I have no clue what she was hoping to read, but again, she sometimes doesn’t realize certain things are inappropriate for certain circumstances, and I was worried she’d say something uncomfortable during the ceremony itself.

3) When it came up that my dad (her ex) would traditionally be walking me down the aisle, she asked if she could also walk with me, and followed this by saying, “Well, I support this marriage more than your dad does, so shouldn’t I be walking you down the aisle?” which I thought was pretty hurtful. 

4) She asked if there could be a mother/daughter dance in addition to the father/daughter dance, which I told her no (that would be weird/awkward for everyone involved, and because my fiancé’s father is no longer with us and he doesn’t want to dance with his mother, it seems inappropriate anyway). 

5) On top of all this, she repeatedly makes jokes about coming on our honeymoon with us; she’s brought it up at least ten times (because, you know, a joke is funnier the more you repeat it, apparently). And while I KNOW it’s a joke, I also wouldn’t put it past her to ACTUALLY try something like that.

I know it’s our wedding, not hers, so I’m not asking whether I should entertain any of her wishes here. I just need advice on how to deal with her requests in general. I’d like to be able to say I was letting her desires roll off my back and not stressing about it, but I also know that if her feelings are hurt or she feels left out in any way, she’ll guilt trip me forever (again, not trying to bend over backwards for her, just need to figure out how to not hurt her feelings).

TL;DR How can I set clear boundaries with my socially-inept mother and let her know what she can/can’t do during our wedding without offending her?",17Jan2019,1

444,"So here's how it has gone, I met the dude when I was a part of the community of a certain game, he was a pretty chill dude so we started chatting more often. Around 4 months ago he admitted to having a ""girlfriend"" which as he said was 14 years old and he admitted to having sexual intercourse with her (He is 18, the age of consent in germany is 14 so I didn't really care at the time). But then, also a few months later he also admitted that he had sex with her when she was 12 and he was 16. At this point I probably should have started doing something about it but he was a close friend and I really couldn't bring myself to do it. But then he actually told me that he took the virginity of an 11 year old. 11 fucking year old girl and it was literally when he was 18. He already had been reported by the parents of his ""girlfriend"" and he can't come anywhere near her. But then again, the police didn't knew that the relationship was going on for 2 years and that he also had sex with an 11 year old. What should I do? I have messages proving this and I can get more of them if necessary.

445,"Looking for some relocation advise. 

I'm Irish, late 20's, project manager in a tech company and I'm looking to make a move to a new place. My company won't facilitate me to work remotely so I'm looking to make a move and find work locally.

What I really need some direction and advice on is picking a suitable location to move to. 

I'm toying with the idea of Australia (Melbourne/Sydney) or Doha, as there sufficient work opportunities that are quite well paid there, and the climate sounds good, aside from 2-3 hot months a year. 

Can you share your insight on where you would recommend a move to. I have some desired criteria which I would like to hit all of the points. 

1. Good climate year round (ie around 70°F/ 20°C, no snow, not much rain)

2. Tech industry opportunities (specifically project/program manager)

3. Not a crazy cost of living (I would like to avoid the rent prices of SF)

4. Visa accessibility (I'm Irish, so Europe is an option, as well as a relatively straightforward process for Australia).

5. Young population (places with a substantial population aged 20-40)

6. Reasonably number of public and vacation days (ie... Ireland has 4 weeks mandatory vacation).

451,"We're a couple (25F + 26M) who are both at points of transition in our careers. I'm working on developing my skills and moving up in my field while hitting a ""jumping point"" for remote work (I do international digital marketing/communication + web development) while he has just transitioned from active duty in the US Navy. As a super driven person myself, I also very much value his drive to do what he wants to do post-military and I don't want us to feel like one person's dreams are being valued more than the other person's. 

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, I've always wanted to move out of my home country (USA) as in since I was a really little kid. He's heard me talk about it for the years we've been together and knows I'm super serious about it. I know (in a rough/casual sense) 3 foreign languages. However, I do think that he's a little apprehensive about his ability to achieve his own goal(s) if he's being moved around various countries/continents where he may not speak the language. That is totally valid, and my first thought is for us to maybe have a ""home base"" where he can teach while I can go do my thing solo as needed. (In that case we'd be paying 2 rents/home payments.)

&amp;#x200B;

The problem with this is we don't really have the money right now to go buy/rent a place in an English-speaking country so he can start working on being certified as a teacher there. We may in the next several years, but for now we need to stick to one monthly payment for rent/housing. It's very possible that my first location assignment from my current company (in my negotiations about remote work) would be Germany. 

I'm guessing he could definitely find a way to get teaching experience in some capacity where we are, but would that ""count"" whenever we eventually have a home base? Do countries' public schooling systems (public as in government sponsored vs. independent, I know some have different terms) value teaching experience in other countries when recruiting new teachers? (Side note, he has a BS in Aerospace Engineering from the US Naval Academy so bachelor's degree requirement is already fulfilled if needed)

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure if this would be a good question to ask a teacher-related sub, but may as well start here. I think he would actually really like this new ""adventure"" we may do quite soon, but he'd need to be doing something engaging with his time and talent.

Last night, I accidentally left the front door open just a crack while I was gathering and taking out the garbage. It was probably open for half an hour. I didn’t think much of it at the time (like an idiot) because the cats have never ventured through an open door before, at least that I’ve seen. 

I cannot find them at all this morning. I looked everywhere in this house, and although I’m still hoping they’re hiding somewhere I hadn’t thought of or couldn’t get to, it seems unlikely. 

I’ve googled how to get lost cats back home, and have taken those steps (set out food, large carrier with a blanket they like, and litter box), but I don’t have their vet info, so I can’t call the vet and see if they’re microchipped. 

So, do I wait until tonight to ask her for the vet info and tell her what’s going on? I only just discovered they’re gone about an hour ago. Should I wait and see if I can find them? I don’t want them out in the semi-cold; they’re not used to it. 

Do I call her or text? How do I say it? I feel absolutely horrible and I’m so worried for the cats, and I want to express how terrible I feel but it’s not about me.

460,"I've had enough of this lazy cunt that my girlfriend lives with.

She's from the country but comes into the city to stay in their shared university student house whenever she has class. My girlfriend is also from the country and whenever she's in town I stay with her in her house, so 4-5 days a week.

Her roommate doesn't have any regard for the house, or my girlfriend, at all. She treats the house as a hotel, using toilet paper and never replacing it, making messes my girlfriend feels obliged to clean up (as me and her don't like to live in filth), blocking the toilet/kitchen sink and doing nothing about it, using all the dishes and not washing any, and because my girlfriend is the named tenant on all the bills (because her roommate was too lazy to sort anything out herself) she frequently takes the opportunity to claim that she has no money and avoid paying my girlfriend for as long as possible.

The roommate is a diagnosed alcoholic. She drinks until she blacks out at least once a week, sometimes as much as four times a week and that's only when she's in the city, and every time she drinks there's a massive mess in the house and she wets her bed. When she comes home, she starts screaming arguments with anyone she meets, smashes dishes and beats on doors to wake people up. Not to mention she drags people in from the street to sleep with.

I've had enough of my girlfriend (and by extension, me) being subjected to this because she's never stood up to. I keep coaxing my gf to talk to her about how she gets on but after so many arguments over this in the past she doesn't care and just wants a smooth road until the end of the tenancy, when she get rid of the roommate for good.

464,"Hi, so I work at a cafe as a server/barista. I make drinks, serve customers, bus tables, wash dishes, etc (basically a bunch of jobs in one). All of the other servers do this as well.

My boss, the owner/manager, was at first very....eccentric, if you want to put it that way lol. During my interview, he had pulled me aside at the front of the place and was talking shit about one of the other employees that is still currently working there. He also is very loud and doesn't have the cleanest mouth, so while he was talking about her + other past employees, he was loudly using the word ""bitch"" and ""cunt"" to describe them.

Ok, I just thought he was crazy but in a weird/odd/funny way so I didn't really think much of it. Fast forward to me training and trying to learn everything -- the store is a mess, almost every time I come in theres something broken, and the system we use doesn't really make sense to me either. It's good to preface that this is my second job ever, but I worked as a server in my first job so I have experience with having some sort of system and having a few weird kinks with it as well. Anyways, it takes me about a month/month and a half to completely learn this system that barely makes sense, as well as following regular protocol with other things such as side work and cleaning and all that. 

So to put in context, I've only been working here since August. During that first month ish of me learning stuff, I was obviously making mistakes. After one time of me calling him for help with a transaction and him yelling at me the whole time, asking me what happened even though I had told him and then the resulting transaction losing him $1, I really don't think he has liked me. 
Ever since then, he has started scheduling me less (and if I ask for more hours, he will tell me he gives them to employees who earn them) and not only that, only scheduling me for closing (which is for employees he doesn't like, which he has stated to me before).

Idk, this whole thing has given me a lot of anxiety and self doubt -- I know I work my ass off there, so it's really frustrating that the few times I make a mistake it really fucks me over for forever, it seems. And the boss is a complete dick about it.

If you need more context or even wanna hear some more crazy stories, just let me know please!

(p.s., idk if i should mention but not only does he do this shit, but my aunt just got diagnosed with terminal cancer and i told him i need more hours to help w money and he only schedules me twice a week 🤠 amazing)

466,"Some back story before we begin. So my ex took some time last summer and went to Arizona to visit ""family."" She came back and broke up with me without an explanation until I recognized a smile I used to get over books I wrote her through text and went through her phone. The first thing I saw was all I needed, an ""i love you"" from her to him with no reply right when she went to sleep. At this point in time she had told me I didnt need to sleep on the couch so we were still in the same bed sleeping beside one another while our son (about 5mo?) slept in the cradle in the same room and her little girl of less than 2, who still calls me dada even apart, slept in the other room. Two bedroom apts are hard. After I found out everything seemed to settle and she left the apt within the week and took everything that wasnt nailed down and charging me for the couches ($400) so I had somewhere to sit. The bed and frame, my mother bought so she left that but took the only sheets we bought together. She took the toaster and the vacuum, all the kids clothes, and left me with a second hand crib so I could see my son. 
Since then our fights have been about time with him. She now lives with this other man in another city and refused to give me an address. So I refused to pay for half a babysitter I dont even use if I dont know the address my son sleeps at night. So she took my nights with my son away. This caused a huge fight which I'll get to. I now get my son Monday, Thursday,  Friday whenever she has her mother drop him off between 9 and 11 and keep him till 5ish (very general because it's fairly accurate to the times I get him). On to the fight. I dont remember the day, i dont remember the time, I just know we were fighting already before it happened and I was pissed because the plan changed at the last minute and she was threatening me with lessening my time with him even more if I didnt drop him off. So I went to drop him off at grandmas house. All fine and good. I tell her mother what I've already told my ex which is that I will not be cohersed(?) Into this dropping him off and losing time with him because she wants to leave work early or something to that effect. It all kinda turns into a blur after that. She calls me all mad, I reply in kind, she keep interrupting which is a peeve, I keep interrupting, she hangs up. I call her back, voice mail. I try again. I leave one text for her, ""If you do not answer the next time I call you I'm headed back there."" Wait ~30 seconds because I know shes a strong reader and it's plenty of time. I call back. No answer. Turn around in closest parking lot, head back. This is where it makes my stomach boil to even think about it. I come in, it's her parents place, people who I love even if their daughters are fucked up. So I am cordial and ask her to speak and refuse to let her leave until we do so. She tries to push past me and I dont move from the doorway. Let me put it to you this way, 6'5"" of 300lbs retired army standing in a doorway unmoving for a woman 5'4ish and 200lbs at most. I'm not moving. She loops through the house and goes out the garage with me calling after her ""Keep running away, you're only hurting your parents and your kids!"" And I turn back out the front door. Since then they've tried to work very hard for the little girl to call me by my first name. We proceed outside and I'm so mad at this point that I'm laying into her and I cant quite remember what was said. She puts our son in the car and I let her get in the car without any hindrance other than trying to get her to say something. Shes fully in the car and I ask her ""Why are you doing this?"" Or something to that effect and she replies ""You! This!"" And indicates me and how I'm pissed because the address is withheld from me. 50 miles/53min drive in another city without knowing where my son sleeps at night. She goes to slam the door in my face and that's when I really snap. I step forward from the rear of her vehicle (Dodge Journey) and stop the door from closing. She gives me this look where I know if she actually carried her CCW I probably would have been drawn upon. I literally had my CCW in my back pocket at the nine mind you and I never realized until we were done. I tell her after she fixates me with this glare and flops in her seat with crossed arms like a scolded child, ""No! You are not running from this! You refuse to get it through your head this is WRONG. I don't even know WHERE MY SON SLEEPS AT NIGHT. And you refuse to tell me and make any excuses you can to not tell me JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN! 150 miles? What a pile of shit! Nowhere is it in the law where it states that I have equal parental rights does it say you can refuse an address as long as you're within 150miles!"" ""Yes it does!"" ""SHOW ME! YOU KEEP SAYING ALL THESE THINGS ABOUT THE LAWS THAT I CANT FIND! SO SHOW ME!"" When she had let go of the door I had done the same. When she had said this I got a feeling in the back of my neck which is a very bad feeling for me to have because the next thing that's going to happen is I'm going to black out because I'm too angry so I let it die screaming after her when she drove off ""You're a coward and can only act childish.  You hear me? CHILDISH"". This feeling in my neck has only ever happened once back in high school and it ended up in a fist fight. I apologized to her father shaking from the adrenaline in my system because I had brought our problems into their house after sitting for a moment and calming down and then I left. That Friday was my next day with him. She lied and told me she wasn't in town so I couldn't have him. She worked in town. ""I'm not going to work today"" she did go to work I found out later. She had him with him. Before she went to work though she went and filed for custody. She went the same day I did. She went in the morning and filed and completed and I went in the afternoon and got paperwork but couldn't fill it out because I was just too angry that I didn't get to see him that day and she had him from me in another city so I couldn't even go get him for the day. I filed the following Monday after I got him and was stable with him coming with me for the 3ish hours I was there. Since then the county sheriff's department has ""attempted to serve me three times"" without coming to my door. Which is my understanding that the papers HAVE to be served in person. We both have active paperwork, she has attempted service, I have not. So my questions follow:
Am I a bad person, parent, or father and why?
What's my next course of action? 
How am I supposed to be stable and support my son, myself and a newly opened store when I can't even see him or  know what's going on?

473,"So a few years ago I moved in with my friend and their ex (large home, separate spaces). With their blessing the ex (Z) and I got involved, and long story short I soon found out how toxic and manipulative they were. Z was not happy I broke it off with them and immediately took to poisoning my relationship with my friend (as manipulative people do).

  My friend believed Z and I now avoid them both entirely. I have no desire to have either of them in my life anymore due to the drama and level of codependency. 

  

   It has been relatively peaceful and easy to avoid them. The place we have is very large and within walking distance to my gym, work and hobbies. The deck is also equipped with a doggy door so my pooch can come and go as he pleases (as I work long shifts in sales). Also very cheap rent with a lease (9 months left for this year, I can break it*)

She's always showed some signs of having abusive tendencies, past relationships that went poorly, building my ego at home just to embarrass me (jokingly) in front of her friends, getting physically aggressive when she's angry, etc. But lately its gotten worse.
She's isolated me from all the friends i have that she doesn't like, she constantly tells me that I'm the one exception to her being a lesbian (Im a trans male so thats kind of a big oof), and makes fun of me constantly regardless of how I'm feeling. 
She likes to grab my hand and bite it for as long as she can and as hard as she can without breaking skin. No matter how many times I tell her ""stop, that hurts, i dont want you to do that"" she just laughs at me and brushes it off.
I'm almost positive that this relationship is going to turn physically and emotionally abusive sooner or later and i want to break up but i'm too scared of the fall out, and of being gaslighted if i try, like i was in my last relationship.
The worst part is, since ive stopped talking to all my other friends I only really hang out with her friend group and my whole family loves her, meaning if we broke up then i wouldnt have anyone.
Plus she's super possessive and easily angered, hence the isolation thing, which means she would probably take it horribly if i tried to break up with her.

After a couple days and it not getting better, I went to the ER to see if something more was wrong when they asked about my health insurance. Oh yeah! I should have that. It was just a couple days after it was supposed to kick in (Jan 1) but I hadn’t gotten a card yet, so I told them I’d give them my insurance info later. 
I went to HR 2 days later when I returned to work and asked about my health insurance info (visibly injured). HR lady said that she would check and to ask her the next day. My boss and I come back the next day and ask again. She said yes, that I have insurance and that id signed up for the same plan as her, so I asked for the paperwork so I could give the ER my info and because I was referred to a specialist afterward for a herniated disc and would need an MRI - all of which they said I’d need my insurance for or I’d paying astronomical amounts out of Pocket. (I make $11/hr at work. I literally cannot pay $400 up front per dr visit.  Besides, I’ve spent everything on the medicines prescribed that I had to get without it. That’s why I signed up for insurance in the first place.) 
She gives me a packet and the next day and I read over the packet to get my member information - which is inconveniently nowhere to be found. In fact, nothing linking the plan to me was there at all. This was the packet she never gave us in the beginning. Ugh. I called the insurance company only to find out that they do not have me as a member at all. The insurance rep was super nice though and told me it was a easy fix. She gave me her personal line and told me to pass it to HR and they’d fix me right up. I’m annoyed, because it’s been weeks waiting to get my insurance info and the whole time I am in severe pain, can barely stand, walk or sit, or lay. Including sleep. To say it sucks is an understatement. In fact it’s thrown me into a severe bout of depression with anxiety that I’ve never had and the pain is progressively worse every day. I’m struggling just to function the least bit. 
Anyway. There is an end in sight. Woo hoo - almost. It’s been 3 days since I informed HR that I did not, in fact, have health insurance and I’ve been checking with them frequently - only to be told they still have no information but they are trying to get it fixed. 

I need help reddit. I’m literally crawling around my home to get ready to go to this job to pay my insurance premiums - that I haven’t even been able to access. Having to jump through all these hoops while feeling the worst I’ve ever felt is taking a toll on me emotionally and physically. What can I do?! ",17Jan2019,1
476,This is a stupid problem and I'm sure I'm just being anxious. They sent me emails about back round checks and direct deposits which I filled and it's says my first day is this Monday the 21st but it didn't give me a time just a date. I have my supervisor phone number and email should I ask him or wait until they contact me they do operate on Saturdays. ,17Jan2019,1
477,"So I don’t want to get into too much detail as it’s not for me to share too much about it, my best friend is like a brother to me, I love him dearly and we are very close friends. His partner and mother to his new child turning one in April, she suffers from mental health problems much like myself. The last few days have been really tough for my friend as his partner has recently attempted suicide and is saying as soon as she’s alone she will try again, she has a crisis team coming out every day to her for support. He’s in a really horrible situation and I’ve had a similar situation myself. I have reached out to him and let him know I’m here if he wants to talk, however I know, as I do it myself, that that’s a lovely gesture but sometimes it’s too difficult to reach out and actually accept the offer. I have considered popping round, partially uninvited and calling him when I’m a few minutes away to make him aware I’m on my way and that I’m coming round to have a chat and show support. When I have my bad days, as I’m also pretty low most the time, this is something that I would find helpful. Support from a friend without asking for it to me would me a whole world of difference than actually reaching out first. 

Although this is something I would find helpful, is it a good idea? Another friend of mine has said I should just turn up and he’d appreciate it, but I’m terrible for over thinking and as much as I want to go and give him a hug and support him and his partner I also don’t want to intrude. I love them dearly and want to be the best friend I can be during this difficult time, but I don’t want to make anything worse or uncomfortable for them. 

What should I do to support him, I feel so useless at the moment and it’s now starting to get me feeling down by knowing he is struggling. It breaks my heart. 

All advice is welcome! ",17Jan2019,1

480,"I realized this one day on Reddit. I’m not part of many subs so I wanted to look at a few more that were about some of my interests. But when I went to find new subs I realized I didn’t even know my interests. I can not think of anything I like. 

This got me thinking and I realized that I like plenty of stuff on the surface level (i.e. I like to watch a show if it’s fun but I never ever get interested in any lore or fan theories or branch off stories or anything). Everyone I know seems to have at least one or two things they really get into, but I don’t think I have anything, or at the very least don’t know what it is.

482,"I’m a 20 year old male from Australia. I finished high school at the end of 2016, had a gap year in 2017 and went to uni for the majority of 2018. I studied a double degree, law and psychology, and actually did quite well, with just above a 6.0 GPA overall. This will probably be a long post so I can understand if no one is interested in reading it all.

Ignore this paragraph if you like, it’s just a bit of background information. In high school I was considered a top student, but in my final year laziness and a tendency for procrastination settled in, which can probably be attributed to a sudden major loss in my life. Anyway, since then this laziness has consistently grown but not past the point that I can still perform. This is why I was surprised at my success at university. Although, I do strongly believe that my best work comes while under pressure (i.e. finishing assignments at the last minute, sitting tests with little to no study beforehand).

I dropped out around halfway through my second semester of university due to family reasons, and moved back home (I had to move several hours away from my hometown for uni). Now, with the start of the university year looming, I’ve come to question my choice in study. I don’t believe I have the work ethic to successfully complete the rest of the law aspect of my degree, and I have lost interest in psychology despite the fact that I excelled particularly well in this area.

There are three main issues that I have:
- The costs of again relocating several hours from my hometown
- Setting my sights on an end goal career-wise, and sticking to it
- I want to be able to live comfortably with a well-paying career

The costs issue can be averted if I choose to stay in my hometown to study, although they offer a very limited number of options. The only one of these that I’d be interested in is primary teaching. In regard to my second issue, another reason why I am considering leaving law behind is because I still don’t have an exact idea of what career I want to pursue, and I don’t want to put all the effort into law if I’m going to lose interest in that too. So, I thought that I’d try outline my skills and interests so that I can possibly receive some careers advice.

I’ll start by saying that my best subject has always been English, and anything to do with writing. I seem to have a proficient overall grasp of language, having also succeeded in studies of some foreign languages in high school. I thoroughly enjoy writing, and used to read religiously before my aforementioned laziness set in. Overall I have succeeded in every subject I have ever studied. Other than English, my best subjects were usually the sciences (particularly biology). I was good at maths but I just cannot stand the thought of ever having to do it again, at least as a major component of a career. 

In terms of my interests, I predominantly play videogames and watch sports (NBA, soccer/football, Australian Rules Football) in my spare time. I like to involve myself in these communities, and enjoy voicing my opinions. I’ve often considered trying to take up streaming videogames, but am reluctant due to a fear of giving up lots of time for little return. Alternatively, I’ve considered pursuing a career in journalism  specialising in either videogames or sports. This is where my third issue comes into play. I’m not sure if this is a career that will pay well, and so I’ve been hastily exploring other options. It sounds a little weird and egotistical, but I’ve honestly just been randomly picking out courses such as paramedic science and medical science just for the reputation. I’d feel more comfortable telling people that I’m studying one of these rather than journalism. I don’t know.

It’s 6am right now, I haven’t slept out of stress. I’ve just gone back and read over this and it sounds ridiculous. I really just need some guidance on what to do with myself, is there some sort of specialist I can go and talk to about this sort of stuff?

Anyone, this is what I see as my options:

- Continue law with a lack of an end-goal and the possibility of failure
- Combine my skills and interests in a career of sports/videogame journalism
- Avoid the issue of relocation costs by staying in my hometown and studying to become a teacher
- Pursue some other career that has potential but I will still likely be skeptical about it

I think eventually that I will overcome the laziness that I’ve recurrently mentioned, I’m just going through some personal issues that will likely subside when I set some proper goals for myself.

489,"Hello everyone, I was recently going through some old photos on my phone of my high school years (I’m a sophomore in college) and just feeling really nostalgic for that period in my life. I had a wide variety of friends in different social groups, I was involved in a youth group and theatre and I stayed busy maintaining good grades taking challenging classes and going to work a couple days/week and was very happy living with my family at home. I don’t know if it’s just the carefree responsibility-less nature of being a high schooler but I feel like I was so much happier back then. After high school I moved out to a new state (Portland Oregon to be exact) and started living with my boyfriend (who I love immensely) and his family (who I also love greatly but there’s some tensions sometimes). I’m paying for college on my own and started at a community college and plan on transferring to a university next year. So I go to school basically all day 2 days a week and go to work the other 5. I usually only have a couple hours in the morning and a few hours in the evening for things unrelated to work or school. I have friends here that I’m very comfortable with but no one that I feel like a genuine connection where we always just have fun and do things and laugh a lot. I feel really socially deprived despite my efforts to look for potential friends at school and work. I feel exhausted from working so much but I don’t know if I could afford to take a day off work (especially because I’m really trying to move out of my boyfriend’s parents house in the distant future). Even if I did have a day off I wouldn’t know where to look for the friends/lifestyle I long for. I don’t know if it’s because work has really consumed my life or the fact that being in a serious relationship/living with my boyfriend has sort of tied me down from going out and doing new things but I’m super unhappy and unfulfilled. I miss having friends that I feel super giddy around and I miss the person I was in high school. I don’t know what options I have for making changes in my life and it’s really bumming me out. I just feel like this period in my life, being a twenty year old living in a new state in a happy relationship, is supposed to be transformative and exciting and fun but it’s mostly just routine and wishing for something different. I have never really used Reddit before, but I figured this community may have some good ideas for me.",17Jan2019,1

The title says it all really. I went to the doctors recently and while I think I'm chunky yet funky, she thinks I'm just chunky and so as a result I'm on a diet. I'll admit that I am on the larger side, currently weighing in at 13.7st/86.9kgs. I've actually put on 2 stone in the last year which is obviously a major problem. I'm determined to lose this weight.

I've started eating healthy, drinking more water and being more active (going for walks etc). The biggest issue I'm facing is that when I'm bored, my instinct is just to eat. I aren't even hungry yet my brain is telling me to eat. In all honesty it's probably one of the factors that brought me here in the first place.

492,"Hello, I’ve been battling depression for 5+ years, along with some anxiety and, as of two months ago, panic attacks. I have major self esteem issues and I feel like all my friends hate me, and that nobody in this universe wants me to be their friend or companion.

514,"I'm (m,23) black/mixed race and was born and raised in Germany, which as you might know is not that ethnically diverse (\~97% Caucasian) and to make things worse I grew up in a rural area where we were almost the only black people in town. As a child I was completely oblivious to race issues etc. so even though I knew that I looked different and occasionally got racist digs because of that, it didn't register to me since in my mind there wasn't much different about us. 

When I got into an academic prep school at 10 as the only black kid in the entire 1,200 students-school is when the racial bullying started. It was like they despised me because of my skin and they made sure I knew that everyday. I have probably heard any derogatory degrading thing you could possibly say to a black person and those years of bullying left a permanent toll on my mental health, which I'm still dealing with at 23 (among other issues). At 13 I learned I was gay, too, (what a lucky strike, I should try gambling) but luckily I could hide that until I moved out of that conservative hellhole of a state.

In recent years I educated myself a lot about race &amp; society in depth and even though that's a good thing, there's a huge downside.

Did those teachers subconsciously grade me down in oral grades, because their implicit bias doesn't see a straight A student in a black kid? Am I just imagining things or was I right?

She would buy her own ticket, but likely won't be able to afford another for a friend or her father or I to come along, and we can't afford to pay our own way. That means that if this concert truly does come to fruition, she'll be attending on her own.

Parents, is this safe? Is it generally a good idea for young women to go to these sort of events alone? I realize that if she does decide to go, I won't be able to stop her, being that she's of legal age and I technically can't control her in that way. She doesn't have her own transportation, but the way she's got her grandparents wrapped around her finger, I know they'd be willing to drive her. My daughter has Asperger's, is quite naive for her age, has never tasted a sip of alcohol, nor has the desire to, so I'm not at all worried about HER behavior at the concert, but more or less the antics of those around her. She's fairly petite and not at all physically strong, so if the worst possible scenario were to happen, I know she wouldn't be able to protect herself.

He's the only person she's ever cared to see in concert, and so, while I don't want to stop her from going, I'm also a bit concerned for her safety in such an environment, especially considering, as I mentioned, she isn't exactly an adult yet in terms of maturity and life experience.

I haven't been to a concert in decades. Are women frequently harassed at such events these days? Do you think she'll be okay, or should my husband and I put a little more effort into purchasing a ticket to go along with her?

When I was at checkout I realized that it was fourty dollars extra (it came with benefits like if my phone gets totaled I get a check to help pay for a new phone). Well a couple days in and I notice a speck of dust on the screen, it's under it. I want to take the protector off and clean the screen but I don't want to risk breaking it. ",17Jan2019,1
518,"So me and this guy have been befriending each other for about 2 months now. We just meet up at night and go around town while drinking.

First time we met and hung out was a random encounter, so nobody asked. Second and third time was proposed by me. Fourth time we hung out (2 weeks ago) it was random again.

Anyways, so my 18th bd is right around the corner and since we're both rock/metal fans and we both dislike big birthday parties, I wanted to ask him if he wants to go on an Ozzy Osbourne and Judas Priest concert with me a few days after my birthday, just the two of us.

But here's the problem: I've only known him for two months but for people who only hung out 4 times we're pretty good friends. I'm sure he would like to come to see that concert. But during these 4 times we've met, he never was the one to ask me first. Then again, 2 out of 4 times were random encounters. But still, I asked him twice, he asked me never. I doubt he doesnt *want* to see me, because he lives 30 mins away from me yet he gladly comes when we agree to meet up and when we're heading home he always asks ""We're staying in touch, yeah?""'

I want to ask him to meet up again because I don't want to invite him to something so big over text. Do you think I'd be too clingy and annoying?

521,"To introduce myself, I am 25, veteran of the navy. I got out Dec2016 and started internet college and taking care of my child which I am still doing in CA. I continued dating my baby mother (BM) until recently. Things have gotten toxic and extremely out of control. It stared with me cheating and lying. I offered to get counseling and try to figure out what went wrong, I cheated the week I got out while she was pregnant. It has only gotten worse as expected with time.

Is saying that he provided the most support too vague?

My current evidence is : 
1 : Haymitch withheld water from Katniss, but this supported her in the way that he was sending her the message that she was near water
2 : Haymitch was the one who convinced the sponsors to support Katniss by sending her the expensive ointment when she got burned by the wall of fire. 
3 : Haymitch reminded Katniss that she and Peeta were in love when he sent her broth. He did this to assure that they got the support of the Capitol and their sponsors.

524,"Hello! I very need your advice! 

I am 21 y.o. I have problem with finishing University. I am on year 2, but I took me 5 years to get here(year 2). Right now I have really big problem with it. My parents told me, that I need to get a degree(3 years) and I will be totally free.

Diploma in Computer Science. Right now I probably need to make decision on my whole life: should I change a Uni, and specially city ?

Right now I am on city **A**:

* It is big city 1M+ people. 
* I have work here(as programmer).
* I have a girlfriend here.

I have a variant to move to the city **B**:

* It is small city 60.000 people. 
* No job for me(as programmer).
* It is 5 hours away from city A(visiting with gf will be hard).

Living in city A:

* I get payment which will be enough
* To pay rent for flat
* To pay tuition in city B
* To pay for Food
* Some extra money
* I can't get diploma

Living in city B:

* My parents will pay for everything: flat, tuition, food
* I will get diploma

I don't want my parents to pay for that. Right now they telling me to change city A to city B and get diploma.

Also I am thinking about another variant: it is possible to study on Saturday and Sunday in city B. And I am thinking about work from Monday to Friday, travel 5 hours to  one side to the weekend, study and get back. Doing this I will get money(from job), which allows me to pay rent for flat in city A, in which I would like to move with my girlfriend, pay for weekend studying in city B, pay for tickets for all trips, and I will have some money for food. 

Going to live in city B:

* I will get no job
* I  need to find a flat
* Girlfriend 5 hours away
* My parents pay for rent, for food, for study - for everything

Generally: staying at A gives me money to pay for everything. Going to city B - I have nothing, my parents pay for all.  

 I don't want my parents to for all of these. But going every weekend for 5 hours on one side - it is really hard physically and emotional... but I am able to pay for all. Changing big city to small. Loosing everything for only one diploma. The only plus I see - diploma.

I am thinking about staying in A + trips for weekends for study in B.

This decision  will change my life.

She admitted it, but she kept saying she only loved her as a friend. Fkin bullshit, she also wanted to sleep at his place for 1 day because she doesn't wanna pay extra at a hotel in amsterdam.

529,"I want to start off by saying that I have a mild form of schizophrenia. It makes getting along with people really difficult since my delusions are primarily involved in the body language of other people. I collect social security due to an inability to get along in the workplace.

&amp;#x200B;

Lately I find myself feeling what I want to say is catatonic, but maybe that's inaccurate. Months ago I had a decent job, but the company I was working for went under, so it forced me out of work. Finding a job that compliments my illness is super hard and looking for one is very daunting. What's more than that, is that I'm generally afraid to go outside, I feel like everyone is really hostile and I'm always acting strange and moving my body in ways other people find upsetting. The reason for this is a torrent of intrusive thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

Normally I get by shutting myself in and playing video games, watching anime or listening to some podcast. Recently my interest has just dropped off and I have stopped being interested in anything that is fun or challenging. Unless it's laying in bed or eating I feel waves of dysphoria for interacting with just about anything. I've been trying to play games but my interest is so small that I can't get past easy stages in games that I've played for a long time.

530,"I've had some successes in life, but also many more stinging failures. Recently in my personal life I got to feeling very bitter, angry, and cynical over many things, but the most serious catalyst was a woman who rejected/ghosted me. To describe myself: I'm usually a very kind guy to all people I encounter in life. I display respect and openness to everyone I meet, and consider(ed) everyone as an independent human who should be respected. I want(ed) to be a genuinely good citizen of society.

My personality has, within the past 2 years, been completely transforming little by little. But on the inside, not the outside. Rejection has fueled this fire - rejection both romantic and in my work life.  

But now on the inside I'm starting to strategize literally everything, and am starting to view almost every interaction with a human as completely impersonal. I now view presentation as more important than substance, and I think it's totally okay to lie to people and give them false suggestions about who I am. 

Like for example, if they ask me if I did anything interesting lately, I say I visited another state with friends, in order to make myself seem more interesting, financially successful, and powerful. I will pick a state whose geography I know and have a made-up story in my head if they press for more details. I also read psychological research suggesting what factors will make people trust you and be more attracted to you more, and then I do it in order to influence them. They never have any clue that I'm doing it on purpose and think that's just how I naturally am. All the clothing I wear is based on psychological research, and designed to make me seem more financially successful than I am, in order to increase respectability, attraction, and perception of me. I even got to the point where I was thinking of changing my full first name and last name into something else because it might influence people based on how the name sounds and what associations it might evoke. At that point I got to thinking this mindset might be too much - but I'm still seriously considering the name change.  

I'm not dangerous or anything (I don't want to go to jail or break the law). But the way I'm approaching social relations with my new mindset is, obviously, off the wall. And yet I keep doing it because the sad part is *it's working for me*. It's only when I revert to my real self that my goals end up frustrated - that people go away.

My entire mindset has basically become: ""this person doesn't care about you, they will reject you if they knew the real you, but it's all just a game anyway, so manipulate their impressions of you with careful lies and subtle manipulation. It's OK to do this and there are zero consequences because none of it is illegal."" So far I have stuck to only small white lies designed to subconsciously boost me (like my traveling example), and would never tell a massive one, but I'm certainly going in that route by planting cues in peoples minds.  

I've basically come to view society and social life as one massive game and I'm just a player. Everything is depersonalized. I justify it by telling myself that society is shallow, and all I'm doing is exploiting peoples' sins by taking advantage of shallowness. The biggest thing that won't make me stop this is that I'm getting ahead way more in life than with my previous normal belief system. That's why I've slowly gotten more and more into this over time.

535,"I had an acne scar that was not fading. So I thought my best option was to consult a dermatologist. The dermatologist consultation costs 53 dollars. I had my first consultation with the dermatologist and she told me it's best to do ""electrodessication"" which is an electric needle to cut the scar and make it flat. So the next week I went and got it done. It got flat and I felt like my pimple scar got less visible(but it didn't fade.) That day I paid for BOTH another consultation and the treatment. And the dermatologist just told me to use antibiotics and to come back after two weeks. So fastforward, I went today and my dermatologist was not even there. However, they told me another dermatologist is there (it's her sister) and asked if it's okay if I go to her instead. I said okay.

The second dermatologist literally didn't say anything new/useful during the consultation. She just told me that I had to use dark spot creams to heal the scar. She then proceeded and asked me to buy 4 of their products (only one of them was a dark spot cream) they ALL costed 265 dollars. WTF.

Its just really foreign, unwelcomed, and can really torment me sometimes having to entertain a dialogue in my thoughts with someone who has wronged me very badly in my life.

If I were to explain it to a friend and try and draw some sort of conclusion about what would cause this, the best way I could describe it is that it seems like it is being inflicted upon me and that it may have something to do with hate or someone or somethings power over me (as crazy as that sounds).

At times it literally does not sound like it is coming from my thoughts or my head at all. And sounds just as clear as an actual voice a few feet away from me.

537,"Hey, thanks for taking the time to read this! My name is Austin now almost 23 from CT, and I’m looking for some guidance

I was raised my my mother and father(until around age 10 for him), and both were abusive in their own way. Some background information;
Let’s start with my Father. I’d say from up to age 7 or 8, I spent a large majority of my time with him while my mom worked to put a roof over all of us. My father couldn’t hold a job and regularly cheated on my mom, would threaten physical harm to me, was a heavy alcoholic and would regularly drive heavily intoxicated with me in the car(I didn’t know what being under the influence was at the time). He also was addicted to prescription opioids(He once broke his leg because he fell asleep on the toilet from taking them). At age 10 I wrote a letter to him when he moved down to Florida telling him until he’s clean from alcohol and pills, I would never speak to him. And I haven’t since…

As I said prior about my mom, she  did work to support the house. However, she always made me feel like no matter what I would do, I would screw it up, that I was incapable of growing up and surviving on my own, and that I’d always need her, while also making me feel guilty whenever I wanted to leave the house and hang out with my friends. She blames me for deficiencies she has in her mental health as well as physical. She is down to 115lbs and Blames it on worrying if I’m going to come home tonight, or if she’ll get a call from someone telling them I’m dead.

My extended family on both sides claimed that I was an autistic child, particularly Aspergers, and have always treated me as “below them” intellectually, or like a child. Not only has my Family thought of me in that manor, but also my peers throughout school, and people that I would play Xbox live with who didn’t know me outside of that thought something was wrong with me.

I’m not looking for anyone to tell me that I’m Normal, rather for someone to point me in the best direction to determine if what they feel(which obviously made me question myself and my worth) has validity to it or not. ",17Jan2019,1
538,"I'm a 21 year old guy who’s quiet and can look nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it so idk. Also when I only got a pub job myself without asking for her help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done every time I see her. I was intimated by her because when she looked at me when talking to me she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair most appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way .  When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I I tired to my left to looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley quiet way which confuses me because she gave me a furrowed eyebrows snobby look at me when she first called me over to the appointment which got me down.

Edit: she started saying the ‘awww’ from when I’d get up to leave at the end of every appointment since the time I failed an interview a few months ago for not having enough confidence but I usually would say ‘oh ok thank you’ when I’d get up to leave at the end when she said awww so it could be that idk",17Jan2019,1
539,"Just a little backstory: I've been divorced about 10 years and my ex-wife has a son who is 5 years old. When I am over at her house to pick up my children, I have fun hanging out with the boy and generally just being goofy with him. His father is not an upstanding citizen and has anger issues and probably is abusive toward this child, although I do not know the extent or extremity of this abuse. The other day, I observed the boy run up to his mother and either slap or punch her in the jaw and then stand in front of her, laughing at her. The hit did actually cause her some pain, so she told the boy this and he continued laughing.

I am not this boy's parent and I don't actively ""parent"" him when I'm around. I just hang out, being a goofy adult friend to him.

540,"My mother is sick with fast-spreading breast cancer and end-stage COPD, and has opted to not have surgery to correct the former, and instead go into hospice care to be with her dog until her death. She's convinced she'll be dead in 2 weeks, but I've spoken with the doctors, and they've said it's impossible to know how long she has left. It could be months or more.
My sister and I have had... strained relationships with our mother throughout our lives. She was bad into drugs a lot in our early life, and was in and out of abusive relationships. When I was around 9 my mother claimed to have had throat cancer that was spreading rapidly through her body, and told everyone she was dying. Upon entering a new relationship and joining a church, they performed a hands-on healing of her, and magically her cancer was gone. Needless to say, trusting her when she is sick has been a huge struggle for my sister and I since. I moved in with my sister after this, and she took care of me, raising me, even though she was still in high school, until my mother regained custody of me during middle school. I'm adult now, in college and living on my own. 

This sickness, there are things she has exaggerated, but we know it is close to the end. She told people she had a cancer diagnosis before she even had a biopsy, told us the doctors recommended hospice care, when they only presented it as an option, and a few other things to make it all sound more dramatic, along with daily Facebook posts making it sound like she'll be dead in the next few days. This is how she is, and we have accepted that. It frustrates and hurts us, but we have acknowledged it, and still try to give her love as best we can.

A few nights ago, she called a 'family meeting' and proceeded to tell me my sister was not invited. I went, though made it clear to her that my sister was hurt, and I was upset with her for treating her that way. When I expressed this to her, she became belligerent, saying hurtful and guilt-inducing things. I am more numb to this type of communication from her than anything at this point, and after several attempts at telling her how I felt (using non-violent communication, and expressing empathy for her feelings, but still being firm with my own) I backed down. As I was leaving from visiting her in the hospital she informed me that after she's dead I'll have to go through a childhood friend (we'll call her Bri) to get anything I might want -- that she gave Bri all the keys to all of her safes and storage units, and Bri will divvy it up how she sees fit. 

My sister and I are devastated. My mother is not a rich woman. She has lived most of her life in poverty, or living off of disability. We know there is not much that she will leave us. But that's not the point. My mother has always had a history of having a 'friend of the month' that she usually gets close with for a short period of time, she shares everything with them, and then a few months later their talked about like they're her worst enemy. ""She stole from me. She was flirting with my boyfriend. She was just a user."" This situation I imagine would be no different, if her sickness allows her to be alive long enough to see the end of this 'friendship.' She is constantly talking ill of us to her friends, making us look like bad children for basically what comes down to having a difficult relationship with a narcissist. Many people see it our way, but many of her friends do not -- many see us as being unloving and uncaring and undeserving of her love in return. She paints us as if we take advantage of her. Which is crazy to both of us. I am in college, and have not gotten the slightest bit of financial help from my mother since I was 18 (27 now). My sister lives close by my mother and has not only helped her financially, but has also been at her beck and call, and helped her as much as she was able to with getting her places, and had her involved in her life a lot. 

To top it all off when my sister asked her about details she would like for her funeral, my mother told her someone else was taking care of it... My sister explained that it's important for us to take care of it, because it will help us grieve. She shouted saying ""EVERYTHING I DO IS FOR YOU KIDS, YOU ALWAYS MAKE IT ABOUT YOURSELVES!"" It's just painful that she won't see our point of view. Anytime I try to speak with her about this, she screams over top of what I'm saying until I stop talking. She'll cry and say how we're making the end of her life a living hell. 

All I want is for my mother to be honest. I would accept it without judgement and open arms. I've told her this. She still clings to the fiction that everything she's ever done has been for us, and that she has never lied, and everyone 'always tells her she's the most honest person they've ever met.' There's no getting through to her. 

I want to forgive my mother before she dies. I want to let of this pain, and I want to help my sister to heal. I want her to see that she has hurt us -- that we see her for who she is, and have still been here despite that. That we love her, and deserve to properly mourn her. That we have sacrificed to have her in our lives, and deserve the small inheritance that she would leave someone else. I want to be able to forgive her, and let her die in peace knowing that she is forgiven for all that she's done to us. I don't want her to die angry at us, or us at her. 

I don't know what I'm asking for? Just anyone who has had a similar situation, or.. has some advice for healing? I don't know. I'm sorry it became so long -- I just desperately want to be validated that I'm not crazy for being upset about this. That I'm not crazy for finding it harder and harder to love and forgive her.

541,"I have struggled my whole life with severe mood swings and panic attacks. I was diagnosed with social anxiety disorder as a small child, but more recently I've been thinking I might have borderline personality disorder.

I get absurdly angry over the slightest things and I honestly dislike being around people now.

Today is the end of my first week of classes. I had to work until midnight last night, and going to bed at 1am isn’t too bad, but I was up until 5 trying to figure out how to do my online homework. My professors had so many tabs and some weird organization and I just didn’t get it. 

I make it through my 8 am class fine, but in the rest of them I was dozing off. I was near the front too. I was so embarrassed. I wasn’t snoring or anything, but I’m pretty sure you could tell I was sleeping. 

This is such a bad first impression. I was planning to introduce myself to each of my professors during office hours because that’s what I heard you should do from former teachers.

546,"I started thinking this about 5 weeks ago. I came in to the kitchen and found my tablets laid out on the counter at around 6pm. I take my tablets at 8pm every night so there’s no need for me to take them out before. I asked my roommates if they had touched them and they all said they hadn’t touched them or taken them out and put it down as me forgetting I did. The thing is I keep them in my room so I don’t know how they got there and I’m very careful where I place them because I don’t want anybody knowing what I take them for. 

Then a few weeks later my food began to taste funny and making me feel weird. It was a minor chemical taste. So I started eating out or cans which couldn’t be tampered with and the food tasted normal again. 

This morning I woke up and took a drink of a bottle of water on my bed side table. It tasted awful so I looked in it and there was white powder in the bottom of it.

548,"Hi all, 

Not sure how to break it in but I have tried from multiple perspectives to see the situation I am from others points if views. So while I feel like while Im entitled to feel the screaming rage and depression inside me,  maybe im the one expecting too much from others and not myself. 

Ever since I was a kid, i have made it a point to never be alone. Tldr;; I had a highly abusive childhood that which has left me with ptsd, waking nightmares. Cold sweats. My mental conditions , especially while I was going through therapy,  was so unstable and a lot of the long term relationships I had ended up with ended up going south.  My friends often stayed on Skype and now discord with me as i fell asleep and stay with me throughout the night because there are still nights where I may have an episode.  Regardless for being 18-23 it made me feel like a pretty shit human being. 

Fast forward,  25 I'm finally finished with my Masters in Business and now work at as an accounting specialist for a mid-sized gas station / convenience store chain. 
Ive also met someone whom I consider to be the love of my life. This person has helped me crawl out of some of my destructive tendencies... ie: self-harm, my trauma of the past, got me finally eating a healthy diet.  Lately we even got to the point of spending weekends together.  Itd be great but what i'm really upset over is this:

At my job, I handle the accounting for roughly 400 sites. I help with reconciling all of the beer, and a majority of our other trade vendors. But lately,  there is a shortage of man power in other departments to process their invoices timely. So now,  I do it. ALL of it.  Construction, FMG / HVAC , IT, Carwash, Risk Audit, and more.  My boss doesnt even have access to the files I have.  Technically im sitting on a gold mine but I can't take it anymore. I already had one genreal breakdown at work but with 2019 coming around, they even increased my workload making me in charge of some key training initiatives in 2019 and helping to develop some new workflow processes.  Itd be great but, yo, i'm an accountant. Im so behind with work. 

Itd be great but I also have to deal with a great deal of verbal abuse too. I have a stalker from the IT Department... i had 2 but thankfully 1 was a temp. I have a coworker who thinks its appropriate to point out that Im a woman each time i make a comment and follows that up with reminding us that women are awful at everything.  Good job.  Is this the early 1900s? I also have a coworker who is very verbally negative and has a crush on me which makes it even worse when he interacts with me.  He acts extra mean with me while giggling and telling me to suck a big fat horse c*** for example...

Its miserable.  I come home and all i want is to spend time with the love of my life.  But i feel like i'm a bank seat to everything sometimes. Hes nice and dotes on me but when we don't see each other its like... he chucked his phone into the pacific ocean. I just normally send a good morning or whatever text.  But i feel like i do this out of love and worry but its not really good for anything.  I can literally watch him come home on discord,  ignore all messages for a good long while,  and beeline for his friends. Am i always miserable to be alone with? Or just when he lies at night saying lets watch something together but falls asleep within the first 3 minutes.  
I know.  Im not dumb.  Thats sure is watching together. 

While yes this bothers me,  i don't actually take it out on him. Right now i know he's dealing with some emotional baggage with his own personal life so i try to back seat a lot.  Hes a little interesting ofa driver.  Really defensive so he tires out a lot on a 40 mile round trip commute.  ( 20 each way ) and he works in a tax office so it is tax season. The weekendswe are spending together are also becoming less interactive as a date night and more like let me talk to my friends and game in the same room.  Yeah great... that's cool too at least i see him once a day or something but its... maybe just a part of being together a while? 7 days a week just friends. 


Basically,  i feel so unfulfilled and as bland as egg-shell colored wallpaper on a crackhouse wall. Videogames take my mind off things but i have nothing im really looking forward to until kh3. I just don't know if there's something i'm missing to try and shake this negative feeling im feeling?

551,"I (f 25) have been seeing this guy (25) for about 8 months. We never discussed what we are or had “the talk”.  I labeled it (without him knowing) a FWB type of thing.  I’ve noticed recently that I’ve caught feelings for him. It was when he mentioned that he was hanging out with a new girl... and it made my stomach sick. I brushed it off and acted like I didn’t care. Because we aren’t together... and I can’t act crazy. (I’ve been very chill throughout these 8 months). 

Anyway.... the last time we hung out I discussed going to a different state for a mini vacation in August  &amp; asked him to come along... and he agreed.

552,"Hi guys, I have been browsing this sub for a couple of days only, but felt it could be the best place for me to get a little help. 

I am 27 years old, female, and a colorrectal suegery resident. I am recently married to my husband (35M) who is the most wonderful guy ever. Our home life is very harmonious, ups and downs like any couple, and he is extremely supportive of my career. I work long hours and get little sleep, has been that way since surgery residency and I thought I was used to it. I normally have no trouble staying awake and being pushed to work a lot, but during the last year, after starting my newest residency, I have been having A LOT of trouble working. 

I get snappy at needy patients (really ashamed to say so, but full disclosure here), I can't wait to finish work to go home, I feel exhausted from all the consults, meetings with patient's families, having to explain the same thing many times, etc. I've been feeling so unmotivated that for the last 6 months I skip work almost once a week, always with a different (and false) excuse. I love operating, I love my profession, but lately I have such a hard time being a good doctor that sometimes I consider quitting.

I am on medication for depression, have been for over 3 years, and it's helped a lot. 

I guess what I am trying to ask is this: aside from therapy and medication, what are some of the mental tools you guys use to motivate yourselves to go to work and do a good job?

556,"I’m a junior in high school.  I’m counting down the clock to when I get to move out of this fucking house because I love my parents but I absolutely can’t stand living with or close to them.

My mom makes the house disgusting.  Leaves her food, trash, everything fucking EVERYWHERE.  I used to try and clean but she immediately destroys whatever I do.  Of course that’s my fault even though my room and bathroom is spotless.  Things that SHE does wrong are my fault.  She asked me to keep her door shut so my puppy can’t get in her room and chew her stuff.  Fine.  Did that.  But she came home from work, left her door open BY HERSELF, and my dog got something off the floor because her room is a mess.  Somehow it’s my fault she left her door open.  Somehow it’s my fault she can’t be bothered to pick shit up off her floor.  I understand it’s my dog but he’s a puppy!  They get into shit!

Everything I do is wrong.  It doesn’t matter if I’m a straight A student, involved in several school activities, never EVER get in to trouble, I’m the worst daughter she could have asked for.  I’m stupid and I have no friends.  She attacks me verbally and I’m nearly positive it’s emotionally abusive at this point.  That’s what my counselor seems to think.  When I defend myself I’m giving her attitude.  When I ignore her I’m giving her attitude.  When I try to be rational she escalates the argument.  She insults my appearance and has left me with issues that have taken long to cope with let alone overcome.

Recently she’s started getting physical.  Not crazy bad, she’s not physically abusive or anything, but until the last year I couldn’t DREAM of her getting anywhere near physical.  But when she’s mad and screaming she will pick up the thing closest to her and throw it at me or at something else.  Once it was a large plastic box full of clothes or something.  Once it was the food I brought home to eat from a friends because she neglected to go grocery shopping for a month but didn’t “trust me” to do the shopping for her, thought I’d fuck it up or something.  Sometimes she grabs my arm hard and pulls me.  Nothing terrible but it shakes me up because my mom never used to do this until recently.

Today I was standing at the top of the stairs to my basement.  There’s a door at the top.  She got heated and tried to slam the door on me.  She shut my arm in the door in the moment and while I panicked to get it out I lost my balance and almost fell down the stairs.  I grabbed the door knob at the last second to steady myself.  I would’ve cracked my head open on concrete because she was mad.  I’ve gotten used to stuff like this but that was the last straw.  She could’ve seriously injured me because she refuses to control her temper.  She’s the PARENT.  THATS HER JOB.

Obviously my parents are separated because my mom is wonderful but my dad isn’t much better.  He’s drunk any time past 10 am.  He lives close by but drunk dad is racist homophobic dad.  I’m still closeted from him and he doesn’t know, he’s never gonna know.  He’d probably kill me.

My dad used to at least try to hide his drinking from me.  He’d wait till later in the day.  He would turn off his phone.  Now I guess since he’s retired he has nothing better to do.  I can never communicate with him because he’s always drunk.  He always spams me with texts and calls of mean, racist, terrible shit.  I have no where to get away from my mom and if I tried she’d call my friends parents and tell them not to take me.  I’ve tried to leave before.

I can’t fucking do it.  I’m sorry if I’m being melodramatic but I feel like I’ve been trying my best and I’ve gotten so much better this year and she keeps fucking kicking my legs out from under me.  I really needed to vent.

However, I’m not happy. I thought running away from my sadness in America would help but it didn’t. It just made me sadder.

I wanted to quit the team because it just doesn’t make me happy and it’s more of a hassle than anything. 

Parents call me selfish for wanting to quit and won’t let me

I fear that if I’m on the team any longer I’m going to end up offing myself because I just feel so shitty about myself whenever I play

569,"Hey everyone. I've dated this girl for about five months. It started out very casual but I was slowly developing feelings for her. She was very reluctant in defining the relationship and was often unsure how she felt about me. It seemed to go through monthly cycles of ""omg, you're awesome"" to ""uhm, I need some space"". We've broken up and gotten back together twice and recently, we broke up again.  


The first few days after the break up, I was sad but I kind of accepted it and was able to go about my life. However, as time goes on, I feel worse and worse. I keep thinking about her and how great she is. I feel very strongly about her despite her flaws/fluctuations. It was definitely not a huge spark but a very slow burn and basically.. I think I love (loved?) her.  


I'm having trouble focusing at work, no motivation to do anything, and no appetite (which is awful because food is a huge love of mine). I can't play any games or watch tv.. To make matters worse, I recently purchased a handgun (for sport). I'm not suicidal and I don't want to kill myself as I know these feelings of despair are temporary. But I can't help but keep thinking about the gun. Like, wtf is wrong with me?  


What do I do to get through this? I've tried reaching out to friends but they're busy or maybe they don't seem to care. One of my best friends is in the military and he's on the other side of the world so I can't really talk to him most of the time. Idk if I just need a distraction or someone to talk to but I've come home from work 3 days in a row and I just cry nonstop.  


I often look at myself as having a split personality. There's one side that's extremely logical and then there's the emotional side but they don't talk to each other.

573,"Mandatory ""on my phone formatting is bad blah blah blah"" statement

Bit of backstory, I (15M) lost my father last year to an accidental overdose-toxic medication combination, caused mainly by dementia. This hasn't been easy, obviously. So last year I decided to enroll myself into public high school (I've been online schooled since 2nd grade) this was a terrible idea looking back. I had a generally bad experience, long story short I ended up having a mental breakdown and ended up going into multiple DKAs (diabetic ketoacidosis) so I stopped physically attending school, due to physical and mental health issues, it's been about 3 or 4 months since I was last in school.

So now, here I am, weighing my options. I've had a therapist for about 2 months now to help with school and such, school isn't happy that I've stopped attending. I've seemingly run out of options, Denver Online School is no longer an option due to them being full. Homebound teacher will likely not happen since the administration board usually doesnt pay for such things. I move in May to either Texas or NC, so I don't even want to start school until I move. My options right now are seemingly impossible, go to a school for troublemakers, or go back to my highschool, both of which I really dont like, for social and personal problems. I'm terrified, my mother could be taken to court because I'm not in school, and if I go back, I will be miserable, and I mean god awful miserable. I dont want to lose myself, but I dont want to hurt my mom. What do I do reddit?

577,"Background: 
I'm a 16 year old male.
My sister is 13.
My granddad is in his 60's.

Alright so this story begins 2 years back when my Grandma died. She was a great person and all loving and caring. However after my grandma passed away something slowly changed in my granddad. He started being closer to the young females in our family.. 

I will now tell you some events in from the past year ago that let me to believe this:
- On his birthday he was really going into the kiss with my sister and laughed weirdly right afterwards.
- When he is visiting us and my parents are out of the house he tends to sit real close to my sister while keeping normal distance talking to me.
- He tends to touch the younger females (12-15) more then others in our family.

Which brings me to today: 
I was sitting on the opposite side of the living room. Granddad came into our house and immediately sat down next to my sister (which he always does). My parents where still here and he was just talking regularly to them and my sister. My parents where leaving and said ""Don't make it too late"" my granddad made a joke and they left. Then my sister was just on the phone and my granddad starts talking to her and explaining something about some kind of game. While explaining he leans in real close and pulls his arm around her. He does these types of things constantly for the following hour and a half after which it is time to go to bed. My granddad slaps her leg or ass walks upstairs with her (weird considering she's 13 but okay). While walking upstairs he constantly looks at her ass it looked like (couldn't see it that well) . Then they have a talk (couldn't hear about what it was). And my granddad comes back down about 5 minutes later. Normally I'd start talking to him but this time I couldn't get any words out of my mouth. It was pretty late at this point so I grabbed a glass of water and said goodnight see you next time. He didn't even look at me and just said goodnight. Now I'm here standing in the bathroom hearing the stairs. Turns out my sister was walking down. About a minute later my sister and grandad come upstairs and my granddad entered her room and said something unrelated kissed her did some other thing that sounded like him making her bed. He said goodnight and walked downstairs breathing heavily. 


So here are the options I've considered:
- tell him directly about this.
- tell my sister about my thoughts and what she thinks.
- tell my parent(s).
Note: I have considered that maybe I'm overthinking this.

All these options have benefits and disadvantages to them.

592,"TL;DR: (tbh I don’t blame you) ashamed and feeling out of control with comfort eating. Need advice on how to stop. 

Rage at myself for struggling to attain balance. I’m 20 years old, living alone at uni and I’m able to write a dissertation in my third language but not know when it’s normal to eat certain foods or amounts of food?

In 2012 I was stuck in hospital for months with a feeding tube recovering from severe anorexia and now seven years later I’m still struggling to learn what balance is and not overeat. It’s like no one ever warns you that recovery is more of a pendulum or yo-yo and not some constant uphill battle that gets easier. 

I’m a healthy weight and I exercise regularly and for the most part I try to follow a loose meal guide made by a dietician just to keep me feeling safe and keep my anxiety at bay. I also see a psychologist regularly to talk about things that make me anxious. The first four years of recovery were somewhat more simple because I was in high school and living under my mother’s roof: every day had definite, rigid structure (perfect for the OCD and anorexic need for control), I had a regular school lunch box and controlled sport. 

But binge eating crept up on me. I first discovered comfort eating in 2014 (it was masked because I was still needing to gain a bit of weight) when my gran passed, and then was every now and then in my junior and senior years when my parents divorced and my mother and I were homeless for a while. The stress hit hard in the last two years when I had to work in 2017 and then again last year in my first year of uni. Completely new environments, time structures, people and food rules in both years. The overeating/comfort/binge eating became especially bad in 2017 when I gained a bit of extra weight with an abusive boyfriend. It wasn’t that much (though it felt that way to me at the time) looking back and I’ve stayed within a stable weight range the last three years in my adult body but I worked hard in 2018 to get back down gradually to a lower, healthier weight and busy myself with the things that kept me feeling safe: studying, friends, therapy and exercise. And it did help. But last year was also turbulent because my father attempted suicide violently in front of me, I escaped an attempted rape and my mother started dating an old family friend, who lived in my mother’s house for the last six weeks over the holidays with his 23 year old daughter in the spare room. Which I would normally be thrilled with seeing as he makes her happy and he’s a cool guy, except she’s left me behind in her new happy family and admitted to excluding me from plans the last while because she doesn’t know how to work me into this new life of hers with him. And yeah it hurts a bit and I don’t know how to communicate with her without her defensively screaming at me or seek asylum in my father’s unstable state. 
 
I’m sure this emotional stuff has an impact on my subconscious anxiety and oral fixation and I know that the comfort eating doesn’t happen every day and I’m not necessarily finishing whole 2L tubs of ice cream and slabs of chocolate, but it’s packets of chips and a chocolate bar or too big a bowl of pudding and nougat or whatever. I know that it’s happening and that it’s more than is healthy and this distresses me. Pig-out days or ‘cheat days’ as my gym-obsessed friend’s would call them are normal but it’s more sinister than that with me. Like I feel more anxious eating in front of people and feel more safe eating in my room alone when it comes to ‘carby’ food. As silly as it sounds I’m worried that I spiral out of control and can never grasp onto a sense of stability with my life or my eating and I’m so tired of the guilt, the confusion of not knowing what normal eating habits truly are and what is just Instagram model façade and tired of hiding my comfort eating in plain sight of friends and family who would never suspect a thing. I am so so ashamed of myself and I feel pathetic and hopeless and I don’t know what to do. Any advice or experience with any of this would be greatly appreciated.

593,"To preface, I’m male, in a committed long term relationship with a woman and am going to be fairly vague since she is on Reddit as well and I don’t want to put the cart ahead of the horse so to speak. This is also going to be long, so please bear with me as I start this off.


Long before my GF and I became an item, I went through a pretty sexually adventurous stage in my 20’s. This was when craigslist had a casual encounters section, so I was sleeping with women, trans women and cross dressers on a fairly regular basis. I have and am very attracted to femininity, and never really thought to put a label on my sexual identity. I kind of just went with it because I was having fun, and assumed that sleeping around, let alone with cross dressers and trans women was just a phase. A period of curiosity and exploration.

Because I thought this was a phase, I buried this in my late twenties and only fondly reflected on it from time to time. That’s when I met my current gf, who is a natural born woman. We hit it off really well, and now she lives with me but is also currently financially dependent on me. For a while, I thought great, I’m slipping into something normal and I can reflect on my past as just a wild time. Then I get hit with cancer, which forced me to look at a lot of things. I’ve since recovered and am back to normal so to speak.

But it made me more closely examine my previous encounters. Or rather, reflect on my life. I can’t deny my attraction to trans women, not in the fetishized way, but in the same genuine capacity in which I’m attracted to natural born women. But more so, that I want to exclusively date trans women. I don’t know why this is, and to a degree I feel ashamed of myself. I’ve found myself fantasizing about ending things so I can date the type of people I always have wanted to. But I feel selfish for doing so because I do care about my GF, I want her to be happy. I don’t want to hurt her.

I feel awful, and I don’t understand why. I’ve dated one trans woman in the past, which didn’t work out due to not feeling a connection. I sort of dropped it after that because I guess I was afraid to pursue it (dating trans women) any further. I feel dirty for keeping this a secret from my gf, and I’ve often battled with coming clean about everything or staying the course for her sake and I feel lost.

I know the right thing to do is to speak up, but she’s very reliant on me. We live in a one bedroom apartment, there really is no where for her to go. And even typing that makes me feel sick, like I’m plotting this out to selfishly prance off into the sunset. I guess, I don’t know what to do here and could use some wisdom and guidance. I don’t want to hurt my gf, but I also don’t want to keep living this way either. What do I do reddit?

As far as those who will ask why I keep stuff like this to myself, I’m well aware of how gay men and trans women are treated. While I don’t identify as gay myself, I wager that I would be treated the same or worse. I work in a conservative industry, so its hard to be myself outside of home.

I’m in California so it is legal, but I’m just paranoid about that kind of stuff since it’s always a possibility.

Also, the only reason why I’m kind of risking it like this, is because this gives me a chance to be social and hangout with people since I don’t have that many friends. I’m probably just going to say that I’m going to the gym or something because simply saying that I’m going to hangout with friends is kind of out of character for me.

598,"Hello dear friends, I have an issue that I am very desperate about and I don't know how to handle it, so maybe you have some advice for me. 

I am currently 19 years old and I am in love with my cousin who is 24. For the last 3 years it has been very hard to admit to myself that I am in love with her.
She lives in Turkey and I live in Germany (my family is from Turkey) and I see her twice a year for maybe 4 weeks in total.
When I am in Germany, I try to forget about her, try to get to know other girls and distract myself so maybe my love will fade, but I still always think of her. When I am in Turkey it's like my love for her has not changed a bit. 
Every time I leave her it is so incredibly painful because I cannot tell anyone, I don't have the courage to tell her and I don't think that would be very smart anyway, and I know that eventually nothing may become of this love because there is less and less tolerance for this kind of love in our society.

Sometimes I tell myself that I can't help who I fall in love with and should not blame myself for it, just like for example non-heterosexual people. But I don't really know if I can explain that to anyone else.
In our family, and in Turkey in general, it is actually not completely uncommon for two cousins to marry, but still not common enough for me to feel comfortable about it, and less and less people are doing it.

I know that I am the cousin she likes most, because she told me so and she treats me so, and she cries when I leave (being the only person I know to do so, and I have about 30 cousins), but I don't know how far her love goes.
She has been raised very traditionally and wants to marry in a traditional way, where a man just asks for her hand without really getting to know each other. I know that she does not have a boyfriend, as we have sometimes talked about such things openly.

I have thought about marrying her, but I have not even started studying (she has already finished), so it is probably way too early. I am afraid that she will marry someone else until I finish. Sometimes I imagine her marrying someone else and it is incredibly painful. I would have less importance to her.
If I finish studying and she is still not married until then, I think I would have a pretty good chance of our family acknowledging it and her accepting it. 

What do you think about this whole situation, what advice would you give me as to how to proceed, as I don't know what to do or think. 
Thank you so much, this is my first time talking about this openly.",17Jan2019,1
599,"Long story short, me and this girl have been romantically interested in each other for a couple of months now. I was in a class with her last semester and this one as well. She's the one who approached me (I wouldn't have even tried because she's actually so fucking beautiful and mega-rich it's unbelievable. I'm good looking but she's way, way, way out of my league).

She literally asked me to date her one time over text but she never brought it up again and I just assumed it was a joke or something. Anyways, like a couple of weeks later, she made it clear that we weren't gonna date 'cause it's just too inconvenient (travel, money, etc). I knew pretty much from the beginning that things would probably end up that way because we're from two different worlds. 

However, we began talking even more than before and became closer than ever. I know all about her kinda messed up past and how many people in her life have screwed her over, both romantically and in general. It's like we're dating but not really. She's always flirty and makes sexual jokes but she talks about me finding a girl and her finding the perfect guy a lot. Judging by these conversations, it's pretty obvious that I'm not ""the perfect guy."" At least I don't think so.

I got a call yesterday with her crying and accusing me of cheating (?), asking if I love her, etc. She was going on about how I'm ashamed of her (I don't know how she would get this idea, if anything it would be the other way around). She had to hang up because she started crying really badly. The fuck? The next day she was obviously embarrassed about it and said that she ""didn't remember"" what she said.

Obviously this is concerning behaviour and I'd probably dump any other girl but the problem is that I think I actually love her. This is like the first time I've gotten this close with someone. I've never loved any other girls I've talked to or messed around with, but she's different. The thought of her with someone else kills me but I kinda accepted that it's inevitable due to the circumstances. I've come to terms with the fact that we'll never be together since she told me that we couldn't date, but judging from that call it sounds like she wants me to herself...? What is going on?

Classes begin late next week, but his prognosis calls for at least four weeks of rehabilitation before he's even cleared to be transported halfway across the U.S. to his school. Does anyone know what the ramifications are? Can he lose his scholarship if he has to miss a semester or come to school late this semester.

I am so bitter and regretful. Meanwhile, all of the friends I never hear from have huge friend groups and are thriving. I can only focus on one person and find it hard to maintain relationships because of my irrational emotions and cut-throat decisions. ",17Jan2019,1
606,"Wtf am I meant to say? She hadn’t mentioned it to me, or checked if it’s okay with me. I’m an overly understanding person, and being so un-confrontational I just come across as a pushover. 

This just adds to my feelings of insecurity around these friends (my friend group) where I’ve felt like I’m the expendable one around for a few months now, it’s so uncomfortable for me to just smile and pretend to not be affected by their closeness. I’ve had a lot of issues with this which they don’t know much about at all. 

I can’t go to her party, which I had said to her when she was talking about setting a date, so now I feel like I’m being pushed out even more. She’s not a bad person, and I get that there are other factors she has to consider in choosing a date, but this feels so inconsiderate. And I know when I tell her I can’t come, she and everyone else won’t actually be sad about it. 

Should I talk to her about being annoyed? This honestly feels like the last straw with these friends but I don’t know how to detach myself from them completely, whether to play it safe and have people to go to or be friendship-groupless until the end of school (I’m in my final year). ",17Jan2019,1

608,When I was growing up I remember my parents consistently donating blood. They would always tell me that when I grew up I should because of my blood type (o-) being in demand.  The thing is that I made choices in my life that lead to me using intravenous drugs. I have been sober coming up on 4 years now and every time I see a blood donation drive I want to donate. I have gone as far as going in and filling out the questionnaire but they decline me because I tell the truth. I guess my question is would it be ethically or morally wrong for me to lie and donate blood like 10 years from now? side note I have been tested 5 times in the last 4 years for blood borne diseases and came up clean. I’m not sure why this is important to me but I feel like in 5 or 10 years not giving blood when I can would be worse than lieing. Thoughts from medical professionals maybe?,17Jan2019,1
609,"So to begin I’m 19 and have made very stupid choices the last few years. I’ve been with this girl for the last 6 years until recently. During our final months we decided to get two dogs. Puppies. Without a home. You can tell where this is going. I’ve been living out of my car with them for about 8 months. I had a job and we were going to buy a trailer and live out of it, but because of her lack of dedication to the dogs, I had to quit just so the dogs wouldn’t have to sit in a car alone for 8 hours while I worked. She still lives at home with her parents so 99% of the time now it’s just me and the dogs alone. It’s becoming more and more difficult to afford gas and food for the dogs, at one point they had gone two days without eating because of this. 

I know I’m a shitty person for agreeing to get these dogs when we literally can not afford them but now I’m trying to turn things around. 

I’ve been trying to convince her that we need to rehome her but whenever I even bring it up she either threatens to never see me again or (if it’s on the phone) to block me. She sees them MAYBE every other day and I’m with them 24/7. I’m sick of not having a job, not having a place, and as much as I love these dogs more than anything or anyone, I’m ready to move on and start my adult life. It would be better for them and me both. 

How do I handle this situation? Do I keep trying to convince her? Do I just do it behind her back? 

To make things more complicated they’re both officially in her name. 

Both my life and the dogs lives are being ruined and I need help. ",17Jan2019,1
610,"I know the use of ""friends"" in the title may seem weird considering the rest of the title but oh well.

I've been friends with this girl who's a few years older than me for close to 3 years now, and I feel as though I've really started to dislike and/or resent her within the past couple of months. When we first became friends, we got along well because we had mutual interests and seemed to connect on a personality level too. Fast forward to the past few of months, and she's been increasingly distant with me as well as exhibiting behaviour that I personally find really off-putting. About 4 months ago she essentially bailed on a trip we were planning together, and I found out that she had been planning another trip with a group of her other friends on the side (to the same place); I told myself to let it go because our planning had pretty much fallen through anyway, but I still felt hurt by the lack of notice.

I was willing to move past that since it was the first thing that had ever been 'wrong' in our friendship, and our contact was back to usually for about a month until she started replying/contacting less frequently. I don't usually mind too much since I know everyone has their own things happening, and sometimes I don't reply to people straight away, but it seems she only contacts me when she wants to discuss something she knows only me (out of her friends) cares about. Moving on, when we do hang out or I see her posts online or the messages she sends, she's become increasingly hateful and just cruel/mean about certain people as well as disgustingly judgemental about others. These kinds of things don't remind me of the same girl I became friends with, and definitely isn't something I value in a person at all. I've pulled her up about some things she says but she just turns it back around on me or starts being passive aggressive.

Overall I just feel like if I hadn't become friends with her all those years ago and I just met her as she is now, I would avoid interacting with her as much as possible; yet because we've got history I feel the urge to hang on. What makes it a bit more awkward is that we have mutual friends too, and that just makes the situation more complicated and I feel like I can't speak to them about her without seeming like a backstabbing friend.

I just don't know what to do.",17Jan2019,1

615,"As of right now, I have more hatred for this one person than I have ever in my entire life. 

A little back story. Me and my girlfriend are in an extremely happy relationship that has gone on for about 11 months now. She is the sweetest person on the planet and is just a joy to be around. Brightens everyone's day. I am extremely lucky to have her. 

Well, a few nights ago, we were talking about our exes and how they have damaged us. I told her about my ex from highschool 2 years ago that cheated on me 4 times.  Then she started talking about her ex from about 3 years ago. She explained to me how abusive he was emotionally. But then I saw tears forming in her eyes as she started to tell me how it went from verbal and emotional abuse to physical and sexual. 

This disgusting human being looked at this small, sweet girl and saw a prime target for his sick mind. He took advantage of her forgiveness and compassion for people. And he used it against her. 

I wont go into detail as they are quite graphic and I eventually told her to just stop telling me as I didnt want her to have to remember it and I was already angry at the beginning of it. Seeing her cry broke my heart into pieces. 

What gets to me the most was when she and him were dating around 3 years ago, ,she and I were friends and she was still the sweetest person you could ever meet. She never acted like anything was wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have never been in a fight or anything really too confrontational. I tend to me a mellowed chill guy. I am 6' 5"" with some muscle from the Military College I am currently at. This guy is just some low scum of the earth. I dont think he is even working. 

I seek advice on what to do with all this hatred. I have never hated anyone to this scale in my entire life. He does not deserve happiness or success. A big part of me wants to meet him face-to-face and settle it, but I am on my way to commissioning into the military as a 2nd Lt and I cant blow that with violence. 

I feel like hatred is different than anger. Anyone know any remedies?

620,"I've had some successes in life, but also many more stinging failures. Recently in my personal life I got to feeling very bitter, angry, and cynical over many things, but the most serious catalyst was a woman who rejected/ghosted me. To describe myself: I'm usually a very kind guy to all people I encounter in life. I display respect and openness to everyone I meet, and consider(ed) everyone as an independent human who should be respected. I want(ed) to be a genuinely good citizen of society.

My personality has, within the past 2 years, been completely transforming little by little. But on the inside, not the outside. Rejection has fueled this fire - rejection both romantic and in my work life.

But now on the inside I'm starting to strategize literally everything, and am starting to view almost every interaction with a human as completely impersonal. I now view presentation as more important than substance, and I think it's totally okay to lie to people and give them false suggestions about who I am.

Like for example, if they ask me if I did anything interesting lately, I say I visited another state with friends, in order to make myself seem more interesting, financially successful, and powerful. I will pick a state whose geography I know and have a made-up story in my head if they press for more details. I also read psychological research suggesting what factors will make people trust you and be more attracted to you more, and then I do it in order to influence them. They never have any clue that I'm doing it on purpose and think that's just how I naturally am. All the clothing I wear is based on psychological research, and designed to make me seem more financially successful than I am, in order to increase respectability, attraction, and perception of me. I even got to the point where I was thinking of changing my full first name and last name into something else because it might influence people based on how the name sounds and what associations it might evoke. At that point I got to thinking this mindset might be too much - but I'm still seriously considering the name change.

I'm not dangerous or anything (I don't want to go to jail or break the law). But the way I'm approaching social relations with my new mindset is, obviously, off the wall. And yet I keep doing it because the sad part is it's working for me. It's only when I revert to my real self that my goals end up frustrated - that people go away.

My entire mindset has basically become: ""this person doesn't care about you, they will reject you if they knew the real you, but it's all just a game anyway, so manipulate their impressions of you with careful lies and subtle manipulation. It's OK to do this and there are zero consequences because none of it is illegal."" So far I have stuck to only small white lies designed to subconsciously boost me (like my traveling example), and would never tell a massive one, but I'm certainly going in that route by planting cues in peoples minds.

I've basically come to view society and social life as one massive game and I'm just a player. Everything is depersonalized. I justify it by telling myself that society is shallow, and all I'm doing is exploiting peoples' sins by taking advantage of shallowness. The biggest thing that won't make me stop this is that I'm getting ahead way more in life than with my previous normal belief system. That's why I've slowly gotten more and more into this over time.",17Jan2019,1

Two years ago I got back in the dating game after ten years off the market, after a five year long-distance relationship failed and with it a failed plan to immigrate to start a new life. So, I decided to try dating apps for the first time...

There was this guy, he wasn't my type at all looks-wise (this is my type now thanks to him!) but he showed a great deal of interest and was easy to get along with so I decided to give him a chance. At first the date wasn't great, I honestly considered climbing out the bathroom window to escape, but something happened to change that and by the end of the night we were kissing. He asked me to go home with him that night and that should have been a warning sign...but I thought that maybe that's normal for dating now and I shouldn't hold it against him. To be honest I did go home with him after date number two, I've no problem with having made that decision. 

But soon it became more like a booty call, he slowly started to show who he was and hint that he wouldn't be one to want a relationship...despite his knowing that's what I wanted, he avoided being honest with me but I think I'm guilty of not being honest either as I convinced myself I could be casual to enjoy more time with him.

It turned out he not only wanted casual, but he wanted to date multiple other women and even include me in sex with other women - 100% not okay with me. He also showed himself to be a narcissist and manipulative, I could go into a conversation with a clear idea but by the end be thinking completely differently. I tried to convince myself I was okay with everything and dismiss my increasing anxiety as just dating nerves, any time I did question how he treat me he'd twist me around again so I wasn't quite thinking straight due to his manipulation either. But I was so hooked.

We were only together a couple of months but I was totally intoxicated by him despite everything. Over a year later I still think about him often, I bit on a couple of occasions when he tried messaging me on Facebook...and regretted it. A few months ago I saw him on a dating app again and we matched, I almost agreed to meet him again, he took too long to get back to me on meeting and so I thought better of it, I unmatched him but I still hope he'll try contacting me again...thus on New Year Eve I unblocked him on Facebook. I still secretly check out his social media too.

I'm normally so sensible with guys, I've always done well to avoid fuckboys in the past, even when I've come across other douches I've liked I've not gotten hooked. I've dated multiple guys since this one too, one I even thought could have been the one, but THIS GUY is so deep under my skin.

Now I personally don’t care what other people want to do but when the official rule is to come and go at 7 o clock, I’m not late or breaking the rules by coming in at 6:50. Just today this one old fuck at work said I have no work ethics because I come in ten minutes to 7. Like the fuck?

628,"Semi-long post to give some background, so just a warning and a thanks ahead of time for those that read it all and reply. 

I had a fourth interview today with a company that had been interested in me for a long time. Up to this point, the job was described to me as a true management role focused on finding, evaluating, hiring, training and retaining marketing candidates, not on actually executing marketing campaigns. I have a lot of experience doing this, as well as in marketing, so the fit seemed to be great. 

The location was a pretty busy lunch spot that was fairly loud and made it hard to hear all the questions as one of the people there, the founder, is very soft spoken.  Things started to go wrong once our meals came.  I was 1) trying to hear the founder and misheard him a few times so he had to repeat the questions and I could tell he felt like I was dodging the questions even though I was leaning in as much as I could 2) I had to eat my meal as everyone else was essentially done before I got to have three bites and they had mentioned they had a hard stop on the hour, and 3) some of the specific metrics they were asking for involved me having to provide backstory that would have taken way more time to explain and could easily have come across as ""negative"" against the current company. 

The main thing though, was that these questions didn't really touch at all on what I understood the point of the job and interview to be about. These were all very specific, detailed questions that never touched on the aspects of my experience related to being a manager or building teams in any real depth which is what I prepared for and I understood to be the point of the role. By the time it ended, I had a pretty bad feeling about how I performed and I felt a bit blindsided. 

I spoke with the founder after in private, and I attempted to provide more insight into the two or three questions I know i had come up short on by explaining I didn't want to paint the current company in a negative light in front of the others, and that the issues he pointed out were a result of some top-level strategy decisions that I didn't agree with and that I had previously mentioned (in not as much detail) when discussing why I was looking to leave.  

Is there any way I could possibly recttify this? The other founder, who wasn't present, was the one who originally outlined the job description to me and I had spoken with more candidly about my current challenges. I was hoping I could talk to him tomorrow and share my confusion about the scope of the role and my feelings regarding the interview. I can't do much about trying to explain the noise or how weird it felt to be stared at by everyone with empty plates, but I'm hoping I can do something to give greater detail into some of those questions and hopefully turn the focus back to what I thought the role was about which was my track record of managing/scaling teams.

630,"My parents have gone away for the weekend for a little vacation thing, and they went grocery shopping a couple of days ago for stuff for my younger brother (16M) and I (19M) to eat while they're away: basically just stuff like meat and vegetables for cooking, a couple of frozen meals, some snacks, just basic stuff to curb hunger. They left late this morning, and the first thing that my brother did once they left was cook a frozen pizza and just eat the whole fucking thing by himself and wash it down with half a litre of Pepsi. 

My parents bought that pizza and soda for us to share for lunch or whatever, and he was made adamantly clear of that fact because of how this is kind of a problem with him. I was looking forward to eating that pizza, but it really ticks me and my parents off when he does this kind of thing and doesn't even let anybody know. I asked him why he decided to cook the pizza and eat it all on his own without notifying me first, and he just got really angry and confrontational with me, claiming he hadn't eaten in about 12 hours, which was kinda understandable at first, but there's so many better things you could eat when you first wake up, and it was 8am when he woke up and 11am when he cooked the pizza, so that felt like kind of a bit of a cop-out. 

He always does this whenever me or anybody else in the family buys snack foods, ready-to-eat meals, or soda of any kind - he will sit down with a huge ass bag of chips or a whole 1.5 litre of soda and eat/drink the whole thing in half an hour while playing video games online. We'll order a bucket of kitchen from our local KFC, and he'll eat like half the bucket and leave me and my parents to split the rest between us. He'll just shred through a whole pack of cakes or donuts within a couple of hours and leave absolutely nothing for others to eat. If there's a bottle of soda in the fridge that specifically belongs to someone and isn't being shared among the family, he'll drink it anyway, and I've even caught him late at night drinking directly from bottles I've bought for myself.

If me or anyone else tries to ask call him out on it, he feigns ignorance and pretends he didn't, or if there's actual evidence to suggest he did (i.e. backwash in the soda), he will either attempt to guilt-trip me (i.e. ""you stole something from me, so i'm stealing this in exchange""), or argue that it's justified because he hasn't eaten or drank anything all day, which nine times out of ten isn't true. In any case, if the matter is pressed any further or any attempts are made to explain what he did wrong, he'll drown me out by yelling at me to go away or fuck off while he plays video games or watches Youtube, and quite frankly, I am absolutely sick and tired of it. I'm genuinely tired of him not seeing boundaries when it comes to food, and quite frankly, it feels very disrespectful that he thinks this kind of behavior is perfectly fine, especially towards me. I can barely eat more than three slices of a standard size pizza and generally eat a lot less than him, how he manages to eat eight slices in one sitting or not spare anybody else anything is beyond me, and I find it incredibly rude and condescending that he thinks it's okay to just take whatever he wants without considering what others have to say. 

My parents are aware that this is a problem, and they've done multiple things to try and stop it (buying sugar-free soda or snacks thinking the flavor will turn him off, buying less fast food and packing him less sugary/fatty foods in his school lunch), but it still persists nonetheless and quite frankly, I have had absolutely enough of this. I'm at my wit's end with this, and I tried to tell him so many times to knock it off, but he's not interested in changing his mindset even a little and I just don't know what to do anymore. 

TL;DR - my little brother is a glutton who steals food from everyone in the house, isn't interested in stopping, and gets overly agitated and angry when somebody tells him to take it down a notch, and I'm sick and tired of it",17Jan2019,1
632,"I'm very socially isolated, there are factors that contribute to this but no mater how hard I try I don't seem to be able to make connections with other people let alone make friends - I'm not anti-social or an introvert, I try to go places where people are but it's always me just there on my own while everyone else has their own friends or is doing their own thing. I've tried Meetup (no longer an option), I go to gigs, I've tried classes, but clearly something about me people don't like.

No one seems interested in getting to know me - occasionally someone will talk to me but it's then revealed they only want to get into my pants which is hugely disheartening (plus even then they put no effort into pursuing me such as asking me on a date, it's like I'm not even any worth as a passive hole to fuck), sometimes there's interest outside that but it soon wanes...and it's not like I do something that offends people, they are still friendly with me, but they just seem to lose interest and so the potential friendship fizzles out without going any further. 

The only people who have shown real interest in getting to know me have been romantic partners, but aside from the fact I've been single for two years and you boyfriend being your only friend, once the relationship ends that's it - the very nature of a breakup is that they no longer want to know you, they go on to find someone else they like more.

I don't understand because as far as I'm aware I don't do anything wrong, there are plenty of people in the world who re horrible such as people who are prejudice or abusive and yet they have friends and romantic partners while I'm alone. I don't know what it is that makes me so unlikable as a person that no one wants to even try to get to know me.",17Jan2019,1
633,"Long story short, my friend I've had for a long time who last summer we became a bit more distant as they kind of hung with other friends (some of which I knew) but didn't really bring me in. Not really bothered anymore just for context. Now uni has come around and this friend is still back home, most people have left and they want to come and visit me. We are still good friends but I just don't really feel like bringing them down, i feel like I'm kind of being guilted into doing it. Honestly I shouldn't really have a reason why I don't want them here but I don't really do at the same time? Is that selfish of me? Now they are kind of resenting me because I'm over here having fun and have not extended an invite. Don't know if im being immature or salty would like anyones perspective.",17Jan2019,1
635,"I live in a four bedroom apartment, with a connected living room and kitchen in the middle, the shared space. About 3 months ago, one of my roommates started doing all of her studying in the kitchen. I made nothing of it at first, I mean, it's a shared space, she can do whatever she wants so long it doesn't affect anyone else negatively. Hitherto she's been studying in there every single night, and when I go in there to say make a meal, do dishes, do laundry, etc., I feel like I have to be incredibly cognizant of how much noise I'm making. By no means am I a loud person, but her choice to study in the kitchen has turned the whole atmosphere of the apartment into that of a library's. 

&amp;#x200B;

This was more of a vent; I have no plans of talking to her about this because she can do as she pleases in this shared space. I guess what I'll end up doing is just still treating this space as I normally would and ease up on the noise filters. Yes, I'll still be respectful of her studying, but I'm not going to pay any more mind to my anxiety being induced from this whole situation; like her I have every right to do as *I* please in there, so long as my noise levels are justifiable for whatever it is I'm doing.

636,"Hi everyone, I'm very frustrated with myself right now. I'm a university student and I feel like I'm having trouble reading. I had a feeling that I was a slow reader for a while now, but it wasn't until recently that I began timing myself. My most recent time was 3 hours to read 1 chapter (13 or so pages), and I know this isn't normal because I looked up [forum thread](https://forums.studentdoctor.net/threads/how-long-does-it-take-you-to-read-a-30-40-page-chapter.434858/)s of people talking about reading 30-40 pages in 3 hours as if that were slow. My time is slower, so this has to be something substantial.

I feel like, when I read, I'm constantly rereading sentences that simply did not make sense. Words will zoom by and I'm at the end of the paragraph wondering what I just read. I have a difficulty holding onto anything.

This is especially frustrating because I learned to read when I was 3-4 years old (so I've been told), and I was the only kid who could read in my early classes, and I consistently scored highly on reading tests throughout elementary school. So now I'm just sitting here wondering.... what happened? What went wrong?

So what could it be? A reading disorder? ADD? I've taken a few tests (online tests, nothing serious) that say I show mild ADD symptoms - primarily inattentiveness. Could this be my problem?

Either way - does anyone have any suggestions to help me out? I'm trying out the Pomodoro method currently (which is how I began timing myself in the first place) and I'm trying to adopt the mindset of ""don't worry about reading the whole thing - just worry about reading for these 30min"" as suggested from Dr Barbara Oakley's ""Learning How to Learn"". The problem is, at my current rate, I never finish my readings in time for the next class! I do 4 pomodoros and I'm 2 hours in and not even done with the first reading. After that I get really fatigued and it's hard to get back into it.

Please, any help would be nice. I am frustrated with myself beyond belief.",17Jan2019,1

I don't mind what they become whether thats atheist, Buddhist, or hindu.

How can I tactfully approach this issue and not appear like an asshole. I want to introduce doubts and make them do western valued activities like drinking, drugs, even trying homosexual sex.

639,"I was at school and we played a prank on one of our friends. He took it the wrong way and tried to fight me. It ended with me lunging towards him. He flinched and I called him a pussy. Once again he tried to fight me. I didn’t want to catch a suspension so I didn’t throw A punch but he did. Nothing connected besides my shove. His mom found the group chat me, him and a couple of other kids are in. We jokingly call each other names like faggot and shit. His mom is gonna show the principal the messages tho.

640,"I posted previously in relationships about my husband abusing me. It was removed by mods because they said the abuse sub was more relevant. I am posting in a hurry and panic on my phone. I don’t know what else to do. My husband was feeding the cats as I got dressed to go out for dinner since I have surgery tomorrow and won’t be able to eat for a while. I heard some stomping and it sounded like him chasing my cat around which Inalready told him a million times not to do. I was about to open the door and go downstairs to see and then heard a HORRIBLE sound from my cat. I have never heard him sound like that. I burst downstairs in a mad rush ofnpanic and saw him holding my cat forcefully upside down by his neck and it must have hurt him from the way my cat was screaming. I immediately yelled at my husband “what the HELL are you doing???!!” and he didn’t seem remorseful at all, just defensive and not taking it seriously. He actually had the gall to yell at me and said he was trying to catch him to him in the crate (we have two cats and are temporarily putting them in crates with litterboxes to get separate stool samples after they eat for the vet) and the cat was trying to scratch him. The cat was terrified and hiding. I calmed him down, stroked him, and gently put him in the crate. He didn’t object and is an extremely friendly and well tempered cat unless of course you are chasing him and he feels like he’s in danger.

I don’t know why but seeing that has sent me into a full meltdown. I locked myself in my room and I can’t stop crying. I don’t know what to do. Please help. I have an elderly friend I could ask for help but she and her husband are old and I don’t want to infringe on them too much. I just am so lost. How am I supposed to go out for dinner now and pretend like everything’s ok? How can I leave my cats with him knowing he could treat them like that? Am I overreacting? He’s calmly knocking on the door calling my name like nothing happened and I’m frozen.

Tldr; just caught my husband abusing my cat and I don’t know what to do.",17Jan2019,1
641,"5 years ago I moved into Canada for university, last year I finished my studies and moved into a full-time job. If you were an outsider things would looks very good for me. My job is great, it is flexible, the people are nice and we get good perks, but somehow I don't really like my life. The past couple weeks I have had a hard time just staying awake at work, I have grown tired of the routine. Nothing about my daily life seems to give me enjoyment or satisfaction. I am not sure if I really wanna stay in Canada, the weather is horrible in the winter, and the S.A.D really seems to affect me. At the same time I also feel tied because I doubt I would get a salary as good as this one if I were to move away. To make things worse my girlfriend has seem very distant for the past few weeks. I live alone but seeing her was the one thing that made me feel like I wasn't alone. It has been soul-crushing to see that I love her a lot more than the loves me. She wants to meet up this weekend because she is doubtful about our relationship and I think she wants to break-up. I have been crying and depressed all day, i have gone through lows before but it is incredibly hard to describe how bad I have felt all day. I need help",17Jan2019,1
643,"She never acted this way until my Nephew came on the scene. She did it once to me for a week when he was 6 months old and then again when he was 4 and now the longest one yet, he is 5. She hasn't spoken to me since July 30th 2018

We had a silly fight and she twisted it into a big deal, since then I gave her space. Wrote a letter (a nice one).  Asked my mom over the holidays to tell her I just want to make up and what can I do? She won't even answer my mom.

Yesterday I asked my Mom to just ask her if she EVER plans on talking to me and with some insistence on my Moms part, all she got was ""I haven't thought about it"". . and when my mom asked how long I was suppose to wait she said ""till I feel like talking"" and then my mom said ""does that mean there is hope to make up"" and she said she ""didn't know she hasn't thought about it"".

I called and left her a message telling her I AM DONE. 

Today I printed out two articles that talk about how stonewalling is emotional abuse and I am mailing them to her. 

I was REALLY close to my nephew and it breaks my heart to wonder what reason it is HE  I am not around  .... I hope she isn't telling him something horrible. 

If he wasn't involved I wouldn't care. I feel I have to walk away for my own sanity because I can't wait around for months more just WAITING to be thrown a bone. 

Any advice is appreciated ",17Jan2019,1
