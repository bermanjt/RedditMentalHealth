0,"So in september i met this girl and we became really close, and ever since October ive Been meaning to tell her that I really like her, but im not sure if i'd make her uncomfortable and that she would stop talking to me. Not sure what to do as I really do like her but im not sure if its worth losing our friendship. I mean shes shown an interest in me in that way before but im not sure if it was just playful banter or shes actually into me as well.
Do I risk it?

1,I can't even describe how horrible nausea and throwing up really is for me. By now I am genuinely convinced that it's one of the worst feelings ever. There is nothing comparable i had all kinds of pain even the pain after a big stomach surgery I would prefer to nausea. Unfortunately i have a sensitive stomach and whenever i ate just a little bit too much it starts and it reached a point that i am really extremely scared now whenever i get nauseous. Does anyone else feel that way? When i tell this other people they all say im exaggerating but i am a pain tolerant person usually and this feeling just makes me wanna die...,08Jun2019,3
2,"Like the title suggests, I’ve been given the opportunity for a great beginning in a good career, but I don’t even want it. For some background info I’m 20, turning 21 and this is my first “real job opportunity”

A year ago I graduated from a college with a diploma for “Mechanical Engineering Technician”. This is essentially a diploma for me to become a Millwright and work in the blue collar sector. 

After hearing about the trades booming I decided I would go for what I’ve been told is the “king of trades”. So that’s what I did and after a year I have secured an apprenticeship at a union an hour away.

This job pays $26 an hour where most pay $15, includes benefits and a retirement plan. So it’s a great situation to be in compared to others, but there are some down sides: 

The job is an hour plus drive away each day

I don’t currently have my own car (but have money to purchase one)

the job is contract work, meaning that it’s not a steady 9-5 type. But whenever there is work, I’m called in and have to show up at the job site at any time. 

My issue is, this is a fantastic opportunity for me because of how young I am, and I could stay in this union for life and live a pretty good one at that. But when I step back and look at the whole picture, I don’t even want to take it. While I’m sure it would be a great career, and one that I’m actually decent at. Now I’m in a position where I don’t want it and everyone in my life is proud of me because it was semi-difficult to get and I’m just throwing it away. 

My real dream is to own a business or work in a business field and then start something on my own. But I haven’t been one to take risks or be adventurous enough to prove to myself or anyone else that I can do it. 

I’m just so bothered by the fact that I have this opportunity that is a good one at that, one that two of my friends wanted but didn’t make it through, but one that I just don’t see myself in. 

I look at everyone in the trades, and then look at myself as an individual and don’t see me and this working out with out me being miserable. 

 Now some may say that I should just “try it out and see what it’s like” but that would require a lot of initial investment if you will. I would have to buy about $700 in tools to start, and buy a car to get me to and from work everyday. 

If anyone reads this I would just like some advice because I can’t seem to make a decision, it’s such a good opportunity, but one that I don’t even want.",08Jun2019,1
3,So my bf and I were together for 6 years then we broke up for 2.5 and now we’re back together. He’s noticing how I’ve changed such as how I’m more feminine and expressed to me how much he hates it. He wants me to be the same person I was. I’m upset because he’s telling me I can’t wear makeup or dresses or get my nails done because he’s “disappointed.” It’s frustrating because I’ve worked hard on losing weight(71lbs) and want to look beautiful by wearing makeup and dressing nicely instead of just being in hoodies and jeans. What should I do?,08Jun2019,2
5,"So I’ve been stewing in this awhile: for the 2 years (this is my first job out of college) that I have been with my company, I haven’t been able to submit expense reports, so I’ve been paying them out my own bank account ( totaling $1,652.83). 

It started with me being unsure of whether I followed/understood our policy when I did a trip for a shoot and not figuring out how to submit correctly in the system, so by the time the credit card payment was due, I paid it off myself because I was anxious to tell my manager at the time that I was late and I was worried that I booked my flight out of compliance with our policy and anything outside our policy usually has to be approved by a director or VP . I’ve let my anxiety around this mount up and I’ve continually paid off business expenses myself to put off the embarrassment.

I was promoted 6 months ago and now I have to travel a lot more for work so the expense are starting to mount up. I’ve reached out to the tech team who runs our expense program to see if I can at least start submitting my current expenses, but according to the system feedback, all expenses over 30 days have to be cleared first.

I don’t know what to do and I’m worried that my manager will notice she never has to approve expense reports for myself and will eventually ask me about it.  I’m afraid of fessing up and being embarrassed in a large email chain with our leadership or getting fired and ruining any recommendations I would need if I leave my company at some point. 

I’ve historically gotten good feedback about my performance from past managers and have a good relationship with my manager, but I feel like a fI’m failing at the basic tenets of my role.

Should I come clean and be honest or bite the continued costs so I don’t risk my recommendation when I try to make my next career transition in the next few months? Please help with some POV or guidance.",08Jun2019,1
6,"For frame of reference, I’m 17. I’m in my summer break between senior year of High School, and Freshman year of College. However, since summer’s started, I haven’t done much except stay indoors. 

Part of this is because I don’t drive, so I can’t really go anywhere without asking for a ride. I’m going to get my permit next week, but I obviously can’t drive anywhere by myself for months. I do have a job, but I hitch a ride with my parents whenever I have a shift. Outside of that, I make films. But I feel like I’m wasting my summer by not going out and doing much. 

So, I’m kind of stuck indoors for this summer. Any ideas of hobbies/ways I could get places/things to do?",08Jun2019,1
7,"I applied to a local store for a job, they gave me a contract with set employment start and end dates, which I have fully filled out and submitted (SIN, but not bank deposit information).

My (future?) department manager  gave me a huge stack of papers to read (literally thicker than a textbook) for my ""training""/orientation and most likely won't even be paying me - my department manager does not respond to my emails so I don't know yet.

Before anyone tells me to not work there because of dysfunctional/toxic management, I need the job experience more than the money and no other companies have even replied to schedule/decline an interview (I've sent out at least a dozen application forms).

If I were to stop prompting management to respond to me, could I get away with saying that I was employed for the duration of the contract (without actually working; remember, the contract with the set dates has already been submitted) and that I left because my contract was up (not because management fired me for cause - because they won't respond to me). I DO know what my job description, responsibilities, etc. are.

TL;DR

If I'm a schedule-based employee and my employer ""suddenly"" stops giving me hours, can I say that I was employed for that duration of time even if it means that I never actually worked for them?",08Jun2019,3

Last week said co-worker was not at work, so it was me and the manager.

Until the beginning of this week when the co-worker returned. Everything took a 180 turn. Had a breakdown and really hated that because I didn't want them seeing me cry out of sheer frustration.

What happes it's that I (20 M) met a person (20 F) like 6 months ago in a party in my hometown (I was on vacations) and we were drinking and talking so much time that night.. Then we trade our phones numbers and we talked a bit some days, and slowly I was getting interested in her, what happens is that we are both in university but on different ones, she is at an university on the north of the country and I'm at one in the south, we don't usually talk too much but every time I went to my town in the north we went always to a Café and we have always a good time, but the more days that pass the more I realize that I'm rly starting to like her, we had an conversation today about if she was interest in someone and she said that met a boy some months ago and that had severals meetings with him but thinks that lost interested at that dude, and somehow while she was talking about that it really seems that she was talking about me indirectly... I thought I would have courage to talk to her about me being interested on her but I was a bit nervous and didn't said anything and I lost that opportunity... Now I'm just gonna see her again in 2 weeks hopefully, and I think I should speak to her about my thoughts on her but I'm scared like a fucking baby... I might have lost a opportunity to be with someone again...

People in this story Crush Crush's EX Crush's best friend Me

Backstory: I finally asked out a girl i've liked for a long time. And she rejected me on wednesday. This isn't where the friendship ended.

Story: Today, her ex, (told me this ""She told me about the paragraph you sent her. You know it's funny how you asked her out over text, and you called me a coward for breaking up with her over text""

I never said that, I said ""You shouldn't break up with her over text as that's just not a good move to make""

Later I was told by her ex that, crush told everyone. I confronted her about it. She lied and said ""I never told anyone about that, I don't know how he knew"".

Here is some crucial information on how I knew she was lying; CHATS ON SNAPCHAT GO AWAY, I know he didn't log on and see.

So in class this afternoon we were doing group work, I was with my friend (not important). I glance up because crush and crush's best friend were being obnoxious. I GLANCE DOWN INSTANTLY AFTER.

She goes off on me, something along these lines ""YOU GOT A PROBLEM"" I said ""no?"" she said: ""WHY SO DO YOU ALWAYS LOOK AT ME WEIRD, YOURE SO UGLY THATS WHY YOU GOT REJCTED"" (she hates me because of our past).

I really couldn't be bothered, so I just kept doing my work. After we're done with our work, I end our friendship off by texting her what she did exactly, why that was a dick move, and gave her some important tips on how to lie. I then unadded her, blocked her number and now that's 3 people in the group that hates me.

Anyway, class ends and i'm walking out, crush's best friend comes up to me and say ""YOURE A SALTY BITCH JUST BECAUSE YOU GOT REJECTED"" I instantly said ""Not that because of other reasons"", Crush's friend: ""LOOK ME IN THE EYES AND TELL ME THAT BITCH"". She keeps doing it and I turn around and say ""I am not salty I got rejcted. There is another reason"".

I walk out, go home and have a good time knowing i'm free from those people.

16,"Let’s call him Daniel, so me and Daniel have known each other for more than three years. We’re in this friend group with a girl named Amy, Larry, and ryan. Now Amy had a crush on Daniel, and she gets jealous whenever Daniel talks to me. She complains how me and Daniel are so close and how she doesn’t have a guy best friend, and she gets triggered whenever we talk about person shit and don’t tell her about it. Amy isn’t trust worthy at all, so we don’t tell her every single thing we talk about. I’ve been distancing myself from her and now they’re both getting closer, i don’t mind them talking it’s just unfair in a sense, that she bitches about me being close to him because she’s most likely jealous. They’ve gotten really flirty in a sense and i feel like I’m third-wheeling so i don’t hangout with them anymore. And I’m distancing myself from Amy and now me and Daniel don’t talk that much anymore. I don’t want my bond and friendship with Daniel to break, it’s just that Amy keeps getting in the way, and its frustrating me. Larry and ryan feel the same way i do about this, and we’re all distancing from Daniel because of Amy. So whenever we feel like we’re third wheeling we leave. I don’t want Amy to ruin my bond with Daniel, but i also don’t want to really associate myself with her.They’re not dating, and it triggers me whenever she gets upset when i talk or hangout with it.

17,"Okay so I’m a student and live in a student house, therefore the refrigerator isn’t mine, but like a couple of months ago I was clearing the ice out of the bottom of the fridge, I feel like normal fridges don’t do this but alas, this one does, it collects the water and freezes it at the bottom (idk if this is important but it’s a fridge freezer, with the freezer portion under the fridge) and I think I had a bad day that day or I was annoyed that it was only ever me that cleared this stuff out but anyway I was probably being more forceful that I needed to be and was using a flat head screwdriver of all things! But then I jammed it too hard and it went strait through the side, close to the bottom. Now nothing happened when I did this, no hiss, no air coming through, no noise, nothing, but being the panic stricken chicken I am I started freaking out I knew I couldn’t tell my landlord I can’t afford anything repairs that need doing, anyway the best thing I thought of was to cover the hole with some tape, and it had been like that since today, it started making louder noises but nothing terrible, it still worked and everything, but I had to again clear out the ice and noticed that the tape was coming loose, so this time I used duct tape and some super glue, but now I’m panicking again because we  move soon and I kinda want my deposit back, but not just that I’m worried that the next people to move in won’t be so on top of clearing the ice and the water will go inside the hole and idk blow up the fridge or something,  so is there anything along the lines of blowing up, catching on fire, death, that I should be afraid of happening to the people that move in, and can I do any permeant solutions that I can use to avoid such a thing?!",08Jun2019,1
18,"My dad is not, well, young. He's mid-40's and has major health problems (he could apply for disability and get it). My dad works 60-80+ hours a week, plus working at home and isn't getting raises or vacation because the parent company is cutting everything back. His job is safe, but he makes less than $50k a year. My mom is permanently disabled as well, so she cannot work. We're living in an area that is in high development, and so prices for living keep rising. I have two younger brothers, a tween and a college-aged brother, and we all live at home.


Basically we barely have enough to stay afloat, and we're not allowed government assistance because my dad ""makes too much"". I don't even know who that man is anymore. He's in a haze most days, and he yells and snaps at us constantly (unless drunk) when we try to help him with things. I would bet my left leg that he's going to collapse, have a breakdown, or die by the end of the year due to health complications.


I don't know what to do. I want to get a job, but with no transportation, ability to actually drive, a degree (other than a high school one), and the fact that if I actually *get* a job that means all of the things I'd normally be taking care of would fall to my younger brother who is in college. Not to mention that my two brothers would rip each others' throats out if left alone.


I asked my mom about funds for college, and basically I don't even have the ability to go without putting my family in at least a few hundred in debt at the community college. Money that we **do not have**. That's my fault. I forced myself to attempt college when I was very ill but my GPA dropped so low that I'm no longer eligible for financial aid until one of two things happen:


1) I stay out of all colleges for 2+ years so I can nullify my GPA.


2) Pay for an entire semester, no help. (My local community college pricing is ~$155 per credit hour, *not* including books or transportation fees) 


3) Get a school loan and fall into a debt hole like the rest of my extended family has.


This doesn't even go into that I'm going fucking insane with everything, the stress of cooking, cleaning, caring for my littlest brother, mom, and dad.. And whenever I bring up that I'm stressing about having to take care of them, they tell me that I don't have to take care of them, but **still have to be part of the family and do my duties.** WHICH means taking care of them and my youngest brother, who they cannot raise because dad is never home and mom is too sick. And if I don't do the work, it falls on the college-aged brother, who needs to focus on his studies. :(


I'm at my breaking point. I'm not even going to the doctor regularly for check-ups for my own chronic health issues due to funds just... not being there. I'm having chronic nightmares from the stress, and I just... want to run away. But where would I go? Sure, I can MacGyver and improvise things all I want, but without work experience, transportation, connections or a degree I'm stuck.


What are my options? I'm pulling my hair out. 


Thank you in advanced.",08Jun2019,1
19,Im flying into Florida from NY to see my fav Band AND chill with my family. It is the weekend only. The only way I can spend time with family and get to the front of the line at the show is to pay for someone to chill there until I get there. There are services for this. It isnt hard to find.

She was screaming at him at the top of her lungs on her phone which is extremely unusual, sure it sucks but not to be yelling obscenities and stuff. 




Now, she is on her way to his job!!!!! She plans to “ fuck his shit up” ( NOT how she talks )


She says she is going now because her adrenaline is high 



And was doing stuff before she left at like 80mph, dropping stuff in her room cause of how fast she was. 




When she gets there she is going to make a HUGE scene. I’m scared. Wha if she leaves before he can get her and is not paying attention so much she gets hit by a car or something?

23,"All my life I have felt like I'm the backup person in every kind of relationship. I have NEVER felt like people are reaching out to me and asking me to do things because they want to see me. I barely get invited anywhere period. 

Here's a really good example of it. I have a really close female friend whose birthday is today. We have known each other for years and she's been over to my families Thanksgiving and Christmas parties. She's been to my birthday parties and I have invited her to a whole lot of other things. The only thing she has ever invited me to do is to go see a movie with her last minute. Her birthday is today and she's out partying but did she invite me? Nope. Complete silence from her. 

How do I fix this? Why do people only sort of want to be friends with me? It's making me feel absolutely terrible and I am starting to feel like something is wrong with me. Which there very well may be something wrong with me. I just have no idea what it could be.",08Jun2019,1
24,"For this post I will refer to my best friend as John to keep his name anonymous.

I fear he will become a drug addict. We are both sophomores in high school and have been best friends since the 7th grade. He has experimented with many drugs and it scares me that he will end up dead because of his addictive personality. Me and John smoked weed together for our first time towards the end of freshman year, I enjoyed it but always knew it was never going to lead to anything else. For John it has, over the last few months he has tried LSD multiple times, shrooms, drinks alcohol, smokes cigarettes occasionally and smokes weed any chance he gets. He has an extremely addictive personality and always likes getting absolutely shit faced to the point where he has vomited over my house. I am posting this because Today (June 7th) there was an incident that makes me upset. We were biking our my neighborhood when he stopped to tie his shoe, I turned around and waited for him and noticed there was a cigarette right by his foot that wasn't lit. When I turned around he slid it into his pocket and I noticed it was gone. I immediately confronted him and told him to get the cigarette out of his pocket or else he wasn't coming into my house. He denied it and we biked back to my house and I told him not to go inside. We argued for 5 mins and he kept refusing and acted like I didn't know what he was talking about and then he finally threw it in the grass. I was very disappointed and upset that he denied it multiple times. When he left my house I locked the door behind him and looked out the window because I knew he would go for it.. and he did. He walked around and grabbed the cigarette and as he turned the corner I was there waiting for him. He immediately had a grin on his face and tried acting like nothing happened. I was speechless and didn't speak with a frown on my face and walked back inside my house. I realize one cigarette can't kill someone but it's not about the cigarette, it's about him lying and genuinely being addicted to them and I believe he will die young. That is something hard to confront and say but I believe he unfortunately will. We have spoke and he doesn't think it is a big deal and has literally convinced himself these things aren't bad and says he would never do anything else like heroin but has also said,"" If there was a line of coke in front of me, I would probably try some."" These thoughts haunt me thinking that this can be partially blamed on me since I offered him to smoke weed for the first time together. One last thing I would like to mention is his 25 year old brother condones these things. He goes over his brothers house often and drinks a lot of alcohol, smokes weed and cigarettes with him. His first time trying LSD was at his brothers house and he secretly put it in his mouth without his brother realizing.

Anyways my rant is over. Internet please, I need advice. What can I do to stop him from becoming addicting to drugs or locked up. I care for him so much and don't want him to be the first death I have to experience in my life. Any advice or comments are needed. Thank you.",08Jun2019,3
25,"It all started about a year ago when I put on roughly 30 pounds due to just major insecurities and depression and my coping mechanism was just sweets and junk food. Now, I realize I need to lose the weight for health reasons, but I’m doing that while also learning to love and be sensitive to how I felt when I was putting on the weight. However, my family has consistently berated me for how much weight I put on and how big and fat I’ve gotten and I need to go back to being skinny. Even today I saw my mother’s friend and the first thing that came out of her mouth was how big I am. Those words cut so deep because I’m trying to cut back on junk and hit the gym 3-4 days a week. It just sucks because I’m trying to love my body and also lose the weight but I keep getting attacks about how I look from the people who are supposed to lift me up. I feel like I’m not losing the weight for my health but rather just to get people to stop and leave me alone but frankly it’s not a healthy mindset and if anything I find myself to be even more insecure and sad since before I’ve gained the weight.

26,"Hi. So I’m 16 years old and I live in Kenya. I can’t afford to go to school because my mum lost her job which is pretty unfortunate. But I was lucky enough to finish my O Level IGCSEs last year with 7 passes before she lost her job. I’ve pretty much wanted to medicine since I was a kid but I realized I wouldn’t be happy if I pursued a medical career. It sucks because most of my finals were sciences so my options are a little tied down. 
I’m not one to feel sorry for myself but I know it hurts my mum when I’m just at home because I know she wishes she could at least take me to school. But that’s the thing, I’ve been alright not being in school for the time being (I never really liked it anyway) because I’ve better learnt to play the piano and I’ve been really hooked on Music Production and writing as my hobbies. Anyways, I’ve been researching things I could homeschool so that I can broaden my areas of knowledge on my resume so I decided to take up AP because I know if I do really well I can get a scholarship in a good university in a field I like. I also knew it would give my mum some peace of mind because she wouldn’t feel like I’m wasting away.
So a few days ago she tells me about some university which is offering scholarships in ACCA, CPA, Financial Economics and some other mathematical related fields. She knows I’m pretty good with numbers and said it would be great if I applied. I told her it’s a great opportunity but I was already trying to study AP. She kept quiet for a while then she asked me how much the AP exam was so I showed her the webpage and she looked disturbed. She told me she wasn’t going to pay that kind of money for an exam. My reasoning was maybe she’d get some luck and get a job so she could just register me in an institution and I take the exam. Then she started telling me about the scholarship’s benefits and stuff. The conversation ended with no proper conclusion.
So today, she brought up the university thing again and told me to check the university’s site and see if I would consider any of them. So I checked them out. I do believe they are great opportunities but I don’t think I will be happy doing any of the courses because I’m not interested. I haven’t told her that but I know she really wants me to go for it and the deadline is on the 14th of June.
I really don’t know what to do now. I could either stay with my wishful thinking and pray she gets enough money to pay for my AP exams for next year or just be completely realistic and apply for the scholarship although I really don’t like any of the courses. I also understand my mum’s perspective that she doesn’t have cash and I know she just wants the best for me in life. I’m just really confused because this is a serious life decision.

28,"Today I was working on my project in shop, when all of a sudden a staff member of my middle school rushed me to the office and told me to ""bring all your stuff"", and ""walk on front of me"". I had no idea what was going on, until the school police officer told me that I had posted on my google classroom (if you don't know what google classroom is, it is basically a website made by google that lets teacher post assignments and the students can write back), anyway, he told me that I had posted ""f-word all n-words"" (of course they wrote the actual words), ""Hail Hitler and kill all jews"", and ""there's a bomb in the school that will blow up at 10:10 A.M."". Of course I didn't write these things, but you know, of course they had to bring me to the office. Anyway, after waiting there for an hour, my mom came and we started talking to the officer. Since I was in shop when this was posted, and there are no computers in shop, and I didn't bring my phone to school, it was pretty easy to convince them that I didn't post this, and that I didn't have a bomb, however no one knows who did this, and well, I really want to know. I mean, people already consider me to be a weirdo, but now, since it was posted on google classroom, and you know, rumors, everyone knows about this. I really don't know what to do. I am assuming that I forgot to log off one of the school computers, and that someone that hates me found it and posted all those things.

My dog found a pair of bunnies that had been orphaned. (Mom had drowned in that bad rain we got here in the DFW area.) We brought them inside and I tried to take care of them. I tried so damned hard to keep them alive. The first baby bunny died during the night, and the other bunny was so weak and cold it was obviously suffering. It wasn't eating, and it's poor little stomach was distended.....



I drowned it. I wrapped it gently it some soft cloth, I apologized to it saying how sorry I couldn't save it and how I hope it could forgive me, because I'd never forgive myself. It didn't take long for it to pass. Less than 30 seconds. I can't get it out of my mind.

36,"I’ve had the appointment for this large piece on my arm for almost 3 months. Usually when I book tattoo appointments, it’s going to be within the next few weeks, and isn’t gonna be a costly tattoo. 

I booked a $500 piece for early July. I was feeling really great about it. As time has gone on, I’ve gotten more and more worried about the price. I tried to talk myself into being excited for it, but I finally just accepted that I don’t want the tattoo. Not only am I reluctant because of the price, but also because I just don’t really care for the idea anymore. 

Well, from what I’ve seen online, tattoo deposits aren’t refundable?? I asked an artist who I’m close with and she revealed to me that artists usually don’t refund deposits. I’m pretty bummed. The deposit price isn’t anything too crazy, but I guess I never knew that it wasn’t refundable. 

I’m not sure what to say to the artist when I email and cancel. It’s someone who I’ve gone to a few times, so I feel sheepish and kind of like I won’t be able to go to him in the future.

When I first moved in I paid the pet fee of $300 and have been paying $25 a month for my dog.

41,"Hello there. I'm facing something of a dilemma and would wholeheartedly appreciate any and all advice/insight/wisdom. I want to keep it brief so I will omit information not directly relevant to the situation.

Basically, I'm about to turn 28 and am still living with my parents. I don't have any academic credentials and have minimal work experience. However I am ready to turn the page on this dreary chapter of my life, and so I have been looking into various career options, their salary expectations, and academic requirements. In doing so I have come across a career I never even knew existed which I believe would be perfect for me. I honestly could not imagine a more rewarding career if I tried. However it would require 6 years of studying, meaning I'd be at least 34 before I move out of my parents house. Option B is to enroll in a very different academic program that I would graduate from by 30 and would allow me to work a job that pays well enough to sustain the life I envision for myself. Although I would enjoy this job, it would never be nearly as fulfilling as the former option. 

So essentially it's:
Move out at 34 &amp; do something I adore for a loving VS. move out at 30 and do something I like for a living.

My options are 

AP Language and Composition - which I know would be good collage prep, but I despise ELA and writing. I have friends who have taken the class and said it was good, and the teacher was nice, but I just hate writing. I'm also awful at it and very slow, but the class requires times essays for a grade.


Choir - I'm already in band, but I have wanted to do Choir for the longest time. Music is a huge part of who I am, and if the music industry had no uncertainty about job security something involving music would be my career.


Independent Study with the building renovation teacher - I would help mentor the intro renovation class and have free time to work on learning new trades' skills. I love working with my hands and learning practical skills like hot to patch a hole in the wall, how to change a light switch  or how to use power tools. Another class I really want to do, and the teacher is awesome!


The last 2 are classes I really want to do, but by social norms I ""should"" take AP Language because its prep for collage. I  don't even know if I want to go to collage (my parents seem to think I definitely will), and have no thoughts on what I'm going to do for the rest of my life.

44,"Im still in high school, and my parents got divorced when i was around 1 1/2. for my whole life i stayed at my mums house for 1-2 weeks and my dads for 1-2 weeks, alternating each week. my mum is originally from a place we will call ""The Town"". for the most part, my mum and dad only lived 10-20 mns away from eachother in the city i live in currently. when i was around 9 me and my mum along with my siblings (on her side) went for a trip to ""The Town"". as we were leaving i told my mom that it would be so much fun to live here (The Town is also on the complete other side of the country, I really wasnt thinking). she really missed being there and talked to me about moving there. she explained that i would have to switch schools, make new friends and only see my dad and step mum on holidays. i always like excitment so i said yes, but my dad said otherwise. he wanted me to stay here and that there was nothing anyone could do about it.

I could tell my mum really wanted to go, so i told her that it was okay to go and that i could stay with my dad. she understood and she and my 3 siblings went to live all the way on the other side of the country. this event really messed me up, i was constantly being bombarded by family asking me things and insulting my mum, and getting bullied at school for not having a perfect family (i went to a very religious school in a fairly wealthy neighboorhood, it was almost too perfect for most kids). i changed a lot after that and missed my mum more than ever. when i finally went to visit her on christmas break i got social media so i could communicate with my friends while i was gone. my mum said it was okay so why not? but when i got back to my home city my step mum was not such a big fan of the idea, taking away my phone constatley, never giving me privacy and going through my things. its been like this forever and i feel like i have no privacy or my own life. i love my step mum but i hate being so controlled and whatnot all the time. 

latley i have been thinking about moving to my mums house, but i want to this summer so i can be there in time for the next school year (the 2019-2020 year). im really scared to tell my dad and stepmum, last time i did my stepmum called me crying for over an hour and guilt tripped me out of it. but this time im serious, although i love my family here my mum misses me and vice versa. me and my mum get along so well and i can truly be myself around her.

48," I work at a store that has a broken AC system.

 There have been numerous attempts to fix the AC but unfortunately we've only managed to get the AC working in the front of the store. Employee break rooms and merchandise are kept in the back where there is no AC. As summer is approaching, the heat in the back room is becoming unbearable. There are no windows pr doors to open and no way to circulate air.

 Employees who have the option are taking their break out of office to go somewhere with AC and those who dont are having to suffer it out as employees are not allowed to take their breaks on the store floor. With some of our merchandise being high up in a stock room with very high ceilings, retrieving items is suffocating. 

I want to try and find a makeshift solution to this issue so that my employees arent uncomfortable in their down time. It is also worth noting that our head management will not be taking any action to fix this so it will have to be a DIY solution.

&amp;#x200B;

There is someone that I like who I've been meaning to ask out. She works at a coffee shop. I want to ask by saying something on the lines of ""We don't really get a chance to talk, and I thought it would be nice to grab a coffee."" (it doesn't have to be like that word for word). It's true that we don't get too much of a chance to talk because she's working, and most of the time I've been there when she is working there's a line of people or there are people around (whether they are customers or coworkers). I would want to ask her out for coffee when there isn't many people around, since I feel like that if there's a line of people behind me, I feel like it would put her on the spot and make her uncomfortable.

Part of the reason why I haven't asked her out is because I don't know how to properly respond if she says she doesn't want meet up with me, or that she doesn't want to because she has a boyfriend. I don't know what the best thing to do or say in this situation, and I don't want to say something on the lines of ""Oh. Okay."", and then leave. I thought that I could say something light hearted or a light hearted joke, but I don't know what to say.

Around the same time, my uncle began to play “tag” with me where every time he would catch me he would “casually” touch my boobs. It happened so often that I thought it felt nice and began to purposely stick out my chest and would ask my uncle to play tag continuously. This continued on for a year and it eventually stemmed my addiction to pornography. It came to a point, where instead of  “good” feeling I once got,  I felt nauseous to my stomach. I eventually told my parents just about the touching part and they moved my grandpa out then never talked about it. Currently I’m 16, and i still have my addiction to porn and never told anyone the full story. I don’t want to tell my sisters about it because deep down I feel like they’ll blame me and it will ruin their relationship with me.

58,"Hi Reddit, I have (or had?) a friend who cares a lot about keeping in touch with people she cares about. We went to the same middle/high school, and she continued messaging me into college. I appreciated it, since she was the only one doing so. But since she always texted first, I stopped prioritizing her. I'd check a message and if I felt up to it, I'd respond. If I didn't, I'd wait until I felt up to it and respond at a later time. I responded to all inquiries and messages, but this was because she sent new messages while waiting for a response. Eventually, she stopped sending new messages, I forgot about the old ones that were there, and conversation stopped.

I was content with that. I figured she'd be fine with cutting small talk and meeting up when it mattered. I'd idealized a long-distance friend as ""someone I could rely on regardless of distance or contact,"" and I used that as justification for my behavior. But honestly, I *knew* she didn't feel that way. I was simply going along with whatever was convenient for me. I know I was in the wrong.

But I don't know what to do. I just got a message that reads:

*""Wow, you really were just never gonna messaage me if I didn't message you first, huh? :emoji:""*

I want to apologize, but I don't know how to go about it, or if I should at all. It doesn't feel fair for me to apologize, as that's asking for forgiveness without doing anything. And I'm worried that just saying sorry wouldn't be fully acknowledging what she's saying. However, I also don't feel that it would be right for me to explain myself. She hasn't asked me to.

Ultimately, what I want to do is convey that I'm sorry and acknowledge what she's feeling *without* giving her the impression that I'm expecting (or demanding) forgiveness. If she wants an explanation, I'm willing to provide one, and I want to tell her that I do care about her as a friend (but that she doesn't have to and that she's free to block me from her life if that's what she wants), but I don't want to make the apology about me.

In short, I don't know how to apologize without being selfish once more.

My current draft is:

""Hey \[name\], you're right. It was always easier to simply respond, and once you stopped messaging, I rationalized to myself that it didn't matter-- that we could stick to occasional meet-ups instead. I took advantage of your friendship, expecting you to be there without giving back. I'm sorry.""

60,"I've recently learned a guy who makes me super uncomfortable is going to be in a class of mine this upcoming semester. I don't really see dropping the class as an option. It's not something I desperately need for credit, but it's my fun class this upcoming semester with a professor I really really like and there's unfortunately only one section of it so I can't just switch sections. He and I have had classes together before and he's super disruptive. He interrupts the professor and other students constantly. On the more serious side of things, he can act rather aggressive towards professors. In orgo I, I worried a few times because he's a very large guy and our professor was on the small side and he'd slammed his book on his desk on a few separate occasions. He also has made some comments about my body that make me super uncomfortable, and has asked me invasive questions about myself and about my friends as well. Since the beginning of this last semester when he said something that made me mad in the dining hall so I left, he followed me to my new table, and I told him to fuck off, he's avoided me. Like speed walk out of a room if I enter it avoids me. He's mentioned to my friends he's worried I'll ""try to get him kicked out of the school,"" which isn't what I want. I just want to be left alone, or he can talk to me if he can be not creepy about it. 

I'm really really anxious about being in a classroom with him again because I'm worried us being in the same class will lead to him talking to me again. When we've had classes together before he's constantly asking me if I understood the lesson, to study with him, to tutor him, etc. and it's really overwhelming. He doesn't seem to take a hint very well. 

I really want to take this class though, so people who've had to deal with being in a small class with someone like this, how did you handle it without being an anxious wreck the whole time?

61,"My fiancee and I both live pretty unhealthy lifestyles. Nothing dramatic just not paying attention to what we eat, not exercising regularly, etc.

My fiancee has a thyroid problem as well and has been overweight all her life and has big body image issues. I've always been attracted to her, I think she's super sexy- that is not the problem here. Her thyroid problems have been untreated for a few months (other than staying at the same dose of meds- she's supposed to go to the doctor often and have her levels checked and meds adjusted) due to insurance woes. She's gained a bit of weight in the last 8 months and I think that's a big reason why.

She went to the doctor today (yay!) but stepping on the scale and the dr giving her the food and exercise talk made her feel like absolute shit. She went grocery shopping after and when I asked her why she bought 8 bags of salad she burst into tears and my heart broke. She talks about needing to exercise and eat healthier but I think it comes from such a place of self hatred she can't make the steps on her own.

I so desperately want to help her take steps to eat healthier (not nessacarily limit but just eat more nutritiously) and get more active. But I'm so overwhelmed because it means a complete 180 in both our lifestyles and I have no idea how to start. 

Conceptually I know the steps. Meal planning, grocery shopping, getting some exercise every day. But when I get home from work every day the last thing I want to do is spend hours at the gym or cooking.

62,"My Regional Manager, who of course won’t be named for privacy, started making our schedule each week around 3 weeks ago. The company has a policy that any time off requests or availability changes need to be submitted 2 weeks prior to the requested time. I told my General Manager 3 weeks ago that I begin classes this week (classes are on Wednesday and Friday this week, it’s an EMTB course) and that I won’t be available during those 2 days. I got my schedule for this week on Saturday last week and I was scheduled for Wednesday and Friday opening shifts. I explained to him how I couldn’t do that considering my class runs during the time I’m supposed to be working. He tells me it’s fine, takes it to the RM and the problem is resolved. A happy ending right.... well no unfortunately. I got my schedule Sunday (my job does Sunday to Saturday for work weeks) for next week and they again have me working both class days. I bring it up to my GM again and he says talk to RM so I do. We come to an agreement that I’ll work the other 5 days and have my 2 days of class time off going forward. She tells me at the end of the call she’ll make the changes the next day (Monday) and ends the call. So I think the problems resolved however I had  yet to receive the email by Wednesday so I text her to see if everything’s ok. No response. I think ok maybe something’s wrong with her phone so I send her an email and give her till the next evening to respond. No Reply again. It’s now Thursday so I decide maybe I’ll send another text just to be sure. About 3 hours after texting her I go back to see if I have a response (I was at work at this moment) and I saw she read both messages one hour after I sent them, but made no response. Today I called her after I got off work, about an hour ago, and she basically said to stop bothering her about it. So her I am sitting her trying to figure out what is going on considering she hasn’t changed my schedule at all even though she said she’ll do it at this point 4-5 days ago. I understand she’s an RM and has other concerns, however given how much effort I’m putting forth to make sure I have those 2 days off she could at least give me some sort of response outside of don’t bother me or in the best case change the schedule.

Now I need to add a bit of background info, the job I work at has high turnover rate given how it’s a $9 an hour job and management is kind of bad towards most employees. However I came in a month ago in a time when they needed people. When others called out I would offer to work double to cover that person’s shift, if the opening or closing crew needed help I was the first person they called for assistance. The store managers appreciated my open availability and willingness to help. The Managers, GM, RM and  I are good friends on the job due to these factors now. However this whole situation has kind of put a bad taste in my as I feel let down. I’m trying to figure out what to do if she doesn’t change the schedule, should I go to class ignoring my work or should I go to class?

He was such a good friend to me...but then I got a boyfriend and he told me he was in love with me and we got in a huge fight because I was dating this new guy and heard the “how can you pick this guy you barely know over your best friend? I know you so well” and he’s right, I get what he’s saying but i can’t help how I feel and he understands that too. I ended up telling him months ago to leave me alone cause I got so mad with him since he started doing some petty things. Now I miss him a lot. This was my best friend. Someone who still means a lot. 

I thought about contacting him. But what would I say?? Then I realized I don’t need to rekindle the friendship but just put closure on it because we were so close and then it abruptly ended with a fight. I just want to put peace on it. Were in our twenties. I talked to my boyfriend about it, he knows everything, he is comfortable with it.

I’ve recently begun to feel really burnt out and started asking myself if I am doing too much. This is my first job as a caregiver, and a lot of my other coworkers have left because of the patients attitude and the job. Let me just break down some of the stuff I do in one day.

I come in for my shift and I do light house keeping which involves me moving furniture around and then sweeping and mopping and vacuuming his whole house (kitchen, tv room and dining room). Keep in mind he only uses his room and washroom. So I’m cleaning his family’s mess too. He had me dust all the floor base boards in the house, and this has to be done every third Wednesday of the month. Then I have to dust the ceiling fans, Lysol wipe down every thing that I can, dust all his blinds in the house, mop the stairs and floors. And this is every day that I’m sweeping and mopping, not once a week. 

All of this stuff doesn’t include the things that I am required to do which is dressing him, transferring from the bed to the chair to the commode, meal prep and meds, washing his face and moisturizing, giving massages. 

There is a lot of extra stuff that I do, but this post would be way too long is I listed them all. This is my first psw job so I don’t know if this is normal. Someone please tell me if this is the average workload. Should I say something to my patient?",08Jun2019,1

They are getting ready to retire (Dad is 60) and my Dad's company most likely is going through bankruptcy due to liability for a multi million dollar fire that they are responsible for. There is no charges filed yet, but hearing the papers are saying about the fire, there is very little chance for this company to get out of it. So there is a chance he might be laid off.

I am 24, and am starting to get on my own. I am still on their car and health insurance but am slowly paying for my own stuff.

My parents have more than one vehicle. But our sole pickup truck failed inspection due to a rotted rear frame. This came out of the blue. More or less there is nothing holding the springs on the vehicle. They took it to a body shop and they said it is so bad, that the body shop owner would not (if it was him) have his family ride in this vehicle.

&amp;#x200B;

Dad was PO about this as we need this truck to haul with. He has googled and found a replacement frame for the truck (no clue on how much it cost) from a junkyard near our house. He also has googled how to do this repair himself.

&amp;#x200B;

We are all mechanically inclined and can do this job ourselves. But I do not think this truck is worth saving. This is a job where we split the truck into 2, take rear axle off truck, and weld the new frame (hoping its not bent or bad itself) to cab of truck. 

Its a huge job that is big time dangerous.

I was like ""yeah my vision is really bad and lenses get thicker the worse it is.""

I felt uncomfortable and unsure how to respond so I just left. I told my boyfriend what they said and how they were acting and asked what he thought. He got agitated by my question and told me they were giving me a compliment and to stop looking for drama where there is none.

A complement? HOW? I left the situation alone and after going over it again in my head I really do feel like they were being rude. My boyfriend has always defended me in the past when they are outright rude so I think it's weird he would try to convince me they were giving me a compliment if he heard me right.

-no experience with either of these jobs
-would like to work only 3-4 nights a week max (3 is probably perfect)

The backstory is we were trying to get pregnant for a second child after a couple of miscarriages husband decided he was too scared to try again. Became pregnant that cycle and had x rays at almost 4 weeks without knowing. 

So I have not told him still. Our relationship is a little rocky since last time I posted, and maybe it’s because of me dealing with this by myself. I’m just easily annoyed by him (projecting?) and spend a lot of time alone or just with our son. 

I’ve had three blood tests where the pregnancy hormone levels are a little low, and the second test the levels did not rise appropriately. The third test my levels did rise enough. I have an ultrasound scheduled on the 21st with my reproductive endocrinologist. 

I did already see my RE once after my third beta test. He is concerned because of the x rays, the hcg levels not rising as they should have initially, and my dropping progesterone levels. He prescribed supplementation. 

I’m also constantly bleeding lightly. I did so with my son as well (actually with him I bled a lot worse), but it made for an excellent cover. I have pcos, but usually I do ovulate regularly at my age. In the past I’d bleed randomly and for weeks at a time so when he asked me about it, I said it must be my stupid ovaries and that was that. 
 
My plan currently is to wait for the ultrasound and if it’s good, to come clean. If it’s bad, I’m not sure if I will tell him. 

Thank you for all the input, even if I didn’t follow it, and I hope this update post is allowed. I will further update in about 2 weeks either through my profile or here. I do welcome more suggestions even if you think I’m a total piece is shit for hiding it.",08Jun2019,7

She said I had been harrasing her over social media, when I have not contacted her, except once in an Instagram comment, (Explaination in below image). She has, as far as I know, continued to spread rumors, and continued to block any of my accounts, (My main Gram of the Insta, and a burner account I made to try and contact her to get this lie-making machine to stop.) I sent her an e-mail, (I'm going to redact all identifying information),  that told her I'd like to speak with her, and she said:

*As far as I know, you have been saying I have been harrrasing you over the internet, correct? When the only similar social media account is Instagram, and mine is SCP based, and I don't even post. I commented one thing asking you not to use my name in that, and I also asked nicely, which is not harrasment. Also, it was not very kind to use the h-word in your previous transmission, thank you for respecting this Christian inbox's rules. So, please do not lie about my internet  activity, especially about a lie such as harrasment. If you disagree with my opinion, (I mean fact) that I have not been harrasing you, I would like to hear about it, assuming there is adequate evidence to back it up. Now, the E-Mail is getting long, so I'll wrap it up.*

So I have been managing three bars for 2 years now to pay my way through university. The owners are looking to open a fourth bar, and they want me to import my practices over to the new bar. I have trained three other people, who showed through their work ethic that they deserved the promotion, to be assistant managers to take care of the bars when I need to study or are sleep deprived from work, internship, and school. For the last two years, I have been the one to hire the assistant managers and train them. Additionally, these three bars, since I have started managing, have become the three most popular bars in town. However, they have decided to go ahead and hire a random guy to be the manager for this fourth bar. They want me to set the bar up, impart my methods to managing and running a bar, but they don't want me or my already trained assistant managers to work it. I feel as if they are trying to take advantage of the successful methods I have imprinted into the three running bars, and just taking my methods before they boot me and focus on this new guy. For some added info, the owners are not benevolent people. They have a few company policies that are obviously in place to take advantage of the workers, such as having them all sign up as independent contractors to forgo taxes; nevertheless, this job is important to me because it allows me to be self-sufficient at University, and family money is very tight.

102,"I am not sure what to believe, but the following have led me to suspect my dad may be cheating:

  
a) I recently found a condom and packets of lube in his closet that expires in 2021; asked my mom if they were doing anything (they're both in their mid 50s, and while I know people even in their 70s are active, the way my dad belittles her and never has anything good to say about her made me question the intimacy or lack thereof). My mom said they haven't done anything in the past 5 years and she seemed pretty sad as she told me.  
b) Two years ago I found a condom that expires in 2019, and it's not there anymore.  
c) My dad would say he's going to the gym and he'd be back 4 hours later (the gym is around a 30-40min drive away)  
d) I found a Magic Silk men's thong in his closet as well...didn't ask my mom about that...  


Some background:  
He's been on testosterone meds (hypogonadism) for a while, so that could probably explain his aggression toward my mom (plus people take for granted people they live with). Moody is a good way to describe it; lots of ups and downs. He had been arrested before for indecent exposure (not a sex offender or anything, and my mom and I aren't sure what he did, he seemed embarrassed about it...). He was very devout growing up and always went to church with us the first half of my life. He still goes to church though we tend to go separately. His behavioral changes happened within the past 8 years. His parents both died 11 years ago.  


I don't know what kind of weird thing he was arrested for, It had been very hard for me to concentrate the past few years in university and my GPA fell from a 3.8 to a 2.9 worrying about everything at home. I need some closure. I am thinking of buying a GPS tracker to help confirm, as he may not give an honest answer if my mom or I ask. Is it possible he may be using that condom by himself?

My boyfriend and I, both 16, just lost our virginities to each other earlier today. It was fun and I enjoyed it.

However, my boyfriend had a ton of trouble staying hard, and even though he did manage to penetrate, he did not manage to finish. also, we had to try having sex 4 times, because every time we had to stop to put on the condom, he would lose his boner.

He and I are very close, so our relationship is fine, I would just like for him to be more satisfied with the experience in the future. So, briefly, here are some details of things we thought might have effected it.

a. we were virgins
b. he masturbated a lot that week
c. he denies having anxiety over it but...?
d. maybe i was doing something wrong

He's already not in school for some reason and hasn't been in over a year. Me and him do get along well. He looks up to me like an older brother and I try to set a good example for him. I can't tell him how to live, though. He's not my kid. But I do try to sway him into making better choices, to *some* avail. As it stands now, he has no skills, a middle-school education, addiction problems, a lousy attitude and no future. I'm sad for him, but I don't know what *I* can do at this point. It's like I'm living in the movie *They Live* and only I can see how messed up everything is.",08Jun2019,1
109,"I love my niece (brother-in-law’s kiddo) dearly, and I would do just about anything for her. Tomorrow is her birthday party and I originally thought it would just be family, so just my partner, their family, the niece and I. I learned today it’d be roughly 20 kids, with maybe a couple parents between all of them. 

My mother-in-law seems so see me as a free babysitter even though I’m really not interested in doing so and also really not great with kids. When my partner and I come over to visit, she just hands me my niece and runs off. If we’re all together and others are watching her, she will yell at me if I’m not watching her every move, even when she’s asleep/just sitting around. If I’m not at this kid’s beck and call then I get several earfuls about how I don’t love her and how I’m not paying attention. I fear that while I was not explicitly told I’d have to watch the kids at this party, that will become the expectation because the mother-in-law will be there and she sure as shit won’t let me get away with just eating some cake and seeing family. 

I tried to tell my partner about my concerns and they just said “we won’t have to!”, but then that became “well we might have to just keep an eye on them”. But...I know that “we” will quickly become “me” and “keep an eye on them” will quickly become “babysit all 20 children who are on an extreme sugar high!”

I explained to my partner the pattern I notice with their mom, and they were completely oblivious to it. They said they think it’s nothing, their mom just wants me to “see when she’s doing something cute”, essentially. 

I am under a lot of stress from a new job and the day of the party is my only day off. Am I rude to want to spend it not babysitting tons of kids that are not mine, with very last minute notice, when I’ve said that’s not my jam?

I should say, I’m happy to keep an eye on these kiddos and I’m not going to let them die or anything, but I’m really not the type to be involved in playing, breaking up tantrums, etc etc. Kids are really high-energy and I am pretty low-energy to begin with and this job has pretty much made me tap out. 

Tl;dr: Gonna be asked to babysit tomorrow. Definitely don’t want to do it. Am I rude for saying no?",08Jun2019,6
110,"Hello! I am a 14 year old 5”6 male. The thing is, I weigh 240 pounds. I have a semi active lifestyle as I play baseball as a catcher. But this is not helping me lose weight. I am hoping to reach around 180-190 by the start of high school as I just got on summer break. I have a 2-3 month period of summer break and I know that 50-60 pounds is a lot to lose in that short amount of time. But I am open to anything. I took an intro to weight training class at the high-school that helped me learn the basics of weight lifting. I do not like endurance running but will try it if it helps. I have a gym nearby and currently have a membership, but am also looking for workouts I can do at home. Please give me advice and possibly help me set a reachable and healthy goal for high school. Anything helps.

112,"I’m 17/m, I recently broke up with my ex and I think I made a horrible mistake. I really cared about this girl and I think I may have just spazzed out and pushed her away as a reaction to the stress I was under at the time.

Reasons for breaking up with her:
1. I felt like I was loosing myself, I didn’t like the man I saw in the mirror
2. I felt dirty about having sex and sneaking around
3. Her brother and I used to be friends but we hate each other and he always tried to cause drama
4. She always tried to defend her brother
5. I didn’t feel like I could relate to her
6. Sometimes I think she saw me as some kind of “prize” like I was a trophy to all her friends
7. I’m going to college soon

Looking at all these reasons I still feel like I made a terrible mistake by breaking things off with her. She really cared about me and I wonder if I’ll ever find someone like her again. 

About 2 weeks after we split up she rebounded which kinda still bugs me (call me deplorable or a narcissistic I don’t care I loved her and it hurts to see her with someone else). I fear that because I hurt her I’ll never find another girl again. 

I know I know I’m that typical high school kind that thinks he found “the one” but I just genuinely think that I’ll never find someone as loving and caring as her. It’s been eating away at my mind. I’ve been trying to find new hobbies and go to the gym but it follows me everywhere I go. I don’t want to be upset about this anymore but I just can’t help it. 

I’m not a super attractive guy. I’m fairly skinny and short. I know what everyone says about being happy with who you are and all that stuff. I’m sure in time I’ll be okay but I just really worry that I’ll never find someone again.",08Jun2019,0

115,"I guess you could say my mom is a special kind. She has alot of health conditions and while never diagnosed I think mental as well. She often says she said something she never said and says we don't listen. She is highly hypocritical and is often strict. She takes lots of meds and sometimes abuses me, my brother or my sister about once or twice a year. I do have proof of one case but just the markings that lasted about 3 weeks from a belting and no proof it was her. She constantly goes through our rooms like the gestapo throwing contents of our draws on the floor and looking under our sheets and beds. She has cameras in all main parts of the house to watch what we are doing and she constantly withdraws anywhere from 5$ to 1,000$ from my personal bank account which has forced me to buy crypto currency to keep my money safe. I guess the advice I'm asking for is what should I do, I don't have enough money to dip because she takes it all and my dad won't divorce her.

116,"I (19F) spent the summer overseas last year and will be again this year. Despite only basic communication from my grandparents' live in maid, we would spend time with each other and I would say we're friends. She is around 25ish years old (she's not sure of her exact age).

She always asks my aunts about me and how I'm doing. I've also been told she's gotten much better at our language so I'm excited about that. 

I don't know what to get her. She is from Bangladesh if I remember, and I have no idea what kinds of things she values. I don't want to give her something  that will not be of use to her when she goes back to her country next year.

117,"Reddit, I need advice. 

I am currently a student, and I have changed my major too many times. Once again, I'm doubting myself. I was planning on becoming a secondary English teacher--middle school in particular. I have just transferred to a University after about two years of college. In that time, I also worked at a high school as a teacher' aide. Parts of that job were great, depending on who I worked with. However, I ultimately feel like I failed at the job and don't want to put myself through the training to end up in a career that I am mediocre at. Especially if the job I do directly affects others, which it would. I also feel like I did not get adequate training and was very confused the entire time.

I absolutely love English and all that it entails, but I am always open to careers outside of it. I know what I need in a career--something with clear instructions and duties. I don't like gray areas. I am also very introverted, but I like to be around coworkers and part of a team, while also being able to work independently. I want to get a bachelor's degree as well. The main point is that I need to know clearly what my job is, which I feel like I didn't get in this last position. If I am told what is expected of me, I can do it, and well. Does anyone know of a career that matches? Of course you can't tell me for sure, I just want some ideas. Opinions? Advice? Should I just stick with education? Help!",08Jun2019,1

I ended up being diagnosed with anxiety soon after I was able to find a place. To add on what I was going through, I went through a rough interview and broke down in tears from stress. I just want to work, pay for therapy and feel free from this  but my anxiety and frequent breakdown has caused me to become absolute terrified of job interviews and thus.

122,"My best friend of two years now, who I am closer to than my one else in the world, and I decided it would be fun to get drunk together. We got 20 bucks together and bought 2 four lokos, later that night, we turned on a movie and started to drink and talk. Once we were absolutely plastered we were laying in bed talking and stated to tell each other how much we loved each other. It was a really sentimental moment. I for a long time, wondered what it would be like to be with her intimately and apparently she had also had the same thoughts. So as we were laying on her floor I nonchalantly asked if she would ever have sex with me. She replied yes, and I asked if she was serious. She said yes and then we both brushed it off and continued talking. I kept thinking about it and asked her again. But this time more serious. “Would you let me go down on you?” I asked and she said “right now?” And I replied yeah. And she said sure, before we once again started talking about other things. Then we both decided we would go pee and freshen up. Once we got back to her bedroom she undressed and I went down on her. She told me she liked it and she was glad she lost her virginity to someone she trusted. But she and I both were worried things would be awkward in the morning and decided we wouldn’t let it be. In the morning when we both woke up we didn’t talk about it at all we just went on with the day. Later in the day she asked me, “did last night really happen?” And I was wondering the same thing so that confirmed it. That is the last time we talked about it. It’s been around a week now and I keep thinking back to it. I was really into it and would like to do it again, but I don’t know that I could being sober. I also don’t want to ruin our friendship.

125,"So in my ASL (American sign language) during 4th period so right before lunch. There is this Jewish girl in my class and she is very quiet and I have never spoken to her. And I’m Jewish and German. And basically my friend in the class we have this thing where she yells at me in Russian and I yell at her in German it’s just a weird thing we do (plz don’t comment in German I don’t know enough to have a actual full conversation in German). And it’s just funny because I don’t know Russian and she doesn’t know German so there’s really no point to it. It’s just a thing we do. But usually it’s very quiet in ASL class because we have a lot of voice off time. We usually do this in yearbook class, bio class, lunch time, or when we are passing by each other. It’s just funny to make a big scene or just pretend to be mad each other. So it was loud in class a few days ago and from across the class my friend started yelling at me in Russian so I yelled back German very angrily I mean German around sounds like you are mad anyway. And the Jewish girl looked at me with this look. And while after this little yelling thing she now gives me mean looks. Before she would smile at me because she knew I was Jewish but I don’t know if she knew I was also German. It just doesn’t make sense she gives me mean looks now. I didn’t mean anything by it. How do I make her not hate me again? Also was this rude? And do you think maybe she doesn’t hate me and is just annoyed?

128,"Ever since I was in middle school, I’ve never managed to have a consistent friend group. I was always a floater and would hang with people in the same classes as me that weren’t necessarily part of the “cool” crowd. Once I got to high school, it was a little different. I went to a small high school of about 250 kids evenly spread out through each grade. There were people who obviously didn’t like each other and didn’t hang out, and there were respective friend groups, but I never found a single group of people that were my friends. In middle school I had one best friend, and in high school I had one best friend.  My high school best friend went to middle school with the majority of the people at our high school, so they already knew each other. I was the only one at my high school from a specific middle school so I knew nobody. Throughout school I just drifted to different lunch tables and things like that and never had a specific table I sat at. Fast forward to college, my first year in the dorms I didn’t socialize much outside of the guys who lived in the dorm and hung out in the common areas. My second year, I moved into a co-ed dorm and met people who would hang out with me when we were all together in the dorm, but otherwise wouldn’t really bother. I got out more that year and got involved in campus organizations and even took on some leadership roles. I continued to be active and extremely social outside of parties(I don’t drink or smoke and don’t like loud music, just a personal preference) until I graduated about a month ago. No matter how close I am to somebody, I always try my best to lend a helping hand, listen to them when they need advice, and just generally spread positivity and make sure everyone involved is doing good. I never do this with any expectation of reciprocity because I understand nobody owes me anything and only helping people with the hopes of getting something in return is pretty gross for lack of a better term. I said all this to say that no matter how socially inactive or active I am or how much I try and extend friendship to people I always end up in a situation where I’m consistently excluded from social plans unless I bring some form of benefit to the situation (i.e. can get us a discount at a restaurant). I also don’t drive, and live in a city without solid public transportation so having a car can be extremely vital to traveling with multiple people. I understand this, and it’s one of the reasons I don’t invite myself to other people’s spontaneous (or planned) social outings as I’d need a ride to and from and I don’t know who has car space and who would be willing to drop me off at home without taking them out of their way. Another reason I don’t invite myself is because if they wanted to invite me, I believe they would. In middle school, high school, and even college, people who I thought were my friends would consistently make plans to hang out outside of school and ask everybody at the table/in the room except me. There were times where I tried to maybe nudge them toward asking me along in case they weren’t trying to be rude such as asking what movie they planned on seeing and offering to check showtimes. But they’d just keep planning without me. And on the occasions I’ve tried to make social plans, everyone I’ve asked is usually busy. There was even a time where I planned a small party at my house for about 15 people. I set the date about a month ahead of time, and the week before a girl decided to have her birthday dinner at the same time and invited all the same people. Needless to say most canceled on me and went to her dinner. I get that birthdays are once a year and my party wasn’t super big. But it still was pretty stressful.  These same people would talk to me or see me on campus and hug me and speak first and be super happy to see me. Then exclude me from everything else they do. It’s gotten to the point where I’ve just given up on trying to actively socialize. Is there something I’m missing here? I don’t want to chalk it up to me being unlucky, since the only factor that never changes is me. 


TL;DR: If every social setting I’m in ends up with me being excluded from plans no matter how I try and change certain variables, what else can I try? Is it worth trying?",08Jun2019,1
129,"I have never met this person irl and so I am aware that they could be lying. I have known her for several months though and she has been a great friend and never had any holes in her story.

130,"Yesterday I texted my closest friends telling them how I've been feeling left out from their group and of how I felt like they didn't want me around. After this, my friends apologised. I was told that sometimes they were just quiet and wouldn't know how to respond to what I would say, one had family issues going on and said that I was very 'full-on' (she meant it in no offence), and the other said that they felt closer to my two other friends. 

Which unarguably wasn't the best thing to hear seeming that I already felt left out from the group, so hearing that my friend didn't feel that close to me as the others made me feel even more pushed out. Anyway, now that I've gotten that out of the way, I feel like there's something stopping me from talking to them now. I don't know what I would say, and I'm worried that if I say something that I will get ignored or that things will go back to the way they were before.

132,"I was kicked out a year ago for telling her to help me clean the kitchen that her and my stepdad messed up. I was always threatened to leave her place if it doesnt go her way. So i started renting a place and paying for my expenses with complete independence and cut contact. We hadn't talked for a year. No holiday greets, no birthday texts...nothing. However, my graduation ceremony came up and I realized she paid for my entire tuition for 4 years. A part of me felt guilty so i texted her saying she can come if she wanted. She said she'll go and I apologized for how I acted last year.  She gave me a typical narc response to an apology but it didnt matter to me anymore. Being away from her has let me grow emotionally and I've learned how to practice patience and humility. 

Now, you're probably wondering,why the hell would I even think I should go back. The problem lies with my fear of having no savings left and being homeless. Her place has a gym, kitchen, private cr and a safer location. I have none of those. I'm constantly thinking of the money I have to pay for rent. It occupied more than half of my take home pay. I keep thinking how can I afford to save to feel secure and my life depends on my income. I'm so scared of being homeless. I'm thinking if i should go back to her place for maybe a year, save up to feel secure and then leave. I'll try to behave and avoid conflict so i wont get kicked out against my will again.

But she isn’t allowing any “I love you or I miss you” to be said because she is trying to get over me,  Which is understandable. 

I miss her like crazy and I feel sick. 

The problem is, I emotionally feel like I can’t do a relationship right now. I’m stressed, depressed and just need to go figure things out with myself and work on myself.

136,"About a week ago, I moved to Graniteville, South Carolina from Cape Coral, Florida. I'm wondering if there is any reason for me to worry about this change.

I have recently moved into a development of Graniteville. It's one of those communities where houses are close together, but they are all two stories. This house is a major upgrade from my old house. We had so many problems with the old one, especially with the water. The septic system cost us a fortune, and the food in Cape Coral didn't always agree with me. Here, it seems as if these issues are not our concern anymore. The food quality is so much better and it's more digestible, the people are always trying to strike up a conversation, and the weather is much calmer during ""hurricane"" season.

But I've heard negative things about Aiken, which is the town next over (and the one with all the stuff to do). Stories of high crime, the dangerous roads, and seeing some very broken down homes fills my mind with worry. I want to start working, and all the jobs I could apply for are in Aiken. I need a job, but I'm afraid I might become the victim of a violent crime. Is it safe where I'm at? What are the job opportunities in Graniteville? What should I do to get optimal experience of living here, or should I just move back to Cape Coral? I know it's only been a week, but I'm worried. Did I make a mistake?",08Jun2019,1
137,"I dated this girl for 3 years. Former friend started dating her around half a year ago, not too long after I broke up with her. Talked to him about it when I found out about it (not through him) and he didn't give a shit so I told him never to contact me again and I didn't wanna be his friend. Now all of our mutual friends arent talking to me and keep giving me excuses as to why they're busy and cant hang out even though they're posting stuff with former friend. Not sure how to find or make new friends and I want to get back at this guy somehow, despite the inevitable ""just move on and forget about them."" 

Here's why I think they're all siding with him though: a few years ago they each took turns dating the same girl who had always been known as ""more outgoing"" in place of the word slut. Then they all kept being her friend after she found a new bf, until I came into the picture and talked them out of associating with her. (She had always been pretty toxic and unstable so I figured it was for everyone's best, as it turned out to be)

138,"I know this is so juvenile and ridiculous but I like my best friends brother. he’s only a year older than me and I’ve never seen him this way ever. 

he went to my secondary school and sixth form and a lot of the girls in my year found him attractive but because he was my best friends brother I knew he was off limits so I never developed any attraction to him.

the other day I was chilling with him and his family bc I obviously know them since his sister is my best friend. And idk why but I found him very attractive. 

He would smile a lot at me and we were laughing at each others jokes and he would like flirt with me? I don’t even know , like he would touch my hands and like we were playful. We went out for dessert in the evening and he was so accommodating to me . I would ask him what a certain thing was and he would just give it to me and try and make me eat it multiple times? And idk he just smiled a lot at me and he was so cute? Almost like he knew I was finding him cute. He would roast me and I would do the same but when I would pretend to me shocked and act hurt he would immediately laugh and say he was joking.

I mean he’s seen the worst of me tbh , at a sleepover when me and his sister were pretending not to be drunk , university clearing day when I was crying and he helped me get into university and stupid bad dates and of course when I’ve FaceTimed his sister we would both look terrible and I honestly didn’t even like him like that in any of these moments but now after that one day I have a huge crush on him? Like I’m on holiday right now and all I can think about is him and how incredibly guilty I feel because if my best friend ever found out she would be so mad lmao . She’s expressed so many times how annoying it would be when girls in our High school would tell her how cute her brother was. She’s also so overprotective over her brothers bc she threw a massive fit when her oldest brother got a girlfriend but I know this is VERY VERY far fetched but she would tell me how I would make an amazing sister in law to someone so maybe she wouldn’t be super super bothered .

143,"basically i made a friend in university first year and we got really close as we were finishing our 3rd and 4th/final year. However, we got into a fight right as 4th year was finishing. In summary of the fight, she told my (now ex-) friend that I was communicating with her about our fight which my ex-friend got mad at. I got mad at my friend for telling my ex-friend I was confiding in her. I ended up apologizing because It was unfair of me to somewhat make her choose sides since my ex-friend was her friend too so yeah I apologized. However, she never did and that still hangs over me since she said very hurtful things to me. 

Ever since I just keep noticing things about her that I do not like and make me uncomfortable or mad like prioritizing a lecture over one of our friend’s who got injured in class, borrowing everyone’s notes for a test but not sharing hers, talking down to basically everyone, being an attention hog, etc. 

but she calls me her best friend??? and messages me everyday???? and has confided in me some very personal deep stuff??? i don’t want to just ghost her completely since our university friend group is close and i like the rest of the girls. like i wish she would stop trying to be exxtraaaa close to me and keep our friendship in the group, you know?!?!

Like, stop trying to hold me responsible for my family when I could have had a good life by now if the track I was on had continued.  If there was something more to this situation, I am sure I would have been fine and life would have went on by.  Perhaps I would have been married by now, or in a serious relationship with a guy.  I feel tested on every level, but the truth remains of who I am.  I guess I had a few confusing ideas about certain topics but it's over now.  I read a book, and felt more and more confident.  Books save lives, and educate.  Just saying.  I feel inhibited to say anything, if I should at all.  It's like I won't be believed about anything.  One bad situation ruined it all.

145,"I know the title sounds very cliché, but it's true.
  I met a girl online by the name of Sowon. She was awfully nice to me and we grew closer *very* quickly. But after a while, she started acting off. She made fun of me and others around her. She called people homophobic and racist if they weren't sucking up to her. She often called me her ""slave"" or ""toy"". She was toxic. I wanted to get myself out of that situation but she threatened to slit her wrists with a razorblade if I did.
  Then she came to me telling how her stepdad raped her. I was devastated when she said that and felt horrible. But then a few days later she tells me her stepdad was going to, and I quote, ""my stepdad tried to have sex with my cat."" Soon after she says she lied for attention. Also she makes it very apparent that if she does something wrong she says ""blame it on the bipolar"" or ""sorry, I can't control autism"". She makes up all these mental illnesses claiming she has been clinically diagnosed for all of them. Reminds me of something *cough* menchausan syndrome *cough* and she doesn't show any signs of being depressed, autistic, or bipolar. (this is coming from a person who has multiple friends professionally diagnosed with bipolar disorder.) 
  I knew she was lying and I confronted her about it. She told me she had lied about the rape and sex for attention. She even mocked me for believing it. I blocked her calling her a sociopathic liar. She claimed she 'had connections' and that she would hire a hitman to kill me.
  ""winter, seriously? she's probably a little kid lying to make herself seem scary!"" you ask. If I wasn't scared why would I be making a reddit post? She's over 18 and I even have proof to show she is. She clearly feels no empathy towards people. I mean, she threatened to kill her dad in his sleep and hire a hitman to this random person online. (By the way, the reason she said she was 'raped' and wanted to kill her dad was because her dad took her phone away. yeah.) I may be overreacting but she genuinely scares me. She may not be bipolar but she's definitely insane in some way. I want to block her and cut her out of my life completely but I fear for the safety of me and my family. It could either be a lie or a truth, and if everything she said to me was true then I'd be royally screwed.


  Do I block her? I know she could be lying about all of this, but she's crazy. Im so sorry if this was long, I just want some sort of reassurance.

I used to be 160 and 12 percent body fat, but after a depressive break up and abuse from a horrible household, I comfort ate my way back to 180 something.

&amp;#x200B;

I am stuck into between a stand still of losing weight, and achieve the body I want, or I can actually be happy and Eat however I please. Whenever I see a burger or fries or even something as simple as chips, my mouth starts to water, and I get tempted but I try my hardest to resist it with will. Deep down, I don't even know why I am trying to lose weight, I just felt like it would make me happy, like it would make me whole. Then I look at food, and then I ask myself, would that make me happy?

I have a choice between Having a ""healthy"" lifestyle and great body, yet feeling completely dreadful all the time, or I can eat however I please, and have my body suffer for it. I just want someone's advice on it, since I don't have any friends, nor family. I am not obese at all, a lot of my weight I have on right now is actually muscle, but my body fat percentage is high \*in my opinion\*.

I eat around 1800-2000 Calories daily, Workout nearly 6 times a week and Often get my protein from protein shakes, or various meals. I feel hungry all the fucking time, and even while eating clean, I hate it. I am still hungry. I want to eat more, yet I am anxious due to the fact that my body might suffer.

I don't restrict myself, whenever I want food I want, I go and get it, but I feel horrible afterwards. I feel weak, and I am disgusted with my own actions. Eating food that I enjoy seems to be the best part of my depressing life. I am not depressed about my weight at all, I don't care for my looks too much, I am just wondering which one would make me happier? Either choice I make, I will regret it one way or another. I can eat something I love, and regret it, or I can achieve a body I enjoy and regret that as well.

153,"I have a serious problem.

My work space is pretty large so I don't get to interact with all my coworkers that often. I recently started interacting more with one in particular. Whenever we passed each other, she would give me that ""look"", if you know what I mean and was friendlier than usual.

One day we had a short chat and I got her first name. At the end of my shift, I checked our printed schedule and found her full name. Later that night, I found her on Facebook. Fortunately, her profile was very restricted and had a few pics that were public. I bookmarked/saved all of them. I started using FB's search to find photos that she was tagged in and had a little more success. I checked her public photos again and checked the comments. Some of them appeared to be from her family members and close friends so I went deeper down the rabbit hole.

Half of them were public and I found more pics of here. I slowly went through all their profiles to see if they took pictures with my crush. I also realized that she took pics at a particular place quite often. Using clues about our location, I figured out the name of the church. I quickly googled it and checked the images tab. I also searched the name on facebook and found a page.


The page had several hundred photos. Jackpot! I went through every single one and found a dozen pics including my crush. I also realized that many of her friends went to the same ""volunteering spot"". My next move was to check Instagram. I searched the name of the spot on instagram and found an account. The account was public so I was able to search through its follower list. I searched for my crush's name and found nothing so I started searching her friends; names and found a few accounts that were open. 

I found a few pics including my crush. I checked the ""follower"" and ""following"" lists of of each of their profiles and I finally found my crush's account. Sweet!. Unfortunately, her profile is private. I was going to try on Twitter but realized it was getting late and got some rest.


I went back on facebook and collected the names of all her friends/acquantices/classmates that she had photos with or made comments with. I searched each and every one thoroughly. Some of them had public profiles and had photos with my crush so I saved them. I also checked their tagged photos and found more. I then checked their friend lists to see if I could find the others and was successful. As the weeks went by, I would monitor all her friends/ profiles to see if they posted a new picture/story with my crush and it happened occassionally. I would literally monitor them daily. 


Of course I would save the pics immediately and my heart got a rush every time. Recently, I was checking one of her friends profile and he had like 5 stories that included her. I don't think my crush was even aware the dude had the camera in her direction. Jackpot! It's getting very bad for me. My crush's profile has remained private the entire time which is frustrating because she appears to have over 100 pics. Some of her friends have gone back and forth between private and public. Her social circle that I monitor (10-20 people) have no idea that I even exist other than her and I know all kinds of personal things about them like their life aspirations/goals/hobbies etc. 


They all share one hobby centered around one place. I had thoughts of creating a fake ig profile based on that particular place and seeing if my crush and her friends with private profiles would accept a friend request from the fake profile thus allowing me to see more of her precious pics and possibly daily stories.

Typing this all out has shown me that I'm going crazy. I've creeped so hard that I feel somewhat guilty/paranoid whenever I see her in person. I feel paranoid even posting this. This is one of the worst cases you'll see in this sub I bet. My creeping is strictly online though. I'm calm, cool and collected in person.

161,"I met my girlfriend irl for the first time on May 31 2019 at ColossalCon 2019

This was our 4 month anniversary. This was also the happiest weekend of my life. We spent about 3 days total together. When it came to me saying goodbye however, I broke. This was the first time in my life I had ever experienced a feeling of getting my soul ripped out of my and thrown into a meat grinder right in front of me. 

That pain is still inside me but I’m able to control the crying a lot more since that Sunday and Monday. 

However, pain of the start of our relationship is starting to arise. Here’s some backstory for context. 

In the first few weeks of our relationship it was rocky because of ME, I was new to love. I didn’t know what to do, we had differing opinions on things (I’m republican she’s liberal) so we fought..a lot.. and a few times we nearly broke up over something stupid. About a month into our relationship she lost her dad. It was horrible to see her so broken down. I tried to help her but I was still in that asshole of a mindset so sometimes I would say something heartless like “You’re just gonna have to accept that he’s gone.” I hate myself for that now. A couple weeks later she lost her dog, pouring salt into the cut she had from her father. This absolutely tore her apart. If I weren’t here she probably would’ve taken her life. Back to the main point, at times I would try to find a way to not be on call with her because I didn’t want to. Whether it be me saying I was in the bathroom or saying I was doing something with my parents or whatever. I feel so ashamed that I would lie to her just so I didn’t have to be on a video call with her. All she wanted to do was talk to the person she said she loved. I feel like a horrible human for doing such a thing to her. (I’m crying like a bitch writing this)

After having to say goodbye to her all I want to do is talk to her. It’s almost as if we’ve switched places. When she goes to work I’m so bored. I don’t have anything to do anymore. The games I would play on a daily basis are lackluster now. And the emotions I feel without her are constant sadness, lack of motivation, and in general I just wanted to fast forward time to the end of her shift so we could video call again. It’s almost like depression for me (I’m not clinically depressed nor have I ever thought I had depression so I can’t say for certain)

Anyway, all of the emotions of me being a dick in the past, the constant reminder of the moment I kissed her goodbye and saw her left is tearing me apart and I don’t know how to deal with it. I’ve talked with my dad and he went through the same thing when he went to the military. There’s just so much going on for her that it makes us seeing each other near impossible. 

All I want is to be able to hug her again...please somebody help me. I’ve lost everything.

163,"okay. i’ve haven’t been in a relationship in 5 years prior to this one. 

it’s kinda weird bc we were both on okcupid and we happen to match and immediately started dating from there. it is risky territory being in a relationship where you’re still learning a lot about the other person. as much as i love my boyfriend as a person, and love hanging around him, and showing affection.. i don’t think i’m in love with him. 

i really can’t describe what the feeling is. i just really want to be there for him, help him, and spend time with him, but at the same time, i want to disconnect and just be my regular self before i met him. 

i feel so bad because he has told me before that he is in love with me, and had told me he loved me in person also. i do love him, but i don’t think i can be with him intimately. 

sometimes i feel like i can’t open up because there would be times where i’m pretty upset about what he has said, and he’ll always use the “i’m sensitive” card or there’s times where i’m looking for him to sympathize for me, but for him, it’s like fixing something little.

I keep a journal and try to do a few things everyday for self growth, and sometimes I lose track of what my actual goal is so I end up writing a lot of it down. Today I was looking through my mom's closet(with her permission), looking for old photos when I came across a 'journal entry' of sorts written by my mom all about ""travel and live life to the fullest, be a better person"", and that scared me because it looked like something I would write and something I might say, and I don't want to be like my mom but I'm nervous seeing this that I'm on that path.

I just found out a couple days ago that my roommate and my ex girlfriend have been sending each other nudes. They’ve been doing it for about a week now. Or at least so they say. I broke up with my girlfriend at least a month and a half ago because the relationship was becoming mentally abusive, and I couldn’t let myself fall into one of those again. 

Here’s the problem. It isn’t that I’m not over her. I am. It’s that my roommate had absolutely no consideration of how I would feel if I found out. He thought it was airtight and foolproof. When I found out and confronted both of them (on FaceTime because it’s way easier to tell when someone is being fake with you when you can actually see them), they were struggling to suppress laughter during the call. To them it was a joke. That’s it. My roommate had literally no empathy towards me. Even after expressing my emotions and thoughts, they said they weren’t going to stop. My roommate even tried to make me feel guilty, as if any of this was my fault. As if I shouldn’t be mad. I think the worst part about this though is, my roommate had promised me that if me and her broke up, that he wouldn’t do EXACTLY what he ended up doing. So not only has he completely breached my trust, shown no empathy towards me and acted as though he did nothing wrong, but I need to room with him next semester.

Everyday I go to work/school, then hang with my friends for the remainder of the day. All we do is blow our money on weed and food. Like it's bad, every day i spend at least 10 dollars on weed and at least 20 on food. I have to eat after I smoke it's a habit now. I want to break out of this habit though.

I want to stop all of it. I want to stop smoking weed but I know I can't. It's impossible. I want to stop blowing my money every day, I can't even save over 300 dollars, it all goes to junk. How do I stop?? 

Where I live it's not many people I know so i've been around with the same people for the last 5 years or so. I want to make new friends but i really don't know how? I want to save money but I can't?

172,"So my parents, my stepdad is approaching 60 and works as a damn good electrician for really shit cash (I wish he would join a union or something but he's vehemently against it, he makes nothing compared to a lot of electricians) and my mom is probably approaching dementia (she buys Itunes/Google Play cards and gives them to some guy that she thinks is tom cruise on the internet and doesn't pay the bills). My sister also has a job with Best Buy and now makes almost the same money I do, but she pays literally nothing for bills because she just throws tantrums and doesn't understand how to be a fucking adult.

I moved out today and had been planning this for a couple weeks. They are almost 1k dollars behind on the cable bill and I have to pay $100 on the electric bill probably next month since I was responsible for that at the time (the electric bill was my ""rent). I am 27 and eventually I felt like I was being taken advantage of because I've had to cover large amounts on the cable bill to keep services on because my mom wouldn't and my stepdad couldn't. And recently I had to forward myself money using an app called Earnin which is basically like tiny payday loans in 100 dollar increments a day if you so choose, and I had to forward myself 100 dollars to cover the land rent (they own the trailer they live in).

I don't make dank cash either but for basically 2 years I was the top earner in the household, and more recently I began buying food for everyone to eat because everyone was always complaining they were hungry (mostly my sister and my mom). I stopped because my sister always ate all the food and never left anyone any food, and her and my mom steal food that blatantly is not theirs.

To clarify, we were not a family unit, it definitely felt like more of a ""roommate"" atmosphere.

Anyway, I moved out today and I'm just like... I know I had to move on with my life but at the same time I don't know what they'll do without me helping them. The rent where I'm at requires me to hold most of my money for me to live even, so I won't be able to help them as much. And a part of me doesn't really want to, but at the same time I know they need money help, but I was so mad of just being taken advantage of. I'm excited to be set up in my new place, but I just feel guilty too. Everyone around me just says ""you gotta take care of #1"", ""you gotta get out of there"", stuff like that.

Does it wear off with time? I assume anything does, but I dunno, I just feel really bad. It was not a good spot for me to be in (considering my room got 110+ degrees sometimes even with my computer off) but I dunno. I can't shake the feeling they're gonna be homeless in like 3 months or something.",08Jun2019,1

I would be going to high school at an Albuquerque public school if i weren't going to a charter school, so hopefully if anyone knows the specific rules of APS they can answer the question.

&amp;#x200B;

I have to repeat 9th grade. I went to a public charter school that requires a 75% to pass a class. The high school in my district only requires a 60% to pass a class. I failed every class except for PE/Health with scores in between 60 and 75%. My school also weighs the credits differently, so instead of having 4.5 normal credits and .5 credits from an elective, like the public school in my district, at my school there are 6 normal credits and no credits from an elective. I have 3.5 credits from my school. If i had gotten the same scores in all my classes at the public high school in my district, i would have 4/5 credits, and I would be able to get the 1 credit back in summer school. But my school is year round meaning I can only do 1 session of summer school, for .5 credits. I cant do any credits recovery at my school next year because I failed an online class which means I can never take an online class again. Apparently public high schools only look at the letter grade on the transcript and not the number, so even though by their standards I passed enough classes to transfer, all my C's are F's.

I know I can repeat 9th grade at a different school, because I passed 8th grade but I want to know if there are any APS public schools or charter schools in Albuquerque that look at the number and not the letter, or if I'm screwed no matter what and I should just repeat 9th grade at a different school.",08Jun2019,1

So i know this guy from school but we aren't ""friend, friends"". I normally see him in the hallways and we just say ""what's up?"" or if we see each other at the end of the day we would walk with each other to our pickups but that really was it on our friendship levels.

Now i don't think he's very popular since a lot of my other friends say they don't like him for reasons so i felt a little bad for him, he does have friends but a lot of people say he's annoying and stuff like that.

A couple days ago he asked me for my phone number, but i couldn't say no so i gave him to it. We had this really strange conversation that kind of creeps me out so i don't know what to do in this situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'll just format how our conversation went through bullet points, he'll be J and ill be H.

&amp;#x200B;

* J - Yo sorry it took me so long but hey, its me
* J - I just wanted u to have my number so u could add me as a contact

**The next day**

* J - How was your day?
* H - Oh sorry man i forgot to text you, but it was good hby?
* J - Oh please don't worry about it! Mine was good thanks for asking
* J - What are you doing this weekend?
* H - I was going to something this Saturday, hby?
* J - I'm going camping, this ride is too long lol
* J - I don't think i've said this but you seem like a nice guy and if you need anyone to talk to i'll be here

(This seemed a little weird to me but i just thought he was trying to be nice so i was fine with it)

* H - Oh thanks thats very nice, ill keep that in mind.
* H- How long are you camping for?
* J - Oh np, maybe we can hang out on Wednesday? Ill be camping until Monday
* H - Yeah that day works, where u camping?
* J - Up by a lake its not far.

(Why would he say it was a long ride if it wasn't far?)

So for a little bit we talked about what we were going to do and he suggested to go to this indoor play house with go karts and stuff but it seemed like a kids place off of the pictures so i was just going to say lets watch a movie but then it go a little weird. I was gone so i came back to all these texts.

**An hour later**

* J - We can pick you up at your house

**15 Minutes Later**

* J - Its up to you

**2 Hours Later**

* J - Hey i probably won't have service so text me when you can

**3 Hours Later**

* J - Yo i'm really sad, i just learned my girlfriend cheated on me

**1 Hour Later**

* J - Nvm :)

When we first started dating, we both had really high sex drives and were having sex multiple times every day. It wasn't so much a gradual decline, but after maybe a year together I just stopped wanting to have sex. It wasn't an issue of attraction, but just I was never in the mood. I knew his sex drive was still the same, though, and we talked about it and he assured me he didn't care if we weren't having sex because he would rather be pent up then me being uncomfortable or feeling forced to have sex. Eventually, we got our groove back, but now we're living together and it's been months since we've had sex. Again, on me, because I just haven't really been in the mood, and him being on new medication is affecting his sex drive as well, so we're both currently just never in the mood. I feel like we're on the same page, and he assures me that not having sex isn't going to be a big deal, but I'm still worried that something is wrong with me/us? A lot of times when people talk about problems in their relationship, they'll always list lack of sex as a huge thing. I know he's told me it's not an issue, but I'm still worried it is. Is it okay that were not having sex? Alternatively, is there anything I can do to boost my sex drive without having to take medication or something?

tl;dr: went from having a super high sex drive to a basically non-existent one, worried about what this means for the relationship despite bf's assurance this is not an issue",08Jun2019,1

We had met over the summer at a friend's grad party (just finished 8th grade) and we talked a little bit but nothing unusual, and we ended up becoming decent friends. Fast forward to the beginning of freshman year, I make friends with someone that we'll call John. A bit into the year I realize that John and Megan are dating, and I don't think too much of it, and I continue through the year. Throughout the year I do struggle a bit with the thought of being with someone, as I haven't ever really been in a relationship nor do I know what I would even do given the chance to be in one and I just kinda feel hopeless because not only is this girl in a relationship but she's in a relationship with one of my good friends, and idk i just pushed it down and ignored it. fast forward to about now and John tells me he's lost feelings for Megan, and that kicks back up all these emotions that I had pushed down for so long because the reasons I had to ignore them we're gone, and now, I'm not really sure what to do . When they broke up, I made sure to be by her side side because I knew it would be hard on her, and now I'm at the point where I think she's moving on and idk what to do.

191,"I must've noticed the bites about a week ago. At first, I thought they were just a one-off- I have dyshydriotic eczema, so weird itchy skin things are pretty common for me, and I live in a swamp, so mosquitoes and other bitey bugs are pretty abundant.

The thing that got me paranoid though, was that they were mostly appearing overnight, and that they were unlike any bug bites I have had before. So I fell into a research hole of looking up bed bugs. It is probably important to note that I am extremely scared of bugs. So over the last few nights, I have dismantled my room looking for bed bugs. 

I have found nothing. No bugs, no eggs, no fecal stains, no blood spots. The bites persist.

I am going insane. I can't sleep. I am checking the entire mattress for bugs every five minutes. I am crying through the night and texting my boyfriend every five minutes for some vague semblance of comfort. I am so crazed that I am now turning to internet strangers for help.

I have compiled a list of reasons I may or may not have bed bugs:

REASONS NOT IN FAVOR OF BED BUGS:

1) The bites. Bed bug bites usually show in clusters, but these appear one at a time very wide apart. They are also very, very small (like ingrown hair small), and often aren't red at all unless I scratch them. They don't even show up in pictures because of how small they are. Some of them have also appeared in places a bed bug may not roam (i.e. my rump, which is protected by two layers of clothing during the night.) 

2. I have not found any concrete evidence of bed bugs during my inspections.

3. As I mentioned before, I have eczema, so I'm no stranger to weird skin things. This may just be a weird skin thing (though I will note usually my weird skin things don't spread themselves out across my body like this.)

REASONS IN FAVOR OF BEDBUGS:

1) The bites. They appear overnight. They itch. They are bumpy. They appear mostly on exposed areas- my hands, wrists, feet.

2) According to the research I've done online, you can have bed bugs and never see a bed bug, or see any of their leavings, or have a reaction to a bite, and also exterminators can't tell you if you have them. It is entirely possible for me to have entirely invisible, phantom bed bugs.

3) One of the symptoms of having bed bugs is a pervading fear and paranoia that you have bed bugs. I am definitely paranoid.

Please help me. Please tell me there is some skin condition that causes random, very spaced out itchy bumps. Tell me that I can't have bed bugs without seeing some evidence. Tell me the description perfectly fits some other bug. I can't afford an exterminator and I work 3 jobs so I am already up to my ears in stress without BUGS. Please, please, before they have to lock me in an asylum and I start seeing bugs there too.",08Jun2019,7

193,"This happened yesterday. So I was driving behind another car at a reasonable distance and we were both going under the speed limit. The driver in front of me stops at the stop sign and I stop behind her, again at a reasonable distance of at least a car’s length away. After about 15 seconds of waiting at the intersection, which I didn’t think was out of the ordinary since there was a decent amount of traffic going by, she promptly puts her car in reverse at full speed and hits my car. I was kind of in shock but we both got out of our vehicles, and she immediately apologies and states “Oh my god I’m so sorry I had no business being in reverse. I didn’t even see you.” Then she asks me to meet her at the barber shop she apparently works at across the intersection, which I deemed to be reasonable since we were blocking the road. I followed her there, and immediately notice my car makes a grinding noise as I accelerate and my car is shaking heavily as I’m driving, none of which was a problem before. When we get out of our vehicles at the barber shop, she proceeds to try to convince me to take $75 - $200 cash to not get the police or insurance involved. She also stated it wasn’t even her car and that she needs to call her brother, who apparently also owns the barber shop. For some reason, I waited for her brother to show up before calling the police or my insurance company (Geico). When her brother shows up, he proceeds to try to convince me to take the cash, and states she doesn’t need the points on her license and that the damage isn’t that bad and that my deductible will be more than the damage is worth, and even says he’ll take my car to the mechanic across the street that he’s friends with. I tell them there is something mechanically wrong with my car and that $200 wouldn’t cover the damage and that I would feel more comfortable filing a police report and letting insurance handle it, especially since I know I wasn’t at fault. As soon as I start dialing the police, they start saying that they’re just going to lie and tell the police I rear ended her. They even go so far as to call over some pedestrians in the area they know and tell them to be their witness and lie to the police. I should have started recording immediately but I was on the phone with the police and trying to contact my insurance company to file the claim. As soon as I get off the phone, I start recording video of them conspiring to lie about what happened. Right before the police show up, they apologize and say they are going to tell the police the truth about what happened, that she backed up into me, so when the police officer showed up, I just explained what happened with the accident, and left out the part where they threatened to lie about what happened, since I assumed they were going to tell the truth. I get the police report today, and they did lie on the police report and say I rear-ended her. Also on the police report, it states that I said I was trying to pass her, which I was not and didn’t say that to the officer, and have no idea where she got that. Also, it states that she estimates the accident happened at only 3 miles per hour, which is impossible given the kind of mechanical damage done to my car. Geico allows only 25 megabyte uploads to their website for claims, and my videos showing them conspiring and changing their story are high quality 4K videos over 300 megabytes each, so I can’t upload them. My brother is a lawyer with experience representing insurance companies, so I will be asking him for advice, but wanted to see if anyone here with experience has advice they can share on what I should do. Some of the police crash report is inaccurate about my own statement and I would like to have it corrected if possible, as well as include the fact that they basically tried to blackmail me into not calling the police.

EDIT: The other driver also has Geico, don’t know if this affects anything in any way. Also, those pedestrian “witnesses” never made statements and the crash report states no citations were issued due to conflicting stories.",08Jun2019,2

My step daughter is in town this summer for a few weeks. We don’t get to see her too often; a few times a year. 
Earlier today while shopping at the store, she pointed to Children’s Dimetapp Cold and Cough syrup (nighttime) and stated “mommy gives that to me every single night so I don’t get sick”. 

Now, of course a 5 year old isn’t going to understand that cough syrup doesn’t prevent you from getting sick, and that her mom is probably doing it to get her to sleep faster.

198,"Whenever my friend plays video games, I notice that he becomes overly frustrated or doesn't have fun and quits immediately.  


For example, when he is playing single player games like GTA V, he will constantly complain and then ""rage quit."" I use quotes here because he says that raging would mean that he is smashing/slamming stuff, but essentially what I mean is that he quits really fast after getting slightly irritated. He even exhibits similar behavior in more casual environments, like surfing or bhopping in CS:GO. These aren't too bad, but these are honestly more casual modes of play, and I am surprised that he gets so frustrated over them. Next is the behavior he exhibits in more competitive environments, but these are honestly just friendly rounds of custom games that we play with each other that shouldn't be taken too seriously.  


It was just me, him, and another friend playing a round of gun game in Counter-Strike: Source.  He missed his shots and died, and then he slammed his mouse to the point that it dislodged the scroll wheel and it stopped working. He was able to fix it though and says it wasn't really broken, but the point here is that he got angry enough and slammed it in the first place. Another example is that today we decided to play a custom game in Overwatch (also similar to gun game), and there is a warmup time that says ""Waiting for players"" or something. The 3 of us were just jumping around shooting each other while waiting for another friend to join, and I guess he died so he quit/disconnected without saying a word. I say something along the lines of ""Ah come on man join back,"" and he says he will. Some time goes by and he hasn't joined, so I ask him if he will. He says ""Perhaps."" and I say ""Oky man just say yes or no"" and he finally says ""No I'm not."" But this behavior is really annoying. We're just playing as friends, not taking it too seriously, and he is always disconnecting and quitting without saying a word to us or letting us know. And him saying ""Perhaps"" is something he says a lot to ""yes or no"" questions that I'm guessing he has some fear/anxiety in answering.",08Jun2019,1

I am the oldest of 3 girls. My dad has always been a hardass but pretty much only projected that on me. He relentlessly gave me shit for not going to college. I tried half a year while working 6 days a week simultaneously to pay for life and school. Decided I love my job more than going to school with no purpose. This resulted in my dropping out. I am now the General Manager at my place of work a couple years later and make great money for my age and lack of higher education. I’m also very responsible with my money, unlike him. He thinks my job is stupid and the industry I am is “not a career”.  I don’t give a shit what he says at all. My mindset is much different than my sisters. 

About a year ago there was a falling out with my mother. She was arrested and my younger sisters had to move out. Because of this after all these years my dad (who lives a few hundred miles away) finally “stepped up” into a fatherly role. He started projecting that hard ass attitude onto my younger siblings. Especially my youngest sister who is still in high school. She has always been a good student but since the whole ordeal with my mother she’s fallen a bit behind in school (she is flunking one class but still maintains good grades in all others). She has also had some mental health issues. She self harmed and tried worse. She sees a therapist for this but dad thinks it’s all a joke and nothing serious. 

She received a great scholarship which is paying for all her education but not room and board. Because of this she needs to come up with money for that. She asked him to co-sign on her student loans for her and he refused. She just got a job but is under so much stress and anxiety trying to make as much money as possible before having to leave for school. She’s been crying every day, all the time, due to the tremendous stress. He has also said numerous times he has set up a college fund for his 12 year old step daughter. He never did anything like that for us. It hurt my sisters feelings as she has asked him for help and he refuses.  I want to help her. I make enough and have enough money to help pay the rest of what she doesn’t her self. But I also want to call my dad and tell him he’s not going about this well. There is a lot more to this family dynamic and situation. I tried to sum it up as easily as possible. What do I do?",08Jun2019,1
200,I recently sent an email after being accepted into a volunteering program. It has been 6 days with no response and since summer vacation has started I'm just assuming they're busy. How should approach this? Should I knock on their door twice or send an email asking them to read my previous one?,08Jun2019,1
202,"I think I've said this like 30 minutes ago but I'm really worried right now, it's been 2 hours since I broke my desktop and I don't know what to do or say to my mom, it doesn't have a warranty or anything and I don't think I can deal with the stress right now",08Jun2019,1
203,So there’s this girl I like from my job and she’s a waiter and I was working as a bus boy that day so it was almost closing time and the last table of her section was still there. She looked like she wanted to get out of there and (I don’t blame her cause everyone by the end of the night is tired and just wants to go home) but she asks me if I can clear off the table for her and I said yea I mean I have to stay here anyways cause there’s still more tables eating on the other side of the restaurant. So she grabs a $5 bill from her bag and she’s like “here take it” and I said “no don’t worry about it’s 1 table” but she just insisted and put it in my pocket as I had my hands full and left. I really didn’t want to take the money since I like her and also because of the manly instinct we have of men that we should always pay for women and etc. Although I understand from her side she’s just trying to be nice. I feel like I want to give it back to her but  probably do it in a clever way or just tell her something funny about what I did with the money she gave. What do you guys think I should do or what clever thing should I say to her about her giving me the $5?,08Jun2019,2
204,"So I have a had a long distance relationship with this girl for nearly a year. We met on Omegle(I know I know) but we both started liking each other a lot. (Yes I know how some people will react to that if they don't support or never have tried online dating) I won't lie and say everything was perfect, we both messed up during the relationship. But for the past I would say month maybe 2 she has been getting more distant. She replies to texts less and for 2 or 3 days now not at all. She has been saying that her service has been messed up as well as her internet. Therefore, she can't really Skype or call. Now, last time something like this happened (she was kinda sick) I was able to text her mom and her mom replied and said she was in fact not feeling well etc etc. So I do have her moms number but she has not replied to any of my texts either. Now a while back me and my girlfriend had a very serious argument that resulted in us taking a ""break"" (neither of us saw anybody else or anything) and afterwards she informed that she blocked my number in her moms phone. Fastword back to now and I have tried to a couple textnow accounts just to see if she was ignoring me specifically or anybody that texted or called, as well as text her mom to see if she was okay. I should point out that I say a couple because I made like 2 others because my phones service started acting up and I had to use WiFi to communicate and since I don't use Facebook textnow seemed like the easiest most reliable options. I deleted the app and lost the accounts since they were meant to be a temporary one day thing, hence why more accounts were made. Her mom always replied though. Now she doesn't either. I gave it one last shot today and made another textnow (like I said I don't keep the accounts and I had already deleted and had to redownload after using it to get ahold of them both after my own service was being weird again) I called her mom from that number and her mom answered. I listened for a second as nobody was talking but I heard something. Her mom hung up or the call dropped or whatever. I called back a bit later from that number and she answered again, this time saying ""Hello?"". Don't ask me why but I got a weird feeling and hung up and deleted the account. I don't quite know why as I called trying to get an answer but for some reason when I did I just sat there not knowing what to do. Now I waited for a couple hours sent some texts to my girlfriend. I finally bit the bullet and made one final textnow (just in case I was ghosted and my number is maybe blocked. I wanted to be sure she saw this) wrote out a short message saying I didn't want this to end and I loved her. No reply. Yes I admit I cried a bit when I sent that text. I don't know what to do as since she is long distance (another state type of distance BTW) I can't just up and go to her house or something.
I just don't know what to do, like do I keep trying? Move on? When is too soon to say I am single? How long do I wait? You know? I mean these past 2 or 3 days she has not replied AT ALL. Like not answering calls or texts or anything. But for the past month or so she has been getting more distant. 

 A few things I wanna point out: 1.  I know not everybody will undertsand having feelings for someone so far away or you've only talked to through video calls and texts, I get that. And to be fair I was never 100% sure we would last but it does still hurt and I do still feel something for her. 
2. Please keep in mind when reading this I made a lot of textnows yes, but again I deleted them after I got my intended purpose out of them and didn't count on maybe needing/wanting to use it again.
3. Also keep in mind I would not have used textnow at all if we lived closer together. I would just go see her and ask what was up.

4. Feel free to ask me anything about this but please don't judge and try to be open minded about the distance thing. I will explain more/better if needed.",08Jun2019,23
205,"so I recently might have realized that I become kind of a dick to costumers by the end of my shift. I work at an ice cream shop from 6pm-12am and I’m not complaining it’s only a little bit of hours, but it does get busy ya know since its summer. By the end of my shifts I tend to eat SUPER fokin tired m8. Like emotionally drained haha so when a costumer comes in at 11:30 and orders like 3 shakes and 5 sundaes, you can only imagine the face of disappointment I hold as I scoop. I notice that my manager is super good at faking that he’s completely okay with people walking into the shop 5min before we even close, and it’s kind of embarrassing. Like costumers can totally tell I’m not in the mood to serve anyone, and they’re damn right I’m not, but it’s so unprofessional and I want to be better at it! Any tips on how to idk not be a dick, thx ~ sincerely pb",08Jun2019,2
206,"So some backstory, I grew up being a very petite girl. I am under 5 feet tall and was under 100lbs until I was a sophomore in high school. Around my senior year of high school I started gaining a good amount of weight due to some family problems going on and my grandmother was very sick. I went from 95lbs to 135lbs in just a few months, I hated myself. 

I was going to college in a few months and wanted to lose the weight so I started to barely eat one meal and a day and stay up for hours working out, trying to get the weight off in time. I was showing signs of anorexia but still say to this day I wasn’t. 

Fastforward halfway through my freshman year of college, I was on my laptop. Now my best friend went to same college as me and used my laptop to skype her boyfriend. She told me boyfriend “If I was as fat as her then I would starve myself”. Reading this made my heart drop because not only was she my best friend but I was finally at a place where I started eating normally and I was getting out of bad habits and that completely shattered me. 

It is now 4 years later and I still feel shattered. The past few weeks I have been not eating as much again and I keep telling myself to stop and eat but I just won’t allow myself. I don’t know what to do. How do I stop myself from doing this to myself every few months?",08Jun2019,3
207,"I just finished my 2nd year in community College and typically that's when you're supposed to graduate or transfer out to a university. I'll probably need another year before I can properly leave the school but lately I've been feeling like I'm not getting anywhere. 

I really very seriously considered dropping out that I haven't even scheduled my classes for the next semester yet.(that's an easy fix if I  decide to continue though) I also didn't fill out the next school year's financial aid form which would pay for most of my classes. This is mainly because I really wanted to drop out. 

Near the end of last semester, instead of preparing for the next school year I ended up applying to a full time job position as a flight attendant. I recently got an email from them that they would like to schedule a phone interview and I cant do that right now because I don't have all the things I need for it yet. 

I really screwed up. 

For some reason a lot more people have been asking me what I'm studying in school and I give them an answer like I'm still going to be studying what I want. I don't tell them I'm thinking of dropping out. 

I don't know what i want. 

I don't know if I still want to stay in school for another 3-4 years or if I just want to leave and do something else. And if I do stay in school I know that there's gonna be a problem with my financial aid because (like the idiot I am) I didn't fill out my form in the proper time.

I don't know what I should do. 

I haven't told anyone about this yet. No one knows that I applied to that other job. No one knows that I was thinking of dropping out. I came pretty close to telling my siblings but I chickened out even though we tell each other everything. 

I need help on deciding what I should do. Any advice?",08Jun2019,1
208,"I have to move soon pretty far from her. She has been depressed since as ling as I knew her but it does not make me love her any less. She cuts and told me that she is suicidal. I told her everything I could possibly say to her but I feel like i’m just saying the basic things i was told to even though everything I say is true. For example, “I will always be here for you.” and “I love you so much.” also “Nothing will ever change how I feel about you.” How can i actually help her though. I feel like it makes her more upset when I say those things. 

I just want to help her best I can so any advice is appreciated. I love her so much and I don’t want anything to happen to her.",08Jun2019,1

214,"I’m a 34 year old woman, been with my husband 13 years this month. I love him tremendously. We’ve been through so much in our 13 years that I can’t even begin to explain. 

However, I walked into my husbands man-cave this evening to see him on some kind of sex chatroom, and he was in the middle of role playing with a woman on there in PM. At first he tried to hide it and then he fessed up that he has been doing this for several days. 

I remained calm and told him we needed to talk about this. I wanted to fly off the handle and react with my emotions instead of my head, but I didn’t. I held my shit together and handled it like a grown up. 

The first thing he did was blame me for him doing it. He essentially said that if I gave him more attention then he wouldn’t seek it elsewhere. Mind you, he doesn’t give me any physical attention either. It’s not like either one of us is hitting the other one up daily like “hey, you wanna have sex?”... no, it just doesn’t happen. We have sex every few weeks usually, it would be more if one of us would facilitate it, but neither of us does. So when he throws something that HE has done, back on me... I get really frustrated. He vehemently defended his actions as not being wrong. Still hasn’t offered an apology a couple hours later. 

What am I doing? It’s not like I’m denying him anything, he just has to ask or make some effort if he wants sex. I told him if he put half as much effort into our marriage as he did that chat room, we would not have an issue. 

Logically I know this is on him, I do. But where do I go from here? How can I trust him if he’s building distrust between us by doing stuff like this?",08Jun2019,7
215,"I don't know if this is the right subreddit to post, but I just need help on what I could possibly do. Miniso is a really complicated company when it comes to complaints but it's not going to stop me from doing something about it. Sorry for the long post tl;dr below. 

This was at a miniso in my mall. I bought the large size polar bear plush toy (0300011161) that they had on sale for ""$9.98 +tax"" with my trans cousin and black friend. I did not know about any rules in regards to this sale and finished the transaction. As I was leaving the store and was looking at the Jake and Finn plushies with my friends. She then informed us about a rule in regards to only the big Jake and Finn plushies which was you had to buy I believe $40 of miniso items. I didn't think much of it as she stated herself that it only applied to those plushies. As I left the store, she stopped me, stated she was the manager of the store, and accused me of stealing. I showed her my receipt which stated I had purchased the item for $10.22. She then stated that I must return the item as she may be fired because of the cashier's mistake as staff manager looking over her. Not only did she lie to me about being the manager of the store, but put me at fault for her possibly being fired. At this point In time, this bear was my property as the transaction was finalized and was not obligated to make this return for her or the cashier's mistake so I walked away. This lead to her bulting between my friends and ripping the bear out of my hands. She stated, ""If you want your money back come make the return, if you don't you can leave."" In other words, she stole my property and forced me to come with her to make a refund. She then gave me the manager's number upon request which ended up being some random number. I asked her for her name which I would not be surprised if that was also fake. Throughout the discussion she was extremely aggressive and disrespectful.
Some quotes: (she gave me no eye contact btw)

*I'm coming back with the sticky note she gave me with the random number*
Me: is the number right? 
Her: oh really did you check? *Grabs sticky note and rips it apart*
Me: why'd you rip it up? Was it even his number? 
Her: No, I just wanted to give you a number so you could go away. 
-----
Me: Can I have your name please?
Her: #### do you want to see my ID!?
Me: sure, if you're offering.
Her: No, I don't want to get it. 
Me: okay then why'd you offer. 
Her: I just wanted to see what you'd say!!
------
Her: *rolls eyes* so are we done here or what? 
Me: no...you still haven't given me a way to contact the manager. 
Her: well you ever heard of personal privacy? It exists and I can't give you a number to my manager. 
-----
Me: *looking an utter disbelief at her over this whole shit show because of a stupid fucking bear*
You're treating me like shit for something that's not even my fault.
Cousin: yeah you act so immature
Her: well I'm 17 so *smiles like a fucking idiot*
 
(More happened but I honestly can't even remember anymore)

She did not discuss with the cashier about her mistake and she made me feel embarrassed and helpless for something that was not my fault. I was greatly mistreated for a fucking bear and I don't want someone else to suffer the same shit either. What can I do Reddit? 

Tl;dr: Employee accused me of stealing, she lied to me about her position, she ripped my property out of my hands, she forced me to make a return for the sake of her job, she gave me a fake number when I asked for a manager, she refused to give me any sort of number or name beyond that, and all in all treated me like crap. What can I do?",08Jun2019,3
216,"Lately, I just haven't been able to fully be myself anymore. I can still manage to act the same way the 'real' me would act, but it just doesn't feel the same. And it's just that, an act. I also feel like I'm not fully there emotionally. Nothing really excites me or moves me anymore. There's a lot of exciting things happening in my life, but I just don't feel anything when I think about any of it. I have no motivation to do anything. Another thing... I'm exhausted. All the time. No matter how much I sleep, no matter how healthy I eat. I don't know what's happening to me. I feel like I'm slowly losing myself. Sometimes I get so desperate to just be 'me' again I start crying out of frustration. 

I had a blood test done 2 months ago, I had vitamin D and iron deficiency. I've been taking supplements but it's not helping. My doctor doesn't take me seriously and just keeps giving me more supplements. I don't know where to go. What do I do?",08Jun2019,1
217,"I'm used to working a pretty harsh 60-80hr workweek. It's been like that for the past couple of years. I got used to it. It was hard and I fucking hated it sometimes, but the money was good. I developed severe anxiety and started going to a therapist to work it out.

Just recently I started working a very normal 40hr week and for some reason I am developing a lot of fucking anger. When something frustrating would happen, I'd feel pissed but I usually had good composure and lately I feel like I am on an extremely thin fence. This is affecting my work and my personal life.

At work, I've had tiny outbursts. Banging my hands against the counter or kicking a cabinet in frustration, tiny things but very not me. It's escalating to the point where I do it right in front of others and I'm afraid I'll have an outburst that will cost me my job. I feel like everyone around me is incompetent and I can't deal with their shortfalls.

I bring my frustrations home with me and lash out easily at my boyfriend. We usually never have issues like this. Tiny squabbles here and there, but I've literally told him I don't want him around me. I'm scared I'll say something I'll regret. Small things like dishes not being done or shoes not being taken off in the house set me off and I don't know why. It's small stuff that happens all the time and he doesn't have the same household compulsions I do, but it's never been a big issue before. I really cannot control my temper lately.

I feel bitchy and it's because I am in the bitchiest mood. I just don't know why my threshold for patience is so low right now. I'm not overworked or lacking in sleep as I was before I started having these normal working hours. I feel like I should be better for it. But I'm not.

I go to therapy for anxiety, but it's been a hot minute due to scheduling conflicts, so I haven't been able to really talk about it to anyone and I wont be able to for another few days. I'm afraid it's enough time to do something I'm going to regret because of my slowly seeping anger.

What should I do in the meantime? I don't know how to go about it at work without telling my managers that lately I feel like everyone's a fucking idiot and it's pissing me off. I don't know what to do at home where I can't have a normal conversation without becoming upset and taking it out on my poor boyfriend.

I'd also like to add that I've never been a violent person, but the banging and kicking make me feel like I am slowly developing that trait and it's terrifying.",08Jun2019,1
218,"I'm turning 13 in around 2 months so I might exaggerate a bit while writing this.

I get angry at myself. A lot. Every time I make a simple mistake I shout and scream at myself, saying that I should kill myself or that I deserved the worst.

For example: I went to my grandparent's house and I planned to bring a board game. We had played the game the day beforehand so I went to pack it up. As I did I felt excited as I had not played a game with my grandparents in a long time. I finished packing it up and soon after, my family and I left the house. Just before we got to my grandparent's house, I asked if anyone had brought the game, as I did not have on me in the car. Everyone said no, and then I started shouting at myself in my head, later hitting myself as a result. I told myself I was stupid, that I deserved to die, and that my family should just disown this pathetic piece of *garbage*.

I don't understand why I do this, but because of it, I fucking **hate** myself.

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.",08Jun2019,1
219,"I'm not going to lie i'm putting myself in a very venerable position writing this but at the end of the day I might be able to learn something from this. I am nine-teen years old meaning that I'm going into my twenties-soon to which I have mixed feelings about as  i'm going through online college courses. Even though that I have, and still am continuing to set my-self up for success there is a lack of general comradery  in my life, with me having lived in my parents house for the duration of my life. As I go into my twenties now more so than ever I want to put myself out there and I'm very well aware that means allowing myself to get hurt emotionally or physically but i'm okay with that after all to my current knowledge that is par for the course with any relationship whether that relationship be platonic or romantic which are the two relationship types that I do not posses  currently outside of  intimidate-family members. 

Being diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome to which I have come to terms with my mother would always try to set me up with people some times  with those people even being well below my age group how ever well intentioned it didn't  help. I have little knowledge of the daily life of people as I did not attended any public schooling aside from my single year of pre-K and me foolishly deciding to go to a 4th grade public school just so that I can feel normal which is a phase every Autistic person goes through to which I had gone through quite early  thankfully. This period to which hadn't beneficial   to my growth moved to pull me aside from the normal campus and into the special-ed trailer because of a piece of paper informing them of my  affliction.

  If that all seemed long-winded and pointless I'd like to apologize, I must admit that this is very hard for me to write as I'm sharing personal thoughts to which have never until reverberated  past the censer that is my mouth so please bare with me.  Regardless I will now get into the  proverbial meat and potatoes of my post. I want to start dating. Right off the bat i'm sure that you'd like to make sure my purpose behind wanting to start dating is not misplaced which is not with out reason so I need not beat around the bush because we're all adults here, so I'll say that even though sex is something that I am interested in having after all most people are even though there are individuals who don't, I am much more interested in forming a strong life-long bond to a women (would it be more appropriate to refer to them as girls? I do not know)  that can challenge me and criticize any assertions I might hold or things that I do which might help me grow as a person. After all I know that I will have to change a lot of things about myself most notably the way in which I eat which I would say is  quite a prosperous thing to worry about even as I write this but I lack the experience to say otherwise. Regardless it might as well be with someone special at this point. 

This  forming a relation ship is the most difficult part however as the only way to meet people is go outside because people congregate in places  so naturally you go to those places if you'd like to meet people. But my means of getting there are my parents as I lack the knowledge and experience required to operate a motor-vehicle (even as an autistic person even I know that was excessive who refers   to the act of driving a car as ""operating a motor vehicle?"") I'm trying to come off as clear as possible even though that is rather extreme I cannot afford  to be misunderstood.  So she would have to cart me all over Texas to which I am well aware that we lack the funds to afford as she is the only one that makes above 30K a year even though my dad just recently found employment working for a  much smaller super market chain. 

 So how am I too approach this? She always talks about us attending Church services to which I have mixed feelings about to so me and my brother can make Friends. How may I convey these ideas to her in a manner to which doesn't place blame on her after all it's very confrontational to say 'The reason i'm not happy is because you don't make enough money"" But i'm hurting and I have been for as long as I can recall even though this is pathetic I sometimes think when I lie in bed ""There should be someone next to me"" Dispute me knowing that  level of intimacy  is clearly reserved for adults. I am lonely I know at least one of the things that is making me unhappy which is a lot more than most people have to go off of. And this is further supported by the fact that when I watch porn (I might be getting into NSFW Territory warn me if I over step any rules and I will make changes accordingly.) I  fantasize about holding closely whom ever I am fantasizing about essentially being straddled by a person to which I am well aware of is an actor. 

This might seem comedic to some and I agree that It might not be a necessary detail to include but it is only indicative of the level of involuntary detachment  that I have towards any non-platonic feelings of affection. Is it common for people to include things like that? I am not aware. I know that I am smart after all I'm more figured out than most  of the people in my age group and certainly all who I met at my short one day of  brick and mortar community college and I know that I can express myself vividly  I can communicate clearly which as far as I know is a vital skill to have to develop a relationship. How can I find someone? I know well of the  existence of dating apps  like ""Tinder"" which even though I have considered to my knowledge are nothing more than a method in which to  ""ghost"" nothing more than a game to some people. And as a method for meaningless hookups which might be something I'm interested but i'd have to drive and I am not sure if I want somebody out of my life as fast as they came in the first place. 

To be honest even I can't take this for much longer how can I let my mother know that ""I'm not just her little retard any more?"" As absurd as that sounds more so the way in which that I phrased it. I'll post this even though I am fearful of the consequences because I don't know what will happen  I hope this wasn't too long. I'll step away from this while I try to get my mind off of things as I go to bed.  Thank you all for your time.",08Jun2019,1
220,"So I've been through alot and up until recently saw myself as bi. I've had crushes on both guys and girls. 

I've never had much luck in relationships, I've been cheated on many times. I've had more heart breaks in the past few years than most reasonable people would ever consider before taking a break from love. I still haven't given up, but recently I have seem to have more interest in guys.

221,"So, lately our team has gotten smaller and smaller. One of our team members, who just recently left the company, had a close relationship with my supervisor. I can tell that loosing him has been a little hard on my supervisor. It's also possible that I could be wrong, but my intuition tells me otherwise. Not only that, but just this week another coworker gave in their two weeks.

I work hard and do my best at work, I want to be as reliable as I can to my supervisor both through work ethic and through mental support. I did try and convey to my supervisor how I feel today, and asked him if there was anything else I could do to be supportive to him.

222,"So my 5 year old cousin come to my house like at 7 tonight and she was playing on my old phone I let her play on my old iphone because it doesn’t have anything that she could mess up on it. Also I’m not worried of it breaking. So yea pretty much i deleted a bunch of stuff on it so it has FaceTime, messenger, games, tons of songs downloaded from iTunes, YouTube, and the kid version of YouTube, and the roku app so I can use it as a tv remote sometimes, and a few other things. So I let her play on it because she gets bored then starts bugging everyone in the house and it gets to where it’s impossible to entertain her so I just let her go on the phone. I usually check in on what she is doing on it. I mean I checked and she was just playing some little kid game and then she was watching Barbie on kid YouTube. An important note is that she watched YouTube at full volume and refuses to turn the volume down or use earbuds so usually she gets kicked out of every place in the house and gets put in my room which I don’t mind because I’m hard of hearing and my tv is blasting and I use captions so her video things just sounds like a sorta quiet sound of Mumbo jumbo that doesn’t really bother me so by the sound I have no clue what she is watching or doing so that’s why I usually check on her. I have the regular YouTube app hidden on the phone sorta by placing it on the second screen of a combined icon thing of a calculator and boring apps so she won’t be interested in clicking on it or so I hoped. Anyway I got carried away watching a show on Netflix and before I knew it 2 hours had passed since I checked on her so I go over to look at what she is doing and omg she is watching a actual video of a women giving birth! I grabbed that phone so fast and turned that video off! So turns out she had stumbled upon the real youtube app which we don’t even tell her is a thing but she didn’t know it was a honest mistake she made. And by using the talk to type button she searched something like “Barbie and baby” or something about Barbie and a baby. And stumbled upon that video she was only about 20 seconds into the video but I have no clue what other videos she saw if she was watching videos before that I mean the other searches were  “Barbie” and “slime”. But I’m freaking out what if she is scarred for life I don’t think she knew what she was watching. I explained to her that she can’t be watching stuff like that and that I’m not mad because I knew that she didn’t know it was a bad video when she clicked on it. So I put her onto the kid version of YouTube and logged into my school profile on real YouTube so that she won’t be able to access/ watch videos that are 18+. Maybe I should just delete youtube off that phone though? if she stumbled upon that app again. And I checked on her more. But I have no clue what other videos she could have seen. So I’m really scared if her parents find I will be in so much trouble. What do I even do. Maybe she heard cuss words? She is known for repeating words and then when she says a bad word her parents question her on where she heard it. I know because of when she said “crap”.  She was questioned until she revealed that she her uncle say it. And they gave him hell for that. I don’t want to be in trouble with them like that! Advice?",08Jun2019,3
224,"Yeah I appreciate you shouldn’t be reading your partners text blah blah blah, but I asked him explicitly and he was very shady about it, so I did it anyway! 

 His ex has been very clear that she still has feeling for him etcetera, so imo any comms between them should purely be about their shared kids. 

However on numerous occasions now he’s been sending her links to songs, I don’t know if they’re her favourite songs or what but they think it’s completely inappropriate - to me it reads heard this song and thought of you...like WTF! 

He tells me that he’s not friends with her like that, but she asked him to be her best man at her wedding...like WTF. Her fiancé was texting other girls and who did she call crying down the phone...my bf....again wtf!

He recently told her, much to her tears and despair that he doesn’t consider her a friend like that. In all honesty I blame him for this entirely, because he knows how she feels, but I feel like their (more so his) text exchange give off the impression like their could be something more! 

Anyway I’m defo gonna confront him about this, because whilst it’s not make or break to our relationship right now, I feel like an a build up of these things will find us in a position we don’t want to be in the long run. But I’m open to other thoughts....",08Jun2019,1

But basically one night I was taking pills to try and die, then I drank a bunch if vodka. I was feeling pretty good at that point and I called one of my friends. We started talking and I kept drinking. Now that's all I know and faintly remember. But apparently I started freaking out all of a sudden and started saying that he hated me, he doesn't care about me, and I dont know if there was anything else. But then I started cutting myself apparently and he asked how bad so I sent a picture. I also dont remember any of that. This traumatized him so he told his dad and his dad called my mom.

228,"TL;DR at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

So I need to fill out some context first:

1. I have issues with being angry, and sometimes it makes me cry I get so angry but I so desperately don't wanna hurt anybody else, but I don't have a healthy outlet. I rarely *ever* lash out at someone else, but I do have a very very hot temper which ends up being bottled up but then let out through creativity or exercise. I'm looking into therapy but I don't have access to it right now unfortunately.
2. I (over the chat client, Discord) recently had a falling out with an old friend (we'll call her J for privacy) over her unreasonably insulting my boyfriend, then bringing up traumatic bullying as a way to manipulate me after screaming and shouting at me. 
3. I acknowledge 100% that I was in the wrong as well, but I ended up apologizing to everyone involved so that I could repair the group. My friends of 17 years now still talk to her, and some of my other friends do as well. It's hurtful, but live and let live I guess. I've remained friends with them, I've been running a roleplay game for them that I wrote, and I think I've been pretty good to them. They haven't been great to me though. My birthday was 2 weeks ago and they never wished me happy birthday, despite me outwardly stating that it's my birthday, I did a portrait of one of them that took more than a day and they said ""oh yeah I saw, thanks."" when I asked them to check because they didn't respond. They shit talk my boyfriend and other friends who are nicer to me, and they're overall mean. 
4. I don't leave because it's my sister's server and I want to keep it going for her.

Context aside, here we go!

Tonight, on Discord, I invited my current friends into a voice call. They took a while but then they joined. 

One of them commented, ""oh we were talking to J but she had to go so we figured we might as well talk to you."" I found this super insulting because they said it in such a rude way but ok just another thing to add to the list I guess. Then they kept mentioning her several times over and over. I made half jokes that were kind of supposed to be ""hey can you guys stop"", but that didn't work.

Eventually, I straight out said, ""hey guys, all jokes aside, can you please stop mentioning J so much? The whole situation still hurts and it's uncomfortable to hear about so much"". They agreed that it was inappropriate. Then WOW they mentioned her again later. I ended up leaving and playing a video game instead.

Later, though (J's best friend is in the server cause she's been overall nice, we'll call her R), R started talking weird, it didn't sound like her. Theeen ""yeah this is J by the way."" I was LIVID. Even my sister thought it was a bad idea. Everyone was happy to see her, and I just said ""wow ok"", THAT'S IT. And everyone started spamming ???? and J literally asked several times ""what?"" I didn't know what to do, I still don't, I am so angry I can't think. It was so intrusive and they carried on like normal after that. My thought process. Was. Who does she think she is????!!!

My mom and my boyfriend both said the same thing, ""you expect too much from all of them, they're not very nice"". And I mean OK??? But I just feel like I'm subjecting myself to this and I don't know how to back out.

Right now, my blood is BOILING. I am 100% at my limit with them and it's 12:30 am when I get writing and drawing done but I can't concentrate, but I can't sleep either. I don't know what to do. How do I control this?

Help! Thank you!

231,"Hi!

I've worked where I am now for 3.5 years.  It's a very small company, just 20 employees.  There are a lot of issues at the company, particularly around the way it's run and the management structure - or lack there of.

Very briefly, there is the owner and then three 'senior' people, who are only senior due to length of service and being the owners friends.  Two of the seniors don't even work in the same office as the other 18 employees.  This causes all sorts of issues from ""No one else if allowed to be part of the senior leadership team"", to the one senior person who is at the main office ticking every 'bad management 101' box going.

So, a couple of months ago a was given a promotion to a Senior role, but was categorically told that I won't be part of the Senior Team.  The reason given is that it would upset a member of the Senior Team.  Maybe I shouldn't have but I did laugh at this.  So basically I'm senior in name only.

The senior member of that would get upset is the one that works from the main office.  The owner even said to another member of staff that he may have just done something 'controversial', and when this senior member was told their response was 'we don't need anyone else, I don't see the point'.

So now there have been multiple occurrences of them trying to get my in trouble and or undermining me.  

For example, telling the owner I've been discussing salaries with people.  And telling the owner I'm distracting everyone in the office.  What's incredibly frustrating is that the owner knows it's all BS, but due to blind loyalty he plays along just to satisfy this person's own insecurities.

And that's what it is, they feel threatened by anyone else being in a position of seniority.  They are a terrible manager/team leader.  They belittle those they manage, make them feel on edge constantly etc.  People have told me that they worry about submitting any work because a lot of the time he tells them it's not right, but it's not that it's not right it's just that it's not they way he would do it.  And then he redoes their work.

I'm not really sure how to handle this, it's difficult because the owner won't address it because they're mates and he doesn't want to upset him.  But the company is being dragged down by this ass hat and morale with at least half the employees is rock bottom.

Thanks.",08Jun2019,1
233,"Disclaimer: Im Swedish so I'll be translating swedish terms and concepts into their american counterparts so that more people will be able to follow along. I also wont be naming the bar or the town we live in.

So some background:
So this guy (lets call him Karl for this) and I were classmates all the way from 1st grade to 9th grade (last year of swedish elementary school). We werent really that close friends but we would talk in school and play videogames and the like sometimes. Towards the the end of elementary school he had told us that he was going to highschool in the very same town to become a electrician, so that is why I thought it was weird that he randomly disapeared right after graduation without a word. And I mean complete radio silence, no one saw him for about 2 year, not online, not on any social media, 700 days since last online on Steam and the like. So of course some rumours started about where he might have gone. A former friend of his told how he had been forced to live across the country in a home for gaming addiction or something while another more serious rumour was that he had molested some kid and went to prison for it. Our source for the latter one for this was that a  friend of a friend of a friend of a friend had been a witness so we all took it with a grain of salt. 

In our last year of highschool Karl suddenly turned back up again and people were shocked when they spotted him all over the town but no one really ever interacted with him again. So fast forward to about half a year after graduation and we caught up with another classmate from elementary school who knew everything about him since she had bought the court papers from his trial that hD apparently actually happened back in the day and shared them with us. 

I wont tell you all the details but in short he went to a preschool and molested a girl as young as 6 (rumour is that it was his own sister but thats not known for certain). He was caught red handed and punished for it, far too lenient IMO (no prison time, most likely because he was a minor at the time), and thats why he was missing for more than 2 years. 

So fast forward to last night when two of my friends go out for a drink at a local bar we are regulars at (and I mean regulars like all the staff recognize us and the bouncers dont even check our ID anymore) and are shocked to see Karl of all people behind the counter serving drinks to people.

So here is the question behind all of this, should I contact the bar to try and get him fired? I highly doubt they checked his criminal background since I sure as shit wouldn't hire a convicted sex offender to be a bartender. Sweden doesnt have the same sex offender registry laws as America he wouldn't be under the same obligation to tell people about his past. I dont imagine many customers would be comfortable coming there knowing his past, Im certainly not and wont be coming back as long as he works there. Also I think letting his employer know softly and giving him a chance to let him go quietly would be better than this getting out and causing a scandal.

The thing is that I dont know if I want to do this out of any sort of moral conviction or if Im just trying to fuck him over because he's a piece of shit (which he is). Im not so vindictive and I dont think he should be blacklisted from every type of work in the world for the rest of his life, but making drinks for 100s of strangers every night is probably one job I think he shouldnt have. So how should I go about this?",08Jun2019,1
234,"

I’m starting college this fall and I’m having a small panic attack about writing essays and papers in college since I’ve haven’t done either. I know most students get lots of practice writing from elementary school to high school to prepare them for college but I never got that. 

I was home schooled by my mother and she was pretty much bed ridden by the time I was in high school, so I was in charge of my own education for all of high school. I taught myself history, math, geography, science, literature, and economics. I have taken tests on all those subjects and scored well on all of them(multiple choice tests the majority of the time). But since I didn’t have to turn in any homework besides math I never wrote anything and have never had to develop writing skills. And the realization only hit me about a month ago that I don’t know how to write even the smallest essay. I know this is all my fault by not having the forethought to practice ahead of time and work on this skill set but now I need suggestions on what I can do to develop this skill set in the next few months before fall when college starts. 

I’m not looking to be criticized on the mistakes I made in high school, I know I messed up by not writing. I’m looking for suggestions and advice on how to remedy my lack of writing experience by either books, lectures I could watch, or other resources I could use

Here we go again, another crisis. My best friend (we have been friends for 2 years), her bday is on Sunday June 16, on the same day i have this family get together type of thing. If I go to the family thing I obviously can't go to meet my friend on her bday. My family is pretty strict, yeah you won't believe it, the kinda ppl who don't let their adult ""kids"" out alone even in this 21st century and there is no way to go against them. If I tell them I don't want to attend this family thing and instead go to my friend there is going go be a big fight, and I mean very big something equivalent to WW3. They are the kind of people who don't think friends are important at all in life. Now this friend of mine if I tell her I wont be able to make it on her bday she is obviously going to be pissed and even if I tell her my situation she wouldn't understand, she would just say I don't care for her enough and blah blah blah. She did come on my bday to visit me and spent the weekend with me even though she had to miss her class and so she thinks that there can be no valid reason for me to not come to her on her bday. With my university, I live on campus, my last day of finals is June 14th Friday. What I figured would be a good way to handle this is that I tell my friend that I will be coming to see her on Friday and Saturday but wont be able to stay on Sunday which by the way is her bday. So on Sunday I can go attend that family thing I have. This way both the parties will be satisfied. Turns out my friend is still mad that I can't make it on Sunday and is not talking to me.

Although he told me of all the bad stuff about him, like how he doesn’t feel pain or remorse, has bad OCD, is a sex addict, a diagnosed psychopath, a compulsive liar, and a narcissist, I still thought he was the best person in the world, because he wouldn’t let me think any different. This was how it went. He would tell me something disturbing and immoral about him, but before i could react negatively, he would justify and normalize his actions. I eventually believed him, and my own reality began changing. He was talking to two other women when he was talking to me. I knew about it, but he told me it was okay, and that i was the most special, and i believed him. He would hook up with me, and then hook up with her, and then tell me that i was the highlight of his night. He got whatever he wanted, and he made me feel like i was getting what i wanted to. This went on for a while. He even got a girlfriend. But while dating her, he was still calling me everyday and calling me beautiful and telling me how strong his feelings were for me. This fucked me up really bad. I didn’t understand how he could love her and say this stuff to me. I was so confused and really got messed up during this time of my life. Eventually i realized how fucked this was for my mental health, and decided i needed a break. but all i could think of was him. I still didn’t see him as wrong, just as romantically unavailable. I still loved all his flaws, and that’s where i fucked up. Over time we decided being friends would be best for us, because again, he was in a relationship, but it didn’t seem to work. That sexual tension was still there, and i was still hurting. i knew it was time for me to leave. It sucked, but i knew it. So i stopped seeing him. he was pissed and even told me i “abandoned him” which pissed me off a lot, and made me want to tell his girlfriend everything he kept hidden from her. I realized at that point how badly he manipulated me and i started to hate him.

245,"So you already know my problems concerning the Academics Dumpster Fire, but there seems to be a bigger problem.

Living in a third world country, the public opinion on mental health is still in favor of considering it a taboo topic. I can see that in here where most of the time, I can feel as if they're hammering emotional expressions out of me which lead to my callous conservative thinking in politics. I was diagnosed with Asperger's and ADD, and part of Asperger's is something called alexythymia, the inability to feel emotions. 

The most intense part of my alexythymia is the inability to feel love; I don't feel guilty about leaving my now old aging mother behind, or turning down my girl when she wants to finally be official with me, or ruining someone's life with my actions as I am severely lacking in love, empathy and compassion. And recently, passion is threatened to be forgotten as well.

I'm a passionate chef and would love to create new things out of unconventional things, like new dishes out of something you wouldn't expect be possible, but I'm not in the fucking US. I'm in the Philippines; a place where you have to sacrifice literally everything trivial to survive, and knowing this, my parents and everyone else in the family are more than happy to turn me down for my passion and kill it to save money. As I said, they value my worth academically and nothing else, so my passions are often no longer in the line.

To prevent myself and my ADD high horse from kicking and entertaining myself with experimenting for passion, I submerge myself in the Internet, but That's being taken away from me as well.

Idk about you, but the last time they took away all my property was in 8th Fucking Grade, and I'm a Senior now, so the thought of reliving my childhood hell is incredibly stressful, considering that everything was better than it'll ever will until now.

I've made up my mind. I'll leave the family, and never come back. I need advice on estrangement and how no to be guilty over it. For those who would say things like ""don't leave them behind"" or all that shit, I'm already at my breaking point and they're going to kick me out of the house anyway, just looking for reasons to.",08Jun2019,1

247,"I wasn't sure what to put as the title, but I need some advice so here is my situation. I will try to explain as fully as I can so sorry for the long post.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was a kid I was infected with a strain of the Herpes virus, which results in a Coldsore roughly once or twice a year, and lasting for up to a week. I have had it my whole life, from young enough that I honestly believed it was just something that happened sometimes, like a cold. I didn't find out exactly what it was until i was like 23. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have gotten details from a doctor and what I have is apparently quite common. It is NOT sexually transmitted (unless I give oral sex WHILE I have an active sore), it is NOT transmittable by blood, I can only transmit the virus via direct (and in some cases indirect, like drinking from the same cup as someone) contact with an active sore. 

It is very manageable with simple, over the counter medications, and if I catch it early enough I can often prevent an outbreak happening at all.

&amp;#x200B;

My problem is this, I have recently started a new relationship with someone I really care about. This virus will pop up again eventually so I feel it's something I need to discuss with her.  I'm not sure how to broach the subject and I'm terrified it may end the relationship. Am I overreacting? How do I go about telling her about this?",08Jun2019,2

249,"Was essentially FWB with a girl freshman year of college, little more than that but yeah. We had both just gotten out of long term relationships and the whole thing went downhill quickly.

Few months later and we started having sex again until the summer came and she went to basic training. I tried to discuss dating with her several times, but she wasn’t interested in anything serious at the time. A recurring theme with her was that I wasn’t interested enough (she was insecure); so at the end of summer I planned out a huge trip to go see her and spend a whole weekend with her in a very nice hotel, nice dinner, the whole nine yards. Doesn’t turn out well, and we stop talking.

Fast fwd 3 years to a few weeks ago. Had a very nice talk about everything and the past is... well the past. She seems much more mature, ready for a relationship, and tbh I think about her quite a lot. She has her life together, has a good job, and she’s in school so there’s nothing to worry about there.

Logically, I know it’s not necessarily the best idea though. She would probably never be welcomed in my friend group (for matters I didn’t discuss here) which is why I’m asking Reddit, and she has a history of instability, although it’s unclear if it was her wrong doing or not in those cases.

Do y’all think it would be worth a try to date this girl, or should I just stop now while I can? Once again, I’m very attracted to her and think about her regularly, but my logic is telling me “yeahhh idk there bud”",08Jun2019,1

259,"Apologies for some lengthy background, I'm looking for some career advice. 

Tldr:  told I was the best person for the job in the phone call advising I didn't get my promotion and a stranger will be getting ir

I've been working hard for 5 years in a local government dept, and a little over 3 years in my current role. Around two years ago it was realised that our small team needed a senior to help with an increased workload and minor staffing issues. My manager encouraged me at all my quarterly reviews to go for the position when it arose and so I began taking extra duties, such as running reports, doing stat analysis for my manager or submitting procedural amendments to increase productivity and accuracy.

These changes were all well received and almost all are now part of our common procedures. The stat analysis I've done show an increased accuracy and we actually have more capacity for work now that much of the procedural work is optimised. I have helped mitigate system changes with older less keen staff members and have had great feedback in all my monthly 121s.

The job finally was advertised, I printed off a sample of the reports and improvements I'd worked on and went along to my interview. 

When I sat down, only 1 of the 3 panel actually had any interaction with our specialist department and I recognised the questions were very cookie cutter style management questions. The interview didn't go well as none of my work was relevant to the answers they wanted. I don't have much supervisor experience but have trained and coached our staff in this role but hadn't directly dealt with staff conflict or the like that they wanted to know about. 

I came away knowing it was a bad interview but still held hope as my manager had said she wanted me for the job and I'd been doing much of the job already.

I got the call from my manager's boss who told me that I didn't get the job as others had interviewed better than I had. I said I was disappointed as I felt I was genuinely the best person for the job, he agreed but then said he was bound by the points scoring in the interview and I hadn't scored in the top 3.

Ive got several unfinished projects that are not part of work role and I'm going back to work in a few hours. I can't bring myself to finish any of this hard work that I've put hours, days and weeks of my life into. I just want to drop all the extra work and do the bare minimum until I can find something else. 

Should I cut back and just do my basic job and look for work elsewhere? My manager is genuinely disappointed and I now face the prospect of training up the person who is now going to be telling me how to do my job.

I'm just feeling very under appreciated currently and I'm just getting too old now to quit and start from scratch again.

I'd love any guidance as I'm a little lost right now.",08Jun2019,1

261,"I don't know what to do. I finished high school last year, failing the last year out of lack of direction. I've been working for a couple of years, i used to skip school to work. I also dropped out at about 14 and returned to 3 years later.

At 14 I couldn't justify being at school. I hated being there, I had no ambition of doing anything with myself after school so I just stopped turning up. After 2 years of doing absolutely nothing but playing video games and coding I bought my first car, and got a job to save for a better car. At this point I had a bit more foward thinking so I thought it'd be best to return to school and consider pursuing computer science.

After returning to study I realised I really didn't care about anything I was doing. Id always been pretty 'straight edge' up until this point but I started using and experimenting with drugs simply because why not? I also ended up buying a profuse amount of cars and got into 'Street racing' and my effort in school dropped considerably.

Somewhere along the way i thought it'd be best to pursue mechanics as I was fairly interested in it and spent a lot of my spare time messing with my cars.

I spent most of late year unemployment, after I quit a job at a cafe, until I got a job at an autoshop. I worked there for a month before quitting, I simply hated everything about the job. I've been doing temporary jobs and being unemployed since.

The problem is I don't know what to do at this stage. I don't genuinely feel I want to accomplish anything. I got the job at the autoshop because I didn't want to be judged for not studying. 

I haven't found another job yet because I'm being super picky about what I do because I don't want to do something I dislike, even though I feel that's inevitable. 

I don't really feel any motivation to actually get another job because I'm managing to scrape by just selling my stuff. 

I don't feel any point in working just for money because I don't feel there's anything I genuinely want to save for or buy. 

I've spent all my money on cars since I was 16, simply because it keeps me entertained for a lil while, until I want another car. 

Ive never had a decent car, while I was working at the autoshop I planned on saving for a nice car. 

Then I realised i dont genuinely want a nice car. I don't care what I drive. 

Now I have no motivation to work, because I don't want to buy anymore cars.

Longterm I don't really care about a house n things either, I lived out of my car before I really dont mind it. 

I've lived in fairly bad conditions when I was younger and it doesnt motivate me to avoid putting myself back in those conditions.

I don't even value accomplishment and achievements. I'm proud of the absolutely complete wrong things. 

I like music and i produce in my own time at home.

Itd be cool to be signed to a record label or something but I don't want to put the effort in.

I reckon im fairly capable, and i should go study but I don't care enough to actually maintain motivation to finish and get a job. 

I have a decent amount of talents and skills I could pursue but I don't have an urge to pursue them for some reason. 

Everything I do i feel I do just because I should, not because I want to.

Ive stayed the same weight for years, Ive tried to increase my weight many times but then i realised ultimately I don't care and its pointless to place other peoples expectations on myself. 

When I remove those expectations I have no motivation, I feel no need to achieve anything.

I wish I could control my thoughts and feelings and ego better so I could completely avoid placing social pressures on myself and simply be content with surving.",08Jun2019,2

This happened when I was maybe around 10. My parents weren't very strict about internet usage, so I was free to do whatever I wanted on the computer. I guess this was also the time when my sexuality was beginning to develop, because one day I went on this adult-themed chatroom or maybe some online game of sorts, where I met a man. I can't be 100% sure if he was a pedophile, but he met me on an adult themed chatroom and he didn't stop talking to me even when I told him my age. I don't remember many details, but eventually I added him on skype and we began talking. He was very adamant about not wanting so show his face, so I never truly knew how old he was. However, after talking for some time, maybe for a couple days, I was stupid enough to send him nsfw photos of myself (with my face showing, which makes it even worse). We talked for maybe a week or a little longer before I blocked him because he wouldn't show his face, which really annoyed me, because since day one, every time I would ask him to send a photo he would make up some excuse and promise that he would eventually, but he never did.

Anyways, sorry for that disjointed story, but what I'm getting at is this : I sent a grown man photos of myself and I'm afraid that one day, when I come to hold some important job position, or when I become successful, this is going to come back to haunt me. As in, seeing all the sexual assault scandals as of late, I'm afraid that that man is somehow going to track me down and blackmail me with those photos. I mean, I've blocked him and deleted skype many years ago, but I'm always coming up with scenarios where he somehow saved those photos or uploaded them to the dark web, where people will be able to find it and then extort me or something. Am I being unreasonable? I mean, I was below the age of consent when I did it, but I'm afraid that if people found out, everyone would shun me and it would ruin my life.

What should I do? I don't really want to tell anybody irl, but I'm that if I don't do anything, it's going to take me by surprise and ruin my life.",08Jun2019,1
265,"I recently applied for a previous seasonal job that I had in retail last summer so I could have money during the school year. They turned me down saying they didn’t need any more help for the summer. They just recently came back and offered to interview me this week. During the time they told me no, I reached out to another previous job as a tutor I had in high school where they offered me my old job back with a small raise and a few more hours. (Tutoring $13/hr, ~15 hours a week) 

If it happens where the retail job offers me a position, it will be a little less money but more hours, along with a discount in the store. But I would have to leave the tutoring job which I just started working at just last week. (Retail $11/hour, 35-40 hours a week)


To go along with all this, my girlfriend is flying in at the end of the month and will be spending a little over a week with me. If I keep the tutoring job, I’ll be able to have more free time with her and still go to work. 

If I get the retail job I’d be put in a situation where I’d have to ask for a week off and a holiday off (to drive her to the airport) so I can spend time with her.  How would be the best way to ask for that time off and if they don’t give me the time, would it be better to just say no thank you to the job? Or find a compromise where I have at least most of the days off?

I just would like some other advice on what you would do in this situation if you were me. I already talked to my parents and my girlfriend about this and they all gave me different opinions. Thank you in advance.",08Jun2019,1

274,"I don't know why my cousin act in this way which I always thought he is the most caring person because he always reach out to anyone. But there is one time that went wrong. It was around 2am, he was playing his LOL game while I was watching a movie at the living room and all my family was asleep. After the movie ended, he suddenly gave me a massage whenever he see me while no one was looking. I don't know why he always does that to me and don't dare to show in front of my family and his family. 

As always he will massage my back and sometimes he would like me to take off my shirt and bra to massage my back pain...and I let him because I though he is being kind and helpful. But I never thought my cousin would said,""I want to help you to massage your boob  and it will stay very firm"". Of course, I SAID NO to him. Reason is because I am 20 and he is 21 and he already have 2nd girlfriend(Which has already broke up in 2 weeks ago) . Because I said no to him, and he question me childishly why I don't trust him at all. I told, ""You are my cousin, and I am not your girlfriend"". He was like,""But I am just like a brother to you"". And I can't believe he wouldn't allow me to leave the dining room so I sit there and wait him to go to sleep. But suddenly he showed me a Youtube video that a woman is laying on the bed and unknown hand is touching her boob like massage in a Japan Spa. Of course, the woman in the video use a towel to cover her boob.  

After he finished show me the video, he was pulling my shirt gently while convince me over and over right until I walk up to my room. I can't believe he follow me to my room and made me to take off my shirt and my bra along as I quickly take my towel to cover my chest. And I said,""Fine just once, and no nipple touching"". Then he happily pushed me down onto my bed and massage my nipple as he would do while I used my towel to hold on my nipple tightly with both hands in case something happen. And this is first time I have done something that I don't even know why I does that. After he stopped massage my chest when he saw me breathing heavily and holding tightly of my fist without any relax, he told me to shh.. not to tell mom(Or else he can't stay in my mom's house and cannot graduate because his college is near to my home not his) which is unexpected and he also promised me he will not do it again!

Well, I thought it was over. BUT I DIDN'T SEE THIS COMING that one night after midnight he used his forced to carry me from my sleeping room (Living with aunt because is near to my Uni) to his bedroom. He then shut his door immediately while I was trying to get the hell out from his room. He would use his energy force to pull my hand  with his left hand while grabbing my clothes violently with his right hand as I politely said,""Please let me go! You're my cousin not my boyfriend. I know I don't have a boyfriend because I really think is unnecessary. I know you don't have a girlfriend anymore but we can't do this and you also have a hit on my best friend(which she already has a boyfriend). Please don't be like this. I don;t want to cause any trouble."" He then shake his head and said no. He said anything but letting me out of his room. 

I ask straightly, ""what do you want from me？I am not special and I don't look beautiful.” He said, ""Think me as your big brother(which I never had a real one), I want to sleep with just a night."" I said, ""I would rather sleep with myself then sleeping with a pervert cousin."" Then he went furious and place me on his chest with a forceful hug while he layed upon his stinky bed. Then I warned him that I am not afraid of kicking his ball but my mind was pitying him and wonder,""if he got trauma hurt and can't do breeding if my aunt knew about then will she be upset?"" Because of that I don't dare to do it which I also never done it before. 

Now I know what it means by being nice will get taken as advantage like this kind of scenario. So this is how I was forced to sleep with that night. On that night, I don't even dare to sleep even though I was helpless which means I can't move at all. I was trap in my cousin bedroom like a sexual prisoner and I got chained with my cousin one big hand. I think people who read this post would this I am so stupid and hopeless which used up my time thinking should I post it or not. Whenever I moved to escape which I thought he asleep deeply, he will grab me  with his mighty arm and pull me over upon his bed prevent me from leaving his room. And I could tell he is enjoying doing this because he keep asking me to sleep naked with him for many times and said it will be very comfortable to do it. Then, my eyes come down with tears which I wanted to hide it but he noticed because it dripped onto his strong right arm. As that happen, I thought he realize his mistake. But no, he didn't say he was sorry he said this will be the final time. And he promised me he will not repeat the same mistake which I don't trust him anymore. After the next morning, he went to touching my boob and this time he touched my nipple and asking is it comfortable. I don't know how to respond, if I said no will he stopped and if I said yes will he stopped too? So I stay quiet. Right after my cousin oldest sibling asked why he shut the door which he never do that before and asking where I was. My cousin got freaked out and faced me with a shh... sign to me and he told me he had lied to his sis about me asking him about my car broke down(Because my car really got major problem and his college is professional in teaching car services). After he opened his door while finally letting me set free from his prison torture chamber room. I told myself I have to shut my sleeping room whenever I see him or saying harsh things toward him so he will keep distant from me. I think this is my best solution. Sometimes I wonder is there any best solution that won't hurt others like kicking balls or do violent aggressive mean things.",08Jun2019,1
275,"Short backstory. This guy ""S"" and I ""M"" have been friends for a decade. I moved away for college in 2017, he got into a relationship, and we kinda lost sight of each other for a while. I recently moved back and we rekindled our friendship. 

Ever since we started hanging out again, I couldn't help but notice just how much he's been drinking. His flatmate told me that he chugs at least 2-3 beers a day once he's home from work. Yesterday, when he invited me over he drank 7 bottles of beer in roughly three hours and didn't even remotely show signs of being tipsy, which makes me think that he's at a tolerance point that can only be achieved once you're used to constantly drinking that quantity.

I tried to adress it and made some dumb joke about his liver, when he looked me dead in the eye and told me that he's had his blood tested recently and was warned by his doctor to stop drinking immediately. I was shocked to say the least. Turns out the girl he got together with in 2017 broke up with him after both parties cheated on each other. They've spiraled into a very toxic on again off again relationship and casually meet for hookups. He's still very much in love with her and can't deal with the way things are now. I don't know how long he's been drinking like this, but I guess it's been about 2 years now. He also drank a lot when we were teens, but at a normal level. Maybe one or two beers at the weekend. 

I also noticed that his behavior changed dramatically. He keeps forgetting things. I can't drink alcohol because of medical reasons. I had to tell him about 5x yesterday that I can't have a drink with him because of that but he kept on forgetting... Just like he keeps on forgetting that I moved home again. He'll text me every few weeks asking me how long I'm gonna be in town before going back to college. Once I tell him that I'll be here for at least a few months, he acts like he's heard it the first time from me... I'm really scared for him. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",08Jun2019,0
276,"TL;DR: I need to quickly get employment verification documents to start work on Monday or avoid looking like an idiot.


I’m an intern at a bank for the summer. I start work this Monday. In their HR’s email to me it was stated that it was “mandatory that you bring original documents that establish your identity and your employment eligibility on your first day of work.  Examples of acceptable documents include a Driver's license, a Social Security Card, Birth Certificate, Passport, etc. A complete list of acceptable documents can be found in the link below.  “

The link referenced in the last sentence was just a list of acceptable documents.

I, being the idiot I am, misread both the link and the the email. I’m sorry, this is my first job that requires this so I thought I just needed one of any of the items listed. I have my driver’s license to establish identity, but nothing that would establish employment authorization. I’m terrified of being sent home on first day and looking like an absolute buffoon.

I’m in the Midwest right now (in Wisconsin, where the bank is), but my home is on the east coast in New Jersey. I have a feeling that, even if I had anything mailed to me now (even through priority mail) it would get here too slow Monday morning.


Is there a way to get any of these documents quickly? The list includes birth certificate or certified copy, certification of report of birth, ID Card for resident citizen in the US form I-179, U.S. citizen ID Card, or U.S social security account number card.

Or, if I’m out luck on getting this by Monday, how do I explain this to my work? Is there a way to diplomatically explain my error or delay my start for a day? I really don’t want to screw this up. Any advice would be appreciated. Please let me know if my post is unclear in any way

278,"I go down to one of my old elementary schools occasionally to shoot hoops on their basketball court and ride BMX/skateboard around. The last time I came, I remembered something from when I went to school over there that has always mystified me, and I can't even confirm if this is real or just in my imagination.

When I first moved here and started 1st grade at this school in 2008, I remember their being an extra building. It was kind old looking, green and situated on top of a small hill past the playground, and it only had one room in it, which was either some kind of play room, or maybe an extra classroom (but that wouldn't really make sense because there was already one building with all the classrooms in K-6). It had school toys and art supplies, beanbags, big tables, a reddish/blueish/greenish/brownish carpet, and a few other kids, that's literally all I can remember about it.

This building was gone either later on during that school year, or over the summer 2009, because by the time I started 2nd grade in 2009, it was already a foggy memory. It might be real because there actually is a small hill close to where the classroom building is, but it's all overgrown with tall grass and bushes, with no real sign of a building being there just a decade ago.

I think maybe I might be remembering dreams I had back when I attended 1st grade at this school, because no one else ever seems to mention it's existence. Or I could possibly be mixing it up with another elementary school that I used to attend kindergarten at in 2007-2008, but the huge majority (like 99.999%) of all my memories of it come from the school I'm referring to in the rest of this post.

280,"So there’s a guy who goes to the same university as I do. He is friends with a guy who’s girlfriend lives in my apartment. So I knew who he was. We matched in tinder and he said Hi, but I responded super late and he didn’t reply back. I followed him on instagram and he never followed back.

 About 3 months later I saw him at a party and qe kissed as we were kissing his friend was recording so I got pissed and left. The rest of the night he spent it around me like waiting for me to go talk to him, he even made eye contact and went 🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️ so that Id go talk to him, but I didnt go. I tried to follow him on instagram again and once again he didnt follow me back.
2 months later I see him at another party where he doesn’t acknowledge me the entire night but afterwards he was waiting for me outside so that Id go to him. He wanted to fuck in the entry of an apartment and I didnt want to- there was a party the next day and he told me he would see me there. 
He didnt talk to me the entire party. I DMd him and told him that afterwards he could go to my apt with his friend (who was going to be with his gf) he didnt open it nor did he follow me back. 
He ignored me completely.
Now I am aware that the guy justs wants to fuck, but like I want that too? so Why doesnt he follow me back to set a date or something? Like I don’t understand why he is so so interested in me at parties and then ignores me completely as if he was never interested. 
So ive been thinking about this EVERY MOMENT of the day. Its eating my brain. I cant study, I cant think without me making up scenarios where I can talk to him and ask him why he does this.

Fast forward to now, I’m about the same length of time into a relationship with someone else, she lives a couple hours away so it’s long distance but I really really like her, the thing is I’m beginning to have the same issue again where I struggle to make conversation. I’ve talked to her about this and she said that she didn’t notice but that she would try her best to help me out with it in future. She hasn’t, she still leaves me to be the one who has to make conversation and keep things going. 

This wasn’t an issue at the start of the relationship as I had plenty to talk about, and I think I sort of assumed this role by accident, and now she’s just comfortable with it and doesn’t try and do anything as a result. So now I don’t really know what to do because I’ve already spoke to her about it once and she hasn’t really changed anything as a result.

Now today I mentioned her in a text and said I feel bad for her and this is what he said: “Me too, life doesn’t have to be complicated. Just recognize reality and go forth. I miss ______.

296,"This happened last night and i'm still angry, so this is a rant but also I'd appreciate any thoughts you folks have on how to proceed.

My elderly mother, having lived in her house for almost 40 years with no issues, has new neighbours since the New Year, and the neighbours own cats.

My mum is a retired nurse, who now lovingly cares for the birds in her garden. They're pretty much her life, and it brings her so much joy. Unfortunately, the cats also love her garden, and she is now fearful that they will kill her birds - she's anxious to look in to her garden in case she sees one of these cats in the act of killing. She's losing sleep over it, and hasn't been in the best health recently so this is starting to worry me.

At her own expense she's purchased all the cat-friendly deterrents, and has been very courteous to her neighbour, trying to explain and that she really doesn't want any issues. The neighbour basically says cats are cats and just deal with it. And also likes to mention the dead animals that her cats are dragging in, which also upsets my mum.

Last night this took a sinister turn. The neighbours are out (i'm guessing they're away for the weekend), but the lady's dad often stops by to feed the cats if they're out. My mum sees this man throw a dying bird in to my mum's front garden. Not dead, it was actively suffering an agonising death (i'm guessing one of the cats got to it), and he throws it into the garden of a women who he knows would be severely distressed by this action.

Unfortunately I don't live nearby, but her neighbours helped her out and calmed her down. I advised she report it to the police, which she has done.

She now feels unsafe in her own home. A home she has lived in, brought up 2 kids in as a single mother on a nurses salary.

Now obviously the neighbours themselves didn't do this, it was their relative. We don't know how they're going to react, but so far they've been pretty nasty.

If anyone has any sage advice, either on what to do in this situation or about the ongoing cat problem and suggestions for how she can up the cat proofing in her garden then i'd welcome your thoughts.",08Jun2019,2

This happened to me two days ago.

First of all some background:   I am bi in denial and nobody knows except my best friend.I have had a crush on one of my theater friend (TF)for a while now,who is also bi,for like 3 months.

Story:I was at my F1s(friend one) house with F2,F3 and BF(best friend)who was running a little late.We played truth or dare and had a really good chat.After a little while ,we started to talk about our crushes,like all girls do.F2 told us that she had a crush on F1 brother,F1 didn’t had one and I said that I had two male crushes(It wasn’t a big lie since I have a another crush on a male friend of mine).Then came the turn of F3.She said something that I wasn’t expecting at all.She said that she had a crush on TF and that she was bi ,which apparently EVERYONE IN THE ROOM KNEW except me.I played along saying that I hate TF,which I did at the past ,and acted as normal as I could.
After a while,BF came.We told her what she had missed and the crush of F3 .She understood how I was feeling and I took her to another room.I was ready to have a panic attack.She calmed me down and said that I should tell F3 about my feelings for TF.I didn’t.
What should I do?Should I tell her and If something happens between me and TF,what do I do ?
I have lied about my feelings and feels like shit.I even went so far as to tell F3 that I would help her with TF at a 3 day tour,which I will go with my theater group for an international festival ,in which we had been chosen.She doesn’t know that one of my goals ,except doing great at my performance ,is to make her(TF) fall in love with me.

Here are some points


When I was six she  regularly beat us what seems to be everyday and every night. It would be over the dumbest things. Example someone accidentally ran thru the laundry room door and broke the glass so she lined five of us and proceeded to beat like we we were dogs

Example 2. One time we all were joking we couldn’t stop laughing she got angry and said we if don’t stop laughing she beat us. Long story short beat for no reason.

Example 3. This what she did to me personally that started my hatred toward her she was the worst type of bully that traumatize me to this day. She would make fun of me call me all types of homophobic slurs insult me in public and front of people made me feel anything less than human it felt very dehumanizing to through that there’s more reason why I hate.

Example 4. I blame her ruthless behavior to the reason was molested and raped by brothers and it confused my sexual orientation I didn’t know if I was gay or straight it really messed up me. 

Example 5. She forced us to go out and fundraise so she could go and send money down there to the scammers we did this for almost a whole decade. 
She e would get angry if we didn’t want to do she would be beat us if we didn’t meet the quota, we wasted ten summers and only that she forced us to do it after school it was embarrassing thing to ask kids you go to school with if they want to buy candy.

319,"Right now my living situation is not optimal. I am almost 20 years old and still very reliant on my mother for transportation and residency.

My mother lives in a two-bedroom income based apartment, meaning rent is based off the income of the adults living there. Due to this fact, I am paying $480+ a month for a small bedroom. Currently, I am being offered to sublease an apartment from a friend. A studio that is also $480 a month and includes utilities such as water, electric, and gas. The only additional fee that I don't already pay for would be internet. I buy my own groceries, laundry necessities, hygiene products, and general upkeep (though all of my items get used by my mom or my brother, it drives me crazy.) 

I have many reasons to want to move out of my mother's place, and I want to name a few of them. She drag smokes cigarettes, so the place always stinks and I have frequent asthma attacks. My mother and brother never clean up after themselves, therefore the place is always a disaster and fire hazard. There is absolutely no privacy; people barge into the bathroom and bedroom constantly without even a slight warning. My bedroom, which I am paying for, is used as additional storage for my mother. My mother has also decided to sleep on my bed for awhile (I work third shift) and now my bed is covered with ash stains, and who else knows what. It is an absolutely depressing place to live. 

I really want to move into this apartment, as I know I can sustain myself independently. It is near grocery stores and other places that are within walking distance, anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour. I have many friends and pay some of them to drive me to other places, such as work, the mall, etc. Growing up, my mother was a very stubborn parent when it came to me becoming independant. This woman did not let me get a driver's license. When I turned 18, I had to rush out and get all of my own paperwork (birth certificate, ss card, a state id) because she always took it and conveniently lost it. It has been hard trying to develop well, but my dad has always been somewhat helpful despite being three hours away. 

Anyhow, in order to get a license I would need to get glasses (I do not currently have glasses, due to an incident a few years ago), I would need to get a permit, I would need to find a car to practice in ($1000+ already) and I would need to either take classes or get a friend above 21 years old to teach me themselves. All of this could take months.

The question is whether or not I move out now, and then get a car, or if I try to tough it up and get a car then move out. This apartment is a super sweet deal and I'm not sure I will get offered it again(especially since it allows cats, which I own) but on the other hand, I am worried that I am rushing into things without a vehicle.

- in particular I’m getting really anxious about our relationship lasting - like I feel like there’s no reason for us to split - we have a fantastic relationship, we have two TVs in our room so we can do-op in games together! I love being with him. And coming home to him. But I have this big anxious energy and thought trains telling me he’s going to leave or he’s going to stop loving me or he’s just not going to stay with me.

(More footnotes: this is the longest relationship I’ve been in and it’s only been 6 months. I’ve had numerous relationships in the past that have all been with bad guys who didn’t care about me, drug dealers and I was always attracted to guys who treated me like shit - until now. I’ve been raped twice. First time was how I lost My virginity. I was 12. Second time was by a complete stranger. I’ve had a medical abortion and it was a traumatic experience - I got an infection post abortion and nearly died. )

Me and him live together....which we did after 3 months. But things have been progressing really well in our relationship so far. We’ve met each other parents, we both want each other to succeed and we both seem to be really good for each other - my family and friends all seemed to notice a change in me in how happy I was when we got together. His friends seem to really like me too! And I like them! 

But lately, really since I got the IUD in (and I got the copper one specifically so I wouldn’t react to it emotionally or hormonally, ) back in February of this year, I’ve just noticed my anxiety has spiked and I am worried about my relationship and whether we are right, and whether the obstacles in our paths are the ones that will bring the inevitable break up. 

But a deeper part of me doesn’t see an end to our relationship? And it’s the first time I’ve ever experienced that, and my other half feels the same. And THATS a first too - that were both on the same page. 


Should I give my IUD time to settle? Or should I go to my doctor and see about getting anxiety meds? old meditation techniques are as effective as the used to be when I was in therapy before - I’ve been trying them lately and it isn’t helping the same way it used to. 


Thank you 🙏🏽",08Jun2019,1

325,"Ever since I was little, my parents have pushed me to do physical activity and sports. I am currently 14, and a male, just to clarify. And because of this, I have a very male-like body. But for the past couple of years, I have felt weird, and different. I started crossdressing by myself at home, when nobody was around, or if they were around I would do it in the privacy of my room. Every time I cross dress I feel really happy, and like I am complete, but I know that I can't tell my parents because they would freak out.

I get the clothes from my sister, they're her old clothes that she doesn't wear anymore, and that were going to be thrown out anyway.

328,"Sorry, this might really long and rambly. Some extra information: I'm an only child, due to a health condition my mother and I live in a different city where my university is, while my dad works in a different city, and we're both financially dependant on him.

So, a few days ago, my mother accidentally found out that my father's been having an affair. I didn't know either, even though my father and I are pretty close. I imagine this is the kind of thing you don't tell your 19 year old daughter.

After that, it's been a warzone at home, and my mother keeps trying to make me pick a side. So far I've avoided them trying to rope me into conversations, because it isn't my place to comment, and this isn't my relationship to fix, and I've tried completely avoiding the issue.

Today morning though, my mother yelled at me for some really inane things. I get that she's projecting all her frustration on it, but I really haven't done anything to be yelled at. So when I tried to ask her why she's been trying to take her frustration out on me, she said it's because I ""won't pick a side"". 

And that really hurt, because I don't want to pick a side. It might be selfish, but I've lived for so long with both of them in my life and I do need both of them, so it's extremely unfair of her to make me choose. I will accept their decision, whatever it may be, but I don't know how to make her understand that I'm really not going to get inbetween them or pick one of them.

Tl;dr: I need some advice on how to tell my mother that I'm not going to pick a side between my parents because they're fighting.",08Jun2019,1
329,"Okay so long story short, this guy I’ve been involved with is not the best of news so please don’t lecture me I already know this :( . From finding out he’s cheated on me practically every year we’ve been together (5 years), lied often, talked to girls while we lived together and even now while we currently live together. 

We’re one of “those” that we’re not together anymore, but we’re still living together for the time being. I’ve realized a long time ago that he’s not the one for me, so I’ve mentally and emotionally checked out of this relationship. But if I could have it my way he would be out of here. (He kind of made himself at home against my wishes because we’re not together anymore of course...but he doesn’t listen or respect me. Also my family won’t really physically do anything about it because they kind of like him and I don’t tell them much like how he calls me names, argues with me a lot and other stuff, also he helps them around the house sometimes.)

I’m aware this is unhealthy, I’m almost certain I’m in a emotionally and verbally damaging “relationship” but I feel like no one can help me. Me and him broke up officially about a year or 2 ago and he’s still on my back and disrespects me. As soon as I get the financial means to be on my own that’s what I plan on doing. I just know I have to be the one to leave because he won’t. 

**TLDR:** I’m living with a douche bag, cheating, lying, emotionally/verbally abusive ex-partner and I just recently found out he talks to my little sister on the down low. This all started because we wanted my little sister to open up about things, because she ran away a few times and was rebelling and also some other private things, so we wanted her to feel like she has someone to talk to but then I started noticing them just casually talking, he stopped showing/telling me about their convos altogether and deletes and silences everything and I also think they talk on Snap. (I saw a snippet of a convo where one of them asked for the others’ Snap, but when I clicked on it the thread was gone so idk who asked who.) How would this make you feel if your SO or an ex were doing this? What would be your plan of action? Am I being reasonably suspicious? Especially with his track record. And also my little sister isn’t an angel. I don’t wanna trash talk her but you might get my drift. It doesn’t really help that me and her don’t talk much, because she does some things that I don’t agree with because my mom is too lenient. I’m 23 and so is he, and my sis is 15-16. Please help, I know I’m not crazy. Who would I tell, my mom? and how would I even find out anything if he deletes it? My gut is telling me something is up but I don’t know what to do",08Jun2019,1
330,"I don’t really know what to do about this. My mom hasn’t always been great, I’ve seen her have breakdowns and panic attacks when I was younger. Now she gets really mad at times and will take things to the extreme. However, there are reasons for this.

She is bipolar do some of it comes from that. And the breakdowns were when I was a lot younger and she recently broke up with my dad.

My dad has cheated on 2 people supposedly. My mom and his most recent wife who I really liked. But I also know that he’s had an abusive father and when he cheated on his most recent wife, it was shortly after 2 of his siblings just passed away.

But my mom has lied before to try and get what she wants. She got in a fight with her (now ex) boyfriend and threw something at him, and then he threatened to call the cops and she started crying saying he hit her before.

And if I asked my dad if it were true or not, I know exactly what he’d do because he’s done it before. He’d deny it, call my mom every name in the book, and then most likely start throwing things.

They’ve both also guilt tripped me a lot, especially when I was a lot younger. My mom made me promise to never live with my dad over and over one night. My dad basically said that he thought about killing himself when he couldn’t talk to us when I was maybe in 5th or 6th grade.

I have what seems like endless horrible stories for each of them, but only some I’ve actually witnessed. However I also do have good stories of both, but do those even matter at this point?

I’m 15 and I only have a summer job so moving out isn’t an option. And I can only move in with a friend if things spiral out of control.

I also just want to be in the neutral because I don’t know if I can’t trust what they’re saying, or if I just don’t want to believe them.",08Jun2019,1

I live thousands of miles away from home, and I’ve lived other places alone as well so it’s incredibly easy for me to “bend” the truth if you will and extremely difficult to fact check me. I lie about the dumbest things too. My home life, ex-friends, relationships, my real friends, and much more. The problem is that there’s literally no reason for me to do it. There’s nothing wrong with these things as they are, I’m not embarrassed by any of them, but I still continue to lie. It’s gotten so bad that I can’t even connect my different lives together because people would know that I’ve been lying to them. God it’s like some of these people don’t even know me and I feel so guilty. I don’t want this to go on any longer, but I don’t know how to fix it.

I have already paid for the plane ticket. I don’t have a car here anymore. I will have to spend money to keep from loosing my license. After I buy a car and get a new job and spend that money on my license I wont have much left. So it will take a while to save up to enough to travel again. He says he would get me a job and car but also says he has no money. I will be teaching english abroad and have room and board set up. I will have to cancel all of that.

339,"TL;DR: Parents keep commenting on my weight and eating habits. I’ve had body issues in the past and find this extremely hurtful. How can I get through to them? 

Lately every time I go to eat my parents have something to say about what I’m eating or the portion size. It’s gotten to the point where I’m too scared to eat anything around them and instead sneak food late a night, which I know is unhealthy. 

For context, I’m not in the shape that I would like to be. I’m 168cm and weigh 68kg. This technically places me in the healthy BMI weight range, but my fat is noticeably distributed around my stomach. 

I’m quite physically active, so I recognise that my diet is the main pitfall for me in being healthy/losing weight. I’ve taken steps to remedy this, and have signed up with a free coaching service to make sure that I’m making healthy meal choices. 

It just hurts that every time I eat, I get passive-aggressive comments along the lines of “oh, that sandwich has a lot of carbs...”. Or If I’m dressed up they’ll always comment on how much nicer I’d look if I lost weight.I think that they mean well, but this only makes me feel hopeless rather than encouraging me. 

I’ve dealt with body issues all my life, and I’ve actually felt more comfortable within myself than ever lately. I want to focus on getting fit and healthy, and avoid words like ‘fat’ and ‘dieting’ that have sent me spiralling in the past.

I can't hold a job for more than a few months, my longest was about 6. I used to think it was 'cause I was just lazy or somethin', but I've realized over the years that it's just 'cause I hate workin' the same job over and over.

Benefits of Cold Showers (from my experience)

-Takes minimal time (no more half an hour showers)
-YOU STILL FEEL WARM AFTERWARDS (when your body slowly heats up again once you're out of the shower, it feels just like a warm shower, if not better)
-10x more energy throughout the day
-immune system boosted substantially (haven't been ill since I started 2 months ago)
-more willpower to do anything
-generally a lot happier throughout the day
-hair is a lot more smooth, and cures hair loss
-skin is no longer dry

&amp;#x200B;

The situation is more complicated, at least I think so, than the title states. So please, bear with me.

Few months ago I posted in another subreddit about my ""relationship"" with, lets call him, Tom. At that point we were going out on dates, we would kiss and grab hands. The problem was that he wasn't ready for a serious relationship, but he did like me. My feelings were more than that and I was really sad most of the time. We talked about it, at first he told me I could have some time for myself if I needed it, that he would wait because he wanted to keep going out with me. But at the end we decided to be friends.

After that we went out three more times. The first time everything pretty normal, we had fun and he even apologized if he ever hurted me. I told him that it wasn't really his fault, that he had been honest about his feelings and that it was me who decided to keep going on dates with him despite knowing I could end up in a bad position.

The second one was more flitry. I didn't realize at the begginning but at some point he was putting his hand on top of mine and in general, he was trying to get closer to me. I didn't know how to react so I didn't say anything. At the end he told me that he still liked me, a lot, and he had been thinkig about the whole situtation. That he was affraid of fucking up and that's why he wasn't quite ready for something serious. But now he was also worried about losing me and said he might regret everything at some point. Some of his friends were really mad at him for letting me go, and all this had him confused. I was quite buffled, but I told him again that it wasn't his fault, and that the real mistake would have been starting a relationship when you aren't ready for it. I also explaind to him that the reason I decided to keep going out with him was because I didn't want to regret it latter, that at least I wanted to try and be with him. I think that got him thinking, but I 'm not sure anymore.

The third time was our goodbye. You see, he is now in the military. Not because he is patriotic, but because it's a stable job with a good pay. Also, in my country soldiers are not required to go to war zones and can actually choose in what base to stay (he is going to choose one that 30 minutes away from were I live). Going back to that last time I saw him, I helped him buy somethings he needed before leaving, we ate together and had a good time. It feels like it wasn't enough. When he had to go, we hugged and he started nipping softly in my cheek. That's something he used to do when we were on the other stage of relationship, when we used to make out. I kind of panicked and ask him to hug proprely. As soon as I saw his car disappear I started crying.

Now he has been gone for two weeks, and I still feel like shit. He is not coming back until August. Everytime I think about it I feel miserable. I really miss him, and I told him that the same day he was leaving. We talk from time to time, but obviously not that much, I don't really know what he thinks about us now, I wish I did.

I know that I should ""stay away"" for some time, I think is the best for me. And this is where my dilemma comes into play.

A part of me wants to tell him about it, so he isn't weirded out when he realizes I'm not talking. If I do this I want him to know that it isn't fault, it's me that can't deal with the situation. This doesn't mean I don't want to see him anymore, but I do think is the best.

Another part of me doesn't want to make him worry or feel like I'm pressuring him into making a decision. He is also very busy, so I don't know when the best moment to tell him all this would be. But at the same time I don't want to just desappear on him and don't tell him anyhthing.

What would be the best approach? Should I bear with it and wait until he is back to really talk to him?",08Jun2019,1
348,"Sorry if I violate some guidelines or unwritten rules of reddit or this subreddit, very new to reddit.

Me - 23M

Her - 22F

I've been talking to this girl for a few weeks now and she sends the most confusing snapchats ever. I'll send her a snapchat of me at a bar, thinking she might be in the area and could come down, or just to talk. But she just sends me a picture of her face, usually zoomed in to show her eyes and above with no/little text.

No idea what this means.

Pic of me at my job, pic of me at the gym, pic of my dog, pic of me on a hike, pic of the movie I'm watching, pics of a meal I'm cooking (amateur chef, love cooking in my spare time), etc.......face snapchats. Every. Single. Time.

We met at a mutual friend's house party about 2 months back and ended up talking and making out at the party. I got her number and eventually added her on snapchat. Despite making a move on the first night we met, she knows I'm not after a quick hook-up, FWB or anything like that and I'm sure if she asked our mutual friends they would say the same thing. I haven't sent dick pics, messages about wanting to fuc\* her or similar things that would annoy someone to avoid you. 

Avoid is a bad word for this, because she's actually replying, just not to anything I'm doing. If she wasn't interested, I would think she'd just ignore me. But I'm at a total loss. I usually don't reply back, because what do I even do with this?

351,"Hello r/Advice. this is my first time interacting with this subreddit but i don't know where else to turn, so strap in for this doosy.  


Me and my brother have quite a complicated relationship, we are complete opposite people, him being a politically correct person to the point of frustration, me not sure on my own views and honestly just trying to keep them to myself but i'd say i'm somewhere in the middle.  
Anyway that's not what this is about. My brother is self destructive, bipolar, depressed and couple this with his odd way of showing ""love"" to his family (mocking and making fun of them) it has put me in this place of not knowing my own thoughts and feelings on him. On the one hand hes my brother and i know i should love him despite anything. On the other hand however i know if we weren't blood related i would despise and really not like him as a person.   
We have been in a physical altercation where he hit me and i attacked back, people have told me that when they have hit their siblings they come to regret it. I don't feel that however but the thing that scares me is during that certain altercation after i hit him and went to my room (we were living together at the time). He then started yelling at me again and i replied with ""stop talking, I'm literally shaking with anger and i don't want to break and hit you again"" to which he replied ""do it, hit me"" after telling him i wasn't going to hit him again he said fine, went to the kitchen, grabbed a knife and went to his room, I'm sure you can guess what he did next.  


It's hard when i think of him and just don't feel any love for him because of the way he's always treated me, never being interested in anything in my life, constantly making fun of me, trying to force his political correctness on me and having a go at me when i say something he might deem offensive to a minority group that just seems silly to me for example saying that i think it's stupid how they changed bar bar black sheep to bar bar rainbow sheep.   


He has told me straight up how he's sick of the world being ignorant towards all these minority groups, despite my feelings on that he kept pushing and said if things don't change he's going to kill himself. During this interaction he was crying and opening up. I feel horrible though because i don't feel any sympathy for him because of the way he's always treated me and the fact he has such a massive victim complex and makes something out of everything no matter how minor it is.  


I don't know exactly what I'm looking for while posting this. I'm just concerned on what this means for the type of person i am, am i a horrible person for considering whether i love my brother or not? Because iv'e thought if he is truly in the amount of pain he says he is every day and it's like there's no escape for him iv'e thought maybe suicide could be the answer for him. I'm just not sure if theres something wrong with me for feeling this way about my brother.

352," I have been lurking on reddit for sometime and decided its time to post my question.

I am a very passive person, I don't really know why I am, but I am.

I have seen many posts here lately where passive users and the fights it causes in their relationships. I am trying to avoid this, and well be a better person for my family.

I know it drives my wife bonkers when I am indecisive about things like dinner, what I should wear, that I can not commit to any position, or I belittle anything I may suggest right from the start. It has caused fights between us before, none of which are fun. I know it sounds silly but I get really anxious about making a decision so I try to avoid this at all costs.

She has told me many times that I am very passive and not to be. At one point after a particularly bad argument she even told me she was ashamed of me and unattractted to me because I am so passive and indecisive. I really don't know what to do, but I do not want a walk away wife, and want to fix this.",08Jun2019,1

354,"So this weekend is my “prom weekend” where usually everyone goes crazy and has fun after prom.

My friends decided to do little daytrips instead of go with the rest of my grade to the beach, which is fine because I’m saving money and all I guess. 

The only thing is, I’m bored out of my mind. And so are they. I’m trying to have fun but they literally look so bored. 

I feel like my weekend has been ruined. I’m literally staying off of social media so I don’t have to see everyone else having so much fun down at the beach partying and all.

I’m just disappointed I guess. Everything is a flop.",08Jun2019,1

356,"Hey Reddit! 
So, some context, I listen to my music on my iPod, because I have prefer to have my music on a separate device and save space on my phone. 

My iPod is amazing, but it has one issue, which is a faulty headphone jack. With any and all wired earbuds, it will play through one ear and you have to constantly adjust it and find the position where it plays in both ears. It's generally a pain in the ass. 

I was wondering where I can get some nice, wireless earbuds that are cheap or at least worth the price, so I don't have to deal with this issue anymore. I don't like using headphones because they don't fit my head properly. 

Thanks in advance!",08Jun2019,1

358,"I hadn't contacted her for a month post breakup. She had dumped me. We hadn't texted at all. So she texts me out of nowhere. 

She said ""Congratulations on your presentation! (work thing). Amazing as always, so good.""

She then said ""I'm so proud of you.""

Then: ""We haven't spoken in awhile. How have you been?""

I told her ""Good, that's true we haven't spoken in a while. How are you?""

So the conversation continued. She wouldn't let it die, ever. She randomly complimented me at times, encouraged me to get a job at the place she volunteers at with her, and kept asking questions.

At one point it led into a kind of intimate/personal thing, reminded me a lot of our conversations during the relationship.

Then the next day, she continues texting. We were at a common social event, and she apologized for saying something that was embarassing for me on accident, saying she felt terrible and it was a slip of judgment.

Then she continued to ask questions and compliment me.

Once again, I didn't contact her. She reached out fairly randomly to me. And we haven't stopped texting for those two days.

Why is she doing this? And what should I do?

So I'm going to try to break it off. Not sure what the most respectful way to do that is.

363,"I recently deleted all my social media accounts. There were many things bothering me about them. I was active on snapchat and twitter. On snapchat I had hundreds of views per post however 95% of the people seeing what was going on in my life were people I don’t really go out with or have any connection with. Most of them were secondary school people etc. I realised on Snapchat I was being fake. I could have been having the worst day of my life but I’d capture 5 seconds of fun I had and then people would assume I’m living the life. That’s why I got rid of sc plus the fact that it gave me anxiety knowing that people know exactly where I am 24/7 since I posted a lot etc. 


With twitter I had 11k followers, it was a meme acc and I’d come on say something funny or post a meme and lots of people would like it and then I’d feel like a celebrity since none of my friends had a following like that themselves. After a while I realised I didn’t like the attention and I didn’t want to become a narcissist person who thought they were funnier and cooler than other people so I deleted twitter as well.

(like, a real artist, not one of those city run stuff) and it was awesome. i’d look at all her paintings and drawings and flip through books that had all her gallery displays in it and rmeber being totally fascinated. we’d have little workshops throughout the week where she’d bring in her fellow artist friends to teach workshops, like clay and origami. i still have all of the things i made there. 
she’d give us two really generous breaks throughout the day where she’s give us wafer cookies (i think that’s where my love of those stemmed from) played outside, we’d play board games, and she even brought us upstairs a few times to show us cat videos. she had a really friendly, fat cat who we all loved. at the end of the week, shed give away some of the kid stuff she had to those who wanted it. her two daughters at the time were since grown up, so she has no real use for them.

I’ve never had a boyfriend, never been to a real party, gotten drunk etc. I really want to experience that. 

What does everyone else do? Do normal people date before they’re 18? Am I late to the game? Is university fun? How do you get invited to parties?

He left for a competitor. A guy at a rival company across town is being brought in for the open position. He told me what he makes there and that he can't take anything less. His salary is 20% more than mine. He recently met with my boss and reiterated his current salary and the need to maintain it, and my boss is still in talks with him. I'm better at our job than this guy and it can be proven by national contests ranking us. He doesn't even place. I'm in the top ten in the country. Even if this guy agrees to accept a little less, I'm sure it's going to be more than what I make. And now this guy is worried I might say something to ruin his chances to get hired. He doesn't see their treatment of me as a red flag because he'll be getting paid so it's not his problem. I'm just very confused as to why they would bring someone in and pay them 20% more than me when they're already afraid to lose anyone else. To me, this is a slap in the face. I'm currently eyeing jobs with other companies that would pay me 50% more. These jobs are a step up and would involve doing what we do but on a national level instead of local as well as a lot of travel. So what do I do? Apply for these jobs and hope for the best?

387,"I’m going to do my best to keep over two decades worth of history extremely brief. I’m bad for bricks of text so I’m going to present them in points to keep myself on track:

• i am 21 and i live at home with my mom—my dad (who had a severe battle with alcoholism) was shot to death relatively recently 
• my mother has severe mental illness (she’s on social assistance for it) and a history of hard drug abuse 
• my mother has a kind heart but something to do with her extensive mental health issues turns her into dr. jekyll and mr. hyde when she’s upset. i relate to a lot of stories on r/raisedbynarcissists without her having some of the malicious cornerstone qualities of a narcissist. it’s like accidental narcissism. 

• my mother is extremely thin and i’ve always had a heavier frame, although i am not obese. (my mom is 5’8” &amp; 100lbs. and i’m 5’4” and 135 lbs.) she has given me a serious weight complex by constantly telling me i’d be prettier if i was skinnier. she’s since stopped that in my later adult years, but it went on from ages 9-17. 

• her boyfriend is an alcoholic and an addict and a bonafide narcissist (where i think some of those qualities in her come from) i’ve had a dicey history of screaming fights with him— he has the mentality of a 20 year old in a 60 year old’s body and always goes straight for name calling and cursing. 

• my mom was clean for the first 11 years of my life but began using again when she met her boyfriend while i was in grade school. she stopped making my lunches and waking up in the morning. i was a “mature kid” and it would be “babyish” of me to imply i “needed mommy” to wake up with me in the morning (exact quotes). i was in the 5th grade. 

• fast forward to now, i’m 21 and i’m still living at home. i’m a creative and i’ve been writing, making art &amp; music since i first learned how to walk and talk. i was recognized for academic excellence in junior kindergarten for hand-making a 6 page book—i’ve held the same affection for writing over the years. 

• all of that is relevant because my mom’s parents put away money for me to go to school but refused to allow me to go for a creative discipline—it had to be academic, preferably law or medicine because i had the grades and the demeanour for it... just not the drive. 

• i dropped out of my first week of an academic degree to spare my grandparents the tuition $ for something i knew i wouldn’t enjoy—i love writing but i hated the structure of being an english major. i promised them i wanted to pursue higher education but i needed some time to figure out how to satisfy my own needs as well as theirs. 

• my grandfather passed away, and my grandmother closed the education fund because i’m “lazy” and i “show no promise”. this is the absolute farthest thing from the truth. i’ve been working minimum wage to get by as well as taking commissions and building a portfolio over the years. i’ve been bookmarking and comparing different universities all over the country trying to come up with a career path that pleased me as well as the people paying for it. i decided to go for a bachelors in psychology, then teacher’s college. here nor there—that issue is an entirely separate post on its own. my grandmother is an intelligent but extremely cold and emotionally manipulative person, which is where i assume my mom gets that from. 

• my mom is 62 and she has chronic obstructive lung disorder, emphysema, and drinks 6 cans of coca cola a day, very few meals. i’m constantly “checking” her regarding her health, calling her on chainsmoking when she’s gasping, taking her respiratory meds, making sure she puts something of substance in her stomach (bread/pasta/veggies). her boyfriend is emotionally abusive and doesn’t care whether she takes care of herself or not. i am mortally afraid of moving out and leaving her alone with him because i know they will descend full swing back into their drug abuse and i don’t think my mom can survive it this time around. i vomit frequently over the anxiety and fear of losing my last living parent and the only relative i have who loves me— i have nobody that i can stay with. i have one friend but she lives 50 minutes away in a neighbouring city and i don’t drive. 

• i’ve expressed wanting to move out since i was 16 years old. my mother always told me i would NEVER make it on my own because i’m a train wreck of a person who needs constant supervision. (couldn’t be farther from the truth). I said last week that I’m looking for apartments and she completely derailed into hysterics saying “you have no money. you can’t do it. you’ll fail. you’ll fail. you’ll come running home. you can’t do it.” that is the narrative i’ve lived my entire life under. not to toot my own horn (frankly, my horn hasn’t tooted in so long i’m not even sure it can anymore) but i am pretty damn good at making art. it was a natural gift i was blessed with that i honed the FUCK out of. my closest friend (and former partner but again that’s it’s own post) who i met online when we were 11 is a producer in hollywood. we’ve been trying for years to find a way to get me over to the states with her. we’ve decided that the easiest route to a visa is getting signed with a modelling agency that represents in both canada and the usa. due to my absolutely botched sense of self, i have never let a person photograph me until last year. after my first shoot, a bunch of local photographers reached out and i’ve been slowly compiling a portfolio ever since, but i’ve also pulled out of a lot of amazing opportunities because i felt “fat”. i was 200lbs at the height of my depression—i lost 70lbs (i’m back up a bit now) but i can’t seem to see myself as anything other than fat. yet, i look at women who are twice the size of me in awe of their beauty and never once think the word “fat” about them. only about me. 

i know there are a lot of random details peppered into this. i’m trying to paint the best picture i possibly can without getting into my entire life’s worth of history. 

i have marketable skills. i am a great communicator. i am a hard worker who takes pride in everything i do, from bussing tables to painting portraits. i’m humble and punctual and well-manicured and professional and i give every ounce of energy in my body to maintaining those qualities despite all the opposing forces... but i’m running out of energy and i’m getting tired. i’m expending way too much and i’m not seeing any return—i know a lot of it has to do with my mindset but i can’t seem to pull myself out of this hole. 

my garbage self confidence coupled with a lifetime of emotional (and sometimes physical) abuse, addiction, violence, and the constant fear that my mom has going to die has completely robbed me of my joy of living. 

i love creating and i absolutely love taking care of my dog. he is 6 months old and the joy of my world. i stayed with my best friend in the states for two months a few years ago and she said i am an entirely different person when i am outside of the darkness of my home life and she is 100% right.

the minute i find the confidence to regain my footing, my own mother whips out a baton made of my shortcomings and fucking kneecaps me. i’ve been drinking a lot lately and she screams in my face that i am a worthless drunk if i wake up in a solemn mood the morning after. i reminded her today that she willingly had a baby with a man who had 8 beers in him by noon every day—i am genetically disposed to alcoholism and my home life is a cesspool of misery. of course i’m going to drink. i’m not proud and i hate it. 

i am 8 days deep into the darkest insanity i’ve ever experience inside of my own home and my own head

i’m sorry this post is an absolute fucking train wreck but i am grasping at straws and i seriously have no idea where to start getting help

there’s a clinic for people who can’t afford mental health help but my mom has made me feel so dumb and embarrassed for wanting to go there that i’ve talked myself out of it. it’s my only shot at something similar to therapy but i’m too ashamed and humiliated to even go. 

i don’t even know why i’m posting this anymore. i just need someone to tell me that i’m not a waste of skin. i’m embarrassed about all of this but i’ve reached rock bottom and i’m genuinely concerned for my well-being right now.

388,I've had a serious argument with my friends I think we're done. It was over some girl. I feel like dying. I'm full of anger and fear and severely depressed. I speak to none of my family and I just can't build relationships with people. I don't know what's wrong with me I have nothing to live for anymore I'm a useless prick I'm scum I hate myself.,08Jun2019,1
389,"I’ve know this friend, Z (not putting any full names) for 5 years now and I really put my heart into our friendship and consider her my best and closest friend but I feel like she’s always taking me for granted. 

Going on a rant here:

I always have to take the initiative and actively try to hang out and talk with her, or else she wouldn’t even make an effort to hang out with me or have any sort of conversation with me. It’s really tiring to me emotionally to always have to think of stuff to talk with her, and she always seems so disinterested whenever I’m talking, it’s like I’m a jester trying to entertain a king. The only thing that interests her in any way is when we talk about the cute boys and how they look, which makes me really uncomfortable cause I don’t like commenting on other people’s looks. 

She’s also really hot and cold towards our friendship. Sometimes when she’s in a good mood, she would make plans for us to hang out and talk, which makes me really really happy and I feel like I’m actually worth something in her life. Other times though, she would ignore me completely, like she didn’t know me and she would brush off everything I said with “okay”, “whatever”, or sometimes with a nod, even sometimes looking at me blankly like I had said something stupid.

She wasn’t like that at the start of our friendship, she was super nice and enthusiastic about everything, but gradually she seems like she lost interest in being friends with me or something. But with her other friends, she was really talkative and super clingy to them, completely opposite to how she treated me. She always seems so invested and interested in what they had to say which made me feel really bad cause I keep thinking that I’m not “interesting” enough for her. She never lets me hang out with any of her other friends and it really makes me think “I’m not good enough for them”. It has really hurt my self esteem over the years. 

I know this isn’t a healthy friendship, but every time I try cutting it off, I just get soft-hearted when she makes any sort of effort to fix our friendship (and ultimately this continues the vicious cycle). It’s really hard for me to cut her off since she’s the longest friendship I ever had and I’ve invested all my trust into her.  Though it really feels like beating a dead horse with this friendship. 

I really want it to work out but I feel it’s quite hopeless, any advice on how to deal with it?

TL;DR ver.

Best friend doesn’t treat me as an equal and takes me for granted. Acts kinda two-faced and dismissive. Really need some advice on how to deal with it.",08Jun2019,2

So I’m 23 recently turned 24 and I have a sister who’s a year younger than me. She will graduate college tomorrow and I really am happy and proud for her! 
I dropped out of college when I was 20 because of depression and not knowing what I want.
I went back to college few months ago however I can’t help but feel like I’m a failure.
I’m constantly told I’m a failure, that everyone my age and few years younger graduated, that I’m too old for college, family members and relatives asking me uncomfortable questions and I’m just too tired.

I have met many people my age, younger and older in college so I try not to think but they constantly remind me of how much of a failure I am and I can’t help but feel suicidal. I feel tired and I need advice on how can I stop letting them put me down or idk, I just feel lost and I’m wondering if it’s really worth it to go on and study.",08Jun2019,1
391,"So, lately our team has gotten smaller and smaller. One of our team members, who just recently left the company, had a close relationship with my supervisor. I can tell that losing him has been a little hard on my supervisor. It's also possible that I could be wrong, but my intuition tells me otherwise. Not only that, but just this week another coworker gave in their two weeks.

I work hard and do my best at work, I want to be as reliable as I can to my supervisor both through work ethic and through mental support because I've grown to really care about him. I did try and convey to my supervisor how I feel today, and asked him if there was anything else I could do to be supportive to him. He told me there wasn't anything, but I am wondering if any strangers on the internet may have some good advice even if it's something I might already doing.

So I decided to start with a community college to dip my toes into higher education before I dive into Uni. I currently have my Associates of Science in Psychology.

I'm a psych major and want to focus on the research aspect of things. But now I'm transferring to a university I have the option to declare a concentration. I've always wanted to work with kids and would be interesting to do child psychology research and minoring in early childhood development.

Or should I perhaps do adult psychology research and minor in something else?

She thinks men are ""disgusting"" and makes harsh generalisations about them. She also takes advantage of every opportunity to say horrible things about my dad she's never really been on good terms with. She blames everyone and everything apart from herself when something goes wrong, just an example: Last night, she lost a nail-file of mine, after already losing other small belongings of mine such as pens or hair-clips. I politely, yet frustratingly told her: ""Mum, it's not that hard to just remember where you put my things, or at the very least, use them, then leave them back where you found them. What did I get?

He's been there with me through so much and he's the only reason I've made it this far without killing myself. He's so perfect and he loves me too.

405,"
So I met this guy around 6 months ago, very casually. We slept together and have seen each other/slept together about 5 times since, one of us always seems to be out of the country. Although have spoken almost every day for the last 4-5months. 

We have admitted that we have feelings for each other a few months ago but decided to leave it until we can see each other. We agreed that we might sleep with other people and that’s okay. 

Although things started to get more serious after this, we spoke heavily about dating when I’m home and being together for a long time. My feelings got a lot stronger. 

Then the other week we had a small argument and didnt message for about a week, when we did start talking again he decided to tell me he’s joined tinder and feels guilty so we should not continue to talk. He then tells me he has slept with someone and will see her again, isn’t sure if he might like to date her or not. He felt guilty and I was extremely hurt so he decided he’d rather tinder over talking to me for the time being and we decided to stop talking. 

A few days later he turns around and says he has told the other girl how he feels, that he can’t stop thinking of me, is off tinder and only wants me. 

I really like this guy, something about him keeps bringing me back to him but I’m confused and don’t know what to do. Am I just an after thought to him? Does he only want me now that he feels he cannot have me?",08Jun2019,1

The main problem I have with politics right now is the left's incessant need to censor everything, and the right's incessant need to say everyone should be able to say anything without moderation, including letting conspiracy promoting actual neo-Nazis talk unrestricted when some people wouldn't be able to tell the difference between that and what actually happened.

I suffer depression but can't use antidepressants due to health issues and therapy has been no help at all. My depression is 'high-functioning' so I don't stay in bed all day, it just means I exist and sometimes I get a really low mood, I experience suicidal ideation daily but most of the time it's just thinking and rarely am I actively suicidal.

Therapists sometimes ask me how I deal with being suicidal, I don't know I just do - I mean, what's the alternative? Death. It honestly feels like because I don't try to kill myself they decide I don't need any help to deal with suicidal ideation.

The typical advice is call a suicide hotline but they just give cookie cutter responses so don't actually help. I have no friends or family either. 

In terms of my depression things like exercise, meditation, etc. doesn't help. I need very real practical things to change my life in order for my depression to be dealt with, unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any suitable support for me.

427,"So I've got a friend, we'll call her K. So K and I have been friends for roughly 4 years. We've talked on the phone almost daily, even when I moved away for about 7 months. We are pretty close I would say. We are part of the 4-some of friends, so ideally no one really feels left out. One of the friends in our group...i'll call her T has a 16 month old. K is the godmother, and sometimes likes to throw it in people's faces because she can be like that. 

Anyway, so back in February T's kid had her first bday party. I lived out of town at the time so I crashed at T's place and helped her with the party set up, hungout, what have you. K and I had talked the night before and she kept complaining about how she didn't have a car. She never asked for a ride, just kept complaining that her car wasn't working. The plan was for T's mother in law to drive her to the party, because they both lived in the same town. So I didn't offer to pick her up, it was never even discussed as an option. 

The next day I got a text from K asking if I was planning on seeing my boyfriend, who lives in the same town as K. I responded with ""No, he's out of town"" and her response (no pun intended) was ""K"" Again, she didn't ask for a ride. So she eventually gets to the party because her sister drove her. She was only a few hours late, but earlier had blown up snapchat saying that she wasn't going to be able to come. I wasn't really to worried about it because I was busy helping T and her mom set up for the party, and for some reason K couldn't just ask T's mother in law. 

So K's at the party, being snarky and petty the entire time. Blatantly ignoring me which I would later find out it was because she blamed me for being late. So K would pull T aside throughout the party to talk to her, instead of letting her just enjoy her kid's 1st bday. 

Fast foreword about a week and a half. I started my new job back in the town where T lived. I was staying with T and she informed me that K had made comments to her like ""I guess I'm going to have to get used to you both getting close again"" and ""I just can't have people like her (meaning me) in my life"" She also threw shade at me to my boyfriend when I wasn't around, claiming that I was a liar and that if I didn't apologize I wasn't going to be in K's wedding. I confronted her about these comments, but I wasn't about to apologize for something I didn't do. Lastly, I was over at T's house in the beginning of April and she informed me that K was coming over. We hadn't talked at all since the party really. I was there when K got there, and she was being rude, trying to get T by herself and just being petty. I went inside to go to the bathroom, and K sent me a personal snap that had her, T, and the baby in it and it said ""got all my bridesmaids"" meaning I wasn't in her wedding. 

At this point it's been 5 months since we've really talked, but I've still got a desire to be friends with her. There's good qualities about her too...but I don't know if I want to be friends with someone who talks shit about me...what do I do?

TL;DR: One of my friends was too chicken shit to ask for a ride to her goddaughters 1st bday, she blames me for being late, she told our other mutual friend and my boyfriend some pretty harsh and untrue shit about me. And informed me that I wasn't in her wedding via Snapchat. Should I end the friendship?",08Jun2019,1

430,"This probably sounds stupid but oh well-I’m 15. My girlfriend and her mom invited to me to go out of town one day with them. Prior to that, I had two options for that day. I could either stay home and hang out with my dad or go with them. I woke up at like 9 in the morning and there was snow on the ground. My dad wanted to me to help him with stuff outside and since there was snow I didn’t assume that we would do that. In the moment, I thought that it didn’t matter what I did because they would know that I was with my girlfriend if I wasn’t home, so I just walked out of the house and left with them, not telling anybody. That night when I got back, obviously my parents were mad and I apologized. My girlfriends mom found out too and she got mad at me too, and I apologized.

431,"Hi everyone,

First off, this is my first ever post in this sub, so if something's wrong with my post please do tell.

Okay so on to the actual problematic : I will be trying going a month without using social media, video games or any other form of cyber-activity starting in a week, cold turkey-style. I wouldn't say I'm exactly suffering form cyber-addiction, but I've been increasingly aware in the past few months that it affects my life in a negative way, rather than a positive one (or at least I was able to admit it to myself). It's just become the default thing I'll do when I have free time, and I have all the trouble in the world keeping track of the time, and overall pulling myself out of whatever I'm doing on my computer after I've sat down.

I was wondering if anyone here has some tips regarding this type of project.

I'm considering using the implementation intention method, which recommends planning some kinds of activities in situations I'll be particularly tempted to relapse.

I've been thinking of going my middle name, an ""English"" name, that is easy for people to say. I like my middle name and I wouldn't mind switching over to using that name instead of my first. However I'm \[first name\] to everyone I know: family, friends, co-workers, classmates, etc, and it would be challenging for these people to start calling me \[middle name\] instead.

(They were the only people left in the pub before closing)

 another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‘excuse me....excuse me’ and then asked me ‘how do you get a job in here’ and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‘yea we don’t know her that well’ and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ then the brunette said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know...’ and then I juts nodded and she grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you’ quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away.

442,"I've known this girl since the start of the academic year, so for about 3 months now. We talk often and I would consider her to be a good friend of mine. Despite this, my friends think that she's flirting with me and wants to take our relationship further.

&amp;#x200B;

Just a bit of background info. We both attend the same university in Australia, although I am in a liberal arts degree and she is in a commerce degree. This girl is very outgoing and extroverted in that she enjoys talking to many people, including strangers, but not in a 'likes to go to the clubs often' type of outgoing. I'm really the only one in my group of friends (4 girls 3 guys) that's close to her but she is part of a wider group of friends, if that makes sense. What touch barrier that may have existed when we first met is gone by now. As a result, she is incredibly comfortable around me, perhaps this comfort is being misinterpreted as flirting by my friends?

&amp;#x200B;

They point out a few examples, of which they have seen firsthand or have heard me talking about, in which they believe that she was flirting with me.

\- During a horror film, around a month ago, that we were watching as a group, she held my hand during tense moments/jumpscares. Nothing special – we had held hands before at this point – but what stood out to my friends was that we held hands with our fingers interlocked

\- On a particularly cold winter day, she held my cheeks in order to warm her hands up

\- When I was talking about how I had taken the genetic short straw (I have longsightedness and require glasses, my siblings do not) she thought I was talking about my eye colour and said something like 'In terms of physical looks, your eyes are some of the best I've ever seen'

\- At an AGM that we had for the student club that we are a part of, I was sitting next to her and she laid her head on my shoulder for a minute or so during an especially boring speech

\- About 2 weeks ago, we had an event for the student club that we are a part of. When I walked past her on the dance floor in order to grab another drink, she grabbed my arm and yanked me toward her so that I would be forced into dancing with her. She held my hand while dancing at times, and would face me if I walked through. At the end of the night, I asked her if she was coming to a friend's 21st that was in a few days time. She said she would see me there.

\- At my friend's 21st, she spent basically 90% of her time there with me. She again, danced with me on the dance floor and held my hand at times - she would initiate contact. We also talked extensively throughout the night.

\- She also got a buy one get one free drink card, gave it to me and had me buy her a drink

\- On both occasions, I caught a taxi back to her place and then walked home as I only live around 1.5km away from her. When I asked her about paying her back, she told me to buy her a coffee at some point instead

\- She has asked to study with me despite being in completely different courses and not having any subjects in common. I may be no use when it comes to math, but she still enjoys my company

&amp;#x200B;

Thing is, there's significant evidence that, in my opinion, would thwart any talk of her trying to take our relationship further.

\- She has called me 'mate', especially when having heated discussions about politics etc.

\- She has said something like, 'we shall see, my friend, we shall see'. Emphasis on 'friend'

\- She has thanked me for 'being a legend'

\- She's talked about how she will grab friends faces when she's cold in order to warm her hands up, prior to the incident in front of my friends

\- She doesn't treat me much differently when compared with other guys. She held hands and danced with other guys at the event we went to, although, admittedly, not as often as with me

\- She doesn't text me often, most of our chats have been 'get home safe' chats, although she has admitted to valuing human interaction over online interaction

\- Perhaps the nail in the coffin for my friends theory is that she has said I was 'like a brother' to her as she makes the same jokes about having low job prospects as a liberal arts student with her sister – who is also a liberal arts student – therefore making me virtually her brother.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm fine with being just friends, but would not mind taking the relationship further. Although, I don't think I have the guts to pursue her – unless she straight up tells me that she's interested in me – because I don't want to ruin or otherwise make awkward, the friendship that I have built over the last 3 months

&amp;#x200B;

446,"Growing up we never got along. We were always fighting and calling each other names. She was extremely violent. She would throw things at me and cry and scream and say how horrible I was. She would constantly call me retard and stick the middle at me.

I always hated her. I hated how poorly she treated me. She never cared about me. I was very passionate about drawing and she would call my drawings garbage. She even destroyed some of my paintings and ripped my drawings.

I eventually got fed up and just blocked her on Facebook.

Eventually, she moves far away to California. Then she comes back for a little bit and we sort of reconnect. During this time I was in an extreme depression...and she didn't really help...that much.she helped a tiny bit by giving me a hug...but said I was stressing her out? I don't know....I then unblock her on Facebook and send her a message about how sorry I am for being such a bad brother in the past...because I feel like I didn't serve that well as an older brother because of how immature I was...

So then she goes back to California and we are friends on Facebook. I send her pictures of the dogs and she really enjoys them. She then makes plans to come visit and She tells me that she got me a shirt and I TELL her that I am the same size of her boyfriend who is a really big and tall guy just like me.

She finally visits. And she gives me a present. It was an empty box of foreign mexican cookies. She ate the cookies...and she thought it had an interested cartoon graphic on the box and thought I would like it? It was honestly a really lousy gift, because I could easily go to the Mexican store down the street and buy a box just like that...with actual cookies....I do say thank you.

And then she gives me the shirt. And I do say thank you. Later that day I try it on and it doesn't fit. I tell her ""Hey you can give this back to Nick since it's his size, it doesn't fit me"" And she says that it doesn't fit him either and starts screaming at me. And then she just flat out tells me that she got it at goodwill.

And during this time back at the house, she has repeatedly called me retard and faggot and other horrible names. And is screaming at me and sticking her middle finger up at me.

I NEVER call her names. In fact, I tell her to stop calling me names and then she yells at me to quit acting like a retard.

I've just had enough. I just can't stand her and I'm just so hurt and angry. No matter what, she is just a horrible, horrible person and I really hate her. I want nothing to do with her. I feel like smacking her face, but I know that is a big no no. I just want her out of my life. In fact, I don't even want to see her. I just fucking can't stand how shitty of a person she is towards me.

It just sucks, because my dad doesn't get along with his sister either. And my dad doesn't even TALK to his sister or brother. He has a shitty relationship with them too.

I'm just furious and tired and hurt, and I just hate her so much. I really feel sick and don't really want to interact with her anymore. I don't want to send her pictures of the dogs anymore. I don't want to message her. She never cares about me or even asks how I'm doing...and she couldn't even give me a decent hug when she came to visit.

I tried. I tried really hard but she is just pure evil.

But what now? What happens when she has a kid in the future and I become an uncle? Am I supposed to interact with that kid? What on earth am I supposed to do?

I just want to cut her out of my life. In fact, I'm thinking of blocking her on facebook again because of how purely disgusted I am by her behavior and treatment towards me.

I don't know what to do. I'm just very angry and sad that we can't be friends. I thought it was my fault...but now I think it's just because she is just naturally a shitty human being.

447,"On mobile, so yeah... sorry if that affects anything, I don't normally post.

So I work a weekend job in addition to my weekday job. The weekend job is minimal hours but it gives me some spending cash every now and again.

For context, only two employees work at this location. The Monday to Friday employee is technically my manager (and new to our location, this is relevant), while I work the weekend. We work alone each shift.

Lots of changes have been going on around the property, most notably a new addition to the property for business. The problem here is that I wasn't informed of this addition, so when some customers came by and asked me about it, I initially denied it. I did find out in our system that it was in fact ours, and was able to help the customers out for then on, but the surprise of this concerns me. Some customers knew more about the property than I did.

I left a letter in the office, in a place that it couldn't be ignored, asking for more communication. The manager has worked in the company for some time any only began working in my location until recently, and ever since they came on board, I haven't heard much, or nothing at all about office changes or policy changes, or additions to our property. I also made sure to notify my manager's boss, mostly as a heads-up.

That was last week, and upon returning this week, there was nothing. No response, no acknowledgement of my request. I personally contacted the manager's boss and they stated that it was already dealt with. My issue with that, is simply that I don't know what the resolution was, or even if there was one.

Ironically it seems that there is a lack of communication in the response to my complaint about lack of communication. I pressed forward asking for more concrete signs that things are being done, and that proper communication can be established so I know what I can expect walking into work for the day. Sadly I haven't heard back so far.

i'm 16, and my parents are confusing. they're good parents, and they love me, but they are christian (so am i) and don't accept lgbt folks. i realized i'm bi about two years ago and had planned on telling them after i move out. 

i'm lucky i guess, they wouldn't kick me out or anything, but i just don't want it to be a constant argument and stress. my mom is very conservative about lgbt stuff, she doesn't use the right pronouns for trans people or anything, but my dad is more accepting as far as i know. the problem is that my dad will go along with whatever my mom says. 

i'm currently in a relationship of 1.5 years with an amazing guy, and he's been as supportive as anyone could be. 

about a year ago, i came out to my youth pastor. i was confused at the time and just looking for support. since i told him, he has been telling me to come out to my parents, and that i'm sinning by lying to them if i don't. i keep telling him why i don't feel safe telling my parents and why i don't want to or need to but he's been pretty insistent. 

he's made vague threats before about outing me to them, but today he called me on the phone and said that i have three options:
1) come out to them on my own
2)come out to them with him there
3)he'll tell them
he said i have to choose in the next month. 

i'm so frightened right now. i told him how that's not ok and it's not his to tell but hes not listening. he thinks that my parents need to help me through my ""sin"" and that it's biblically required that i tell them. 

i cant even begin to imagine telling them, or how they'd react.

460,"I live in a conservative country. My family is pretty conservative (muslim). Dating is a huge NO here, Idk what my dad would do to me and my sister if he found out any of us is dating a guy when we’re not even ALLOWED to speak to one.

So my sister is 16 and I’m 18. She’s dating a guy who’s 17. I haven’t ever talked to him. We go to different schools and he’s from her school. She was keeping it a secret but I found out. They’ve been saying for several months now.

I’ve taken this as a blackmailing material. Yeah I know that’s shitty of me. But I’m tired of my shitty life and I hate everyone honestly. I want to get out of here but even tho I’m 18 they won’t let me go. I think I have a lot of anger issues and my mental health is not so good. I’m sad and frustrated. Whatever.

My sister has her own frustrations because she’s not let out either etc. While we’re USUALLY cordial with each other, I have taken out this blackmailing chip before and threatened to tell someone that she’s dating. She’s not an angel either, it’s ALWAYS been something through which she drove me really mad so I used the card. Her own fault really. 

Today she tried to put the blame of something on me, my aunt sounded pissed with me.

My sis drives me crazy but now I’ve gone and done a mistake out of anger. I don’t know how to fix it. My sis doesn’t know yet that I did tell tho I did say to her ‘I’m gonna show our aunt the pictures’ and most probably she didn’t believe me. I still want my sis to be careful with me and not go backbiting to our family cuz I’m trying to go abroad and for that I need a good reputation with all of my family. So you see that’s why I got triggered.

So what do I do now? How do I fix this mistake?",08Jun2019,1
462," My mom loves to take pictures, she was once a photographer so I see where she’s coming from with enjoying taking photos. Honestly, I’m self conscious though and besides some selfies here and there I don’t like anyone taking my picture. It’s not personal , I’m like this with my boyfriend as well. She keeps getting upset over it though. We’re on a cruise vacation right now, and she keeps trying to sneak them, even when I make physical attempts like ducking or hiding my face. I’ve tried turning the other direction, mentioning that I don’t really like my pictures being posted. I’ve considered taking a picture of her she doesn’t like and posting it, but I feel like it’d go overboard bf start a fight. I want us to have a good time, but it’s hard for me to have a good time when my pictures are being posted, and it’s hard for her to have a good time when she’s not taking pictures ( of me ).  I don’t mind one or two, I do want to remember the cruise trip, but I don’t even get to see them before she just throws them on Facebook. She’s done this for years: should I delete my account or am I overreacting? She gives me the silent treatment or a glare if I don’t do it and holds a long grudge, but I don’t want to sacrifice my enjoyment on vacation stressing over something so small but irritating. I hate having them taken but she gets very upset. I have photos of her on my phone she told me not to post and I haven’t, and I respect their space and I don’t take they picture. I want to talk about it with them, but I feel like they’d get more upset.
I’d be fine with even meeting in the middle, maybe being able to see it first, but I feel like trying to talk would open up some huge mess and this is supposed to be my fun graduation trip. I don’t want to ruin it over faking a smile for some stupid photo. Please help.",08Jun2019,2

468,"TL;DR: 
I’ll start by saying that this is a throw away account for obvious reasons.

My husband and I have been together since 2017 and I love this man more than life itself. Before we got together, he was open and honest with me about his past and admitted he used to do meth, cocaine, he had tried weed a few times but didn’t care for it, and he had tried various pills. He had assured me that he hadn’t done any drugs since around 2005, or 2006. I myself, had never tried any drugs recreationally or other wise and had always been even weary about even taking over the counter medicines. But his past was in his past at that time.

Fast forward to a little over a year into our relationship, we got into our first real argument. I had been having a hard time trusting him, and had felt like he didn’t respect me the same way that I did him anymore. He assures me that this is all in my head and that he thinks I’m suffering from insecurities due to a past relationship and that I might want to go see my doctor so that he may be able to prescribe me something to help with the anxiety.  (I had lost my mom a few months before meeting my husband as well , which we think could be a contributing factor as well) 

I see my doctor, who knows how I’ve always been about not wanting to take drugs and he’s visibly frazzled but agrees to let me try Zoloft. My husband is extremely supportive and continued to reassure me we were both in this together. Upon getting my prescription, my husband took a pill. He said he wanted to try it to see what it does because he wants to understand what I’m going through. To me, they made me feel “numb” inside. I wasn’t able to express my feelings and even when I was really happy, I wasn’t able to convey that emotion. Not to mention, they made me super sensitive, and my feelings became hurt very easily. My husband on the other hand, said they did nothing for him, yet he would still take one every day (because I was splitting mine in half, my husband would take a whole pill that I would have normally had the following day) ... I asked him why he kept taking them when he claimed they did nothing for him and he said he didn’t know, that perhaps he was hoping it would eventually with the next one, or the next...

One night we are laying on the couch watching a show on Netflix about adderall and my husband says that maybe THAT was what I needed, to help me stay focused so that my thoughts aren’t all over the place driving me crazy like they were.

I have a follow up appointment already scheduled with my doctor from 6weeks prior with the Zoloft trial and I express to him that I didn’t like how I felt on in and how it just made me numb inside. He looked really concerned (I’m normally a very peppy, silly person and I just wasn’t anymore) . I tell him that the biggest part of my problem and the reason I went to see him for even the Zoloft was the fact that I felt like I couldn’t trust my husband. I felt like he just behaved in a way that was very suspicious but never had any “proof” according to him. Anyway, I told him that my husband recommended trying adderall to help me regain focus and help control my irrational thoughts. 

The doctor was quick to pull me off of Zoloft and ultimately agreed to let me try adderall. My husband again, was taking half of my prescription and double it on the weekends, via crashing and snorting it. I asked how it made him feel, and again he said it didn’t really make him feel anything other than curb his appetite. I asked why he snorted it and he said he just prefers it that way. So I try it that way once and it burned the heck out of my nose. I was choking and coughing and felt disgusted with myself for even trying it. I stop taking adderall because I feel like my come downs were extreme and caused me to lash out and I didn’t want to be that person. He continued to take my pills. I expressed my concerns but he assured me he was fine and he would just use them on the weekends to relax.

One day he comes to me and he’s visibly upset. He confides in me that he had purchased cocaine from someone. He started the transaction 2 months prior, the guys had contacted him a week prior to him telling me to let him know he had gotten ahold of some for him. The day he brought it home he still didn’t tell me. He snorted some the day after he brought it home and a few hours after that was when he told me. Had he not told me, I would have had absolutely no idea. He tells me he wants to try it with me and I’m shocked and upset and don’t even know what to say. He’s crying because he feels like I’m judging him, and I was just going him. But it was breaking my heart because as I said before, I love this man with all of my heart. A couple of days pass and I agree to try a “bump” as he called it so that he can prove it’s not as bad as I think. Now don’t get me wrong, he did not force me to try it. But he definitely influenced it, still I’m a grown adult and I could have said no! 

It was awful! It taste like what I would imagine to be nail polish being poured down your throat. It burned really bad and it made me gag intermittently for almost 2 hours because it forms a loogy type feeling that just continues to feel like it’s dripping and sliding down your throat. It did absolutely nothing “high” wise for me... and he said it didn’t really do anything for him either. When I told him I didn’t want to take anymore, he promised that once that bag was empty he was done, no more. But I didn’t know he would go on a binge of 8 adderall and 4 lines of coke in a 24 hour period. 

I’m really upset at this point and tell him he has a problem. He denies it and says he’s gone years without anything and now that he’s done with the bag he’s not touching it again... but he’s still taking the pills. He also started taking other medicines I was prescribed from my c section (Tylenol 3), cyclobenzinate (spell check) because I had a swollen spleen and kidneys in my pregnancy and I could barely walk (but never finished taking the meds), Valium from when my mom passed away, a huge stress cyst had formed and my doctor thought it could help relax the muscle. But I only took 1 out of the bottle 2 years ago! He took all the rest. 

Fast forward to last night. I couldn’t sleep and something told me to ask him if he had taken anything else. And he said “you mean like your pills that I have been taking?” And I said “no, anything else” and he said a friend had given him some tramidol (spell check) ... I asked him why.. he said “just to try” . I look it up and it says it’s a narcotic, controlled substance used for pain. I asked if he was hurting. He said no. He just wanted to take it. 

I leave and bought a 12 panel drug test from Walmart. He tests positive for amphetimines and benzodiazepines, but I didn’t realize that 2 hours have to pass before the tramidol will show up as an opioid. 

He refuses to admit he has a problem and I can’t just sit here and let him potentially ruin his life. We just bought a home, we have a 1 year old, I work as an accountant and he has a great paying career, where he can be subject to random drug testing at any time as per their policy. 

What the heck can I do???? How can I help him if he can’t even admit there’s a problem???

470,"I 26(m) and doing very well on paper, but I absolutely hate my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am going in to my second year at a prestigious law school. I did not do as well as I had hoped first semester, but I certainly got good enough grades that I will be able to land a solid job. I have my own apartment, no financial troubles, and I will graduate without any debt. I am an attractive guy, I have a solid resume, and I am usually personable enough. By all appearances I am doing very well. 

&amp;#x200B;

Despite all these positive check marks, my personal life is almost completely empty. I don't have any close friends. I am desperately single. My family is not close. 

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout the various stages of my life, my friendships have been very peripheral.  While I was always ostensibly part of the ""cool crowd"" throughout high school and college, I was not nearly as social as those around me. I  spent a good amount of time alone. Sometimes because I wanted to, but sometimes because I didn't have anything to do. At every stage, people eventually lose interest in me, stop inviting me to things, and stop answering when I reach out. I have a few people whom I try to stay in touch with, but they have mostly lost interest. I have a circle of law school friends but once again find myself in the same situation. I hang out with them occasionally, and they tolerate me. If I got married tomorrow, the only person I would be comfortable asking to be a groomsman would be my brother. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have slept around a decent amount, but I have never had a real girlfriend. I have come close a few times, but for various reasons, none of my relationships have ever become particularly serious. I tried very hard with someone I was seeing this winter, and I ended up pushing her away. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, it feels like everyone around me has a coherent group of friends.  I feel like I missed out on formative social experiences. I feel like I missed the opportunity to have a happy and full life. I want someone else's life. I am lonely and miserable and I don't know how to make it better.",08Jun2019,1

475,"Okay, so when i was a child i had a truth problem. I would take candy from this candy bowl in our house before dinner and then lie about it.

Small things but my mom always taught me that a lie is a lie and that I need to stop before i start lying about serious things.

Okay, so fast forward to today.

I got caught vaping and smoking because my mom went through my snapchat.

Some of the pictures were mine but some of them were ones that I saved from my friends memories, because me being stupid, I thought it was cool.

Anyways she says that I am not getting my phone for a long time because of what I did, and i immediately knew she found out. We talked to my dad too about the whole thing and I apologized and I said that I have no excuse for what I did, and that i did smoke weed and vape a couple times with my friends. Then she started to ask questions about the people in the photos. At first, I wasn't about to snitch out my friends  but she found out it was them because in the videos I said their names. I then told the couple friends that I was doing it with and she didnt seemed to great that my ¨friends¨ were doing this too. Then she asked about the photos of pills, alcohol and other crap in my memories and I tried to explain that those were pictures that my friends took that I saved, but she said I was lying. Then she asked who i bought the weed from, their first and last name, and where do they live. I tried to tell her that I had never bought weed, only my friends did and even they didn't know. She didn't believe me but idk why because what drug dealer would tell their consumers his or her name and address. 

Anyways the next day she said that she is mad that I smoked and vaped but she is WAY MORE MAD that i lied. 

I didnt want to argue with her anymore so i agreed and she kept on bringing up scenarios of my childhood where i lied. 

She talked about how i screwed up my life and how imma be a liar since I didnt change my ways. 

She said how this was affecting my life badly, and I know i shouldn't have done it but lets be honest. I am a straight A student, besides my first quarter AP human Geography grade and my fourth quarter Algebra 2 grade. They were both high Bs and I am in advanced classes doing well in school. I rarely argue with my parents but when I do, it would be about something I did wrong and my stubborn ass trying to explain why it wasn't wrong. 

Is my life really ruined, I personal dont think so and I think my mom is going off the hook a little bit too much. But i can understand why she is upset, since i did smoke and vape and apparently ¨lied¨  
Did i really lie, because i told the truth and i didn't make short silly bull crap answers, even though she thinks I did. 

I need help on what I should do to be on her good side, and whether i did lie and if so, what can i do to change.

479,"I can’t function under pressure. It’s like something just happens with my brain and all of a sudden all logic goes out of my mind, I start sweating, shaking a bit, start dropping things and overall just look and feel stressed in general. It doesn’t have to be a lot of pressure either. It just seems like whenever I feel someone watching me I become hyper aware of everything and can’t focus, and i find it impossible to do things such as learn something new. 

For example, in my first job as a waitress, I was learning how to make coffee. It was my boss teaching me and I was so scared I’d make a mistake, I ended up making tons of them. If he wasn’t watching me I would actually be able to do an alright job. But if there were a few customers waiting I’d feel pressure, and fuck it again. I only worked there 8 hours a week because I was in my final year of highschool but I feel like I did not get any better the 6 months I worked there, by the end I was still as nervous as the start. 

I honestly think it’s because I know I’m getting paid so I should be doing a good job, so when I dont I get even more stressed. I thrive a lot in any other environment in school but it seems to be different when I’m working.

483,"So I am currently in a crossroads with mediating a conflict. So I have a friend name Kayla, who is a transgender woman who asked me for suggestions for a painter to make a portrait of her in a dress. I told her to talk to Sydney, my friend. Sydney is a devout Protestant Christian and therefore is kinda conservative when it comes to gender and sexuality. Kayla asked Sydney if she can paint a picture of her in a rainbow dress. Sydney knew that it is pride month and asked her why? Kayla then came out to Sydney as transgender and then said that this picture means a lot to her. Sydney then said...

&gt; ""Thank you Kayla for asking me to do this task. I am honored actually. However, I would have to decline because I do not approve of crossdressing for religious reasons. I think you should fine someone else.""

Kayla was then upset and argued to me that Sydney was using her religious faith as an excuse for being discriminatory. I, trying to be calm and neutral told her that Sydney is a Protestant Christian and in her worldview, she would percieve Kayla as a 'gender-confused' crossdressing man. Kayla then got furious at me for allegedly siding with Sydney. I then calmly told her that I am trying to be neutral and that she should take Sydney's advice and find someone else to paint the picture of her in a dress. 

Now I am stuck here. At one hand, I want to be supportive of a marginalized trans woman, but at the same time I don't want to dismiss Sydney's religious liberty. How should I approach this situation? Should I stay out of it or should I take a side? Who is in the wrong and who is right?",08Jun2019,0
485,"I’m currently at an unpaid internship that’s needed for my degree. I’m finishing up my 200 more hours there and so far so good except I’m really not getting any supervision. I’m basically winging it everyday which is not to say I’m completely incompetent (I’m a mental health therapist in training) and I am using my skills learned in school. The issue is my supervisor has a different title/schooling than I do and in what I’ve witnessed can be unethical at times and abrasive towards the clients as well as staff. The supervisor is either not there, busy or in a rush. He has a lot going on as far as his workload so I’m empathetic towards that but he barely knows me and I’ve been there a year. I’ve remained under the radar for the most part and get what I need to do done. He tells my school that he likes me but has never really sat with me or anything to get to know me. I guess because I do what I have to in terms of the work. Prior to this I had a social worker as a supervisor for my previous internship who was incredible and offered a great experience/supervision. Unfortunately the internship was closed down after only a couple months of me being there which led me here.
This past week in front of staff he spoke about the amount of clients going down in the month for various reasons (it’s summer, we had discharged a lot of people etc). Most of the paid staff was not present for this meeting. He then proceeded to tell me, an unpaid intern, out several times that month, that i had dropped drastically in amount of people i was seeing and had i been a paid employee he would have fired me. Taken aback by this, i Did not argue my point that I was out much of the month i had gone down. (i average about 20 services a month, i am there 2x a week for 5 hours a day.) everyone seemed taken aback that he had called me out considering I am an intern and do not get paid. Being an intern I didn’t see a reason for me to say anything in the moment but I’m really annoyed now at the lack of professionalism shown. I am debating whether to tell my school supervisor or just wait it out being it’s only 200 more hours.

Im on my phone 95% of the time, BUT I am listening to her and every time she asks questions I raise my hand (turn off my phone) answer the question and get back to my phone. Or if I have a doubt, I ask a question. Of course I don't do this everyday because being on my phone means I clearly miss out on topic points. but I definitly participate more than the average student in class.  Im pretty sure my teacher hates this smart ass attitude of mine that I can rack up participation points. Also, if you guys are wondering why I use my phone :I have extremely strict parents who don't let me use my phone and all at home and im anyways gonna be studying all day there so might as well use it in school. Stupid reason, yes, but eh .

&amp;#x200B;

Now switching perspectives, I am going to tell you how I feel from the other side of things. For starters, my participation in the class is consistently sub 60% when a kid of does not talk scores 80-90%. In their rubric for participation, it is ONLY graded on how many times you answer questions or ask them. There is no point system for ""being well-behaved, not using your phone etc."". I brought it up once with them, but they quickly shut it down saying I use my phone. I feel this is an extremely gray area topic because it is true I use my phone so in all actuality I don't stand too much ground for an argument here.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, I would like to move into the next topic, MCQ's and essays. I consider myself to be a decent student and I study quite a bit as mentioned above at home. On MCQ's I am consistantly scoring 95-100% and acing these quizzes and tests. Essays, well that's where I get absolutely ravaged scoring an average of 50% on each one. I was shocked the first time, but I am enrolled in an honors (IB , similar to AP) course so I thought I am just a bad writer not hitting the requirements. I spoke to my teacher and she mentioned I needed more analysis. So i really really worked on analysis. But my scores would not go up. I was too scared to ask my friends to see their paper because of the shame attached to telling them my score. And so I had convinced myself I am just a bad writer.

&amp;#x200B;

Then everything changed when we had this HUGE in-class presentation which is worth 2 essays but instead of an essay you are presenting it. So i did my presentation, but I am also in DECA and am extremely interested in business so my powewerpoint was very clean and extremely aesthetically appealling which I thought really hammered home my presentation. Watching all the other presentations in class, it hit me that this entire time these kids I thought were absolute writing gods were having these presentations which were extremely medicore (of course there were a couple I could be like wow'd by). And so I go up to present and after I finish, the entire class is pretty shocked. My happy-go lucky personality, combined with the fact that they know the teachers hate me, me using my phone constantly in class, and how I always tried hiding my scores led all of them to percieve me as someone just a meh student. And the teacher pipes in at the end of the presentation with the comment ""you really outperformed yourself here"". Which I really did not view as a compliment because I had been producing the same quality of work throughout this year. But I knew at least finally this could help spike me grade from that B-.

&amp;#x200B;

We get our grades back. Class average was a 92%. I got a 71. At this point, everyone had seen my presentation and I showed people my score to get their feedback. Even the kids that utterly hated me in that class were like wtf go talk to her. I did and her remark, ""you needed more analysis"". I get back to class absolutely pissed, and slowly I try comparing my previous essays with some of the really smart kids. And I am hitting similar topics, and my writing is on par with them but there is almost a 30% differencial in our grades

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't know what I can do here. I really feel I have played myself because if I try talking to the school admin regarding this incident, the teachers are really just going to pull out the trump card that I use my phone and don't pay attention. I feel over the past 3 days, my perception of myself has really changed- I thought I was a bad writer an extremely average student, but I realize I am really not that person. I have dug myself into this hole and I dont know what to do. I cannot confide with my parents because they already have the perception I am a go for nothing failure.

498,"So I’ve been friends with this person for about three years now, and I think it’s all over.

A lot of stuff let up to this, for starters she’s been touching and groping me inappropriately, even when I take her hands and move them away/tell her to stop.

She’s been asking me to wear tight clothes and other things like that.

Recently however, she’s been texting me a slew of disturbing and scary messages, like how she’ll kill herself if she can’t be with me, and how she loves me and how she fantasizes about kissing me all the time.

She has a history of self harm and depressive episodes, but this is something entirely different. I’ve contacted her mom and threatened to call the cops if she doesn’t get help.

Once I brought up the cops/her mom however, she flipped. She started sending me really brief and creepy messages like
‘Why are you scared of me?’
‘I’m fine, im fine, im fine, IM FINE’
‘I just want to be with you’

And things like that

What should I do in this situation? Am I making the wrong decision but pushing her away despite her poor mental condition and telling her to tel someone?",08Jun2019,1
500,"Hey Reddit, first post, made account for this. So I am a mid-teen and have an overprotective mom who believes a huge lie by my sibling that involves 3 countries police force but my dad is good. the thing is I tried everything other children of overprotective parents did yet it didn't do anything except cause arguements, like when I say I'm going with my friends and I'll text you every 30 min. she says: ""No you won't, they will come up to you with more than 1 person and abduct you"" And such, this is a lighter tone example and it generally boils down to it cannot under no circumstance whatsoever go somewhere with my friends similar to a curfew from when school ends till when school starts the next day, she brings me to school even if I'm 2 years away from finishing high school (not by car, but by bus) (Most of the information stated of me has been changed to evade my sibling since idk if they are on reddit) And overall whenever I go to school and my friends see me I feel really bad She yells at me for nearly everything I do that displeases her, I cannot have any social media (i have messenger for school group and made my reddit in secret) and makes fun of everything I like What do I do?

501,I’m Bi and he’s still figuring out his own sexuality but he told me he’s gay or pan.(still exploring) I’m already out to my close family that matters but he’s only out to his friends and me. He wants to go with me to Pride and I want to take him but I’d have to lie about where we are going to his parents. My Aunt C and Grandma R already know we’re both gay and are actually excited to take us to our first Pride. I just need some advice on what to say to my cousins parents so he can go. All I want for him is to feel comfortable in his own skin and know that he has support and we love him. Pride is a way to celebrate him and surround himself with others like us and know he’s perfectly fine the way he is even if it’s for a short while.,08Jun2019,1

One of these, I found at the time, was uploaded to her tumblr page. I asked her to take it down, but she said she didn't want to and I was stupid enough to allow it to stay up. 
After a while, we split up. Not amicably. I blocked her on all social media and all was forgotten.

But I just met a girl and we were hitting it off, before my ex contacted her and sent this video, claiming that it was recent. 
The original video is buried so far deep on the internet that I can't find it.

shes awesome, but we have a holiday booked in about a month together which im not sure ill be able to cope with, i will obviously power through but i really think i ought to break up with her. im just worried about the consequences if i do. 
first of all, my best friend will be really fuckin mad, cause she thinks that we are a good couple, and that i was never enough in the first place. and then probably try to get with my girlfriend (we're all lesbos lmao) because that is very VERY likely.  And secondly i cant just stop talking about her infront of my parents bc theyll get suspicious, as they dont know we are dating.
i dont know what to do and some advice would be great. as much as i struggle with speech irl id like to handle it in person, and give her the respect that she deserves, but im scared i might not be making the right choice, and end up involuntarily hurting myself in a similar situation with my ex.

510,"Long story short, a couple months ago I confided in a friend that she was in a really bad relationship and it was clear to me (and some of her friends) that she was being abused. He always puts her down and treats her terribly. Like it’s really bad. She seemed shocked that I said anything and she frankly got a little angry at me at the time for bringing it up. She said a lot “why would you think this??” so I backed off and let it go. After a few weeks, she reached out and admitted that she was being physically abused by her boyfriend. She was very upset, crying about not sure what to do. I offered to let her stay with me. She declined. We spent a lot of time talking about “why women stay” and the cycle of abuse. I head a lot of details and I have trouble even hearing his name now. She seemed to understand where I was coming from and I was hopeful she would leave. No one has said anything to her that I know of. I feel guilty for getting involved (not seeking validation that I did the right thing-I know I did and would do it again. ) Its textbook abuse and she is alienated from her entire family. When we all hang out, she is by his side and never says a word. It’s beyond sad. 

Fast forward to now. They are still together. She confronted him and he owned up to it, apologized, said it won’t happen again and they are “actively working on their relationship.” I can’t tell you how fucking mad I am about the whole thing. He promised to fix himself and I have zero faith he won’t hit her again. It’s been a couple months and every time I see her, I do not bring it up. I pretend like I never even said anything (she pretends too) and I don’t know if she told him I am the reason she approached him. But he scares me. He is physically much bigger than me and I am really uncomfortable around him every time we hang out. He is acting like the best boyfriend in the world but it feels like an act. He almost seems uncomfortable acting like a good boyfriend. To be honest, I am not actually even scared for me. I am beyond terrified for HER! And I want to hurt him, Dixie Chicks style. 

The problem is that in August a big group of our friends have planned a trip to Australia, including them. It’s a two week trip. I feel like many of the people on the trip don’t know or haven’t said if they do know about the abuse. The abuse is clear as day. There are like 10 of us going but I am so damn uncomfortable about the whole thing. I don’t want to cancel and be out nearly $4000 for just the flight and AirBnB. And they are going. So here we are. 

Need advice of how to survive the long vacation because I feel physically uncomfortable and angry.  I want to ask them not to go but they are coming. If we all have to go, how do I survive this and not flip out? I have already decided I will stay sober so I can keep clear-headed. What can I do to convince myself this is none of my business and maybe is is changing for the better? Can this ever be repaired? Would love to know if anyone has seen a person who physically abuses actually turn their life around.

I still see her every week but it's getting hard because she's always so inebriated I can't seem to have a good time. Every time I've brought it up she gets defensive and acts like a complete child.

513,"Hey guys so this is a throwaway acc obviously I have friends on my main that I don’t want knowing about this. I am 18m and I live with my mother 40f and I still get spanked regularly. I probably get a spanking about once/twice a week with the severity of the punishment depending on the rule broken, but most of the time it’s with either her hairbrush or belt and usually my pants and undergarments come down, sometimes even putting me over her knee. She keeps the hairbrush hanging in my room too which I think is kind of weird because I don’t see this in any of my friends rooms and they always ask me why I have it hanging up in my room as my hair is short. I’m living with my mother still because it is close to the college I’ll be attending next fall (about an hour drive) and it’s cheaper than paying for housing on my own. She says her house her rules and she has the right to spank me if I act up, but I’m a generally very good kid getting spanked for minor inflictions sometimes not even stopping until I cry. I get I’m living in her house but I am an adult now and I feel like getting it on my bare a** is not appropriate or necessary. Plus leaving the “spanking hairbrush” (as she calls it) hanging in my room like I’m a two year old I feel is very overkill and not normal. Is this normal?

I started my career in the DoD at 18 and I graduated at from uni at 20. My DoD job was great with the pay and benefits and I liked what I was working on which was spacr and satellite stuff, but most of my work was doing basic programming, lab testing, and helping with tech reports. I never truly felt I was doing meaningful work and I almost never had to apply what I learned in school. That came to a head last year when over a third of my group had left for the private sector. I was suddenly put in the uncomfortable spot of being one of the senior engineers in our group out of attrition and it took a toll. 

I joined in on the exodus and left for the private sector earlier this year in something I thought I would be more confident doing, RF Engineering. But now 3 months in on a high visibility production program I realize I lack alot of understanding of RF theory and my RF modeling skills are no where near good enough to keep up with the program. I'm going on 7 years in my career and I'm overwhelmed with feelings of disgrace whenever I go into work.

For some background info... I graduated college a year ago and moved back home. I didn't know what I wanted to do or where I wanted to go so I kind of just put off thinking about it...pretty much decision paralysis. At the time I was in a long distance relationship so in order to make some money for gas, etc. I got a job close to my parents house. This job isn't in my degree field or an end all by any means BUT it does give me the flexibility I need in order to still travel (every other week off) while also providing some income which I'm able to save since I am living at home.  

Fast forward 9 months later, I'm still working the same job and in a different long distance relationship (not ideal I know). I know I need to start my life and really begin my career but my issue is deciding where I want to be. 

I don't want to move to a new city (4ish hrs away) solely based on this new relationship. But, even before I met this person this city has been one that has come up a ton in my life and I have looked at jobs there previously. Plus it's a huge city with a ton to do there, and there is still so much I haven't explored despite having been there so many times. 

The city I am in now is great and I don't mind being here (with the exception of feeling like I'm missing out on people), plus my best friend and family both live here. I never planned on staying or putting down roots here but it is a place that I am comfortable in. 

I don't really know what to do at this point. I'm terrified of making a wrong decision and wasting time/money or not being happy in the place that I choose. But I also know I can't keep putting off actually starting my life.

524,"My very close friend who I've been close with for years is getting married off to a girl his parents have found. It's an arranged marriage and it's taking a toll on me in so many weird ways. Just not long ago we were being teens enjoying our life being weirdos in school, having night outs drinking and now it's already marriage? Where did all the amazing memories of being young go? Now that already has a part in our lives? It's too damn early and I feel shit for not doing anything about it and I can't. 

Him and his family is Pakistani but living a happy peaceful life in Denmark so you would figure out the deal. I can't deal with this coming in and affecting his life like that. Never once have I heard him be happy about it and he has never mentioned anything about who he is marrying really just a name and age. There are no signs that this will all go well for him and who has ever heard of a successful arranged marriage? This can't go well and he's not up for talking atm which is only worse. I feel hopeless of his wellbeing, I can't break this and their parents decision. 

He's already started taking drugs and going a bit crazy on the alcohol and I don't blame him for doing that right now. I'm honestly scared he's going to get depressed or be forced to do so much that he can't take. For God's sake he's not even stable in some situations of knowing him so well so how can he possibly handle this? His young days are being ripped away just like that. Who knows when I'll see him again, if his drug problem has gotten worse, I'm seeing him slowly drown in depression and I can't take it. He leaves a mark on you for the friend he is. 

Theres not anything anyone can do and me and my friends are all watching it happen right before our eyes with nothing to do other than show interest in this big moment for him and be supportive and there for him.

I understand from the title that this may sound like a trivial question, however, I need some advice with handling the situation.

Just a little backstory first. I live with my three roommates and we each have our own room. We moved into the house with just three of us, with the fourth moving in a few months after while he was situating some things with his previous apartment. 

Before we moved into the house, I told the other two roommates that I would not be washing any of their dishes because I wash all of my dishes immediately after I use them. I do this because I don't like having dirty dishes laying in the sink, so if I do it this way, there will never be dishes to wash and nobody has to worry about it. I asked my two roommates to do the same so we could keep the kitchen sink clean. 

&amp;#x200B;

We have all lived here for about six months now and it has been a constant battle of me trying to get them to wash dishes after they use them.

We all cook food for each other and that usually means using the stove top. Whenever I cook I always clean up the pots or pans I use, as well as my own plate and fork/spoon. However, this is not the case with my roommates. They leave their dirty dishes in the sink without rinsing them off first, usually leaving food in the sink. 

Both roommates have a different attitude towards this situation. One of them gets really upset about it and confronts me about it, saying that I lie about washing my own dishes and that we should all just take turns washing dishes instead of just washing them immediately. 

The other roommate usually doesn't say anything when this happens, and I think that's because he understands both sides of the situation. It doesn't bother me anymore that they don't like my method. I just wash my dishes and be done with it, I never cause any problems or confront them about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I was asked to wash all the dishes left on the counter and in the sink. I said that I will wash the dishes this time but as I've told them before, this is the last time I'm going to do this because I dislike washing dishes and that's why I take the five to ten minutes to wash everything immediately. 

The roommate that always gets upset got verbally angry with me this time, cursing at me and saying I don't wash pots or pans when I cook for them. I just stayed calm and said I'm sorry but that's not true, and that was the end of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not looking for advice on how to convince my roommate why my method of washing dishes is better and more efficient. I'm looking for advice on how to remove confrontation about the situation because I don't like being treated like that and would rather just avoid having that happen.",08Jun2019,1

I am depressed, which is a daily motivation and energy draining nuisance. But when I make mistakes and people criticise me (not constructive critricism...that's fine), I delve several layers deeper into my depression, because it never is just the criticism that comes out, but an additional statement. That statement may be an insult, a decleration of my general incompetence, a statement of how I am a waste of time or questioning why one would trust me.

I love them and we're not really fighting and they're not abusive or anything, but I really just need to get out for a little while.

But like I said, I live in the absolute middle of nowhere. There is nothing in town, just three drugstores, a real estate office, the town hall, and the funeral home. Beyond that, everything is highway and farmland. I don't have any friends who live nearby who I can go hang out with either. I just need to go, but there is nowhere to go.

535,"Okay, so around a couple years I go I met this guy online. He seemed nice enough but I immediately realized he was weak (he was a follower, had no real sense of self, etc). That wasn't a big deal at first, I befriended him regardless because he was depressed and suicidal and I felt bad for him. I was too caring. A couple of years ago through the friend group that we were all apart of fractured and everyone started hating each other but this one dude. The two people I had issues settled their issues (likely in an attempt to spite me) but I'm still friends with this one dude because I didn't want him teaming up with these other people. All these red flags would pop up when he was like ""is it ok if I'm still friends with so-and-so?"" like that's some weak behavior. But recently he's been publically showing friendship with one of the people who didn't like me. I don't wanna be around him anymore, he's a snake.

536," I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls who were there a few hours (only 2 of them are involved here) later in the night near closing it was quiet and the blonde girl skipped up stairs to the toilet kept looking back at me giggling looking back down the stairs at me , a while later I walked around the corner to where they were sitting and that blonde girl was looking at me and I didn’t look away for a few seconds and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say to her brunette friend 'that lad just been staring at me' in an excited whisper way. (They were the only people left in the pub before closing)

 another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‘excuse me....excuse me’ and then asked me ‘how do you get a job in here’ and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‘yea we don’t know her that well’ and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ then the brunette said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know...’ and then I juts nodded and she grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you’ quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away. (She was saying the weird girl liked me having a joke because these girls never knew I existed before this night and the weird girl wasn’t in third night) 


I then went back to finish cleaning the same table nearby and then the brunette girl said excuse me again twice and I looked then she asked politely but nervously pointing at me when asking  'can I ask you a serious question?' I looked then she went relaxed and said ‘have you got a girlfriend?' I ignored her, she then asked it again, then the blonde watching the whole thing said 'aww leave him alone....he’s dead cute’ and then ‘he probably has’ (probably has a gf) then smiled at me looking over (cute like puppy dog cute is that bad?) then the brunette asked it again ‘have you, have yet got a gf?’ ’ I still continued to ignore them but looked annoyed because they kept putting me off what I was doing (idk why maybe I was nervous) and the blonde girl said aww leave him alone now hes fuming while laughing a bit.

542,"I'll don't know what to do or what what to say...

Guy #1: A guy that I've been seeing for around 3 months just told me he wants to get married. We've done nothing together (no kissing, sex, anything) and he's told me he's looking for a house to buy in my area for me to move in with him. He lives an hour away right now. Nicest guy I've probably ever met but I really dont feel anything romantically for him. Hes 26 and I'm 20.

Guy #2: My best guy friend who I was going to ask about how to handle the guy #1 situation about just asked me if I'd want to get engaged. He knows I don't want to get married (we're best friends and we have talked about everything) but wants to get engaged at the very least to show loyalty. (Again, I've never done anything with him). 

A little background on guy #2: when we first met, about a year and a half ago, I 'fell in love' almost instantly but when he told me he wasn't looking for a relationship I put my feelings aside and figured being his friend would be just as worth it. I have trouble opening up to people and feeling comfortable around them, with him I didn't have any issues. Fast forward to today- I'm not looking for a relationship of any kind (personal reasons) but because of how I used to feel for him I feel guilty if I say no. 

He's a great guy. The original reason I pushed my feelings aside is because I never thought he'd be interested in someone like me. Seriously, this guy is going to cover Forbes someday, I'll be lucky to be covering shifts at McDonald's. 


I guess I just don't know how to handle this whole situation considering I've never had a relationship of any kind before.

543,"Dear reddit,

I frequently attend parties. I'm a single and social guy in his mid 20's. I usually talk with a lot of people at the party but not really a dancer tho.

I've encountered a lot of situations where wife's (usually 30+) of men chat me up and ask me to dance with them. I usually decline dances but I'm usually always available for chatting or a good conversation. I often get complimented about looks and just accept the compliment with a grateful thank you.

But now the reason for this topic:
I've encountered some situations where I can obviously tell that the men don't like when I talk to their woman. While I have no intention of doing something with them as I do respect their relationships and strike up conversations in a friendly and playful manner.

E.g. I was outside vaping and getting some fresh air. There comes a woman (+/- 40) downstairs and lights up a cigarette. She looks at me and ask me some questions about vaping so I was very willing to share my experience with her if that helps her for any future decisions about it. Moved a little closer and start talking. So eventually we have a conversation about her children, what kind of work we do, personalities and just general life chatter. We both enjoy the conversation.

So what happens next is her husband comes walking downstairs (before that we saw each other, greeted each other openly like real bro's, we cracked some jokes, drank a beer together) and sees me talking with his wife. He has a slushy in his hands and looks me in the eye and hands it over to me saying: have it, this is good for you. And tries to draw all the attention to him. I sensed that he didn't like that I talked to his woman.

I'm not scared or anything but I don't want men to have this feeling that they can not leave me talking with their wife. I considered talking about it with the men but didn't as I didn't want to make a big deal of it. This is one of the situations I experienced but there has been many others.

I do have some instinctive guidelines tho:
1. I never tell a woman she looks good, I tell the man (when the woman is not around).
2. I do not initiate dancing and/or conversations. And usually decline offers to dance with them.
3. I don't allow her to tilt from friendly to anything more.
4. I always try to get the man in to the conversation. Either physically or in a positive way verbally (in a smooth way obviously)

There must be some other things I do too but can't come up with them right now. 

So how do I normally further interact with significant others of men at the party without them feeling offended in anyway? Any useful tips? 

I just want to be myself as much as possible and not be holded back because someone a guy is a little territorial and feels treathened (because I can't control that). But I also want to evade any conflict.

It’s frustrating being called a liar after you’ve found the nerve to finally say the truth. I am a liar and I wish I would have stayed that way. Because then, I wouldn’t be walking around the house with my eyes dry from crying and my head hurting from stress. And no one would be calling me a liar when all I did was tell the truth. The thing I lied about, I didn’t have a choice. I was raised in a Muslim family, fairly strict. It was implied that I was the same way, but I wasn’t, so when I said I wasn’t I was a liar, a manipulator, and a disappointment whose mother had wasted love, time, and money on. 

Anyway, I told my mom I’m no longer identifying with the Muslim faith. On the level that I believe in God, the creator, and how he controls everything, yes, I am Muslim. However, on the level where I can’t be with a boy that I love being with until I marry him, that I can’t wear shorts when it's hot out, and that I can’t consume bacon or alcohol, I am not Muslim. If I had the viewpoint of a Jew or a Christian I would interpret a man being allowed to marry 4 wives as wrong, but since I was raised with the viewpoint of a Muslim, I’ve been apologetic to that fact.

551,"So, I'm sitting these two dogs. The one that fell in the pool a couple times is a brown lab.

The dogs like to run around and across them for long periods of time which the dog's owners are aware of. Thing is, when the lab came in he was bleeding a bit from a cut he got when he was running around the rocks. And when he walks he seems stiff. But he doesn't show any signs of pain other than the awkward walking. I told the owners about the cut but am worried about the stiffness when he's walking. And I'm not even sure if that's just the way he walks either because I can't remember - although he is quite chubby so maybe it's just that plus the cut from earlier?

567,"Hello all,

I have a question about asset management and power of attorney in the middle of a traumatic brain injury event.  I apologize if this is the wrong place to post this, I am really looking for any sort of support/help on the matter.

I’ll be as brief as possible.  

My girlfriend (25) is an only child and her parents are divorced.  This past Wednesday her dad fell and busted himself up bad, they have him in a medically induced coma to prevent the brain from swelling even more and they cut out a piece of his skull to allow for room for it to expand and contract.  One of the craziest parts of this is that it seems so surreal, like how is this strong man that I’ve looked up to over this past year, laying on this ICU bed barely clinging to life.  Anyways, enough sob.

The problem for things outside the hospital comes where he was a business owner, and a rather moderately sized business at that.  He ran/runs things old school, still pays people in power checks, pays vendors/suppliers that way.  Day to day operations are able to continue because he has a good staff, but as soon as this next week, we will need to get a plan of action figured out.  

Enter - drama.  When I say own, he actually splits shares with his brothers, it was his parents company that started in the 70s.  Well my gfs dad is the only one who really worked the company when their parents were alive, so naturally when they passed they made him, the operator of their portion of the shares, not the owner, the operator, and it’s not exactly but just imagine that it was split into fifths everyone had a fifth, and so when they died he now operates as majority owner or partner, however you’d say that.  Well as you can imagine, this created some bad blood.  Fast forward to current year, they have sued him as recently as January of this year to take the controlling portion of shares, and they lost (he has a damn good attorney).  

My gf spoke with that attorney on Friday and basically was told we need to get a power of attorney of sorts together to basically put her name now where his name is, it won’t be her getting all the shares, it will literally be like changing of the guards and the same will apply to her when she’s in this scenario one day.  We are trying to act fast because we don’t want her uncles to have access to running the business , which they can file for after 60 days of him being basically indispose, essentially neglecting the business even though it’s for medical reasons. 

My question is about signing that notary required document, power of attorney, doesn’t he have to be conscious?  And he is only in a medically induced coma, and they bring him out of it twice a day, but the extent of what he could do at this time would be following a “squeeze my hand if you agree” sort of agreement and have someone sign for him.  The lawyer seems to think this isn’t going to be an issue, I don’t know if he doesn’t understand how bad it is, knows loopholes we don’t, or is just going to pull some shady attorney shit.  Id appreciate any advice on what to do in this realm, what you guys would recommend.  

Also, on the personal side of his assets, he has a will, which the attorney has, but because her dad isn’t dead, he can’t read it to her, but she knows from being told over the years that she will be getting everything.  Including but not limited to in the ball park of $500k-$1m if I had to guess including stocks and other assets.  And when she spoke to the attorney for the first time  on Friday, he was kind of telling her under the table that she has power of attorney over his estate, and she has currently medical say so, I don’t know if it’s a medical POA or just because she was his emergency contact.  

My question about the personal side is how do we go about getting access to either his account or dipping into those funds that are allocated in the will?  We are mid 20’s and not wealthy by any stretch.  There are things of his that are going to have to be paid for, monthly bills, and not to mention whatever rehab facility or personal home therapist we will want to get for him.  We can barely even afford the gas back and forth across the city, (granted it’s like an hour one way across Houston).  But there’s also some immediate things we want to do to his house to protect his things.  I won’t waste more time, but in short he has a gold digging girlfriend 15 years his junior, and we are kicking her out of the house; we want to change the locks and put up cameras.  Again he has money for all this, but accessing it is another thing also, he’s not exactly in a spot to hand us his credit card...not even because of his TBI, (well yes also that) but the ambulance cut off his clothes and threw them away, most likely because they were focused on saving his life, but they threw his wallet away with allllll of his business and personal cards as well as probably at least $2k in cash.  So yeah, any advice on that little side piece would be nice too, all we got was a sorry from the security office.  It’s hard to argue though, I mean they were saving his life.

568,"I am a 23F and I moved away from home for the summer to for an internship. I have never had a roommate before (that wasn’t a sibling) and am asking for advice on common courtesies!

The place I living in is exactly like a dorm set up- we have a common area to meet in and our bedroom is one big room with separate twin beds, a kitchenette and a bathroom. So far my roommate is so so sweet but one thing I can tell might be a future issue is that she likes to stay up late and I like to go to bed early. I’m so thankful that she’s recognizes I have to be up early (8am-5pm, Mon-Fri) and uses reading lights.  She (19F)  is a student (with midday classes) so i understand that her creative/study  juices may flow better later in the night, thats how I used to be when I was younger. But now that it’s a weekend, what’s an appropriate time to start making noise?

Also, she is from Indonesia and I am from the United States so there is somewhat of a cultural difference as well. 
Any advice helps, even if it’s not about the sleeping schedules!!",08Jun2019,1

Sure, there is a myriad of possible reasons. I see it as a way of them saying “I saw what you said but don’t feel like responding” or it could just be because it’ll show you that it was read anyway and they don’t want to see rude so might as well just like it. Either way, even if we don’t know each other very well/at all yet follow each other out of some form of interest, am I wrong in assuming that they’ll want to talk?

Anytime there is ‘free-time’ though, including holding our 6 month old, or when our 2 yr old is watching toons - he’s there - headset on :/  It’s not even a particular game - he switches games.  He helps out with the dishes and picking up when I ask him to but it is rarely self-initiated.  He’s very physically attractive, but I’m having a hard time finding him attractive after he’s spent 8 hours on a Saturday staring at a screen taking small breaks to change a diaper or make a bottle.  He acts like everything else is such hard work or inconvenient.  Here are things I’ve tried:

Asking for more help - he does it, then goes back to gaming.

Talking to him about it (not the finding him attractive part; i have no idea how to say that nicely) - he says he understands, but this is just how he unwinds.

Ignoring him - he doesn’t notice until bedtime.

572,"So my roommate (R) and I are pretty close friends, and we have a third friend (M) we're close to as well. M is really really nice and truly a good person, but there's on thing she does that really pisses R and I off. She always flakes on us, and a lot of the time it's on plans that she initiated. Yesterday M and R were going to meet on campus at the library(we're all students) at five. R got there and then M texted her saying she'd be an hour and a half late because she had to call her landlord. I felt bad for R and went to meet her so she wouldn't be alone the whole time. 6:30 hit and still nothing. We texted M and asked if everything was ok, and she just told us about what's going on with her landlord and stuff. However she didn't mention if she was still coming or not. She never showed up, and we didn't leave until 2 in the morning. She never acknowledged it or anything. She normally doesn't acknowledge when she doesn't show up, or the fact she basically flaked out on us. She just drops hints to try to get us to realize she's not coming by saying she's tired or whatever. That's how the conversation ended yesterday, with her saying she was really exhausted. I know she's busy and stuff because of  her major but she should say if she's not going to come. R was really annoyed because she was saving a seat for M and M just tossed her to the curb. She messaged M about it but M hasn't seen the message get. M just does this a lot, and she will often say ""wanna do this today?"" and if you agree it's likely she'll just not respond to your messages when it's time to go or tell you she's tired without actually apologizing and saying she can't go. I've had enough. M: ""Wanna go to starbucks?"" Me:  ""Sure"" Then she doesn't show up or respond to my messages until hours later and says sorry I'm just really tired. How do we tell her that it really sucks when she does this? It's really disrespectful to others' time.",08Jun2019,2

590,"Hi all, I'm going to make this as quick as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I've drifted with a group of friends who were really toxic. I didn't feel like I was becoming a better person by hanging out with them and they made me feel horrible about all my flaws. Treated me like everything I did was a sin. If they weren't angry with me, they were always angry with their other friends (even ones they had known since middle school) or even trash talking about them to me, they're the arguably 'popular' group in school and have so many frenemies, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

All my life, I was never the one 'out there' or incredibly social, which is one major difference from all of them. But the more 'social' and 'popular' I tried to seem and eventually became, I felt like I wasn't myself anymore. People had pointed out I'd become as fake as them (like Cady in mean girls lmfao). I realized this as I could feel myself become emotionally drained and selfish;  it was super unhealthy, so I distanced myself a month ago and I feel like a better person.

&amp;#x200B;

However, there's a big school-organised party/outdoor trip at the end of the year and we'd all signed up to go together when we were slightly closer (a week, with a charity ball at the end). I'm cordial and even friendly to most of them, but not close and I hang out with other people now, but do occasionally have lunch with them as they're in all my classes. They just seem to have drama all the time with every single person in existence, and I'm so scared that one small misstep will cause all of them at once to gang up against me (it's happened before). They're really unpredictable and get mad at things happening long ago, or at how other people talk. Eg. this one girl had mentioned offhand she didn't click with one of my 'friends' music taste and this said friend was seething about it for weeks, another guy had beat another 'friend' to be awarded valedictorian, and he never talked to him again. **Pulling out isn't an option**. I don't know how I'm going to stay sane...

592,"Okay so basically I got reddit to ask for advice cause im at a loss of how else to get help...

PLEASE bare with me it's a long one)!!

Scenario:
Male coworker had been making me feel uncomfortable as all hell at work. Not something I would necessarily say is sexual harassment, but the unwanted touching (non sexual), following me around, intrusive questions, staring and pestering way too much. I didn't want to be a snitch or worried I was over reacting, so I held of reporting. 
After weeks of trying to help him get the message, and hoping it would eventually stop.. I reached out to a female co-worker, who to my relief  (but also dismay), he was also doing the same with her, but she also was apprehensive about saying anything to management. So we had a system of trying to pull each other away from this guy every time he would come over to us alone. 
Although this was only for 2/3 shifts as she was leaving that week. But before she left she mentioned to management how she felt, and that she was worried about me around this guy. So management thankfully took it seriously, pulled me in asked me questions, and basically said: we will ask him to quietly leave you alone, we have told him not to address the incident with any other staff members just to back off and that's it. 

However...today I went in and he has told everyone, saying I falsley accused him if sexual assualt (a complete exaduration of the event) and basically trying to spin some kind of narrative. Like he could try and clear his name before I went in and said anything. Which was stupid as only me the lass that had left and this one manager knew, and it was made clear to him it would stay that way.

Now everyone on the work floor hates me and I genuinly don't want to be there because of it, they have been avoiding me and gossiping with him all day and it's too much.

Question:

What do I do what's my next step?

Do I just quit and call it a defeat, or is there some way of rectifying this extremely uncomfortable sutuation???",08Jun2019,1

So the thing is, every time I ask my friends over, my mom will hangout with us. I know it doesn't seem like THAT big of a deal but I'm 20 years old and I'd like to have some time with just my friends and I. I dont have *that* many friends but whenever I go over someone's house, nobody's parents ever hangs out with us as much as my mom does when we spend time here. 

I always ask her beforehand if I can have people over and usually my hints at getting some alone time with them end up in her having a full on argument with me after my friends leave or sometimes even in front of my friends, usually about me being ""embarrassed"" by her or ""hating"" her. And this really isn't the case, I'd just like to hang out with my friends since I feel more at ease around them and I know they won't judge me. I know it's not a very good habit but I act pretty different around my friends compared to how I act around my mom. 

Anyways, what I'm trying to ask is: is this normal? For a mom to full on hang out with a bunch of 20-somethings?

Rory’s health problems weren’t fully known till our appointment on Friday. She had fractured a leg on her second day at our house, at nine weeks old, while hiding under a couch.

598,"As with all such relationship related matters, the problem started with my last relationship which lasted about 3 years. It ended with breaking up with this girl, only to find out she was already been 'attracted' to this other guy. They were together within 10 days or so of me ending things. In fact, my ex even says that me doing that was one of the best things that ever happened to her. They're still together, and going strong (or so she says).   


Anyway, this December it will have been three years since that happened. For the longest time, I was so disgusted and hurt by what had happened that I stayed away from relationships all together. It wasn't always pleasant - my relationship with my ex was borderline abusive and I experienced a lot of nightmares, panic attacks and the like during this time. However, I do thing that taking some time off helped me overall. If I tried to be with someone, I probably would have made their life miserable anyway. It was bad enough doing that to myself haha.   


Fast forward to about last year. I met this girl at work, who I clicked with immediately. I didn't 'like' like her initially but I really enjoyed talking to her. Our interests matched, although we clearly were (are?) very different people. Long story short, I've fallen for her hard. She's probably got every quality I want in someone I'd want to be in a relationship with. We both enjoy spending time with each other. Just one problem - she doesn't like me. She's in love with this older guy who lives in another state (seriously, what is with girls and older guys? My ex is also dating someone quite older than me) and it's clear that she likes him a LOT.   


I know this may not sound like a big deal compared to the kind of stuff people go through, but it's a very 'real' thing for me. It took an eternity for me to get over my awful relationship, and the first person I really fell for has no interest in me romantically. I know there are some wonderful people out there - but I simply cannot seem to make it work with anyone. Either I don't like them or (more frequently) they don't like me. I've met most people through my hobbies so it's not like my only aim in life is to get in a relationship or something pathetic like that. I will also add that I did try dating apps too - although I did get matches (I'm okay looking and I try and keep fit), it was nearly impossible to make a 'proper' connection with someone - I am not interested in purely physical stuff or whatever (of course, I'm flattering myself by saying someone will even want that with me lol).  


Also, and I'm a little scared to say this but I really think there is something fundamentally wrong with me. Not because one girl doesn't like me but rather... I can't seem to get a mutual thing going with anyone. Plus, all this seems so fucking hard, and I hate the fact that affects me so much. I would love to be single and to focus on myself - doing awesome things, not a giving a damn whether someone liked me or not. But I can't seem to be that way. I want to be in a relationship! I want to care for someone, and want them to care about me.

I tried shaming her by telling her friends and posting about it on facebook, but then everybody acted like I was the bad guy!

Now she tries to pretend like she's coming down for other reasons- like to talk to my mom or borrow something- but the very first thing she does is go straight for the toilet.

She thinks she's being sneaky but she's not.

604,"Quick background;
My father was abusive growing up and a few years ago my mother, brother, and I had to escape from that. 


My mom has always had a lot of issues, as have we all due to our experiences, but she has always been aggressive to me due to me looking like my father. She is very emotionally manipulative and abusive and at times physically abusive.
She will threaten to sell our home (I still live with her) and leave me homeless, threaten my personal belongings, and has (as of recent) begun threatening suicide.
 In the past she has hit me and torn out parts of my hair, but within the last few years mainly she just throws things at me. I never really saw it as abuse compared to the hell hole I grew up in.
I can't currently work due to health issues, so I'm unable to try and get a home of my own, I'm wondering if I should leave and try to move in with some other family members. 
Especially typing it out it seems obvious, but I have never lived without my mom and it has recently been discovered she has a tumor in her brain (I know she's not lying about it because I was in the hospital room with her when we got the news). 
I can't contact my therapist currently as she's currently out of the country. I don't know what to do.
I know I should leave but I'm scared of something happening to her if I do. 

What should I do?",08Jun2019,2
605,"Posted on here earlier &amp; every single one of yall said I was being manipulated and keep the block. 

For context, this girl manipulated me a whole lot and I left the relationship in shambles. I then went no contact and they broke back into my life against my will by showing up at work. 

This was after 3 months of calling against the blocked number, and then leaving a note in my truck. 

That all happened about 10 days ago. 

What I didnt mention is that blocking them feels like I'm deleting them out of my life for good, which I should feel good about. That said, I hate the sensation. 

It sincerely feels like I'm just killing someone off. Honestly, I'd argue it makes me think about them more and adds extra weight to them. 

Like, they're so off limits that it makes me think about what they're doing and how they're doing. 

I sincerely hate it so much and it's not even about them, it's about the sentiment. 

I dont see this person as a threat, and now that I have a better sense of what manipulation actually is and how it's done I'm at least protected from it. 

Do I have feelings for them? Yeah. Sure. but will I go back to them? No. 

I dont want to. 

What I do want is to just not have it feel like there is a distant haunting memory of who they are hanging over my head. 

I care for this person, and it seems completely inhumane to keep them blocked. 

Maybe I'm hyper empathetic, but jesus christ this is the most gut wrenching thing. 

I feel like it's my only way out of not thinking about them 24/7. 

Tldr: block makes me feel like I killed someone

607,"2019 hasn’t been easy on me, I’ve lost a lot of people I thought were friends, I keep having my heart broken, and I feel like there is no one for me to talk to or trust. I was going through my contacts and I didn’t feel comfortable talking to any of them about how I feel, I just don’t think they would care. I can’t get over this overwhelming feeling that I have nothing and no one, nobody even texts me or talks to me. And the one person that does talk to me is a girl I like, even she takes sometimes hours to respond, and I know she’s on her phone :(. I’m just not sure what I can do to get rid of this awful feeling, I’ve never been depressed but I feel like I could be close if I’m not already suffering from it... it just sucks to feel alone and not just physically but emotionally .

614,"I'll quickly start off by saying I don't need any legal advice; my question is more about how to approach the situation ethically (what is reasonable and unreasonable to do in this situation).

&amp;#x200B;

My roommate recently lent me her car. She's done this before, usually if we need groceries. I needed to buy something from the store one evening, so she offered her car. While I was at the store, she had taken an Uber to a small get-together at a friend's place. She called me and told me to--instead of driving the car back home and street parking like I usually do--drop her car off in a parking garage across the street from her friend's place. I said okay, found her friend's apartment, and looked for street parking first. I couldn't find a spot, so I went into the parking garage. While pulling into a spot in the garage, I bumped the front of her car on a short concrete wall. After parking, I saw that the metal grille frame was dented a bit in one area, a small piece of the bumper next to the frame was dented in, and the paint was scuffed  (an area about the size of a hand) on the bumper. I went in to her friend's apartment to let her know where her car was, then pulled her aside to let her know what had happened re: the damage to her car.

&amp;#x200B;

We got a quote for repairing the damage, which came back to be about $1,500. We got another online quote, which was $1,800. My roommate doesn't want to get another quote and doesn't want to go through her insurance because she says her insurance rate is already high from her past accidents (she says she pays just over $300/month) and she doesn't want her rates to increase. We called her insurance to find out the deductible (which turned out to be $1000), but she has not asked by how much her rates will increase. I tried asking her if she could call to check, but she just said she knows her rate will go up, so she's not using insurance for this. She recently asked if I wanted to pay her the whole thing now (impossible, that's almost half my savings), or if I want to pay her in installments.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my questions: Should I request that she get all the info from her insurance company first before moving forward? Should I demand that she get another quote? Should I request that we wait until the repairs have been made and we have a bill before I pay her anything?

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the length of the post; I just wanted to get all the info down. I've never been in this situation before, so I'm not sure how these kinds of things are usually sorted out. I appreciate any advice anyone might have!! Thank you!",08Jun2019,4
615,"I no longer want her to ever stay here again and I do not know how to tell my boyfriend. I want to talk to him about it tonight rather than drop something like this on him during the work week.

My boyfriend's mother recently came to visit us. She lives in another state and had planned this trip sort of impromptu and let us know 2 weeks before arrival because she found cheap tickets and misses us. That's fine, we accommodated.  

All was going fine until the second day into her stay. I found her personality unlikeable and highly selfish. I've met her before, I know her well but I had never been around her this long. She wasn't like this ever before. We last saw her about a year ago, and we had talked before. I never expected this from her.

The weird part was how she acted while she was here. She kept saying thinks like, ""son your house is lovely"", and he would say, ""well it's not my house, my girlfriend bought it and you know that"". Or, ""thank you, son, for such a lovely (insert whatever)"", and my boyfriend would say, ""well my girlfriend helped a lot and it's actually her idea/thing she owns/thing she planned"", and she completely brushed that off. My boyfriend acknowledged that he wasn't the only one that made her stay possible. 

There were a couple days where he had to work and I took days off to hang out with her and planned things to do with her and paid for everything. She said nothing to me as a thanks, rather, just said to my boyfriend when he was home that she really wishes he was there and that we had a good time, but it wasn't the same without him. When describing our day, she didn't mention me. It was all, ""so today I went to the museum, took the ferry to the island and I found the best restaurant. I had the best sandwich. I then went and had a drink at a lovely bar."" Basically all spoken to him without me in the picture

What really got to me was when she kept referring to my dog as her son's dog. She kept saying, ""son, your dog is so adorable and your dog is trained so well."" I'd step in and say something like, ""when I adopted her she was quite a nightmare because she was a stray and it's taken me years to get her to this point."" She'd immediately go back to saying something like, ""she's great. Son, the dog is so precious.""

I went out of my way to treat her the way I would treat my own parents in ensuring they're comfortable. My boyfriend's mom has mobility issues and I would even go as far as make sure she had a bottle of water by the bed every night, park my car directly on my front lawn 3' from the door so she didn't have to walk to the driveway, and everything else I could to ease her stay. No thank yous to me and they became expectations.

She not once asked me a question about myself when I thought about this. I've started talked about myself and suddenly it goes back to something about her and how it's more than I've achieved somehow. If my boyfriend and I are talking, she will say, ""stop. Son, what did you say I didn't quite hear what you said.""

Part of me thinks that she feels I'm taking her son from her or something and she doesn't like it. Her other children had left her and refuse to talk to her anymore. Reasons had never been disclosed to me, and I never pushed for reasons. My boyfriend is her youngest son from her most recent marriage and I'm thinking he was her everything and she never wanted him to grow up. I feel like she's taking out some feelings on me. 

TLDR: boyfriend's mom stayed with us for a week. We both did a lot to make sure she had fun while staying here and she didn't acknowledge anything I did or anything about me even when I went completely out of my way. I don't want her staying here in my house ever again and I don't know how to tell my boyfriend.",08Jun2019,1
616,"Saw this girl a couple times. I Like her she seems cool. She's been avoiding my snaps all day. Which is probably not as big a deal as my head is making it but holy shit. Iv kept this freak out contained but on the inside im completely set off. It's ridiculous how something so small can have me so fucked up. I don't even know for sure she's avoiding me. Shes probably the most reliable girl iv ever had a thing with. And yet iv gone full clinger on the inside. Feel insecure as hell like I fucked it up. Maybe I did but even then I shouldn't be freaking out like this. I need to get my shit under better control. For further info- she hit me up first this morning I responded she responded I responded, all with delayed response times bc I like to believe we are both sane and not clingy and then I got left on read bc it was the natural point for the conversation to end, a couple hours later I sent a message asking if she wanted to hang out later which she still hasn't opened. I'm kinda aware that I'm being insane. How do I stop that?",08Jun2019,1
617,"Yo, so I have this friend that I never really liked. She just kinda showed up and stuck around with all my friends and we let her stay. We mostly just dealt with her cuz she didn’t have any friends. This girl is very easily insulted, and bursts into tears whenever she doesn’t get her way. She’s extremely childish, and I’d honestly rather not deal with her.

For context: I’m not a very traditionally nice person. I care about my friends, I talk to them, I make sure they’re okay. I listen to their issues. We’re all cool with each other, but I have a tendency to playfully insult them. Not all of them, not anyone who can’t handle being insulted, and as I mentioned before, she can’t handle that. So I DONT insult her. Two of the people I insult like to pretend to get mad about it, but I’ve had separate conversations to make sure they’re okay with everything. One of these guys, is her older brother. So this girl messages me to get mad about how I talk to her brother and our other friend. I told her I made sure they don’t care, and she said “that’s a terrible excuse”. So we went back and forth for a bit and I ended up saying “we don’t talk ever, I don’t know you that well, your opinion on how I act does not affect me.” And she called me horrible and all this dramatic stuff. She also complained that I said I wanted our group of friends to “talk more about how we’re feeling and be less self destructive, and that never happened.” But it DID happen, just not with her involved. We all talk privately, and we don’t want to tell random people like her about our suicidal tendencies, especially in the group setting with all of my friends together, which is the only time I see her. Which I explained. She also complained that the offhand comments I make about me starving to death (I’m anorexic) are concerning, and she doesn’t like when I tell her not to bring them up in public situations. Which just brings us right back to my point about not wanting to talk about this in a public setting. So I got a bit pissed and said a few assholeish things about how I don’t really consider her a friend, and I don’t want to be friends with someone who can’t just have a normal, chill conversation about stuff without getting crazy dramatic.

This is all kinda stressing me out, and I don’t really like her. Is this worth it? What the fuck am I supposed to do now?",08Jun2019,0
618," I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls who were there a few hours (only 2 of them are involved here) later in the night near closing it was quiet and the blonde girl skipped up stairs to the toilet kept looking back at me giggling looking back down the stairs at me , a while later I walked around the corner to where they were sitting and that blonde girl was looking at me and I didn’t look away for a few seconds and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say to her brunette friend 'that lad just been staring at me' in an excited whisper way.

 another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‘excuse me....excuse me’ and then asked me ‘how do you get a job in here’ and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‘yea we don’t know her that well’ and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ then the brunette said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know...’ and then I juts nodded and she grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you’ quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away.

My boyfriend and I have lived together for four years now. Our first year living together we were in a reasonable apartment but we had an absolutely terrible neighbor that made our lives hell.

It’s a studio loft with beautiful high ceilings and wood beams, but we are two people in one room and it has a lousy kitchen and only one closet. We just signed a lease to a new home with three beds and two baths, with a nice kitchen only a few minutes a way- three years after coming into our current place. It’s a bittersweet feeling as there is a lot that we love about where we are, but we felt it was a necessary move in several ways too. I’ve been so nervous we’re making a mistake, but it’s the unknown that has me fearful as well as the loss of the things we do enjoy here.

625,"Hello all,

I've a long distance friend who confided in me recently about her emotions and feelings when she got a bit drunk. She told me that she was molested at a very young age by her own uncle and her mother told her she might not be understanding what she confided in her. She said she had to live in fear in her uncle's house in her senior high school. She didn't say anything anymore after her mother didn't help her in fear of doing damage to the family relations(they are a very conservative family I think). 

She also says she dated a guy in her undergrad and later he broke up with her in her grad school giving her a reason that he was not sure about their relationship. She then dated two more guys both of them cheating on her with the last guy being her project partner. She says she can't bear to see him seeing another girl while working with him on the project. Which leads me to the last part - her uncertainty in her future. She's a physical sciences major and this project is all she can see her future going to. She says she's not sure how to proceed after that stating many of her classmates are moving on to different things and she can't discuss her plans with them about it.

I feel that she's feeling very lonely, not understood, losing confidence in herself from the relationships she's had and uncertain about her future plan.

626,"Well, it's as the title says. I want to leave the house as soon as I can. (Currently 14)

&amp;#x200B;

My situation is... complicated to say the least. I've never had a proper education, only brief homeschooling up to forth grade. Everything I currently know is self taught. That includes my punctuation, English, math, spelling, Etc. The only things I was taught was basic reading, spelling, addition, subtraction, and very basic punctuation. Such as the exclamation mark and question mark, nothing else. Which explains why this post has as bad punctuation as it does.

&amp;#x200B;

I've never really bothered with teaching myself, at least not much anyways. Just whatever I needed at the moment. But now I need to learn as much as I can in 4 years to hopefully build myself a slightly stable future. I want to try and get a GED, and learn as much as I possibly can on C# coding and whatever coding language that would help. I want to learn fundamental skills that would help me thrive in the real world, things like social building skills, how to rent an apartment, knowing the best places to live, financial skills, Etc. Things like that.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it possible to start building up money now? I know that you must be 18 to have a PayPal, or have a guardian/teacher involved. But I want to have money when I leave, because I don't think its possible to do anything without at least a little bit of money. So what are my best options to build up money online? Anything IRL won't work, mainly because I live in a rural area, and I can't necessarily leave the house. At least not without permission or by myself. (Safety in numbers as my dad says.) And I could try asking my dad about setting me up a PayPal, but I'm doubtful he'll say yes. But it is possible.

&amp;#x200B;

What age is the best? My dad said he left his home by 17, and my older sister says she's leaving by 17 as well. But is that really the best time to leave?

&amp;#x200B;

And if you're wondering about how my situation came to be... Its a long story I guess. My dad simply doesn't believe in schools in short. Why be taught what they want to teach you?  Why be sheep and be like everyone else? Why be a loser like everyone else? Why not build your own path? Choose what you want to learn. These are his reasons for the most part. My dad has always said that school has never helped him. That from his years growing up he never payed attention to class, never listened to his teachers, never studied before a exam, Etc. He said that he winged his classes, and passed them. Because he was always learning, always reading, he spent most of his time checking out books from the library. My dad is currently 62, and is a veteran. We live off his monthly paycheck from when he got injured during his time as a soldier.

&amp;#x200B;

He wants us to study and get a GED and get into college that way. We have to prepare ourselves for college with little to no social skills. So I want to get out of here as soon as I can. Don't suggest CPS or anything like that, I've considered it and I've decided that it isn't an option for me. I love my dad and I couldn't do that to him. He's a good person, he just wants us to be independent.

&amp;#x200B;

So what are my best courses of actions right now? I have no clue what I'm currently going to do. Whether I'll keep my stuff like my PC and phone. Or if I'll have to leave with nothing.",08Jun2019,1
627,"My friend as 1 year friendship broke up with me. They were my closest friend. Everyone else started distancing themselves from me, except for them. They let me talk about my problems and helped me stay alive I guess. Told me when to eat, when to drink water. Told me to go to sleep. They started to say little things that would more so control who I talked to. They ended up making me reliant on them.

But they told me the nicest things. That I was pretty, I was amazing, I was perfect, I was a great person. Nobody ever said those things before and I told them everything about myself. We made jokes about getting old together, what it would be like. 

But the last day of school, yesterday, 9:24 pm they hit me with it. 
They didn’t think we should be friends.

They went on saying about how I was too good for them. That I deserved better then them. That they were replaceable. That I could do better. They said they were toxic. I explained I didn’t think they were, and I still want to be their friend. They said they want to be my friend but they want to stop hurting me. I explained they aren’t hurting me, they are helping me. They said I had plenty of friends, but I didn’t know how to tell them that 3 other friends ended things that day. I was left with nothing at 11:18 pm, they were going to block my number at 11:15 but had one more thing.

The first text conversation we had I sent a “:)” to end it. They responded with a “(:” that’s how we ended our first conversation.
It’s also how we ended our last as of now. 

I need them, I forgive them. This is the worst emotional pain I’ve been through. I got 3 of my 9.5 hours recommended. My severe depression got worse. I don’t even feel the motivation to live. They left me with nothing. I have a million questions. But I can’t do anything. I miss them. I want them back. I can’t bring myself to replace them.

I know they care too much about me, so if they see what they made me into and if they see that I can’t talk to anyone I know they will let me back in their life. But that will take months for summer to be over. 

I gave them $5 the day they left me earlier for a dvd. But I accidentally gave them $4. I promised them a worm on a string the week of them doing this. But now I can’t give it to them. I feel really guilty for this, and I could just send a package with the items and a note explaining that I forgot to give it to them.

They say that it’s best for me. But it’s not. 

I’m going to a mental hospital and want to hear their voice when I’m in there during calling hours. I just need them even more during that time.

I just don’t know what to do. Any advice?",08Jun2019,1

636,"Background: it’s about the second or third week of summer and I’m in a foreign country on a school trip. I want to be with girl 1, but I don’t want to mess up anything. 

Background on the two girls:

Girl #1 : I’ve known about her for a while now, but only have really gotten to know her for about 2 months. I developed a crush for her about 3-4 weeks within actually getting to know her (I got to know her through an extra curricular). I learned that she also had a crush for me about 5weeks in. We’ve been super busy due to tests, but have squeezed in a super informal “date” in there. She hasn’t had too many bfs I think. However, about 2 weeks ago I left the country. I’ve been in pretty good contact with her throughout the trip even though she didn’t go on it. She is cute, nice, and funny. 

Girl #2: before the trip I barely knew her. We had been to a few hangs before, but other than that I didn’t really know her. I didn’t have any classes with her or anything. She is decently popular I think and has had quite a few bfs, but not in a “slut” type fashion. She also currently has a bf. 

The trip: everyone pretty much had their cliques going into the trip, but as it went on every clique started merging quite a bit. About three days ago, girl 2 literally attached herself to me. She kept asking me to hold her hand, give her hugs, and she kinda became my shadow at times. She also always talks about breaking up with her bf, but that she still loves him (he’s not on the trip btw). This “shadowing” hasn’t gone unnoticed either. I’ve had almost all my friends give me some looks when she comes up to me or says my name. I’ve also had my friends talk to me about all this and I just say I’m kinda shell shocked not gonna lie. 

The predicament: I want to be with girl 1 but I want to be friends with girl 2. I don’t think there’s gonna be an issue with this because girl 2 is prob going through some sort of seperation anxiety or something like that with her bf. But I want to know what I can do ensure this/if I’m missing out on something. I can give more details if needed. Thanks!",08Jun2019,1
637,"So I have three best friends we will call them Joe, Mercy, and Grace. When we all met I really liked Mercy and Joe liked Grace. Joe and I would often confide in each other about our feelings for the others. We never did anything because Grace had a boyfriend and Mercy was not into girls, as far as I knew. We brushed off how we felt and got to know each other well and quickly became best friends. Then Joe and Mercy started getting closer and eventually started dating. I for one was a little disappointed but I was happy to see her happy. We were all fine for several months. We even planned on getting an apartment all together. Then some unfortunate events came up. The date we were going to/ needed to move out was pushed back for some and lunged forward for others. Me and Joe being the two where it was lunged forward. We got to talking and spending more time together and decided we were going to get an apartment with the two of us. And in the future the other two could join us we would all move out. One night in one of these talks Joe tells me he has been thinking about breaking up with Mercy. I hate thinking about her upset but I could tell they were drifting apart. They end up breaking up while Grace went on a month long trip. The friend group of not the same obviously. Mercy has been confiding in me about everything and we have been getting a lot closer (she has told me she has thought about girls before but I don’t know if she is just thinking about this because of the break up or if she actually feels this way). While at the same time Joe has been emotionally intimate with me in a way no one has with me or with him. I am growing to like the both of them in a more than just friends kind of way. No one knows Joe and I are planning on getting the apartment together. I’m scared to lose Mercy if I tell her. I just want them to be happy, with me or each other it doesn’t matter. I think they might both want to use me as a sort of rebound. I’m just not sure what to do.",08Jun2019,2

639,"Hello Reddit! 

I’m in need of some advice. I have a 1992 Cherokee that is my pride and joy. I truly love this car. I have a mechanic shop about a mile away from my home in Chicago that I’ve been using for about a year.  They are a chain, which i tend to stay away from, but I needed service quick one day and it turns out the manager actually went to high school with my cousin so we hit it off and I trusted him with my vehicles. I distribute snacks and crackers so I constantly bring by snacks (I’m talking at least $1000 to date in snacks) for the guys and their families and the manager gives me a small discount on repairs.  They have done thousands in repairs for me, I let them take their time for every job, I bring in my own parts, and all I ask for is communication. It was great at first and then they started to get sloppy. 

1. Gaskets weren’t installed properly so all the oil leak fixes didn’t actually work. They claim it’s just how the gasket is made. Well gaskets are made to stop leaks, literally. They aren’t made to just slow them down. 

2. They stopped calling me when the jobs were done and just expected me to stop by. I brought in my van for an oil change and they never called to say it was ready, I had to call them before they closed to see if it was ready. 

3. I have a step van (like UPS) for my business and we asked them to fix something on it. My husband and I took a day off of work to drop off the truck and have it fixed. They never called so we went over around closing time and they didn’t do a single thing and never even called to say they were too busy (even though the day before, they promised us they’d have a tech with the truck the whole day). This really ticked me off because that truck is how we run our business and they know that so they knew we couldn’t work. They could have called in the early afternoon to say “hey were slammed and we can’t work on the truck. You can come pick it up” and we could have gotten some work done. 

4. One time I had the Jeep towed there because it wouldn’t start. They had it for two weeks without a call. I was worried so I went in there and basically they said “we don’t know what’s wrong”. Why wouldn’t anyone call me to tell me that?! 

5. I had them replace my brake booster and master cylinder and it took them 5 weeks. FIVE WEEKS when it could have been done in a day! I allowed a week for diagnostic but wow. 

6. I recently brought in the Jeep to have a few things fixed such as new leaf springs, an AC inspection, and the turn signals not working. It took them a week to even tell me what was wrong and they didn’t even look at the AC or the turn signals. He said, and I quote, “I’m not sure I want to tear apart your steering column to find the issue”. Well it’s a 92 Cherokee, it would take one tool and 5 minutes to take the steering wheel off. After he told me about the leaf springs I said I’ll order the parts and drop them off. I dropped off the Jeep on 5/28 and I ordered the parts on 5/5. Parts come in on 5/7 and I drop them off. They said they’d get to work. On 5/8 (today) I’m driving home and I see my Jeep parked across the street in a Walgreens parking lot. So my husband and I pull in. Leaf springs are not installed and all the doors are unlocked. 

I. Am. Livid. I live in Chicago so I really don’t appreciate my pride and joy being parked off the property of the mechanic shop in a Walgreens parking lot with all the doors unlocked on Cicero Avenue (one of the busiest streets in the city). The mechanics are closed for the day and will be tomorrow so it’s not like someone was there to park it in a bay for the weekend. They were going to leave it there all weekend with the doors unlocked on someone else’s property, which could have easily been towed. 

What should I do at this point? I’m about to walk over there with my spare key and basically take it back. I want to teach them a lesson to treat my property with respect. I’ve cut them SO much slack with jobs and I could have easily lit them up about how badly they’ve been dropping the ball lately. 

My husband says to take the car back and park it at home and wait for their call so I can unleash my wrath. 

What would you do? I don’t want anyone to lose their job over this and I don’t really want to call corporate since I thought I was cool with the manager and calling corporate might end up having someone fired. I’d prefer to keep it “in house”",08Jun2019,2
640,"I'm just going to put down the events of 2019, because there's too much to cover in one short post. To start, my long term and short term memory have been heavily depleted by a medication that I've taken for a couple years now (Topomax). It's also given me aphasia, and that has been incredibly difficult to deal with thorough my senior year in high school.  Actually, I didn't even graduate due to the melting pot of issues that have kept being thrown my way. I mean, fuck, I just want to go to college... Back to the story though, and again, I'm sorry that this is difficult for me to write.

&amp;#x200B;

After dealing with my depression through the winter months, I was already in a pretty rough spot as is. As for specifics on that time, I can't recall. Even though it was going poorly, I had my finals scheduled, and just one more week to go with school work. However, a few days ago while I was weening off the Topomax, I might have had a seizure? I only remember driving, blacking out, then waking up in a parking lot. I can elaborate further on that if needed. There's some neurological tests set up for all of that, but that's not exactly what is bothering me now. Don't even get me started on the fact that I had to solve my family problems because they weren't helping themselves. Christ, I was happy, and it got fucking sucked away.

&amp;#x200B;

It just feels like every time I get close to my goals, something gets thrown in the way to stop them. I just don't understand why- I'm trying so fucking hard. I mean come on, I'm one week away from my graduating finals then I have a fucking **seizure**?! I've never even had one before!!!! I even convinced my *mother's* best friend to come help us clean and organize the entire house! Not to mention, it's just a mess now again anyways. What the hell is going on? Why can't I seem to improve my life no matter what I do??? Am I just being manipulated too easily? Where is MY chance to succeed in life? Why can't I seem to get out of this cycle?",08Jun2019,1
641,"TL;DR: My aunt, her workmates, and I are in a European holiday trip right now. They were going to exotic places and restos with a hefty price tag for a part timer like me. I let them do what they want because I just normally pay for the airfare and the rest, my aunt shoulders the expenses for the holidays. But then, my aunt told me to pay up. I only have a few savings and I am gonna drown in debt. I have 5 days left with them and I do not want to be saddled with debt. How can I convince my aunt to lower the holiday expenses of our group? Without offending them or making them feel awkward?

&amp;#x200B;

So as of right now, my aunt, her workmates, and I are in a holiday tour in Europe. They earn more money than me because I am just a part timer. For the holiday, I agreed to pay for my airfare because that is the usual thing I do when I go on a holiday with my aunt in the previous months, and the rest, my aunt paid for the other expenses. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, since I finished my part time stint, my aunt invited me to go to a European trip and of course, I agreed, because I do not want her to be alone travelling and my dad advised me to always humor my aunt.  

&amp;#x200B;

At first, the holiday was fine and interesting. We were eating at fancy restaurants which I normally do not eat and cannot afford. We were going to museums. I let them do their thing. I was a yes man.  But then, my aunt told me that I have to pay up. I understand that of course, I have to pay, but I felt shocked because I did not ask for fancy meals and museum passes and my expenses with them is too expensive for my few savings (I have to pay for a flight and rent in Europe when I go back). 

&amp;#x200B;

And a few days ago, my phone (a gift from my parents) was stolen, and now, I have to buy a phone and freeze my bank account because of mobile banking. I was so distraught after the incident so my aunt told me to go to the museums to distract myself and explore the country since she knows I am not coming back that country. I told her multiple times that I do not want to go inside the museums and attractions since I want to fix my bank account and other account problems. But they told me to carpe diem and enjoy the country so I just agreed.

&amp;#x200B;

While my aunt and I are browsing on the internet the prices of phones, my aunt asked me when will I pay her. I am now panicking since I only have 5 days with them and I do not want to spend more since my parents told me that I am on my own. Adding up all my savings and it looks like I cannot afford to go back to Europe for my job. And I already forgot the notion of buying a phone here in Europe. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, how can I tell to them to lower their shared expenses without offending them or making them feel awkward?",08Jun2019,1
642,"I'm a 20y/o male who didn't really have a lot of friends at high school. The only people I hang out with is a guy I met when I used to play club soccer and his friend from school who were both pretty popular at school (been close friends with them for about 4 years now), they're pretty smart guys as well. The main issue is they don't really take anything seriously, I don't know if they just don't care about the consequences of their actions or they are just too stupid to see it.   I'm not very talkative in social situations at all and could say I have a low confidence level, I also worry about things a lot.  I'm not very good at getting my point across in arguments or discussions whenever I need to, and because of that, I feel like my friends just don't take me seriously at all. Back in their schooling days, there was a guy in their social group of about 20 guys, who would always convincingly say he was going to kill himself or seriously hurt himself and everyone, in the beginning, took him seriously and was there for him but because he never did anything to himself they eventually just saw it as funny and basically turned that guy into a meme. Whenever I get nervous or act all anxious about something in my life or with something that we're doing they just see it as me being an idiot basically.

&amp;#x200B;

I was a pretty sheltered kid growing as I wasn't allowed to go out or do anything until I turned 18  which is part of the reason why I didn't have many friends growing up, with a mum who would pamper me a lot but also put a lot of stress on my shoulders and would make me scared shitless of her. I have a 15 y/o younger brother and my mum would always make me responsible for him, basically saying whatever you do, your brother is watching you and will copy you so don't fuck up. I would always treat my parents with the utmost respect because I was scared about getting in trouble even when I did nothing wrong. My parents weren't evil, I was just a naturally anxious kid who would worry about things. 

&amp;#x200B;

My friends don't hold a lot of responsibility at all. One is the youngest in the family and the other is the second oldest out of 4. The one that's the youngest in the family is careless with a lot of things and doesn't care about his possessions at all, the other friend that's the second oldest of 4 doesn't hold that older brother responsibility that I carry at all and doesn't care about what his other brothers do. They got me into smoking weed and we smoke basically every night now. I was open about my marijuana use to my brother but never tried to glorify it, as I would never smoke around him or even talk about it (I didn't want to desensitize him). But my friends would always see it as me being stupid and would smoke in front of him even though I don't want them to, they just say,  ""well he knows we smoke it who cares if he sees us do it"" and would say that they smoked when they were 15 and they turned out fine so what's the big deal. I personally think that is just ridiculous. 

&amp;#x200B;

The other day we were all at my friends house with the 4 brothers and found out that my brother and his brother who is the same age were going to smoke some weed and I wasn't happy about it but I didn't want to act a fool and make a huge deal about it, because my brother was going to do it regardless. So I thought ok ill let him smoke as there wasn't much. Eventually, we all ended up smoking together, I didn't want to but was convinced that I was just worrying about nothing. He ended up smoking a lot more than he was originally going to. To sum up the night he was acting crazy and talking gibberish, so when I tried to calm him down he would say he was in some random place, for example, he said he felt like he was at a safari partying and then a few minutes later he was talking about him being at Disneyland when he's never been. I got really worried because he was losing grip of reality. My auntie is schizophrenic and it scared the shit out of me that he had the symptoms to get the mental illness. I was always originally worried about myself getting it but just watching my brother and hearing what was coming out of his mouth scared the living shit out of me. I just couldn't stop thinking because he was loving it so much that he's going to want to do it all the time and consequently damaging his developing brain and I feel entirely responsible. They eventually went to bed and I got really angry at my friends and after some arguing, they saw where I was coming from but basically just said I was worrying about nothing. I personally feel disgusted that I let that happen and I can't stop thinking about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I really like my friends but I love my brother and I feel like I've desensitised him, and if anything bad comes out of this I don't know how I'm going to live with myself. Am I worrying about nothing or should I find new friends?",08Jun2019,1

650,"Long story:
My girlfriends cat is a Bengal. She’s had him for about 2 years now. He’s very full on, very energetic, loves to play, loves his space and is just a bundle of energy.
My girlfriend decides to get a kitten. She’s 8 weeks old and is extremely sweet.
The first night was fine, we introduced them to each other slowly (only once). The kitten hissed and was very defensive, so he backed off, left the room and then we all had a good night sleep. All parties were fine.

Next day, they’ve been introduced again, this time the kitten is in a cage so it can’t be touched by the other cat. The kitten still hissed at him and was very defensive, he just wants to play.

Later on at night, my girlfriends sister wanted to see what would happen when they were introduced. This time was different. The minute the cat noticed the kitten, he went for her. Had her pinned down, claws out teeth out hissing, scratching her. Girlfriend pulled him off by his back legs (it was the only thing she could grab). The cat bit my girlfriend multiple times, scratched her extremely deep, blood everywhere and then spent the rest of the time hissing at her with an arched back and claws out.

I’m not sure what to do. I personally feel like we need to re-home the kitten. Girlfriends mum wants the bloody cat to be put down.

653,"So, I am a single mother and my five year old son and I decided to try camping. We get through our first night, no problem. The next morning it is 6:30 and we can't get the fire going. I say forget this, we are going to Walmart (20 minutes away) and getting some Duraflame logs, we'll get this fire thing eventually, but we have one more night and I don't want to spend it all babying a fire. At Walmart I stupidly lock my car keys in the trunk with our bags.  I call Toyota roadside assistance and they send this guy out.  He is driving an older model mini-truck with the company logo on the sides. He is nice enough and my son, who has started to feel tired, says ""Mom, hurry, I want to go back to the camp site and lie down!""  So the guy is like, ""oh, your camping, Pinchot Park is great, I used to go there when I was a kid!""  He unlocks my car and we head back to camp. A couple of hours later we head to the other side of the lake to get ice cream, but by the time we get there my son is feverish and wants to go home. We head back to our campsite and who do we see on the campsite road headed opposite of us? Mini truck guy.  My stomach sinks a little, but maybe he was just reminded of this place, right?  We go and I start packing up our stuff.  All I have left is the tent and tarp plus a few odds and ends.  Our site is the last one on a one way loop, so even though you can see it from the two way road, you have to go all the way around the loop to get to it.  I hear a loudish motor and it's the guy in the mini-truck again, he is headed around the loop.  We stay behind the tent while he comes by and slows to a near stop in front of our site. He goes on, turns toward the exit and stops for like 2 minutes and then continues.  At this point, even if my son was not sick at all, I would have left.  I got a very creepy feeling.

654,"I need to give some background first. When I was born we lived in a neighborhood with a family that was friends with ours. When I was 8 we moved away  after about a year of not seeing the other family. Today my brother revealed to me why.

My dad cheated on my mom with the other families mom. My brother always had speculations, but confirmed this not long ago when he started talking to the girl, his age, from the other family.

My dad got really pissed at him for hanging out with her at a party after I tols my dad she was there, completely oblivious to the situation. 

My brother also beleives he still cheats on my mom with another woman. 

My dad has a safe in his office at our house, and my brother and i know the combination.

In said safe are a few letters amongst other things.

The letters were from a woman he worked with. 

My brother hasn't been able to read them since they are unopened and my dad would notice. 

That last one os just a speculation, but my brother has talked to both my mom and my dad about the confirmed one.

I’m not sure what it is, but it were I feel like I’m being followed, or being watched. I’ve been sexually harassed for years because I didnt go out with someone back in middle school.

The paranoia kicked in about a year after it all started. This December is when it really turned to hell. And I mean literal hell. I wouldn’t even wish it apon anyone. Some how a rumor spread because a friend of mine was talking to someone, and ended up telling a random class mate about the situation. Word spreads fast and falls into the ears of the one who’s been sexually harassing me.

Everyone who was in middle school with me knows that he stared at me. I couldn’t tell you the number of people that said “he’s looking at you.” Or “I’m warning you, somethings not right with him.” He has completely freaked out my friends, and one of his friends apologized to me for his behavior, and another after hearing my side, just burned bridges with him and refuse to even associate with him. He even tried to make me jealous by asking out every one of my friends, and didn’t even talk to them before hand. I knew all of this, and then he finds out, I know. His idea of “fixing” his problems is by getting rid, of the problem. His problem... Me. He tried to push me to be too scared to go to school. He said he was gonna kidnap me and rape me. When that didn’t work, he then tried to push me to suiside by telling everyone I was a slut, and a whore. Not to trust me because I’ll only use you. And when all else failed, he tried to tell EVERYONE, even administrators at my school I was anorexic and trying to starve myself to death. This was to send me to a mental hospital, because it’s his word against mine. It would be a “better safe then sorry.”

The reason why he wants to get rid of me is because I put others before me. I look for the people he hurts so I can pick them back up and throw them out of the mess they are being dragged into. This kid is literally the definition of the devil and pulling innocent people into hell that he believes deserves it.

Here’s what I’m paranoid about. There is this other guy, his best friend. My mind is telling me, that he is taking note of everything I do, and is going to do something over the summer. I barely lasted a night, and if he does something over the summer, I don’t think I’ll be able to take it. I lost sleep for 5 weeks. I’d stay up will 3am just sitting and crying, and then eventually fall asleep around 2-3am. I remember every night I’d feed my cat before passing out because my head told me he was living in my vents and was gonna poison my cat, so I would only feed her at 2 am so he couldnt because I guess that was the “safe” hour. My cats now used to that schedule, and now needs food early in the morning.

Another thing is I feel watched and followed, and think he’s always there. I’ll see people with unknown features looking at me or next to me, but after seeing them for a split second, they disappear. It’s just been getting worse and worse and I have no clue on what to do anymore. Therapy has just never worked, and I’m losing hope on ever feeling safe again. I feel like giving up, but that only gets him what he wants. I feel useless, and as if it’s my fault it’s been happening. I even started considering to apologize to him.",08Jun2019,1
657,"I know this might sound like a typical thing severely depressed people might say, but I’m gonna say it: I don’t think I’m good at anything. Throughout my life, I’ve never really found any subject that I genuinely wanted to be passionate about and pursue. I do enjoy science, art, and literature, but I don’t believe I’ve ever excelled exceptionally in them. I get good grades (As &amp; Bs) in school even though I half-ass stuff occasionally, and never study. I’m quite sure I have autism to some degree, and possibly dyslexia. I’ve been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, ADHD, and, possibly soon, schizoid PD (and Asperger’s, which seems to be very likely to my parents and therapist). I feel incredibly dumb because I daydream a lot, and I have a lot of trouble processing what people say. I get made fun of for this kind of stuff, or people will think I’m completely stupid or just don’t care what they say. My family members think I don’t care about what they say and get angry at me, but I hear only fragments of what people say to me sometimes, which makes everything very awkward and difficult (even though they know I struggle with paying attention). People in my school do, however, call me the “smart kid” in my class; I believe it’s because they’ve never had a conversation with me and realized how terrible I am at talking and listening.",08Jun2019,2

We laugh and have fun together all of the time and have so much in common. She is the light of my life. Today was my daughter's confirmation. She is 14. We had a party planned with 20 guests, new outfits and shoes for her and a new suit for her older brother, a cake, flowers, etc. My daughter is very negatively influenced by her dad. I shower her with love, adoration, support, affection, guidance and care. I spoil her with parties and outings with her friends, shopping, dinners out, lunches, etc. Her father obstructs my parenting time continually and alienates me with negative talk and insults about me. He has done horrible damage to me and my kids. Two weeks ago my daughter said she and her friends were going to sleep at her dads house during my parenting time. For the first time ever I said I actually said no and said I will be coming to get her. I went to her friends house and knocked on the door and no one came out so I went home. She was so angry that I objected to this and asserted myself as her mom that she blocked my phone for 11 days. I had to ask my son to talk to her. She says now her friends hate me, they don't want to go anywhere with me again and they aren't coming to the party. Last night she said that no one loves me and ever will love me, that I am a horrible mother and I am horrible to her and her brother and her dad and everyone, I am selfish, a liar and on and on. She came banging on my door at 6 am to get her dress, shoes and flowers for her confirmation today and said to cancel the party I had planned for her. I have a huge cake in the fridge that cost me almost $100. I am am extremely devoted mom and my kids are the center of my life. I do everything I can for them. I support them financially with no help from anyone. I go above and beyond all of the time to meet their needs and wants. I am crushed by this behavior. I feel so taken advantage of and humiliated and embarrassed. I had to cancel the party and tell all the guests not to come. She was mocking me right in front of her dad. She is implying that her friends and their parents think I am ""crazy"" and not a nice person. I am at a very low point.

I'm just afraid she'll have a reaction of ""Who fucking cares? Why did she even send this to me?"" She's super nice though. I highly doubt she'd actually say that, but there's always the possibility she could be thinking it or not even bother responding.

I'm just trying to be more open and friendly and not second guess myself so much anymore. Do you think I should do it? Am I thinking about this too much?

665,"TL;DR 

tl;dr, In short. I want someone to read these emails where I think im being rational, yet ive also on the phone admitted some parts wouldve come across the wrong way.

&amp;#x200B;

She sent one response I can see, but thats not it. I spoke to her earlier today, stuck to my email and gave her a chance to come over in a calm manner and speak rationally. She read out to me an email she sent me in return which I cant find and didnt read, and it was very abusive, twisting it all back on herself. Im not sure if its just me?

&amp;#x200B;

My final email just now:

\--- 

Ive just seen your instagram. This is the last time ill check this email or anything to do with you. You never take my feelings into consideration. Your allowed to hang out with Liam and Nathan, guys youve told me you think love you, and im supposed to have trust and keep trying, yet you check my messages, and victimize yourself constantly, and I keep asking to have a rational discussion where we can both talk about our feelings.

Thank god I checked your instagram and proved that it was all a lie. You never loved me. Your apology 2 weeks ago meant nothing, you will deny it now. Just make sure you dont come back. Please. Leave me alone for good please. You cant be a normal person, take care of yourself, or work on a healthy relationship, as hard as I keep trying, I dont get it in return. After 8 months I got 1 dinner. 1 massage. 1 attempt at apologisign for your faults, yet you took it back the next minute.

As ive said before I stick to my original email. Mine was sent in a calm rational frame of mind, re-read multiple times. So was my attempt at apologising for the cowardly way it was done and for giving you an opportunity to be normal and work on this, yet once again your out having a fun time with gosh knows who, probably another guy for all I know.

Im done trying. Im never reading this or checking on you again, you dont care, and I do. Thats the only difference here. Soon you will calm down and realise im trying for us and to be rational but it will be too late.

Please dont reply and please let me get on with my life, you have messed with me too much now.

Ill make this short. I wont send a long email or explain my reasons because as we both know you wont read it. In honesty it all comes down to one thing, you are super untrusting of everyone, you have been of me so many times in the last 8 months and we have broken up nearly 8 or 9 times. I am super honest. I am empathetic and I care when I upset you. Unfortunately this toxic mix of your untrustingness and my over honesty has caused me to nearly die too many times, my family cant put up with it anymore.  
Im not saying its all your fault, its both of our faults. Maybe if I was less honest and did what you think im always doing and didnt care, then I wouldnt be in this position, and maybe if you were more trusting and didnt end things every two minutes we wouldnt be in this situation either.  
I know everything is fine at the moment, but If I dont end this now, I loose my best friend. Hes been there for me where youve been frolicking around in brighton like I didnt even exist. Hes sat there while ive tried to kill myself to prove I love you. Hes consoled me so many times hes bored of it. My mums bored. My dads bored. Im bored of it, and now that we are finally seeming to make progress and your finally trusting me like you shouldve 7 months ago, ive been given this choice, thanks to yesterday. It kills me to do it and its going to hurt me much more than you, by tomorrow im sure youll have moved on, itll take me much longer because I actually cared.  
Ill leave the original message below, all though Im certain none of this has been read anyway.  
\-------  
Im struggling here.  
Im so sorry to do this as well. Maybe im just not ready for a relationship.  
In the last 8 or 9 months since I met you, as you know, Ive lost my job, developed a cocaine addiction, went to rehab and every time we argue I love you so much and cant bear to be without you so much that I try to kill myself.  
I completely forget that I have a mum, a dad, friends, a dog, everything, and I try and kill myself again and again because we argue. Its selfish and childish and thats my fault, not yours.  
Ive done it 7 times now.  
None of this is neccessarily your fault. Its my fault and down to my alcoholism and my own issues mostly, but given the past Im pretty sure if I wasnt an alcoholic I wouldve done this much earlier as you will never have trust in me or any man.  
My mum cant put up with the suicide attempts anymore. My dad cant put up with it anymore. My dog hasnt been out in ages and I never spend any time with her. I give you my whole life and where I know thats not your fault, its also unfortunately not normal. I do everything for you and even massage you three times a day, its ludacris. I get back from the hospital and have to massage you and comfort you, thats not what a real girlfriend does. You shouldve been down there with me and Ill never forget that you wasnt. Instead you were living it up in brighton not even caring about me. I try to die to prove how much I love you and you go away and have a nice time like I dont even exist.   
If Im going to try and kill myself because we have an arguement because of you get angry, then Im clearly not ready for a relationship. And I do believe if we had just a normal relationship, if we argued like a normal couple from the start and I wasnt messed around and blocked so much I probably wouldnt have carried on reacting so badly, but I have been. At this point ive been conditioned to apologise and react suicidally in order to get you back, when you dont even care anyway.   
I managed to keep a relationship for 5 years, and ended it for this. Ive never experienced so much mistrust and difficulty in maintaining a relationship. Im a patient and very nice guy and Im so so honest all the time, yet I get nothing for it.   
Yesterdays arguement was down to my honesty. Same as normal. I didnt really do anything wrong but be honest with my girlfriend, and in exchanged I was blocked again.  
Ive been given a choice today, either I carry our relationship on or I loose my best friend.  
Its not just that as well. If I had that choice and it was a clear good relationship It would be an obvious choice to choose you, and the situation wouldnt have even been created, but how do I choose you when the last 8 months 8 break ups, running away with Liam, Aaron, going on dates infront of me?, it taking 7 months just to make you commited to us, all of it, im nearly 100% sure if I choose you over my best friend then next month you will get mad over nothing again and we will break up and then Im completely alone.   
I have a best friend that actually cared when I was in hospital. Thats helped me, and then I have a girlfriend that says she loves me but in my worst times shes having her best times with her friends and pretending I dont exist. The fact you can not care about me that much, this is so hard.  
I just love you more than anything. But I cant die for you when you dont even care. The fact that im trying to shows im also unstable as well. We've met eachother at terrible times. Your madly untrusting with everything and its taken this long to build trust, but even now the wrong look will result in an arguement. Its not normal. The same as me trying to die every time we break up is not normal. If you trusted me more and was more normal, then I wouldve worked on my problems faster rather than constantly relapsing and making them worse. Its a joint problem. Id love to say its because we love eachother so much, but I genuinely think its all just me. I put everything into this relationship and when im in hospital your already out having fun, clearly not caring.  
Ive been in hospital 3 times. Ive called you whilst there and been shouted at. I wouldve expected you to come and see your boyfriend if you cared about me, but you never have. Josh has come every single time. Despite me continueing the same actions again and again, he keeps coming. Hes been nothing but an amazing friend, and I cant do that to such a good friend when you dont even visit me in the hospital.  
Theres been days where I was in the hospital and your out in Brighton having the time of your life, telling me that you just tried to completely forget about me. I could never do that to you. I was in hospital for an emergency detox and you tried to get me to leave early and fail that so I could come back and have sex, when  you know how much I like sex. You didnt come to support me or be there for me, you came for yourself.  
The issue is here that I love you greatly more than you love me, and that Im dealing with a lot of my own issues as well. You say you will support me but then when Im in a bad state you argue with me, usually for no other reason but to take anger out on me, and then I end up ruining my life more and worrying everyone again and again. Ive been so selfish to my family and my friends all because I never want to loose you.  
Unfortunately I cant do it anymore. This isnt completely you, its both of us. Its toxic. You have some serious deep trust issues and often times you get angry and create problems from basically nothing, and then Im fighting to even contact you. We have ""broken up"" nearly 8 times or so now. I am such a trusting and empathic and very honest person and I try so hard to keep this going all the time, but the slightest bit of mistrust that you create in your mind, and we are back to square one, asking me if I actualyl love you or not.  
If I didnt love you this much I wouldnt have nearly died 7 times trying to prove it, just because you got mad and wouldnt even talk to me.  
Josh will never speak to me again if I continue to date you. He has been there for me every step of the way and actually trusts me. My dog hasnt been spent time with in so long. My mum is about to kick me out. My dad emailed me earlier and said that he doesnt want me at his house anyway now. Ive lost everything. I need to pull myself out of my alcoholism as I have been but your mistrust mixed with my over honesty is setting me back every time I make progress, and bottom line is I cant loose a best friend for a girl that I really dont think cares about me. If you cared about me and I was in hospital, youd have been straight there, not argueing with me whilst im in the hospital. Thats not what a real girlfriend does or what a real relationship is about.  
In the last 8 months ive noticed. 8 months, 8 break ups. Back and forth, yet I stay the same. I have been just as open an honest from the very start. Within 2 months I noticed that the whole thing was one sided and I sent you a long message explaining how I feel. In a normal relationship you wouldve responded and addressed my feelings, but instead you blocked me, gave me the silent treatment and didnt take me back until I apologised, even though I didnt do anything wrong, all I did was be honest and tell you how I felt. I still stick by that message. I cant keep apologising for things I havent done. I cant keep going crazy because im madly in love and you dont even care about me. I cant keep doing it.   
This is gaslighting. Your making me think ive done wrong because your unwilling to accept or apologise for your own downfalls. I apologse for everything ive done wrong. I think about it, I explain my reasons, atleast I take responsibility, but even the slightest bit of blame towards you and your the victim.  
The bigger point here as well is that I shouldnt be thinking this way. I shouldnt be 99.9% sure that after you read this message you wont even care and will just find some one else. You dont appreciate me or anything I do for you, and you prove that again and again.  
As I said from the start though, it isnt all your fault, and im not putting this on you at all, but its both of us. Im too honest and loving and I get way to attached and your too untrusting and unstable that you keep setting me off. I keep thinking we are in an undying love relationship and you keep trying to teach me in psycholigical ways that if I dont do everything you want, then you will leave. Like your this amazing prize I should die for. Which clearly I thought you was, thats why I tried 7 times to die to prove it, but its just not the case. Tomorrow youll be with Liam or nathan or someone else and you wont even think about me. Youll think about what I did for you and how youve lost that, and you should. You shouldve appreciated my honesty, but you didnt.  
I thought everything was fine this morning, and I was going to see you tonight. Everything was fine. I do love you. I always meant that. I still do. Its going to kill me to be apart from you, but its almost killed me being with you.   
I also proved it more than enough times. I keep running through my mind what wouldve happened if I did die one of these times, you wouldnt have even cared, you wouldve told your mum and friends that Im crazy and that its all me and you wouldve just moved on, yet Im trying to die to prove my love. Its way too one sided. Even when we first met, within 2 months you ignored me for near a week whilst you ran off and fell in love with Liam. You then laid by me and told me how he disregarded you. You told a man that loved you and had been ignored for a week that you spent that week falling in love with another man, and came to me like a second choice, and you will deny that still. No apology. No regard for my feelings.  
If Im honest, I dont even feel like a second choice at this point. You went on a date the day we got back together, and even told me about it. Im like a 5th choice. Im choosing you over my entire life and you dont really care about me at all.  
You literally have no idea how much I wanted this to work. I shouldve proved it by now. Ive been given this choice now though by a good friend and also my family and taking into consideration, whilst sober, your actions over the last 8 months. Your lack of respect for me, for what I do for you. Your lack of care for my well being. I gave you £120 at the start of the month for no reason, a few days later you argued at me over £2.00 I didnt tell you about.   
This whole thing is unfortunately toxic and its going to kill me to end this, but atleast it wont actually kill me like it nearly has when youve ended it for no reason.  
Ive spoken to so many about my situation. Nobody can understand how my girlfriend would block me on every platform then come back after a few days of me begging. Nobody can understand how you would shout at me when im in the hospital rather than come and be with me. I dont understand it either, and as you know from this morning, I do love you, I do want you to have my child and I want this to work, but if its got to this stage where im nearly being kicked out, nearly lost every friend imaginable, and Im still very unsure if in the next month you might just flip out again for no reason and Ill be sitting on the side like a piece of dirt whilst you run off with Liam or another guy. I need to make the responsible decision for myself and end this.  
Its not all your fault.   
It took me a long time and us a lot of talk to realise and for you to tell me about your serious trust issues. That unfortunately is the cause of this failing, but its also down to my addiction issues. I stick to the fact that I havent really done anything wrong in this relationship towards you since we met, all ive done is try harder than any other guy could to win you over. Yes ive made small mistakes but all relationships have that. I was with someone for 5 years. You talk about things and work through them, but every time im with you im worried im going toset you off and get blocked for 5 days whilst you run off with Liam. Youve literally told me you love him before and that he broke your heart, I couldnt forget that. You laid in the arms of a man that loves you and said that even though you were with me, you ran off and fell in love with someone else.   
No matter what ive done to you in the last 8 months, most of which is your own mis trust, I could never bring myself to do some of the stuff that youve done to me.   
Im going to get help for my problems as I have been anyway, but you really should get help with yours aswell. If you cant make it work with a man that is willing to die for you, then I really worry. I love you more than you know and you dont know how hard this is for me. Its only because I also love my mum, I love my dad, I love my dog, and when we argue and I try to commit suicide or something its like I dont even care about them. I have to make this choice now as Ive been told to and I really dont want to but theres nothing else I can do.   
If I knew for a fact that in the next month or year we would be fine and normal, then yes Id try again about, but youve proven time and time again that you cant have a stable relationship, every time we even slightly argue its always the end. I cant trust that we will be together next month and I cant loose everything just to keep trying for someone who I dont even think loves me.  
You are an amazing woman, despite your serious trust issues, and I dont know how im going to cope without you now but I dont have a choice anymore.  If you read this full message and actually cared, you will come over tonight without me asking and apologise and try to make this work. You will promise me that you will actually have trust with the most honest man your ever going to meet and you will stop blocking me and ignornign me over minor arguements.   
I dont even think you will read all of this, and if you do, your going to say its abusive, when really its just me being honest, again. You didnt do anything wrong yesterday but your mistrust has torn whole thing apart since the moment it started. Ive tried so hard. I need to know your willing to actually try as well. I need to know you even care.  
Your going to see yourself as a victim and your probably going to move on in the next day. Youll be down at Tamen Pala on the weekend having the time of your life, whilst im still upset that ive lost you. I know these things are going to happen because theyve happened before over 8 times I think.  
I am so sorry for the cowardly way of doing this, its just that I cant handle another arguement. You get so aggressive and confrontational when I try to talk to you about serious issues and I cant do that to myself again. When we are in person you dont even listen to me, you twist things, you deny my honesty, and then me trying so hard coupled with you blaming me results in me going crazy. Its toxic. Im too sensitive and honest and your too untrusting.  
I love you more than life itself, as ive proved 7 times or so, but now ive been given this ultimatum, I have to make the right choice, and the right choice cant be the girl that doesnt even visit her boyfriend in hospital. It has to be the friend that does. Im sorry.  
I wish this couldve worked. More than you could ever know, or care.  
Thank you

666,Hey so a little background...I came out as gay in feb and I went fine...a couple months later there was an incident and it took me a month to recover...recently I’ve been really hard on myself and with every little thing I keep saying whatever I do is stupid or useless...I have a friend...someone who(and this is where the gay part comes in) is a big supporter of me...he helps me and has talked to me. Last week we came up with a system that we are implementing for the last 2 weeks of school where every other day we talk in private and have like a mini therapy system...that’s good...I’m getting better...I’m still doubting myself and it’s annoying bc I know who I am and I know what I can do...it’s just not going so hot...and I hope that this thing with my friend helps and if needed I’m going to ask my family to see if I could possibly get a therapist and I just I just need to know if what I’m doing is good,08Jun2019,1

Just yesterday my mom came into my room to go in my bed (I have a loft bed so I dont know why she didn't just stand at the side of the loft?) To tell me I'm weird becuase I sleep at unusual times. This is normal so I just shrug and turn around to sleep and she starts kissing my arm and this is what happaned

Me: mom stop. (She continues to kiss my arm)

Me: mom stop. (I say this slightly louder)

My mom: what? I'm just loving my daughter?

Me: I just want to sleep (at this point she starting to lightly bite my arm as in trying to push her away and I'm repeatedly telling her to stop)

Me: okay I've had enough, get out (I say this in a calm-ish voice)

My mom: excuse me??

Me:I've told you to stop repeatedly, stop means stop.

My mom: I just want to love you!

Me: yeah well, I'm not in the mood.

She then leaves my room. I feel a little guilty.

TL;DR: I tell my mom to get out of my room nicely, cuz shes being annoying and she gets pissed at me",08Jun2019,1
668,"I cant imagine this is the first time something like this has been posted, but I have been very torn about this lately. I have been dating my girlfriend for almost 3 years now, and we are very happy together. But as of the past few months, I just have stopped....feeling for her.

I wish there was some major reason as to why I feel this, but there isn't. I feel like the biggest asshole for typing this, because she has done nothing wrong. But every time we are together I just dont feel like I used to. I find it very hard to explain how I feel. I can't just break up with her, I'd like look like the biggest dick ever, but I just am not happy staying with her. So what should I do? Also I have thought about posting this on AITA but I dont know if I could handle the judgement.",08Jun2019,1
669,"This is gonna be a long one but here we go

So, I've met this girl, let's call her X, in primary school and we've been friends ever since. Our friendship grew over time and she soon became the only person I could really trust. But there was a problem with X. She always liked to argue and was really sensitive about everyting. At first I tried to pretend I didn't care about her shouting at me and getting angry about literally anything I did wrong (once she threw a tantrum because I didn't want to give her my sunglasses when she didn't bring hers). But then it started to irritate me because according to X everything bad that happened to her was my fault. I began to point out that she can't get angry about every little thing but it didn't help and she only got more furious. 

Before you come at me for only writing about bad things that X did, I have to admit I wasn't perfect either. There were moments when she was right about getting mad at me (like when I was late for our project meetings) but I still don't understand why she enjoyed taking her anger out on me, we were best friends after all.

Today things got even worse. A little bit of backstory: yesterday X went to a party with her sister and she didn't know anyone there so she started messaging me because she was bored. Before she went to the party I told her that I'll be with my other friend that evening. Today I checked my inbox and it was full of messages from X, where she basically said that I didn't care about her because I didn't respond to her texts yesterday. So I told her that I was with that other friend and I didn't have time to respond. She got even more angry which made me really frustrated and I told her that I was tired of her arguing with me every single time something bad happens. Then she said that she was glad that at least one of our other friends (not the one who was with me that evening) was online yesterday and responded to her texts and apparently that friend is the only one who really cares about her. 

I fear that this is the end of our friendship. I don't want it to end but at the same time I know that if we get back to being friends she'll be arguing with me all over again. And I don't want that because I hate arguing with people. So, what do you think I should do? How can I show her that I care about her but I'm also tired of her being so aggressive?",08Jun2019,1
670," 

All I have wanted for most of my life is to have a family -- to be able to support myself, a wife, and kids. However, with the way things have turned out in my life, any hope of being able to do such a thing is beginning to fade. I am a 26 year old school bus driver who barely makes enough money to cover his own needs -- let alone a family. I have no marketable skills. I have an Associate's degree but no desire or financial means to continue on with college. I have Hashimoto's Thyroiditis and other autoimmune diseases that keep me from breaking into the skilled trades because my body simply cannot handle daily physical exertion; I even made it pretty far into the process of becoming a police officer but couldn't continue because of all the exercise required for the academy.

The sad part is I am drawn towards more physically active careers and yet I am barred from these because of my health. It bores me to even think about having a job sitting at a desk or cooped up in an office all day. For these reasons I started gravitating towards driving jobs because it had the combined benefit of allowing me to not have to exert myself but also still be ""active"" in the sense of not sitting inside all day, but being out on the rode going from place to place as I do my job. I initially started with the idea of being a truck driver because they are easily able to earn enough money to support a family, but I passed over that idea once I realized how much time it would take away from me being able to actually spend time with my family.

From there I went on to the idea of being a bus driver because the district I am employed by offered to pay me to get my CDL. Ironically I am now in the opposite situation I would be in as a truck driver: I have all the time in the world with this job to spend with family, but I don't make nearly enough to support one.

Since going to college is seen as one of the standard paths that one is to take to acquire a job with sufficient earning potential nowadays, I will give you some backstory on what happened with my college career. In summary, I ended up wasting about 6 years on the pursuit of a Bachelor's degree because I listened to what other people said I should do with college and not my own heart. After I got my Associate's degree (General studies -- I just completed all of the basics and a few pre-reqs for my Bachelor's), I slogged through the same degree plan (Environmental Science) for years because I was told that I needed to get a STEM degree. It was all I could do to make myself go to class every day. Eventually it got to where I was almost suicidally depressed from how much I hated dragging myself to those classes. The final nail in the coffin was this: I had to do an internship for my degree -- a requirement which I successfully completed according to the guidelines laid out by the department chair. When it came time to to take the capstone class which was attached to the internship, however, the professor had changed the requirements for the internship and told me that I had to do another internship if I wanted to take the class. I worked for free for months at a job that I hated... and now I was told that I had to do it all over again. That indeed was the final straw -- I dropped out after that.

The truth is, I never would have chosen such a degree on my own. I probably wouldn't have even gone to college at all if not for the strong pressure from family to do so. I was told that my life would basically be over if I didn't at least get a Bachelor's degree. But even to this day, there is no marketable degree plan that I would be interested in studying in college. If I had my choice I would have chosen Music... Okay, so that allows me to be a music teacher -- but I have no desire to be a music teacher. I just don't have any real interest or passion for any of the fields that are the money makers today.

It has been years now since I dropped out of college, and I have racked my brain for these years trying to figure out how I will be able to make a comfortable living without a degree and without the ability to work jobs that require physical exertion. I have worked a number of jobs typically considered menial: grocery store employee, security guard, and I would even consider my job as a bus driver menial and I found myself bored with these jobs within a month or two of working at them.

The part that breaks my heart the most about of all this is that I have fallen in love recently with a girl whom I would like to spend the rest of my life with... but I am brought to tears when I think about our future together because... I can't see one... and it's all because I can't foresee how I am going to be able to make enough money to do the things that I want to do with her -- to get married, to have kids, to have our own house, to go places and do fun things together. I am heartbroken at the thought that, in spite of the fact that we our both madly in love and seemingly perfect for each other, that it could all come to an end someday because she will realize that I can't bring in enough money and that there is thus no way for things to progress past how they are now.

Am I doomed to be working unengaging jobs that don't make enough money?... Am I doomed to lose the one I love because I can't earn enough money? It has always been my understanding that I would need to make at least $50,000 or more per year to be able to support a family (myself, wife and 2 kids)... How is someone in my situation able to earn that much money?

I would greatly appreciate it if someone could give me their insight and advice.  
All opinions, positive or negative, good or bad, are welcomed. I have reached my wit's end and am in dire need of outside council on this subject matter.

Thanks in advance.",08Jun2019,1
671,"I live in dorm style housing in a small 70 square foot room in New York City. The room is usually crazy hot, I can not control the heat and i'm not allowed to have air conditioning. I've been overheated and gotten heatheadaches often. Right now I'm in the sweet spot where the weather isn't crazy hot and the heats been shut off for the winter, so for once it's actually not crazy hot in my room. But the air in my room must be crazy dry, because I am constantly dehydrated no matter how much water I drink. It's hard to sleep at night because the back of my throat dries out and I can't breathe threw my nose than. I know it's this room and not a medical problem because when I go visit friends in other cities for the weekend the problem entirely goes away. It's weird because I've been living here for two and a half years, and while intense heat has been a problem, this dehydration thing has only been for the last four months or so. I'm at my wit's end, I'm dehydrated when I go to work now and I can't recover from it during the day there. I have a humidifier that used to allow me to sleep but now seems to have no agent in New even though it's working the same. If I drink a ton of water I can maybe get a little relief for like a half hour at the most at the price of having to pee every half hour or so all day. I don't know how to fix this problem.",08Jun2019,1
672,"Everyday my mom comes home my work angry, angry at the people at work. She talks about how she has cussed people out at work and from the way she explains it, these people aren't doing anything wrong. She comes home and starts talking and ranting to herself, hysterically laughing at her own jokes and screaming for no reason. 
My dad doesn't do anything about this sadly. And I am only a 15 guy. 
This has been going on for the past 5 years or so? There was one point at my life where I was constantly being hurt by her constant yelling, and mood swings. When I was a kid I'd ask her to stop saying things and she'd keep saying them regardless of how much I told her they were annoying and hurtful.

I feel like there is no hope or anyway to even do anything because no ones given me any solutions. It's now the summer and I've always hated being at home because I have to deal with this.

677,"My friend Carla is a single mom who works hard to raise her son, Frankie, without any child support from his biological father. I’ve been in her shoes and I know it can be a struggle. Carla and I are casual friends - we get along, invite each other to events sometimes but we haven’t known each other very long (about a year) and we don’t hang out that often. 

Frankie is the same age as my son, Bobby. Recently, Carla asked me about football registration and what the process was to have Frankie play on the same team as Bobby. We talked about the equipment he’d need, and gushed about how much fun they’d have playing together. I saw Frankie the other day and he talked my ear off about playing football with Bobby. 

Then I found out Carla recently lost her job. I’m worried that money will be even tighter than it was. I still want Frankie to play football with Bobby in the fall. My husband and I both made decent money and are very good with how we manage it. We have the means to cover the fees and buy his uniform and equipment. I would love to offer to quietly sponsor Frankie on the team. 

How can I approach this with Carla without making her feel like a charity case?  I don’t want the lack of money to keep the kids from playing together. I want to be supportive, and I don’t think she’d ever in a million years ask me to pay for him to play.",08Jun2019,1
678,"I’ll keep this brief. 

I studied English at college and have spent the past few months with a copywriting job that I do not enjoy. The subject matter is boring, and writing for 8 hours straight kind of ruins the magic for me. 

I recently got offered a job at a local brewery, which is in production and is a physical job. I applied because craft beer is a passion of mine, and thought it might be a nice change of pace. 

However, my parents are pressing me to stay within the field I studied, saying they don’t want me to waste years in which I could be building experience for a better writing job. This brewery job is very manual, and has nothing to do with writing or editing. Perhaps social media management could be a possibility in the future, but for now it is not. 

So I ask all of you: am I wasting my degree and all the money spent? I’m genuinely torn and appreciate any responses. Thanks.",08Jun2019,2
