0,"I made this new friend in my math class last spring. I'm not particularly the most gifted in calculus so I'd say I probably asked him around 5 to 6 times tops to explain a topic or help me on a few quiz questions (our quizzes were designed in which we could go around and talk to other people in the class to solve the answers). Anyhow, I am grateful for his help but I essentially did most of the work to get the grade I ended up getting so I wouldn't necessarily give him all the credit for me getting a good grade in the class. Nonetheless, I appreciated his kindness and made sure to reciprocate if he needed help in another class. 

During this time, we were both taking chem but we were with different professors but the final exams where pretty much the same. I took the exam a day before him and he ended up finding me after my exam and bombarded me with questions and pretty much peer-pressured me into telling him what was on the exam. I was a bit uncomfortable because he was so forceful and upfront about it.. but I ended up telling him some info- like telling him major topics involved, some questions I remembered, and some I knew I got wrong. I thought my job was done and that I reciprocated enough.

Fast forward, fall semester is starting up and he's taking the same chem class/professor I took over the summer. I saw him a few times during summer orientation and his first few words to me were ""Hey u/double_dream_hands, so how was prof XXX?"", ""How was the class??"", ""You'll help me right??"" etc.. I was in a hurry doing some stuff so I just said that ""the class was okay and manageable if it was during a normal semester but since I took it in summer, it was quite a struggle for me""... Few days after, he's texting me and bombarding me with questions about how the tests were, how the labs were, etc.. Usually I'd be okay with answering simple questions like this but you could literally just ""Rate My Prof"" that shit and read all the reviews (because that's what I did), or he could just wait till the first day and read over the syllabus???

I don't really know what to do and I'm just lowkey really annoyed with him asking so many questions.. I feel that he's expecting me/lowkey insinuating that I should help him throughout his whole semester on the course... but I have my own share of shit I have to go through so no way in hell am I giving him all my work, labs, and answers to the exams. I've only known him for barely a semester so why would should have to feel obligated to make your life so much more easier when I had to fucking struggle through that class? I've resorted to just ignoring his texts but I don't know what to do if I see him in person.. I'm really bad with confrontation. Any advice?

TL;DR Friend keeps pestering me and asking me questions about a course he's going to take, pretty much insinuating I should be helping him with the course (providing answers, helping with labs, helping him study, etc) because he helped me in another course before.",19Aug2019,1

Financially, I can afford moving to Florida but I'm pretty sure my family would feel this would be a dumb move and maybe even feel betrayed. I also don't have a great reason to go. I have a best friend in Florida and all I know is I would enjoy life way more down there. Should I try it? Is it worth the being possibly disowned?",19Aug2019,1

3,"Ok so when I was about 14 I started to drink, mainly cause I was depressed and school pressure. I don’t know how much exactly I would drink but it was enough to make me not feel like shit.  When I was around 14-16, I was studying for some important exams which stressed me out a lot and well cause me to drink more. Eventually it was to the point where it was almost every other night. At some point I remember realizing that I was thinking slower, and sometimes simple concepts that my classmates would pick up on quickly, I would take a while to understand. I was never the brightest, but prior to alcohol, generally speaking I could at least sit though a class without falling behind. These exams finished in like June of 2018, and my results while not the best, slightly above average, but nothing amazing. After that set of exams, I had another (for anyone wondering it’s some form of the British education system) which was basically just ten times harder than the last. I was basically sober for the first 2 months of that academic year (which would have been September, October and part of November) when you get that hit of “this is gonna be the year I change” syndrome before I slipped back into my drinking habit. Fast forward to around June this year and my exams wrap up until my final year which starts in September.  I was drinking two times weekly on average for that whole have continued drinking even though I am on break. At this point, I’m drinking by the bottle. My parents eventually caught on to my habit but I didn’t care. I went out of my way to purchase and consume alcohol. This was up until about a week ago when something just clicked. I don’t know why but I decided to try and do some work. I can’t. I can’t think. Reading is hard. Reading and understanding is fucking impossible. I don’t know how I didn’t notice until now but, I’m slower. To do simple tasks I can confuse myself, though I don’t know if it stems from just overthinking or whatnot. My memory has gone to shit and I can’t remember simple steps to simple tasks. I tried doing a crossword in the newspapers and I literally got nowhere. 

Writing this has been a task, and I know that if your addicted to alcohol that trying to stop can be fatal if not overseen by a doctor but I’m a week sober and I think I’ve gone through the worst of it. I don’t even know if I can post about underage drinking o reddit (I’m fairly new but I had to create a new account for reasons related to the handle that I was going by) I cried last night because I just the thought of not being able to think properly scares me. School starts in a two weeks and I want to try. I have to. I don’t want to go to my parents because they seem to have just given up on me. My dad went as far as to mock me for some of my results that I got for exams this year, which was not good, maybe slightly below average, and my mom well she is with him there.  I just want some advice, anything. I don’t even know what’s the point of this post. Is there anything that I can do to prepare. I’m 17 now and I’ll be 18 basically as the school term starts. I know that alcohol has messed with my brain development, and the amount I’ve taken in over the years is bound to have some irreversible drawback on my mental capacity and capabilities, but if anyone has any advice for starting a new year and studying effectively, it would help.",19Aug2019,0

5,"So, I got really good grades in high school, so did my friends, and can choose to go to 2 of the best universities in the country.
Now, one of them, K, is regarded as the better university for med school. 2 of my fiends are going there, I feel like it’s a nerdy environment and that I wouldn’t make that many cool new friends over there.

The other one, M, is weaker and more expensive, but my cousin studies there, a good chunk of my friends are going to study there, and it’s med school program is only 5 years, not 6 like K.

So yeah, I’d live to hear your guys' opinion on this important part of my life.

6,"Trying to cool down from being lied, cheated and taken advantage of by Bad Owner (BO) Professional Fitter (PF),  and their bike mechanics (BM). Let start from then beginning; I spent more than $3000 on a Liv Giant bike, in my favorite color purple, and helmet from a bike shop in LA. The owner aggressively tried to over sell me. Repeatedly telling me I need clips-in pedals, when I continually told him I do not and will not buy them. I asked if he had helmets with visors. Then he starts talking about sunglasses and riding hats. I finally told him I couldn't afford much of anything else other than the bike and helmet. So, he starts with the, ""We have payment plans. Just make payments for everything."" It was very awkward and uncomfortable.
I schedule my fitting with Professional Fitter (PF) a week later after making my final bike payment. PF  then tells me I need a different size stem and they're out of stock in the size I need for my bike. PF removes the stem off my bike and replaces it with LA  after market /off brand used stem laying around and tells me he'll send my stem back and order the new one in the correct size for me and my bike in the original brand. Easy swap with Giant he says to me. PF then tells me I need to ride my bike a bit and bring it back to have the gears readjusted and report back if anything isn't riding comfortably. Called the bike store a twice and never heard back. I did a triathlon and had my bike serviced there before my race since my gears really need to be adjusted after riding my brand new bike, this is what PF said was normal, but never heard from him or LA again. Of course PF no longer works at LA. And this is one employee BO does Not stand behind, PF work. 

We're now to the current incident. I call to schedule an appointment for a full tune up and mention to BO I never received my stem from PF when I bought my bike and actually never heard from him again after the first initial fitting. BO tells me he'll look into the issue and get back to me when I pick up my bike. In the mean time he tells me how filthy my bike is and I need to purchase a $55 bike cleaning kit for my bike. However, the tune up he sold me also included a wash for an additional price. BO will aggressively get any money he can out of you with pressure selling you on everything. BO calls the next day and says my bike was ready for pick up and he says PF no longer works with the company so he can't do anything about the stem on bike. Husband picks up bike for me.
Busy as I am I was finally able to go on a bike ride a couple of weeks after my, ""tuneup"" 5 miles into my ride my pedal falls off and it almost feels like my tire wants to pull from under me like a flat or something weird. Gears are great bike is clean! 

Stop at the closest bike shop and ask to help with my pedal. They were super nice fix my bike and they asked if I had my bike service lately. Never once did they say anything negative. I was upset and said yeah just spent over $170 a couple weeks ago. I'm pretty upset this happened. He asked if it was okay to just give my bike a once over since I was riding and he wanted to make sure I'd be safe.
1) the True in my bike wheels are off
2) breaks not properly aligned
3) pedal not secured bolts not tightened or checked overall on bike 
The nice bike shop said they weren't going to fix the problems but just bring to my attention that these things should have been included in a standard bike tuneup especially for the price I paid.
I definitely feel cheated that I paid for all these service and didn't receive them. In addition to being conned into buying a $50+ bike cleaning kit.
Called the shop and called them out on the services I paid for and didn’t receive. BO tells me to bring my bike back into the shop. BO took my bike to the back and confirms, with his BM, who he make a point to say they have 6-7 years experience, that the True on my bike is off. He then adds, it could have happened by falling off a curb. 
BO then says, “the way your transporting your bike is causing the brakes to get misaligned. The pedal incident is isolated and it was a mistake. BO states we Always tighten every nut, bolt and screw with every tuneup. It was a mistake.” Adding a personal story, “It was a mistake like yesterday I picked up my BMW from the mechanic and it has a very large scratch on the side of it. I told them it was a mistake and I Probably won’t do anything about it. It’s water under the bridge to me.”  Great that’s you, you have money to throw around but I do not. I would like what I paid for. 
BO conclusion was it’s been a couple of weeks since you had the tuneup. He is not going to do anything about your bike especially when it’s another bike shop telling me this is what’s wrong with my bike. BO says he stands behind his guys work. Telling me he is the owner and that he was the only person who could fix this matter and it wasn’t going to get fixed. 

Cherry on top is when BO comes outside to intimidate me and yells at me accusing me of wanting a refund. Never once did I ask for anything other than the services I paid for. I also point out I never once mentioned a refund of any kind. I then say, “If you want to gain my trust again you’ll give me 50% my next tuneup IF I decide to come back, that IF.” He laughs at me and says no. I said fine you have completely lost my trust in your shop and I’ll be taking my business else. He laughs again and begins yelling by slandering the local shops in my area. Saying;
LA is the best shop in LA. I’m going to get used by the other bike shops.  LA sells $10,000 bikes and he’s the only shop that has knowledge on selling and fixing bikes. LA is a nationally recognized shop. He’s the best bike shop regionally and I won’t find anything close to LA bike standards.  

That’s the story. My bike still needs the maintenance they never did on my bike. It’s $70 at another shop. Anything I can do? I don’t have bike tool or the ones I would need",19Aug2019,1

11,"Hey everyone.  So, I’m a women in my late 30’s and I have been in and out if part time hospitality work for the last four years due to personal injury and a very messy divorce ( yes I have children) Previously, I worked full time for over 20 years in the hospitality/customer service industry.  Working from five star fine dinning establishments, for certain airlines in the lounges,  to your basic cafe or takeaway.  I also worked for the government in administration and also real estate. All positions have been within a management role and obviously I’m not limited to just doing hospitality. 
So recently I’ve been very keen to get back into the work force but am only interested in part time work not in management.  Basically a waitress.  I want to go to work, put my head down, do my job and go home, without the extra responsibility.  I’m not as young as I used to be and I’d like to start taking time to enjoy my kids.  
I apply for almost everything online every single day.  Between hospitality and administration jobs I’m applying for as good as ten jobs a day.  I’ve been landing interviews and getting nothing!!  Everyone wants me to be a manager or supervisor.  They tell me I’m over qualified to be ‘just a waitress’.  I’m not even applying for management roles, these employers just start talking about it and suggesting roles I can do within their company based on my skills.  When I turn down the management position I then get nothing.  Not even just ‘a waitress’ job which is what I applied for to start with.  
I’ve spoken to a few ppl and I’ve basically been told I should dumb down my resume according to the job I’m applying for...is this a thing? Does it actually work? I’m at a loss as to wat I need to do to bus some tables...I’m not in the US so dont work for tips etc) 
Has anyone else done this and has it helped to get a job?  I really want to work so will try anything atm.

My family is full of narcissists and judgmental people, so I really shouldn’t be surprised that this is happening to me. As stated above, I’m 19 and just recently graduated.

This job I’m working right now was also not my first choice. But I’m working. I’m trying to better myself and save money. 

My father and my aunt have gone out of their way to bad mouth me to OTHER family members about my life.

They are so quick to talk down on me, yet offer me no assistance for anything. They’re especially talkative about my schooling, which is the last thing on my mind because I need a car first. 

I really don’t know what to do in this situation. I really want to give up. I feel like I’m not going anywhere with this job, and the way they talk about me feels even worse. I rely on my mom to let me borrow her car, so that limits the kind of job I can get (I live in a rural area and all of the better paying jobs are 20-30 mins away). Any suggestions are welcome.

23,"Sorry it's gonna be a long one for the sake of context!

We've both 22 and have been platonic friends for the last 5 years and have helped each other grow in each others hobbies and passions. We FaceTime a lot to rant, plan, talk relationships, or laugh at memes and videos together. We have always vibed ridiculously well and are even traveling internationally together for a month next year to places we both dreamed of visiting. She moved back to her parent's a couple months ago because she couldn't afford to live where here anymore and has been saving to come back asap. 

Last month I was helping her plan her living situation and ironing out the details of our trip, then one day she told me how she broke her year long celabicy recently with this guy she just met at a friends house (going on an acid trip together). We laughed about how she never keeps her celabicy promises to herself and moved on. This was followed by a ton of questionable decisions. The next few days i noticed she was always at his house when facetiming.. Sometimes he would even stay in the same room and listen in and comment on our trip plans. She ended up living there all month long because she was tired of her folks. We joked how she shouldn't be finding a bf rn because she's about to leave and she agreed but started going on small group dates with him. She said they havent ever had a date with just the two of them yet and feels like she's just a trophy most of the time, but loves the attention and sex with the guy. A few days later she said she really loves him and accepted when he asked her to be official. Things got weird with the guy soon after. She told me how clingy he was and how he always wants check ins and know exactly where she is, with who, and what they are doing. He apparently goes off on her via texting sometimes when she doesn't check in but then texts her poems apologizing for freaking out. 

Fast forward to this month.. her plan to move back never happened. I came to find out recently that the dude is 9 years older than us, lives in his parents house, recently quit his part time job because it stressed him, but was seriously wanting to follow her to my state if she decided to leave (even though they've only known each other for 3 weeks and he's never left his state in his life). He even tried getting an apartment with her in the state there in rn but couldn't because of quitting his job. She found out and told me a while ago that half his friends and his parents don't like her at all because of her age and how close they are already. She says they are just in love.

Lastly, i texted her a week ago asking if she got her passport yet and to pay back some cash i lent her. She just responded today, apologizing that she sucks at responding now because her bf takes her phone for DAYS sometimes now! Im stunned she's ok with it. 

I just see all the red flags and I've hinted at them in the past. She loves being independent when she's single but when she falls for a guy she kinda gets ignorant of signs like this and latches to them hard. I saw this pattern in her last relationship with a way better guy imo. 

I feel like its none of my business because it's her life but to me it's so blatant that i feel like a bad friend for not discouraging it more. I don't want to come off as jealous or anything because I recently had a relationship end and im single now. Also worried about how both her recent bad decision making and the guys clingyness will affect our trip! We dropped 1.2k into it already! We insured everything for cancellations but im putting a career job on hold til after we get back and working easy part times rn. 

What do you guys think?

TL;DR: best female friend in other state is dating a clingy, older, and jobless guy that lives at his parents. Bunch of red flags in there relationship and I'm worried for her and an international trip we're taking in a few months. She's seems happy with him regardless but not sure if i should push the idea to her.",19Aug2019,1

First of all sometimes I embellish or very, very slightly alter stories in order to make me seem better, more justified or in the right. But to be fair I it was only minor details I would alter and I don't do it that much anymore.

Secondly I am extremely overconfident to the point of it being detrimental to me. Such as sometimes when I finish a test I and I have time left I won't look back over it because I assume I get all the answers correct, or how I always assume I'm the smartest person in the room and how I despise this one kid in my class who always academically and physically upstages me.

Also I'm a massive attention seeker, like I am usually the loudest person in any room and I always tell sub-par jokes just to get a tiny shred of approval. This may be due to the fact that I don't get a lot of attention at home and I feel like I'm living in the shadow of my older sibling.

Sometimes I use unnecessarily big words to sound smart.

Also I am very paranoid about how people feel about me and if I even hear people mentioned my name in passing I feel like they are immediately talking about how horrible I am.

And lastly I used to have problems with empathising with other people which means I would assume I am always in the right also I had no regard for other people's feelings if they weren't my friends, family or someone I liked and most of the time I would put my needs above others however these days I ave grown as a person and I am more empathetic to other people.

That's all I have to say. So Reddit am I just being paranoid or am I actually egotistical?",19Aug2019,1

5 years ago my crush liked me and now she’s messaged me on Facebook (I don’t have a pic of me on there) and I’m scared she won’t like me anymore",19Aug2019,0
35,"Long story here so get ready 

Last year I had this female best friend who I met in calculus. I talked to every day and night. We were like brother and sister. She was 5 years older too so like very protective. But slowly I developed feelings. Pretty hard too. 

Thing is she had a bf. So I didn’t do anything. They would take trips together and she was in love. 

She always cried about him and I remember every night we talked about 5 hours. It was crazy. 

Well one day her bf and her get into a fight over where they are in the relationship. He wouldn’t call her his girl. And she told me she stormed out of his apartment. I asked her if she wanted to meet up. She said “I’m busy right now but maybe later” I had her social media account cause she gave them to me as a joke. And I saw she went to go sleep with some guy who texted her to come over. Well anyways she didn’t tell me she was sleeping with some random guy and it sucked cause I read the message of them.  I told her I saw the message and she said “oh well hehe” 
She then went back to her bf. She never told him about sleeping with the random guy. She never told him. 

Anyways she breaks up with her bf completely. And then 2 months later tells me she’s in love. I told her that I wasn’t sure where she is with guys and I don’t know how to pursue this. I didn’t want to lose the friendship. She told me there is no guys only me she wants. 

Days go by. I was on her phone messing with it and she was on mine. We do that sometimes. And I see that her fwb has been texting her. Like a day before he asked if she’s in town and she tells him that’s she is out of town. Like she really was. 

Well we have a huge fight and she tells me it’s nothing and that we aren’t even together. But she didn’t admit she was lying. 

Anyways we decided to take time away from eachother. But we still talked every night like it never happened. She told me about how her ex sent her flowers and she kept them. She told me how “all her friends want her to have his babies” I didn’t say anything. We were just friends. My best friend set me up on a date during that time too but we just had coffee and I left. I just wanted my friend. 

So a month later I asked her out. She told me “I’m not her type” but said she was joking and we began dating. 

It was so nice and fun. We were in love. And it was easy cause we were best friends. 

Then her bday came. And I got her a nice gift and surprised her at work. Sure enough that day she got flowers and a text from her ex. She replied to the text and went to get the flowers. 
I told her that I don’t like this going on. She told me she didn’t either. I told her that it’s cause she is still close with his family. She said she will always be friends. I told her it makes me insecure for that to happen. She started to cry like crazy. And told me “get out of my life” so I apologized and kissed her. She told me she wanted to give me her social media passwords. First I told her no. But she said it would “help her” so I decided to take it. 

Thought it was done but it wasn’t. 

One day we are making out and she stops. She says “my ex fwb came to my house to visit my family” this isn’t the same fwb. This is the one from years ago. Who once got her pregnant. I didn’t say anything and continued to kiss her. 

Well couple days later she sent me a msg about how her sister wants to hang out with my gf’s exes family. I felt bad so I said “do as y’all want” she then asked if she could be friends with her exes family. And I had enough. I told her “why the hell am I here” and we had a huge fight. She got mad and it became heated. I told her “so I’m just some guy you are using till you go back to your ex huh” she says “sure” and I called her a “bitch” we then meet up. And she tells me she doesn’t want me anymore. So I leave. She then calls me 10 seconds later telling me to come back and she loves me. So we get back together. 

Couple days later I help her older sister with her physics homework. But I had a call from my aunt. So I stepped out to take the call. My gf asked why I couldn’t take it in front of me. And a huge argument till I finally agree to taking the call in front of her.  Then couple more nights after that she had dreams of me cheating with her friend. 

Well my parents and brother/sister find out. They hate her with a passion. I told them about the relationship and they wanted us to breakup and wanted me to find better. 

So I tell my gf and we talk about it. We agreed to take some time away. But we can’t stay away from one another. 

Every day and night we talked like nothing happened. 

One day she tells me how she met her exes family and hugged them. I didn’t say anything. Then I tell her how this girl keeps screenshotting my snap stories. She asked why. I said “idk she used to have a crush maybe she’s crazy lol” she flipped. She called the girl a bi... Told me “nobody hits on my man” I told her “I’m not your man” It felt like I was being controlled. 

Well the next day she tells me how people think she and this guy at her work are “always flirting” she gave me her phone to prove she wasn’t. They texted and snapped so many times. I didn’t say anything. I gave the phone back. 

The next night I bought up some of her exes again and we had a fight. She said “I am done with you forever now” and I told her I’m getting a panic attack with all this. She told me “want me to call your mom to calm you down” and I called her a “w....” I apologized immediately after and said I got too caught up into it. She was done. 

The next day I logged into her social media. And she is asking that guy who she told me was just her friend to buy her some nice jewelry. I confront her and she says “you are controlling and that he is nothing” 

For the next few days I tried to text and call her. She blocked. Then unblocked. Till she finally “rubbed it in my face” how she is sleeping with the guy now and details. Telling me how we haven’t even been together for a while. 

Well I flipped and said some horrible things then apologized again. During this time I even told her that I had an ex before cause I felt insecure. Idk why. 

I then blocked her

I feel guilt now for what I said in the fights. 

AITA for all this?",19Aug2019,1

The thing is none of them have anything in common and I hate having to deal with this every single time I see them. One of the people I mentioned is my cousin who I’ve just recently visited and who lives in a different country to me and whenever we’re together we get along so well and we have an awesome time together but whenever I have to leave or when she leaves I go into this sort of depression or period of sadness, it basically starts with me almost crying when I leave and I spend the next few days constantly thinking about scenarios in my head with them and how I should’ve done more things with them or things I should’ve done differently and the list goes on.

I hate when this happens and I don’t understand why, I will admit I am an extremely emotional person in general and quite an outgoing person but I usually feel satisfied or happy when I have spent time with friends or family but with these three people in Particular I always feel unfulfilled and heart sore. 

I know this post kind of sounds corny and I contemplated if there was even any point of me posting this but I am genuinely wondering if there is and advice at all I can get to help cope with this because its always a bummer when these negative emotions overpower the good times I had and I’m really struggling to suppress them.",19Aug2019,1

I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and I said 30th November then Sam bubbly pointed up with both hands saying ‘mines 21st’ and then sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays...are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted triggered  like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed/serious a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

My friends are content with their living situations and none of them are planning on moving out, so I haven't had any luck finding a roommate I would be comfortable with. Living on my own is not an option, rent is too expensive here.

My friends are very critical of me talking about moving in with him, but he and I have both agreed to give it until next spring to make a final decision. We both are enthusiastic about planning a future together, moving in together would be both practical and comfortable.

60,"  So today while scrolling through Instagram I saw a post from one of my old friends (let's call her T) and I was shocked. I couldn't have even recognized T if it was for the username. She has lost so much weight in a 6-3 month period and she is as pale as a piece of paper. I did some research about methamphetamine and other stronger drugs and she had alot of the common signs of use. I'm just really worried about her. Its not really any of my business but I fear I would blame myself if anything big happened to her and I wasn't or didn't bother to step in and try to help.

  We were never best friends or anything like that in HS but we commonly worked on projects together and hung out together at school. She told me she ""experimented"" with drugs in HS and told me she once tried cocaine at party (not sure if if I believed her at the time). She hasn't always hungout with the best group of people either. She even dated a few known ""weed dealers"" in our School. (which is still illegal in my state)  I just want to offer my help I guess and I'm not sure how to go about it. I don't want to get her in trouble with law enforcement or anything like that (she smokes weed and like I mentioned before it's not completely legal in my state at the moment).

69,"Hi! I have undiagnosed symptoms and really need help. I am 21 years old, female, mixed race (European and middle eastern), and 145 pounds. My previous medical history includes the fact that I have hypertension, 180 over something, but I treat it with medication. I am also vitamin d deficient. 

I have recently experienced life altering occurrences. I do not know if this is related, but back in October I had flu like symptoms that lasted for about 2 weeks. I had fevers and chills, as well as muscle spasm and joint pain. Six weeks prior to this I had unprotected sex. At a later point, I thought these instances were somehow connected. Fast forward to February, I start experiencing a series of strange symptoms. First it started with a really intense chill that ran through my legs and to my butt. The chill was so intense that it was painful, but to the touch, the skin on my legs were not cold. Then there was an instance where a wave went over me and I felt like I was going to fall over. Also, my hearing suddenly went, but it came back within moments. Soon after I started experiencing tingling in my brain and stomach. After a few days, this went away as well, but I've noticed lasting damage. After this happened my face started to twitch uncontrollably for a few days, my lip as well as the area above my eyebrow. This too went away, but the issues that remain have to do with my brain itself. I no longer have the same cognitive ability. I was in school with a full academic scholarship, but after this, I couldn't do simple math or think of simple things to say. My conversation skills disappeared. I used to have a sense of humor; but that is completely gone now. Also, I used to be extremely ticklish, but now I feel nothing to that sort of touch. It's as if there is a disconnect between my nerves and my brain. I've also noticed I never feel hungry anymore. I never get stomach pains; my tummy never growls. 

Anyway, I thought this could somehow be related to me having unprotected sex. I was struggling to find answers through this and read that HIV can cause CNS/brain issues. But I've been tested for everything, including HIV, countless times, and everything came out negative. I also did an MRI on my brain and everything appeared normal. The structures of my brain are fine, and nothing has ruptured. I don't know if this is a post viral syndrome type issue or a neurological problem. 

People have told me it could be Lyme disease, which I will get tested for, but to my knowledge I have never been bitten by a tick. And I don't live in an area where ticks are common. Plus, I've never had the bulls eye rash that typically follows an infection. 

Some others I have talked to suggested MS. I'll admit that I know little about the illness, and my doctors have never questioned me about the possibility. 

I'm on here because my problems have been discounted by many doctors, claiming it may just be anxiety or a mental illness. I encountered this so much that I visited both a psychiatrist and a psychologist, and both claimed that I did not have a mental or emotional issue- that it was something else. 

I really need help. This has essentially ruined my life as I can no longer perform academically, and I have lost a lot of friends/contacts as I no longer appear to be me. Thanks for reading. Any advice, suggestions, and experience would be greatly appreciated.",19Aug2019,0
70,"The title sort of explains it all, I need a new hobby and this could kill two birds with one stone. I've never ran as a hobby before, I only ever did in required gym classes, which sucked the fun out of it. Now I can do it on my own. 

I plan on looking for shoes tomorrow as well, if I can't find ones here in my house that I could borrow that fit. Regardless, I plan on getting shoes, but I'm struggling to find a pair on a budget as someone who runs on their toes. If anyone has advice on that as well, like any cheap suggestions, that would be super helpful, but I guess with shoes you get what you give.

72,"I need advice.

This past semester I was enrolled in a Biology class that had a lab. On the syllabus issued on the first day, it says 'if you miss the mandatory lab meeting, I will drop you from the class and lab'. In bold and underlined. She has not updated or sent any amendments to the syllabus since the initial copy was sent out.

Well I missed the mandatory meeting. But instead of dropping me from the course and lab, she just issued two F's.

I have spoken with the professor and she will not change the grade. Then I spoke with the Dean of the Dept. who contacted the professor on my behalf. Now I have another meeting in the AM with the original professor.

I am not sure what to expect. I have already filled out the paper for a formal appeal if she denies me again.

Am I out of line? Or should she have to follow her own syllabus?

(Ive cross posted this to the college board, but no one has answered).",19Aug2019,1
73,"I don't want to give too many details for privacy reasons. I worked at a very toxic place last year and developed severe depression, anxiety and PTSD from it for which I am now being treated. I had to quit that toxic workplace. Unfortunately due to life being the way it is, the only job I'm able to get at the moment is in the same building as that toxic workplace that I left. Luckily it is in a different department though so I will rarely if ever run into my former coworkers. However, my anxiety won't stop about what IF I do run into them. I realize worrying isn't helping anything, but I'm very bad at thinking of a response in the moment, so I want to be prepared just in case. 

The people I worked with were middle-aged adults but acted like high school mean girls. It's disgusting. I was professional and kind but they treated me like I was the scum of the earth. They hate me and are more than happy to get me in trouble for the tiniest of infractions. The best part though is that they're allowed to make mistakes and not get in trouble, because they're in the mean girl clique. 

So anyway, my fear is that they're going to try to upset me or get me in trouble for something minimal. I'm not one to explode or act unprofessionally and I've never acted that way toward them even when they were mean to me in the past. However, having to now deal with my mental health issues and many other problems that have come up over the last few months, I have far far less patience and am afraid if they do something bad enough or habitually enough I might snap at them. (Of course that's fine when they snapped at me for no reason, but they would get me in trouble if I did it to them with a reason.)

So I don't know what kind of shit they're going to pull, but the only thing I can think of is that if I'm talking to a former client of mine (I'm still on very good terms with them) and one of the mean girls walks up, she might freak out that I'm talking to HER client and I shouldn't talk to them since I no longer work there. It's not even a trying to take their business away deal at all. Otherwise I would understand. But there is 0% business, money, or loyalty involved in this situation. It's 100% just me being pleasant toward pleasant people and I have the right to say hi to them. The conversations would just be about summer vacations, their kids, the weather, and typical chit-chat like that. 

So, if I'm talking to one of the former clients and one of the mean girls shows up, I can see them saying ""You can't talk to them. You don't work for them anymore."" There is no rule against it, and I'm so sick of their shit and not going to be a doormat. So I'd respond ""Well I don't work for you anymore either so how about you don't talk to me."" I think that's a 100% fair statement in this situation. I would never ever say that to anyone who hadn't been so rude to me in the past or if there was any inkling of a reason it might be inappropriate to talk to past clients. I even asked my current boss and he said I'm definitely allowed to talk to past clients. I'm not going to seek them out, but we share a lobby, so I'm not going to be rude and shuffle past them without engaging in small talk for a few seconds. 

Anyway, if I said something like ""Well maybe you shouldn't talk to ME"" to the mean girl(s) I can 100% see them telling one of the higher bosses and getting me in trouble for being rude. This is how they work. They can do no wrong and I can do no right in their minds. The higher boss doesn't know me but knows them so would probably side with them. 

Even if it's not the greeting past clients situation, I can just see them wanting to nail me for SOMETHING. I just can't think of any other situations. Anyway, the point being, I'm terrified they're going to find some stupid way to get me in trouble and then I'll be seen as the bad guy, which is what they did at my job with them and why I had to leave. Their boss (the one who I previously worked for) is going to be no help in this situation either and if anything will side with the mean girls. 

What can I do (if anything) to be prepared for their shittiness without it reflecting badly on me but also without me being a doormat?

Thanks!",19Aug2019,1

All of a sudden the first thing I wanted to do was run around my dorm room and say hi to everyone who was in heaven with me, but I was too distracted by the fact that flooding my brain was all of the happy memories I have ever had.

79,"There’s a lot of things which make my friendship with her very complicated, namely I have feelings for her, and there are a number of things which don’t make it impossible but rather difficult  to consider a relationship. I’m content enough being friends with her. So let’s not get into that now.

The issue is we can never seem to have a simple interaction. For example, I just wanted to drop something she left at my place back at her apartment, but she didn’t just want me to drop it off we had to go out to dinner and drinks + whole shabang.  90% of the time if I really just want to drop something off,give her a life, or something else basic...she wants to turn it into a whole night.  Now don’t get me wrong, I love spending time with her, but sometimes I just want to make it simple.  I can never turn her down. To be clear, no I’m not always the one paying or fronting the cost of the activity, everything is always equal, we still fight over who pays.

I can never turn her down or tell her that I just want to drop her hoodie off and that I really don’t feel like doing stuff tonight.  How do you tell someone the truth without offending them? Rven when I don’t feel like spending time with her, I still want to spending time with her.

80,"My dad was my hero. Never had anyone been there for me like my dad. When I was bullied, he was the shoulder I would cry on. On every birthday, he would bake a cake for me since money was tight and we would decorate it together and put as much sweets on it as possible. He was an amazing father. He also taught me some core values I still follow. One of them being that cheating is wrong because it's against what he believes in. I've always agreed with that but I've come to find out he doesnt. A few months ago, I was on his phone while waiting in the car for him and there was a notification that popped up for him that said a woman's name I didnt recognize so I clicked on the notification just to see. I thought it was harmless but it wasnt. I come to find out that he had been messaging a younger woman sexually explicit things for a month prior and he even sent her pictures of me and my siblings because he was apparently 'proud of us'. He also asked for nudes. To say I was fucking shattered was an understatement. I was angry at my dad but had to cover it up because he would be coming back any minute. I was conflicted in my mind whether it was actually considered cheating or not because technically they havent had sex because she lives in another country. I dont know what to do. I dont know if I should tell my mom or if I should just keep quiet. What's even worse is that since they texted through Google hangouts and my phone was connected to his email, I could see all the sexual things my dad was saying to someone that was not my mom. Now, 3 months later, their relationship has dissolved because they had an argument over whether he would pay for her new phone or not. I didn't take any screenshots before my dad covered up his tracks and I'm glad I didnt but also I regret I didnt because now I have no proof that anything happened. I feel fucked up for thinking this way but I feel as though I need to tell someone. I feel like im going crazy because im the only one that knows what's happening and im scared my dad is going to cheat on my mom with someone else.

81,"Apologies if this is a bit long, and if it should be somewhere else, i.e. r/family. 

So my sister (21) and I (24F) are both in college; I'm in grad school, she's in undergrad. I'm out of state, but Sis is about an hour away from Mom. 

To be blunt, I don't think Mom's handling the ""empty nest"" thing very well. She's always been a devout Christian, but I think she's starting to lose it, even for her, based on what I've seen:

Mom is a single mother, Dad's a deadbeat (putting it nicely). Now that she's on disability after surgery (5+ years ago), she doesn't work. So, she literally spends hours in her room at a time, reading the Bible or putting up these really disturbing posters that she's written Bible verses on in huge letters. She only eats a handful of things daily (rice, spinach, chicken, sardines, peanut butter, apples and salmon, that's it). She sleeps on the floor and keeps literally all the lights on in her room in order to wake up easier to pray. She likes to pray until 4 am, very loudly. She speaks in tongues all the time under her breath, and to her, the only thing that matters in this world is the Bible. Everything else doesn't seem to matter, to the point where lightbulbs have gone out and aren't replaced, and bills are being paid late. She lives in a huge house, all by herself, and I've noticed bits of mold in my old room as well as cobwebs and various insects in the corners. She loses track of things very easily (forgetting her phone charger, leaving her car keys in the car often, locking herself out of the house, things like that). Aside from visiting one of us, she usually doesn't leave the house unless it's for church, early morning prayer group, Bible study or going to the store. 

All of this is bad enough, but the worst thing is when she confides in me about her loneliness. I really sympathize with her; it isn't fair that Dad wasn't there, and her parents are in another country, but are assholes themselves. She doesn't socialize because she's afraid people will start talking about her and her issues. She hasn't been to therapy, thinking that the Bible is the only therapy she needs. Yet she insists that ""as her daughters"", it's my or my sister's job to keep her company. She will drive down to my sister's dorm, sometimes unannounced, and stay there for days. My sister also feels bad, but Sis mostly feels overwhelmed and pissed off, confronting Mom and arguing with her often. Mom thinks I'm the levelheaded and compassionate one and tries to drive 200+ miles to stay with me, asking if I can get her an Airbnb to stay in ""for like a couple weeks or so"". If Z and I can't accommodate her, she goes to our neighbors' house and asks their daughter to spend the night with her. She also asks her cousin (he lives 3 hours away) to spend a few days in her house. Last I heard about it, she's asking other people in her prayer group to stay with her too. 

All of this obviously worries me every time I go home for holidays or when I see her, and I feel like I should leave my graduate program and stay with her. 

...But if I go, would I ever be able to leave? And is that selfish of me to ask when she's losing her mind in that house?

I guess what I need to know is what I can possibly do 200+ miles away, and what should be done for her. Secularly, Christian-based, anything would help because I'm kinda lost on what to do.

85,"Hi all,

I have to make a choice (in about 24 hours) of whether to live in NYC or Seattle/Bay area. I have an offer that is contingent on location, and the company has multiple offices. I'm eyeing NYC because it's a great place for a young person like me to live (21/F), unlike the Bay area/silicon valley, where I lived for 2 summers. Silicon valley is very tech-centric, and male-dominated. SF might be close, but it's an hour train ride away and not very worth.

My only concern and biggest 'con' against going to NYC is because my parents live close by (40-50 minute train ride). They were physically and emotionally abusive to my sibling and I growing up, to the point that I was in the foster system for a while. 

I do not hold any grudges, and am very understanding to my mother especially, who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder last year after h severely injuring my dad and cutting all phone lines to prevent him from calling 911. However, I'm worried that they will pressure me to live with them, which makes sense for me financially since it'll be rent free, and they want me to be close to them.

I will be making about 180k total compensation before negotiation (and I'm planning on negotiating) in either location. I believe (please lmk if I'm wrong) I can get a studio apt if I allocate about 2k/month to rent. (Also wouldn't mind some financial help in this matter.) My main concern is that my mother will want to constantly see me, show up unsuspectingly, meddle in my affairs, or decide to stop taking her medication (as she did during her depression diagnosis).

I would like your thoughts and opinions on this.

The charge is a check fraud charge and it is a six month sentence. My daughter she seems to be handling it fine. I told her right away about it and she reacted pretty calmly.

97,"Years ago when I was young I attended a semester long program and got a certification in floral design. I absolutely love to work with flowers and so I was very excited to start my career. Not long after that I found a job at a local flower shop. I loved working there and making arrangements, but my boss and I had a lot of creative differences. She CONSTANTLY compared my work to a former employee who was around my age and she loved like a daughter. I've always been a perfectionist and had low self esteem, so this really weighed on me. However, after about 3 months of working there, a coworker who was very manipulative and honestly the worst person I've ever met, convinced my boss to fire me. After that, for whatever reason, no one else in the area would hire me. This really, really got to me and I became extremely depressed for quite some time. Years have gone by and I've worked different jobs in different industries, but I really want to go back to being a florist. It just feels like what I'm meant to do. I've been practicing my work and I've printed up my resume, but every time I really think about going out there to get a florist job, something inside me panics. I can't shake the feeling that my floral work is terrible and no one will ever want me to work for them. And I also can't stop thinking about how even IF I get hired how my boss will think I'm terrible and regret hiring me. I just feel so insanely inadequate and can't seem to find any confidence. I've been trying to work on this in therapy but it's extremely slow going and I really want to do floral work professionally again. And when I look at my work I've done while practicing objectively, it's fairly decent, but I still can't help but feel inadequate. Any tips?

98,"So we went to Costa Maya last week in the NCL Breakway on a 7 day cruise. Everything was going great until day 4 when we stopped in Costa Maya.

We went scuba diving in the morning (which was great).  We then got some lunch at a nice beach front restaurant.  Then it gets interesting.  We go into a swim up bar and order a margarita on the rocks, one for each of us.  We are having a good time, and then we order the second one, and then we wake up 7 hours later in the cabin with no memories after ordering the 2nd drink.

Still extremely foggy at 6 am we go to medical and they determine that we were drugged by something that wasn’t on their test kits.  

My girlfriend and myself, both terrified from this whole endeavor, and having no idea on how we even got back to the ship, we go to security to talk to them and ask them if they have any clue as to how we got on the ship.  To our extreme embarrassment, the head of security knew exactly who we were because we were 20 minutes past all aboard. He said that I was pushing my girlfriend in a wheelchair up the dock and she was covered in vomit.  I was apparently coherent but I have no memories of any of this.  

After hearing the details of our return, we were so mortified that we spent the last 3 days in our room only to come out and pick up food and eat it back in the room.

I went online for the refund and saw that they were charging me a cancellation fee despite me just booking this flight. 

I call in and speak to an agent who lets me know that this is because I MODIFIED my flight instead of canceling the first one and rebooking another. (Of course I would? If I’m changing my flight dates why in the world would I cancel and rebook when given the option to just modify it?) 

So because I modified this flight, the airline is using my original flight booking date from a month ago and I cannot receive a free cancellation fee with refundable ticket. 

I was polite to the agent, thanked her for her time and hung up. Where do I go from here? I’m planning on calling in the morning and trying to get a refund or even just credit for this flight I just booked and put it towards the one a few months from now. 

If I absolutely cannot do that, I need the money back because money is tight and it could definitely be used for other important things. So.. would calling my bank and telling them I didn’t make this payment cause it to be refunded into my account and have them send me a new card work? 

I am 100% willing to be really polite and firm when I call back that I could really use this money and just hope they refund it or put in credit for me.",19Aug2019,0

106,"I've been driving a humble but well-maintained Jeep Liberty since I started college, passed down through my family. My parents wanted me to buy a car so my younger siblings could drive something at home for high school while I'm away.

For a few months we've talked about researching cars together, but every time we started to, one of my parents would object to whatever we were looking at (part unavailability, unsafe, unreliable, etc.). Fair.

Saturday, I went home thinking we were going to look at cars again, not knowing my dad was driving me to a dealership to buy a car he and my mom decided on behind the scenes. When he got there, he didn't have his license, so the car was signed in my name, and he didn't have his wallet, so I had to put $1,000 down on it, but he paid for the rest ($18k) with a check.

While it's not a bad car (2016 RAV4) by any means, I was thinking of looking at fuel-efficient sedans for driving in the city... Plus, as my first car, I wanted to be able to pick something I felt was tailored more to me, even if that meant getting an old beater for the rest of college--I am not someone that values fancy features in a car, and the fact the one they picked has so many bells and whistles irks me. There are plenty of reasons to like the car, but the main issue is I had ZERO input or even preparation for it, and now I'm paying for it.

I worked a co-op and restaurant job the past semester to save up $15k while also paying for my apartment and utilities (as well as groceries, gas, etc.). I had autonomy and savings. Instead of my savings account having a huge buffer, my money solely exists to eventually pay my parents back for a car they chose for me. I'll have to work another co-op just to have net positive savings, rather than graduating with lots of savings as I originally planned.

The advice I'm seeking pertains to the fact that I still have yet to develop a payment plan with my dad, and I'm not sure how much I got screwed over (or at all, who knows). I feel frustrated and kind of tricked and I'm not sure what conversation to even have with them to establish avoiding feeling like this in the future.",19Aug2019,9
107,Hey. I’m a 14 year old boy in my freshman year.I have a crush on a girl but the problem is that I don’t have any classes with her.I want to know what I should do.,19Aug2019,27
108,"Parent of 3: 7, 5, &amp; 0.5 - girl, girl, boy.

I have two major problems. A seeming short temper - and not being able to truly enjoy happiness.

To clarify: I have many sweet moments with my wife and children. I often feel like I'm seeing the moments as a third person - and almost video-game/collector-like think, ""I need to savor this moment...""; but I always end the thought with ""...because it'll be gone soon.""

So there I am - playing with kids, having my daughters randomly present me with a craft because they love me, etc. - and as soon as I try to enjoy it - it is over clouded by the overwhelming crash of reality.

My daughter will interrupt me at the strangest times (like while I'm dangling off a ladder or filthy mid-oil change) when I obviously can't play just to ask if I will. I love that, but then brain goes, ""if you say no - someday she won't ask you anymore.""

I wear my emotions on my sleeve and my wife reads my face easily with this. She seems the depression of the imperfect future wash over me and ruin good moments. I can't think of many times where this doesn't happen.

How do people do it? How do you ignore debt or politics - illness or death - or even just the simple knowledge that you children will age and someday have angst or lash at you - or even that if they don't some day they will grow away?

This compounds with anger. My daughters are very smart - yet they will somehow make a ridiculous messes while crafting (and leave it) or argue with each other and not separate, etc. I get livid. Particularly at their bedtime - fighting over who can spit in the sink first after brushing teeth -- or maybe not fighting but somehow playing with toothpaste or water and shrieking with laughter late and waking their infant brother (...even just the playing when they know to go to restroom, brush teeth, then join their mother and I to do bedtime things (stories, songs, tuck-in, etc.)).

Even on generally good behavior days somehow they always ruin it. I don't strike them but I have had some too-long/stern dressing downs about why can't we just have a good day AND a good night for once.

They're constantly praised by their mother and I when they do have good (school days, trips to store, outings to parks, playing nicely together at home, etc) days. Their 99% of the time punishment is a brief time out and having to explain of what they chose was a poor decision and how they could've made it better. ""Extremes"" are taking away toys or other play privileges for a period of time. They know how to behave - I just see it as extremely pointed when they (IMHO) choose - to not - even though I remember being a kid and forgetting stuff or being caught up in play with siblings and just not being perfect.

I don't know what to do. The combination of feeling angry at them and knowing they can do better and just don't care to invest the effort (even when knowing the upsetting effect it has on me when they misbehave so) with not being able to enjoy/savor the good moments is just depressing.

I don't need them growing to think all dad does is look sad even when playing or be mad/disappointed - but I also am trash-all for lying/hiding how I feel.

So - how do you so it? How do you enjoy something now/today and no let the overwhelm of knowing it will be gone destroy it?",19Aug2019,1

111,"I was thought of myself as a decent man, a ""good"" person. But I recently did something that made me question the person I thought I was.

I am a 20 year old college student and had quite a few drinks before this incident I am about to share, and a lot after. Me and my mates were on our way towards the bar when this girl with her group of friends stop my friend and begins flirting with him. After a while she asks about who we are. We head over and end up all having a few swigs out of a bottle of vodka, her and her other girl friend and my mates. The girl who was flirting with my mate redirects her attention to me and begins calling me beautiful. At this point she was sloppy drunk, I was just drunk. I start chatting her up and we sit on a bench. I get her number. I ask if she wants to make out and she doesn't object. I lean in for a kiss and she does too. We begin making out. After a while she heads back to her group of friends. Her guy friend comes over and chats us up for a bit. I say to him ""tell you friend I want to talk to her some more"". He goes and brings her over. I put my arm around her and say something like ""Let's go somewhere a bit more private."". I bring her to a around the corner to sit. We make out some more, and I touch her butt a little.

Afterwords, my mate told me I was being ""kind of creepy"", and I completely agree. The girl was clearly more intoxicated than I was, and in a vulnerable position. I took advantage of this. She probably would have made out with any dude in that state. I also said some extremely weird things like telling her about the lucrative career I was pursuing, attempting to impress her, and saying something along the lines of ""if you are ever in town, you should come to my place"".

Anyways later on in the night, I got black out drunk and ended up getting arrested, doing some extremely reckless and impulsive things, pretty out of character (mooning a security guard, running into the street with my shirt off, flagging down cars, screaming and yelling, running away from my friends who were chasing me), throwing things, getting pretty aggressive with my friends. I got black out drunk and really do not remember much. I also had several cuts and bruises on my body and a bloody ear, me and my friends have no clue where I got them from as they weren't their when they tried dropping me off home.

I am not trying to pull a coward move and avoid taking responsibility for my actions. But I recently began taking SSRI medication for anxiety. I was told to avoid drinking on them, and if I was going to then 1-2 drinks max. Apparently one of the side effects is ""pathological intoxication"" , ""when ordinary amounts of alchohal produce a much more pronounced effect or different effects then they normally would, ex. Being unusually violent, excessive drowsiness, gross impairment of judgement, attentions, and thinking. I don't know if this played a major role in my actions that night or I am just trying to be a little weasel and avoiding responsibility.

I don't know if I am a bad person, I feel like a piece of shit dirtbag. I have decided not to drink anymore. I have heard people say that drinking brings out your true self, I wonder if a weird creep is who I am. I always thought I was a good person, a respectable dude, a caring person. I have aspirations of going into a helping profession where a big part is dealing with vulnerable people. My actions that night have made me question all of this.",19Aug2019,0
113,"Okay here’s some background. My father moved up to a ranch in Idaho about a year ago. He and I don’t have the best relationship. He just doesn’t try. He moved with his new wife and step-son. 

I have a step sister (Ss) that’s the same age. We were best friends before the marriage and have had a rocky relationship. We had a mutual friend that I’ll call Brit. Brit was my best friend for like 2 years. She ended up cheating with my boyfriend. I did not find out for a year after we broke up (for unrelated reasons he was just a jerk) and during this time me and Brit were still friends. I found out on accident when my ex casually brought it up how he thought it was strange me and Brit were still friends. 

After I found out about the cheating my Ss still invited her over and would make me hang around her. For the rest of high school I had to hang out with this creature. I haven’t talked to Brit since graduation. 
 
Okay let’s get into the actual meat of the story. So basically my dad hasn’t invited me to come and see the ranch and has always favored his new wife and her children . He’s never invited me or my bio brother to this ranch. I haven’t seen him in a year. This past week I found out that that Brit went up to the ranch with my Ss and stayed there for a week. I’m pretty fucking pissed. I’m upset that she got to go before I did. I’m upset my Ss chose her over me and I’m upset my dad did nothing even though he knows this girl made my life absolute hell. 

So basically what I’m asking is should I confront my Ss or dad about this? Do I even have a right to be upset? Am I blowing this out of proportion?  I’m not sure what to do in thus situation.

124,"I'm new to this sub but thought this might be the best place to post my question. If possible I'd prefer a woman's opinion because of the nature of the question. In short I'm trying to see if there's something I'm missing that ""her"" below is saying.

Background: I've been texting tonight with a friend (who is married to one of my two best friends) and we're talking about how roughly 10 years ago I (32.m) had met a few ladies at parties hosted by her and her at the time boyfriend (now husband), and I struck up a short (1-2 months) relationship with two of those friends. I'm trying to understand what ""her"" below is saying/what she means, the transcription follows. Any parenthesis are my added word for clarity:


Her: Hahahaha nooo, I don't know a Caroline 
Me: Oh God then I have screwed up yet again. I was thinking that was the name of the girl from years ago at your house one night who smacked my butt during beer pong then we hung out a few times (this is 1 of the 2 women I met, but who's name I could not remember)
Her: Hahahahaha
Me: I feel like there are only two things I hate talking about with our group, cause I look back and feel embarrassed by both of them lol (or group consists of her and her husband as well as my other best friend and his wife)
Her: Naaaaa 
Me: Yeahhh. Cause I kinda feel like a womanizer when I think about it. 🤦
Her: You can't help that you're such a chick magnet 🤷🏼‍♀️
Me: Ohh that was a good one.. You've flattered me
Her: It is what it is 🤷🏼‍♀️🤣


In short my question is am I reading too much into what ""her"" is saying? Is she just being kind and saying some of her friends were attracted to me? Or is she hinting.

I know this is just a small snippet, if anyone needs to know more dynamics in order to give an opinion feel free to ask.",19Aug2019,1
125,"After high school, I had no idea what I wanted to do at all. I got an offer from a coach in my area asking to play lacrosse with a chance of obtaining a decent scholarship. Although money wasn't an issue while looking at colleges, it was a welcoming option. After a rocky high school experience, I was just glad to feel wanted at a school and prematurely decided to attend.

Very early on, I noticed that it was not the place for me. People there seemed... lame. After partying pretty heavily in high school I was under the notion that it would continue throughout college. Nobody wanted to go out. All my friends from high school were rushing frats and having a good time every weekend while I locked myself in my dorm room playing Forza. Outside of this I had an extremely hard time finding friends I truly connected with which was bizarre. I was very well liked in high school and known among my friends to be extroverted. I stayed there anyways, hoping something would maybe change.

Even though that all sucked, I do realize I still could have studied and at least progressed with the hopes of transferring somewhere for my second year but that option is off the table.

At this point I've spent my entire summer at home with my friends listening to them exchange insane stories and move forward in life and I've decided that I'm done sitting around.

My entire life I've been a ""gearhead"" and I want to pursue a high paying job in the automotive sector. My highly successful immigrant doctor parents are pretty fucking sick of my shit at this point but are semi willing to let me take my last shot at a higher form of education before fully kicking me out and cutting me off.

128,"Over the summer, I took a college class at my college for some easy credits. There was a cool girl who listened to all the same music as as me, and she would often jump into a conversation a friend and I would have. Since I'm introverted, I didn't talk to her but I would occasionally respond to something she would say. In total, we only talked for maybe 1 minute. Regardless, the day of finals I regretted not talking to her so I messaged her asking if she would ever want to hang out. 

She told me she was going on vacation and that she would be back on the 14th. I asked if she wanted to hang out when she came back and she replied with a ""yeah sounds good."" On the 16th, I messaged her ""Hey, how's it going"" so I could start a small convo and reaffirm the hangout. It's been 2-3 days and she hasn't responded. I'm not very social and I've never had a girlfriend, so I'm kinda freaking out and overthinking this. Which, you know, shame on me.

When I transferred to my new college I found out that everyone was really good. So I asked myself, why can they do it but not me? It's because they love what they are doing. Then how about me? I'm only at this course because it's computer-related. because I like games. My motives aren't pure and I've got no talent.

In the middle of it, in between standard happy pictures with uncles and aunts and kids, there were four or five loose shots of his sister, 5-8 years old then, close up, cramped and naked except for a pair of underpants. She was combing her hair or something in two of them and looking in the camera with kind of a deer in the headlights face, not doing much of anything in a bedroom on the floor. 

His half sister is a lot older than him, probably 40 now and even though their dad died several years ago she makes Facebook posts about missing him every four months or so.

He was extremely popular and he befriended loner kids who needed self-esteems boosts, like that was his reputation.

If I act like my normal self everyone is an asshole to me and tries to push me around.
If I act assertive i just end up feeling like an asshole for constantly having to throw people's shit back at them and this ends up with arguments, and when in these arguments people see that I'm worked up and guess what, start acting like assholes to me.

So a bit over a month in I was really falling for the guy despite his wishes to keep it casual (which I only found out after two weeks of being doe eyed at him, but you know, I don't need anything serious being intimate and just dating him was great). And now he's apparently going through a bout of depression that's left him feeling like he doesn't want to speak to me or anyone until he feels better. And you know, I've been there, I get it. So I backed off. But like, everytime he sees my social media stories it feels like I'm being ripped open. I feel like he's never going to speak to me again, and I should move on so I'm trying to see other people. It's just like seeing the world in black and white after seeing in technicolor. And I don't even understand it because not a single date with him was any good, he wasn't very compassionate, and I ended up paying every time. He hasn't once thought about me. But the second I saw him I just thought if I never heard from him again I'd never be satisfied and I have no idea why my brain has latched onto this guy. I guess it was love at first sight but that sounds absurd. How do you get over something so terribly nonsensical as stubborn feelings/heart break like this? Any coping mechanisms would be appreciated.",19Aug2019,1
137,"I’m 20 and I just moved 2 hours from home to go to college. I moved from a place I have lived all my life to a place I’ve been to once. 

After my parents moved me in I started to realize that I maybe couldn’t do this. I’ve always been a very anxious person and have always needed proper routine and structure. I had a minimum wage job I really liked and good core group of friends and was super close with my family. But now since I moved here I’ve had none of this. It’s only been 2 days but I feel like pure shit and I just want to go home. I’ve called my mom crying. I don’t know if I can do this or not. I don’t know if this is what I even want to do anymore.

138,"Earlier today, I (M17) went to Universal with two friends. I’ll call the other boy there Ed and the girl Rachel (We’re all 17 but I’m the youngest). It’s about 6 o’clock and we decide to go see a movie on city walk. We decide on that new Dora movie (highly recommend btw). We get into the theater, get snacks, sit down, etc. (I’m sitting in the middle, Rachel on my left, and Ed on my right)

I’ve liked Rachel for a while (She’s known that I’ve liked her) but I’ve never really known how to approach the situation because we’re always playfully mean to each other and whenever we’re nice it’s awkward. Anyway, she grabbed an extra straw and we share a soda. I’ll skip to where I think I messed up. I’d say it was an hour into the movie and I start inching my hand closer to Rachel’s leg. I get my whole hand on her leg and it’s there for I’d say a minute or two. Then she got up and went to the bathroom. She came back 15 minutes later just saying she got lost and when she sat back down she moved almost as far left in her seat as she could (so I couldn’t put my hand back). The rest of the movie played out and then we walked to the parking lot. After the movie she acted normal  but I still think I messed something up and am asking for advice.

My questions is should I do this and pursue a bachelors after (not sure what tbh).

To keep a long story short, I'm a debt free college kid paying 100% of my own tuition and rent during the school year.

What I really need to know is how I should start planning for this now. How do I become an ""independent""?

I wasn’t entirely too sure where to post this but I’m guessing here is the best place for advice. 

I’ve been with my (ex) partner for over 3 years and I have messed up badly for my own selfish reasons. So we have been talking for awhile again. I’ve done a lot of shitty things and so I’ve been trying to fix it all/ deal with it. I haven’t done anything wrong for quite awhile now and I’m still learning how to become a better person. The only issue is dealing with my own consequences from previous mistakes. I can completely understand how hurt my ex is and I can do everything I can to make her feel comfortable and understand where she’s coming from. I know everyone around me and my ex judges me/hate me which is fine as long as I’m able to change my behaviour because I have been doing everything differently. I still have her friends who I barely talk to or know talk about how much I fucked up. My ex still lashes out on me randomly even though I haven’t done anything. I just let it go because I think I deserve it for what I’ve done. 

My question is as the title says. How do I change as a person while dealing with judgement and consequences? It currently feels like I’m being kicked every time I try to get my feet back up. I’m trying very hard and it feels very exhausting to ignore it all.",19Aug2019,1

157,"I've asked everyone in my personal life, now it's time to go to Reddit for some advice.

Men of Reddit, there is this girl that for some reason, I cannot get off my mind, and it's been this way for over 4 months. Let's just call her, Abby. So Abby and I work for in different cities, and one week I was transferred and I ended up working with her. Immediately I could not get over her and just was excited to see her at work, and it was enjoyable for me. I see her for a week and I go back to my work and think nothing of it. A couple weeks later a co-worker and I volunteer for this event and on the first day I saw Abby there again. I'm genuinely excited and nervous to see her again. We naturally get to talking again as the event goes by and on the first day she asks for my number because she doesn't know anyone else at the event and I naturally give her my number. The first day of the event ends and I ask a couple people if they wanna get drinks and she agrees and the others end up leaving as they have other things to do. We go and get drinks and we talk until the place closes and she drives me home. ( I had taken public transit to get to the event as driving there is just a pain and takes the same amount of time as transit) We talk the whole drive back and we have a really good night. We talk through the event and as the third night of the event ends, everyone is drinking and having fun, There was this girl that recognized me from earlier in the day, and she talks to me for a few moments and then say we should go get some food sometime. I say maybe and she says "" will this change your mind"" and kisses me. I push her away but Abby does see this happen. We go and she leaves with her ex and gets a ride as we had all been drinking. Then ends up sleeping at her ex's house ( she had already told me and they are friends previously), I'm not too bothered as I am friends with some of my ex's as well. The next morning she is avoiding me and talking less and less. I had messaged her late last night asking if we can talk so I can explain myself and maybe tell her if didn't mean anything but she doesn't reply to my message. I message her after the event ends asking her if she's well.... Nothing, crickets. I message her about a week or two later and the same thing, nothing. At this point, someone close and dear told me that she did like me and had a crush on me. I don't know what I did that made her do something. I'm not sure if something happened on the third night between her and the ex. But I am kinda at a loss Reddit, did I screw up, or is she just not interested in me anymore. I cannot get her out of my head and I do not know why. I messaged her saying if i did something I am sorry. It's been about 4 months I've seen her once since then, and I don't think she will be talking to me. I did not message her everyday and I felt I waited enough time and spaced out the messages by a couple weeks at a time. Do I just forget about it Reddit or what? What do y'all think happened the night she stayed at her ex's. Or do you think I fucked my own chances and i just have to live with it.

I met this girl, we've been talking for a bit and we get along at this event we're both working. One of the nights we go out for drinks and talking and we hit it off. A drunk girl kisses me day 3 of the event the girl sees this happen.  The same night she stays over at her ex's house the night.

162,"my moms gotten pretty sick again and she’s gone to the hospital twice now this last month, and honestly for a younger person like me it’s an emotional rollercoaster. On one hand your worried and scared, then the next minute your sad and trying to hold back tears, then your tired or cranky. And even worse it’s not just the hospital visits, it’s the anxiety you feel when your not in the hospital that something could go wrong, and the guilt that sets in when your not spending time with mom.

I could go on and on, but yeah I’ve already gone with her to the hospital at least 3 times this year, and gone with her to her follow up appointment several times. It may not seem like much but the emotional rollercoaster hits me hard, and the long painful dread and guilt afterwards that stays for months. It’s even worse these last few appointment visits because the doctors can’t find anything wrong with her, they even tried CT scans, bloodwork, cat scans, they couldn’t find anything and had to send her back home.

To summarize, I did not apply to college at the same time everyone else did because I genuinely did not believe I was smart enough to get in any 4 year institution. When I did get in, I got waitlisted for a dorm room. Recently, one of my moms girlfriends just paid for her sons dorm and my parents were furious with me for “not telling them about my dorm” even though I’ve been on this waitlist the entire summer. Also side note, my parents were not trying to hear of the possibility of me not living on the school campus and my mom got very angry with me when I mentioned that as a possibility once. Because of this, I never looked into the possibility of not getting a dorm. Well, lo and behold, I will not be getting a dorm this semester on campus because there is no space.  However, there existed about off campus dorm style apartment type housing, but because my parents drilled into my head that they don’t want to hear about “me not getting a dorm” I never discovered this until it was too late. I’ve called 3 different off campus apartment facilities and they’re all full and they all have waitlists. The last one I called said they had a waitlist but the numbers were going down but it’s obviously not guaranteed at this point. I start classes tomorrow and I am extremely upset and stressed about this situation. Also, I have really bad anxiety and social anxiety which isn’t helping the situation either. Also, I feel like I can’t talk to my friends about this either because in the last when I’ve brought this up, it just feels like they were judging me. “You should’ve done this and that earlier, oh well.” I know.

172," 

So a bit of background - I’ve known my room mate (let’s call her AT) for about 10 years now. We were friends in College and we are both adults with decent paying jobs now. About 2 years ago we rented a place (with 2 other people). I like to cook and bake a fair bit. Sometimes I like to take some baking into work, so package it up. The general rule I had laid, is that if the baking is in a package, it’s not for sharing (with the room mates). I usually put some spares on a plate (which is considered free to all). I also have very specific allergies to foods, so the food I cook/bake is not exactly cheap.

A few months ago, I’d laid out some baking on a plate and packaged some in a box to take to work. The other room mates had finished what was on the plate, and I got up to get a drink at night. AT was chewing something, wouldn’t speak, and there was the distinct smell of my baking in the room. I also noticed that there was a piece missing from the packaged box. I figured she’d taken one from the box, thinking I wouldn’t notice. I didn’t want to make a big deal out of it, so I just let it slide.

Fast forward to last night, I was baking again. She came over and took one straight off the tray (they were still cooling), and I asked what she was doing. AT just replied “stealing” and I asked her not to. She waits for me to turn around (I was doing some washing up) and she just grabs another one. I snapped at her, because I had just asked her not to. And her response was pretty pitiful - something about how she’s on a diet, and when she’s on a diet she just wants to eat everything. And after I told her she needs to have some self control, AT’s response was along the lines of yeah, I don’t have self control. I told her she needs to do something about that.  

I don’t understand how someone can just be so disrespectful and have no shame? But a more important question, how do I get her to stop taking my food? I have, in the past, given her recipes and told her she can easily make it herself (the recipes are not particularly complex), to which she responds that food tastes better when someone else makes it.  She seems to have no self control, and does not respect boundaries at all.  She also seems to have no shame.

Any advice on how to get her to stop stealing my food?",19Aug2019,1
173,"I'm the president of a college club and I've taken it upon myself to work on getting a new logo for our group. I've been working with a graphic designer (who also happens to be a friend) for the past few months and we've finally settled on a design. Along the way, I've been sending updates to the group and asking for their thoughts so it hasn't just been me. 

Some context: Before being president, I managed our social media, created flyers, and redesigned our entire website, tasks I still do now. I'm not going to pretend to be humble about it, I know I'm creative and have an eye for design (especially since the design has a lot to do with what I am studying).

When I presented the final draft, one member suggested an additional feature of a drop shadow and everyone else chimed in saying it sounded like a good idea. Mind you, this has been months and we finally have a final design, it's not the time to add new things. I was hesitant but mocked it up myself since it was easy to add. I still like the original final design more but everyone else seems to really like the drop shadow. I think a simpler design is always better, especially when it comes to multiple colors. I also just foresee issues with it when it comes to formatting on the website, flyers, and t-shirts (extra cost for multiple colors). It looks cool when you're just looking at it but it’s not functional for a logo. I think the simpler one pops more, is more timeless, more professional, and is easier to work with. I suggested that we can always add drop shadows to specific flyers or whatnot but as an official logo, I think it would just be a headache to work with and not look as good. 

As the only person in the group who has been creating our flyers, maintaining our social media, and designing our website, I feel I should have some authority over the design since I’ll be working with it *and* this has been my passion project. 

Now, one person wants to vote on it but I know they'll outvote me. What do I do? Can I say that it has to be unanimous? Do I enact an executive decision and be disliked for it/seen as controlling (is that even fair of me?). Or do I accept the bad design and in doing so sacrifice my own feelings and the betterment of the group. What's my role as president and the head of this project in this situation?",19Aug2019,1

176,"Help! I went to see a movie but forgot to lock my room, and my sister got into my things. I know she saw my sex toys because they have all been moved around!

My little sister is twelve, she hasn't said anything to me or my parents yet. I think maybe she would have no idea what a didlo or a fleshlight is, but she has free reign on the internet and probably knows more than she should about sexuality.

I'm afraid she's going to tell my parents what she saw, she likes to cause drama, and I haven't come out as bisexual to my parents yet. My mom would freak out if she knew, she's a christian and would think I'm going to hell and think I'm disgusting. My dad probably wouldn't care, he already suspects.

177,"Hi everyone. 
I'm going to try to take my biases out of this as best as I can (please call me out or or ask for clarification if needed). 
I've been seeing this girl, let's say Kate, for almost a year. She moved to the east coast to follow her job and my plan is to move within the year. She and I were in the same city for the first 6 months of dating, living together for the last 2 of those 6 (she was about to move and didn't want to sign an odd 2 month lease so I offered her my place). 
Since she's moved, our communication has been different, resulting in a lot more fighting and crying than either of us would like. I try to see her every month and have flown out 6-7 times. I'm more of an in-person guy and try to enjoy those moments instead of texting/calling. She is the opposite. She has flown back once (on my dime). But, she prefers nightly phone calls, 1 hour+, and texts throughout the day. 
I do enjoy talking to her, but not to this extent; resulting in, as I feel, the same conversation daily (hey. /hey. How was work? /good, you? Etc). Our most recent fight was tonight with me not calling her Friday (I was on a 4 hour drive with a friend to go to a wedding and my phone died). 
I've expressed that I do not like how little she has come to see me, to which she has ""shrugged off"" as my job has paid for some of the flights. 
She repeats that I do not care enough to want to talk to her every night. 
Am I thinking of this wrong? Should I be talking more? Is she in the wrong? Besides just telling the other how they feel, is there a way to step into the others shoes that you know of?",19Aug2019,1
178,"Situation: I am a young adult living in Cleveland, Ohio and my mother recently (and very suddenly) fell very ill after having some serious issues with her brain. They said that she will likely be out of work for 1 year minimum, but we aren’t certain she will ever actually be able to go back. She had numerous surgeries on her brain and has now been in the hospital for over a month. To give you an idea about the extent of her situation, she has to learn how to read, write, count money, walk, feed herself, and go to the bathroom on her own all over again. She is getting good at general communication again as long as you speak slowly and in short sentences/phrases. She gets confused easily since her brain processes things differently now. She probably won’t be able to drive herself for more than a year, minimum. I am on FMLA right now, but running out of time to figure out a long term care plan for her.

Question: If she gets on disability, is there a way for me (no medical experience or anything like that) to just quit my full-time job and become her full-time caretaker while also somehow getting paid to do so? She obviously won’t be able to afford to pay me, but it seems like there should be something I can apply for or something we can file that allows me to become a full-time caregiver for her and receive a check from the government without leaving me broke and unable to pay all of my own bills? I don’t make much now and I can’t imagine I’d make much doing this, but I’d rather be the one caring for her than someone else.

181,"Hi everyone, 

I hope this is allowed, and please be nice.

So basically my friend (21F) and I (21F) are in university. Last year we took a class together and it was fine. She was in a bad place (she disclosed later) at the time and i was just trying to be supportive. I am in psychology (entering 3 year) and love it, I’m getting As and working hard/established a good routine last year to get an 80%+ average. 

Last school year I was alone in all my classes expect the one I had with her and I made a friend/friends in my other classes. I liked this distance I had because I felt like I was being my own person and had my own routines+I had a part time job with a lot of people my age. 

This summer she decided she is switching into my program and a part of me felt annoyed when she started trying to plan classes together/doesn’t want to take a class because I’m not taking it (it’s a harder science psych class tho so it’s understandable I guess). Idk why I’m so annoyed because I feel like I should be supportive and like I’m being a bad friend. I try to be supportive to her, but there’s something inside of me that’s annoyed.

We now have two classes together each semester out of the four I’m taking. I’m excited but also kind of annoyed because I have my own systems and don’t want to be bothered I guess. Idk, this all seems immature but also I feel like my feeling are valid because of the last class we took together I sent her my lab before she started hers and she did better than me on it (because I freaking wrote the whole beginning). 

So anyway, I guess I’m just looking for validation in feeling annoyed and advice on how to move forward. I am really excited for the school year to work part time, move out, eat healthier, workout, do well in school and just focus on myself, but I still feel a tinge of annoyance. Anyone have advice or a similar situation?",19Aug2019,1

188,"I’m 20 and I met a guy (25) while travelling. It was a fling but we both seemed really into each other and we’d go out of our way to meet each other. His English wasn’t the best but it was good enough for us to talk. 

I was a virgin and I’ve never had a boyfriend before (I had so much fun acting all coupley with him) and on my last night I decided I wanted to lose it with him (I didn’t tell him I was a virgin though, just super inexperienced. I was very serious about condoms and we went to the store to buy some. I’m very paranoid so I even told him to make sure to not take the condom off. 

The sex goes seemingly good until he finishes INSIDE ME and I realize the condom is nowhere to be found. I ask him what happened and he says he took it off as if it’s no big deal. I immediately started crying and yelling and calling him a rapist. He did get me plan b the next morning at least. (I’ve also had STD tests since then). 

This happened almost two months ago and I just can’t stop thinking about it. I keep feeling stupid sometimes like I overreacted. He did seem really sorry when I called him out but kept defending himself saying he’s not a rapist. We talked a bit since then and recently I messaged him saying I still feel really shitty about it and he told me he’s sorry and he knows it’s his fault but we both need to get over it and that he doesn’t want this to continue and then he said he still thinks of our good memories and misses me. He also recently changed his relationship status from single to in a relationship. 

I don’t even know why but I just feel so hurt by everything. It kills me how he doesn’t even care that much what happened and he obviously doesn’t care much about me. I guess when I messaged him I was expecting him to be sad over what happened. I’ve never felt so sad and confused about anything and everyone I’ve talked to feels like I should be over this and I literally have no one to talk to about it anymore. I want to tell my mom about it but I don’t know if it’s a good idea to tell a parent. This whole thing also made me feel so disposable, as if I’ll never mean anything to a guy. Is it normal to be this upset over it? I feel like I’m in pain when I think of it. I’m also having trouble telling if I’m upset because I liked him and I’m sad that it’s over or if I’m upset over the fact that my body was violated. What do you guys think? 

I still think about the guy a lot and then I feel stupid for missing someone who hurt me like this. We didn’t even know each other that well and I still feel so attached to him. Sometimes I even feel like I was too hard on him when I freaked out over what happened, I said a lot of hurtful things to him. He looked so sad when I was yelling at him and it makes me feel bad for him. I keep thinking that maybe he’s just stupid and really didn’t know that what he did was so wrong. Or maybe he was having trouble staying hard with a condom and he was too embarrassed to tell me. I feel like I’m having trouble accepting that it’s over and I need to let go of what happened but I don’t know how.

ALSO, is it possible he thought this was okay to do because he’s from a different country with a different culture? I understand cultural differences and I know rape culture is much more common is certain countries but I don’t understand how he could possibly think it’s okay to do that. 

I’m sorry this post I so long but I really need any advice I can get, it’s really helpful to have people to talk to about it.

204,"So next week I'm going to be moving into my college dorm room as a 3rd year in college. Our room has 2 single bedrooms and one double bedroom. The issue lies within deciding who gets which room. 

My roommates are a good friend of mine, an okay acquaintance, and an exchange student who I've never met nor talked to (I don't even know their name). My friend and I couldn't find anyone to live with, which is why they had to randomly assign two others to live with us. The exchange student is a new student, and so my friend, the acquaintance, and I decided that we should split the two singles among the three of us, since singles are objectively a better living situation (I know it's a little coldhearted to this new person, but we don't even have a way to contact her and upperclassmen get rooming priority anyways at our uni).

My friend had a tough living situation last year, so the two of us decided to give her one of the singles. I was ready to just flip a coin for the remaining one, but the acquaintance didn't want to decide right away and thought it would be better to put it off (I don't get this, but whatever). 

Now it's a week left before school starts and we still haven't decided anything, which is making me quite stressed. I had bad roommate experiences these past two years, and I'm really dreading the thought of sharing a room with someone again. Furthermore, I'm gay and in the closet. If I come out I don't know how this mystery person will react, and knowing myself I'll probably just stay in the closet for another year rather than tell this exchange student. For this and other reasons, I really want a single.

I'm going to be the first to arrive to the dorms next week out of my friend, the acquaintance, and I. Last year, one of my roommates arrived first, noticed there was a bedroom that was WAY bigger, and obviously just took that for herself without consulting. This is generally the trend that happens with rooms (however less so when it involves roommates). It crossed my mind that I could just walk in and move into this single and be done with it. After all this acquaintance hasn't reached out and has put this off for long enough. However, I acknowledge this is an asshole move. What further complicates it is that this exchange student is probably going to moved-in somewhere (one of the singles, if I had to guess). I'm probably going to be the one to ask her to move into the double (again, I feel terrible, but this was decided months ago by the three of us), but I should probably have a clear plan that represents all of us before asking her to move.

I want this single room, but I acknowledge I don't have more right to it than my acquaintance. My friend is kind of leaving me in the blue for this whole thing, which is making me even more stressed since I'd be fine if she'd consider living with me in the double. 

Should I be an asshole and just take this single room? After all I'm going to have the chance when I'm moving in to decide, and I have a number of reasons why it's better (albeit selfish reasons). If the acquaintance reaches out before then, I'll obviously respond and respect her wishes, but if not, I've got to move in somewhere, right?

Or should I do the right thing, reach out to this person, and possibly suffer for an entire year? It could end up fine living with this person, but my anxiety and past experiences is making this seem like a nightmare. I don't know what I would even say to her or how to figure out who gets the room if I do reach out.",19Aug2019,1

211,"Oof. This is a very complicated situation I am in. Before my husband died he asked me to keep a certain gun ( that I had bought him as an engagement gift ) and give it to his son when his son reaches of age. ( So 9 years from now )

This was my husbands favorite gun and very special to him. It is not worth much, around $500 at the highest end.. and I have sunk a lot of money into the gun since I had to replace the magazine a police officer ""lost"" when he decided to illegally seize my guns a couple years ago. 

His son has also inherited an UZI ( another type of gun ) a very nice one at that, his fathers bone carved handle knife, his fathers bible he had in jail and a ton of other personal items I gave to the family after my husband passed.

Some shit went down with the sheriff's department and as a cover up I was arrested for first degree murder of my husband. Even though there was no logical way of that even being a possibility you would be surprised what the sheriff's department can come up with to make you look like satan himself. So the detective that decided to try to fuck up my life called my husbands mom before I was arrested and told her this crazy bullshit story about how I murdered her son. Insane. But he is an amazing liar. All detectives are. So the dumb cunt believes him and decides to cut off all communication I have with his children, that are still under 18. 

I got a good lawyer that basically told the sheriffs department that if we went to trial this would end badly for them since all the illegal shit they did. So they settled on some bullshit felony for 5 years since I didn't feel like going to trial. ( lots of reasons why but that doesn't have much to do with this ) 

Anyways, as you can imagine, bail, lawyer fees, court fees and probation plus my other regular bills have completely decimated my savings. I am trying to get a job but being a ""felon"" I am having a difficult time getting a job. I have sold everything I have to keep paying the bills  and now I have nothing left. My truck needs new tires and brakes and it is essential that I have that if I'm going to get a job. 

I don't know what else to do. I feel like I do not have any other way. I am dealing with so much ( also just had my identity stolen and my credit cards have been effected by fraud and dealing with that ).

I feel like if I sell the gun I'm going to regret it after I get a job since it is not worth much money and my husband requested me to give the gun to his son when his son becomes 18. But at the same time my truck insurance is up, my tag sticker is due and I need reliable tires if I am going to have a job. 

His son has already received a lot of items of his late father and does not know about this gun. Also I do not have contact with him since my husbands mother is a daft cow. After my probation is over I plan to write a letter when his son is of age and tell him what really happened to his father.  

I feel torn. I am completely out of money and am in an emergancy situation. But the gun is only going to bring in a couple hundred. Is it worth selling to get reliable tires for my vehicle and the possibility of feeling regret later on when I am financially stable? My husband meant everything to me. I plan to save as much money as I can for his children when I get a job because my husband didn't wanted to leave his children with nothing and wanted me to get life insurance on him but at the time I could not afford to..  ( We discussed his wishes because he was dying of an autoimmune disease, but he was actually murdered ).

( also, since I am a felon I do not keep the gun at my residence ofcourse. And the dude that actually murdered my husband died like 2 months ago, no idea how, I didn't look into it. I would say karma is a bitch but I'm trying not to be a toxic vindictive asshole. )",19Aug2019,0
212,"Hi....so I've been dating this person for 5 years.

We are each other's first serious relationship - We are in our 20's. I have a good job, real estate property. 

He has talked to me how much he wants to marry me and live with me. Apparently the the 'proposal' thing is coming.

&amp;#x200B;

I only see him on weekends - usually 1 day per week. Problem is we often don't get to do something fun because he wants to have sex. I enjoy it but I sometimes feel used. And like it is a waste of a day because we end up lounging around clean up, eat food then get ready (late in the day for activities). 

&amp;#x200B;

I tell him I want to move in together (he has asked me several times in the past but he couldn't support me financially so I said no) ...now I feel ready but I feel there is hesitation since he makes excuses of things he needs to do example - he will have less storage space. I feel that he is not sure about me - he treats me ok - he has a temper (never hurt me physically) but he can be scary when I push his buttons. I feel he has over time started to treat me less well...is this normal? He gets mad more often almost like he doesn't want to take 'my sarcasm' anymore - jokes that he would love to be with a girl more nurturing and sweet. This year, I asked him am I your rock? And he said not really, I usually talk to my friends - apparently because he doesn't talk to me about things that bother him...I was pissed about it. He later apologized and said I was his best friend. To me, if I am to consider being his wife...shouldn't we be each other's #1?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not a saint. I can drive him nuts too. I can be particular... not exactly OCD...if he doesn't do things fast, I will help him to get it done. Or perhaps ill even do it myself. I like things clean? Is that a crime? .....I push him, encourage him to use his skills and become an entrepreneur like he dreams of but he says I lecture him... I don't ever want to be his 'mom', so I stopped. He has a decent job but I know he wants more. 

&amp;#x200B;

I get the feeling we are not on the same page...even though he says he is. We have very similar morals but very different interests like music - he dislikes mine so we can never connect on that level. Am I wrong to be worried about my relationship? Help me out.",19Aug2019,5
213,"So, I’ve lately just been super down and really unhappy with myself. I hate my face, my body and just me in general. I made a post on r/rant on my main account about how I’ve really upset lately and how I can’t deal with it. On the post specifically I went into details about how my mom/dad put too much pressure on me and how it was starting to get to me. Well, my best friend found my Reddit account (I use the same username for every platform) and she saw my post. We were on FaceTime at the time and she started laughing while reading it aloud. It made me really embarrassed and she told me that I wasn’t being physically abused or anything, so I don’t have the right to complain. I made some bullshit story up that ‘oh I’m okay now, I was just ranting about some little thing my mom did’. Anyways, the other night I was crying because my boyfriend broke up with me and that sort of stuff. My mom came into my room and saw me crying, which pissed her off for whatever reason.

216,"(Just to add as a back story. My sister is a very rude and entitled person. She doesn't see anytime where she's wrong and treats everyone around her like scum. I strongly dislike her and then she started dating my best friend)

My sister, her boyfriend and myself used to be fairly close. I still hung out with my sister and her bf as much as possible but they also moved away to school. Then I met my boyfriend, he was going through a lot a personal issues at home and I had just gotten diagnosis with severe depression so we were together all the time trying to support eachother. 

Anytime my sister and her bf came over we would all hang out and have tons of fun it was like that for a month until my sister and her boyfriend sat me down and told me how much they dislike my boyfriend. At this time, I was pretty sure I loved him so I got really upset hearing all this negative stuff about him. I never said anything back to them because I knew it would make me more upset.

They morning after they told me they didn't like him, they became complete jackasses. Would never say hi to us when coming over and then the started to pick so many fights with us. Got to the point where both my bf and I said f-you guys and we separated ourselves from them. 

They started talking bad about me to some of their friends and saying that since I met my boyfriend I'm completely different.

 (I've been dealing with my mental illness with my boyfriend, nobody in my family has tried to check up or take in mind that the times where I ignore everyone's phone call is  because I'm trying to be a bitch. It's cause I don't have the strength to answer the damn phone. I try my very best to see everyone as much as I can)

They recently got engaged. They're both 19, broke up for two weeks, she's cheated on him, and they've only been dating for 11 months. 
However I keep saying of she's happy she's happy, there's nothing for me to say. It's not my place.

She asked me to be a bridesmaid, and I was very hesitant. Her and I barely talk now, she still treats us like crap and she was talking about how she wanted to leave him two months ago. So my reaction, was definitely not the one she wanted. I physically cringed. I said sorry for my reaction later on and said I was just super surprised to be honest.

Then she asked me to be a bridesmaid, while she was drunk and at a party. So I made the joke of me being the flower girl. I said it as a joke and every one around me knew that but she thought I was being snotty and rude.

Her wedding is in two years and she's already has us trying on bridesmaids dresses. I said that I wasn't sure how I was gonna make it there because bi didn't have a car and then she sent me a big message saying ""you know, if you don't want to be a bridesmaid then you don't have to, not trying to be rude I know it's expensive, it's just, if you don't want to be I need to know because I'll need to find somebody else.

I want to be a bridesmaid for my sister, I know that way in the future our bond won't be the way it is now. So I know it's an important day for her but I can't help but still dislike her after everything and on top of that she still treats is like crap!

My family is really close so I know that if all my other sister are in the wedding and not myself, it's not gonna go over well.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a recent college grad with a degree in a pretty competitive field that I grew to hate during college. I have no desire to go into the industry and the mere thought of applying for positions stresses me out because its the type of work where if you don't love it, you won't make it. Little pay and long hours that are done by those who are dedicated and love their work, and I unfortunately don't fall under that umbrella. The kicker is my parents paid a lot of money to put me through school for this degree, so I feel like I owe it to them to try and be part of it even though I know I'll be miserable. I don't feel like I can talk to them about it, and my mom is constantly shoving applications at me and all it makes me want to do is cry. She is so proud that I ""found what I wanted"" so early and was set on doing it, I don't have the heart to tell her that it makes me want to die when I think about actually trying to do it for a living. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a job currently, not exactly what my degree was for but similar, and it makes me absolutely miserable. Its boring, I have no say in anything that I do and its not at all what I was told it would be like in the interview. I don't have any friends at work and none of my coworkers want to spend time together outside of work, we all just show up, work, and then leave. I just don't really know what to do at this point. I have no idea what kind of job I want to pursue, I don't want to have to move back home because I know my mom will just hound me endlessly about applications and why I haven't found something I like yet, or worse why I keep getting rejected. I obviously need to do *something* to be able to afford housing and food, I just don't know how to branch out my options when the one thing I thought I would love to do turned into something I hate while going to school for it.

at my daughters schools from 8th -10th grade, in PE she attends the swim unit and boys and girls have it together? Why is this allowed? Wouldn't this make girls feel uncomfortable and give immature boys an opportunity to harass and humiliate girls? And cause distractions and goofing off among everyday? Not to mention young boys will be shirtless around young girls and I think that is inappropriate especially in a school setting My daughter keeps saying she does not care but she is young and may not understand how wrong this is this just seems wrong especially at school. Swimsuits are revealing clothing, there is a reason they have swimsuit competitions and forcing girls to  have to parade themselves in swimsuits in front boys is wrong.

All managers have to be available for all shifts and have to especially be at work on high volume days, meaning Friday-Sunday.

I have two school-aged kids and would love to have Sundays off to spend with them, but alas it’s not in the cards.  My assistant and I have always worked half days on Sundays and alternates who opens and who closes so we can both enjoy some of the day off.  

Also, 

I have a new boss that started 8 months ago that doesn’t always go by the rules.  

My assistant manager quit about a month ago and my boss hired his replacement two weeks ago and he is now working for me but under the expectation that he will not be working Sundays because he likes to spend the day with his girlfriend.  

I find this to be intolerable, but tried to talk to him about it and he was adamant that he must have the day off and he already has permission.   I already know my boss will be dismissive and ask me to work it out with him.

239,"Hello guys :)

So I'm [20/f] a really lonely person and I think about why this is a lot and it seems to me like I literally push away every single person in my life no matter who they are.


I've always had social anxiety and been shy every since I can remember but I had friends when I was younger. In middle school I stopped talking to all of them for seemingly no reason. I even switched schools in 8th grade. At that school I made only 1 friend even though other people tried to be friends with me. I'm still friends with this girl to this day even tho its been 6-7 years and I feel myself pushing her away these past few weeks like not returning texts or calls, I was even supposed to visit her and didn't.
I had this other girl I was friends with and she blocked me because I was being distant and I just let her go and we're not friends anymore.



The first two years of high school I was homeschooled, maybe I subconsciously wanted to be in an isolated environment? The last two years I went to public school and made friends with this one girl who was also friendless but I'm not sure if it even classifies as friendship.



After high school I lived with my cousins for 5 months. I was literally LIVING with them and I didn't form any sort of connection. It's not that I don't like them I would have loved to be friends and form a bond but something in me blocks me from doing so.
I had this one guy try to date me and I ghosted him after a few dates.




Then another guy came along and I was starting to fall hard for him and then I broke up with him through text out of the blue which now I regret but I feel like I kind of damaged the relationship and it wont be the same.



Even my family. I live with them but I don't talk to them. I don't tell them about my life, my hopes and dreams, I don't bring my problems to them or ask them for help. I just keep everything inside. This guy that I almost dated was really trying to get to know me and I just didn't want to open up to him. I remember thinking to myself ""I don't want you to know me.""


Wtf is wrong with me? Being this alone causes me a lot of depression and its been getting worse lately. I'm scared that if this gets worse its gonna get really hard for me to go on and I just wanna be ok and be a good person and live a good life.
Any advice is really appreciated! :)

251,"Hi r/Advice, I’m sure this isn’t an uncommon question but I feel if I can ask it in my own words the answer will mean more to me. Sorry for the incoming essay.

I’m not pleased with my life, social and work, and I don’t feel like I’m progressing as a person. I’m 21, I know I’ve got a lot of time and a long way to go. But I also know that if I change nothing I’m going to become increasingly apathetic.

I live on my own, have my own car, and generally pay for my own things. Truthfully, the living situation is luck in that I have a good friend as a roommate and rent is extremely affordable. The car was a birthday present, so I didn’t necessarily earn that. I pay for my car insurance, I don’t pay for my phone bill. 

I dropped out of college because I couldn’t motivate myself to get out of bed. I beat myself up all the time because of that. I do want to go to school but I don’t have the mental capacity for it now.

So now I work construction, which is hard on my body. It’s almost been two years and I still come home every day exhausted. It’s full time, and my boss would work with me if I were to go back to school.

————

Here’s my problem. I work all week, barely get enough sleep for it, and truthfully it’s not that strenuous. I just stay up playing video games too late. I have no savings, and I spend my money very unwisely. I don’t make time time for the important people in my life.

My girlfriend is a godsend of a person, truly the antithesis of me. Caring and uplifting, she’s extraordinarily patient with me. I can’t make myself leave the house most of the time to see her, and I can’t figure out why. I genuinely enjoy spending time with her, but I just can’t make myself go to her.

I would love to have some explainable condition that I can cope with. I’m depressed, or bipolar, or attention deficienct. Not because I want those problems, but because I could cope with them, relate to others, and figure out a strategy to overcome them. 

As of now, I can only describe my self as selfish and lazy. And I don’t know how to change that. I’ve tried changing parts of my life and they never TRULY stick, even if I did it for several months or a year. I’ve always regressed.

Long story short: my father passed away just before Thanksgiving this year. He had been battling a really rare autoimmune disease, which resulted in liver failure. He was on a transplant list at one of the top liver transplant hospitals and we finally got the call that he was high enough on the list to go to the hospital. He was admitted and waiting for his surgery when he contracted Corona virus, which turned into Pneumonia. They couldn’t do the surgery until he could breathe on his own. We were at the hospital for about a month trying to clear the Pneumonia, when his body went into sepsis (his organs decided to shut down) and within two days, he died. It was absolutely devastating and our family and entire community is in complete shock. 

He was an Emergency Physician, literally saving lives every day, and professor for over 30 years. Among the many other things he did for his community and the hospital, he always put family first, which can be unusual in the competitive academic sphere of Western Medicine. He was an incredibly special and wonderful person, with an amazing sense of humor and a genuine deep care for humanity. He celebrated his 52nd birthday while we were in the hospital. I know everyone says this, but it feels so unfair and far too soon.

That being said, I was looking through the bag he had with him while we were in the hospital. He had written my mom a beautiful poem on his phone but started to get more delirious and couldn’t look at devices without falling asleep. I found a notebook where he had started an outline of a letter addressed to my brother and I. Not only did he have doctor (read: horrible) handwriting, he became too sick to write clearly and never had the chance to finish it. Some of the words literally fall off the page. I miss him so much and I just want to know what his final words to me would have been. Thank you for reading.",19Aug2019,2

259,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm driving to college the day after tomorrow. My freshman year at college didn't uh... go so well. I went to a school that, in retrospect, really wasn't a good fit for me. I was in an extremely competitive major (CS) that I wasn't passionate about. I had just gotten out of a really messy breakup with my first long-term girlfriend, and I was jaded and apathetic from that. I was coping extremely poorly, and isolated myself all year. There were days where I didn't get out of bed because confronting the fact that I had to shower and eat was too much for me.

&amp;#x200B;

So I decided I needed to take some time up and reorient the direction my life was heading. I picked up a few hobbies besides obsessively watching YouTube and playing video games, like rock climbing and photography. I started exercising regularly. I spent a couple months researching schools and programs, and found somewhere that I really think will be a great fit for me. I got a job, which gave me some form of structure. I attended my community college and took 3 pre-reqs that I needed to complete for my intended major. I started seeing a therapist. I started on an antidepressant, which seems to have drastically reduced my anxiety. I really feel like I've been on an upward trend.

&amp;#x200B;

But I still have pretty bad social anxiety. I haven't really made any new friends this past year, and I only really talk to two people semi-regularly. I'm still kind of reclusive. I want to use this chance of being in a new location to kind of reinvent myself, and do more things instead of spending \~18 hours a day in my bed. Now that I feel like I have a lot of other things in place - how do I find my social group? How do I make friends as a transfer student that's new to the area? How do I make sure my roommate and I get along?

&amp;#x200B;

263,"So, background:
This job has made me more miserable than I have ever been at a job &amp; I have had many crappy jobs before. Constantly understaffed (example: there are some days where I never get breaks while working 8-10 hours bc there is no one to break me). Lower management is just overworked as the regular associates are - everyone does everything for the general manager who is in the store for max 5 hours a few days a week. I’m also being harassed by a coworker I hate - which I went to management about - and they have done nothing except tell me to basically get over it. Oh yeah! This crappy coworker is also getting promoted! This person has made me cry &amp; have an anxiety attack at work. 

So, I finally said screw it and put my two weeks in and I have to face my boss tomorrow. This job isn’t worth going to corporate over for me, I am beyond done &amp; have a few other things lined up that I could easily jump right into. 

My main concern right now: one of my coworkers (who I am very close with) informed me that my general manager is going to try and guilt trip me into staying (says she can’t afford to lose me). She wanted me to move up &amp; after everything that’s happened, I am no longer interested. I’m so anxious I don’t know what to do &amp; I hate conflict - I’m a super soft hearted, kind and quiet person and I know I can get walked all over - so this is my chance for freedom finally.

265,"I'm not sure if anyone would care to read this, but I'm desperate for some advice. I feel like I'm going insane and I'm extremely depressed with no one to talk to. 

To cut a long story short, I was super ambitious as a teen and had these big dreams of where I would want to go with my career. Unlike most people, at that time, I knew exactly what I wanted to do and what path to take. Therefore, I put in a lot of hard work to get into university and got in pretty easily, but my parents, especially my father, didn't support me going into any creative field (graphic design). I ended up having to settle with studying in a field that I didn't want to go into and took a student loan for it.

Nevertheless, I worked extremely hard and I tried my absolute best with whatever little resources I had at the time, with the hope that I could eventually transfer to a school where I could study in my own field. Unfortunately, my parents both lost their jobs during the recession and I ended up having to drop out of school and find a job. The company let off people soon after and I ended up getting a very low-paying job somewhere else. It had a clique culture where I was bullied and I also wasn't allowed to finish university while I was there. 

To make things worse, I had now become the sole breadwinner of my family and found myself repaying a student loan, plus my parents' loans and mortgage as well, and boy, were they in debt... Loans and bills and food and other expenses out of measly pay and I could barely afford transportation to go to work. 

I tried looking for other jobs and no one would hire me. I tried my best to earn whatever I could online, sometimes only with an hour sleep to go back to work in the morning. Eventually, I managed to quit the job and my parents and sibling got back on their feet. Debts were repaid and I finally managed to pay off my debt too. 

All of that was in my 20s. I never got a chance to enjoy it and sow my wild oats like a lot of people apparently did. Instead, I  worked like a slave in shitty jobs and I have almost nothing to show for it. I have no friends because they all abandoned me after a while. People would laugh at me and bully me at work, so I couldn't make friends at work. I had to put my career on hold; I'm only just now trying to see if I could save to go back to university to get my degree in what I wanted to do in the first place. I'm almost 31 and I've literally never been on a date. 

The fact that I'm now in my 30s and I'm single, I probably have to choose between having a career and a family at this point and the fact that I basically lost a decade of my life, is making me even more anxious and depressed. I can barely sleep and I cry quite a bit. I'm always alternating between anger and resentment mostly at my parents and a deep sadness like I'm floating by myself in a void. I'd talk to someone, but on previous occasions when I've tried, people told me to get over it or that I was being too negative. I feel worthless and ill. 

Is there any advice anyone can give me? I'm in a very bad place and I'm very desperate.",19Aug2019,2
267,"I have significant gaps between each of the four jobs on my resume: 6 months on average. I had a couple temp jobs not listed on my resume (most were probably two days) and I had an Etsy page for my art, but most of the time spent in those gaps have been sleeping/doing nothing. The longest I’ve been at a job was a year and a half (I always use them as references because it’s the only job where my bosses liked me and I gave them two weeks notice before I left). I applied to SSDI and was rejected because I’m too “functional” (ie I take showers, eat, do laundry, and have never actually tried to kill myself). I’m now at a point where I’m out of money, and I have student loans, insurance, meds, and therapy (not currently attending) to pay for. I got a psychology degree, and I was planning on going to medical school, but didn’t due to lack of motivation. Also, through working I’ve found that the medical field is probably not for me (huge consequences from screw-ups, can’t handle the pressure). I’m now 27 and living at home. 

I now have to find a job. Should I change my resume to a functional resume? I may have to fill out an online application anyway. If they ask about gaps or why I left it would be a lie to say, “I had some medical issues that are now resolved,” because they’re not resolved. I’m pretty much going to have to lie during an interview because I hate working and there’s a good chance I won’t stay at the job for long. I’m thinking of going through a temp agency again, but I’d rather find a job I won’t want to quit after one day. But I guess beggars can’t be choosers. I also went to a place that helps people with disabilities get jobs and was told to go to a career center that only has full time jobs, and not to mention my depression (even though it’s illegal to discriminate, they still do it). I don’t even know how someone could reasonably accommodate my anxiety and depression anyway.

269,"I am a college student and because of certain circumstances, I have been non-stop in school taking full course loads of classes only getting breaks when the school closes between quarter start and end dates (spring break, winter break). This will continue until October of 2020. It's been very stressful to say the least. I haven't even have time to make food, hang out with my friends, do any hobbies, go to the gym, etc. for *months*. I don't even have time to go to the doctor for a medication refill I've been needing for 2 months, let alone go to my therapist. I'll usually have my partner overnight then the next morning they will leave since I have class. We haven't gone on a proper date in a long time and it bothers me. I'm able to switch around my schedule a bit for the upcoming classes, but of course I will still be just as busy. Thankfully I have a month break coming up soon until the next quarter starts.

My parents have told me suddenly that they are planning a 2.5 week long trip during winter break. Although I am immensely grateful to have to opportunity to travel, the trip is going to take the entirety of my break - they are literally planning that the day after my finals we leave and 2 days before the next quarter begins we arrive back at home. There are three major things that bother me about this, and I don't know if they are valid complaints. 1) I will have little to no time to prepare for the next quarter due to how late I am coming back. 2) I will have no time to spend time with my friends or even have time to do stuff by myself or do any projects or hobby 3) I will get no time to spend any break days with my partner. My parents say I can just do this some other time but it was supposedly supposed to be our first holiday season together and I don't even get to spend *one day* with my partner. zero.

272,"This is my first ever job and I just started in June 2019. I’m so exhausted. I work in pediatric home health and have been pulling 5 night shifts a week for one patient. I love this patient but I don’t know if I can take working with the mom anymore.

At one point I got signed up for 10 shifts in a row. I let myself be pressured into actually working them by both the office and her. Not surprisingly, I crashed. I slipped and the patient fell off the seat I was trying to put them on. Did all the office work and assessments and apparently it’s okay because they weren’t hurt. My health also went downhill since I was so exhausted. I ended up losing 5 pounds because I barely ate. Since then, I’ve only stuck to 5 nights even though I just wanted 3-4. 

Flash to now. I’m going on vacation with some friends later this week. So I’m taking from Thursday to the following Monday off. I am also only signed up for 2 nights this week before I leave. I figured she could handle her child (who generally sleeps well)  for 2 nights or one of the other nurses could sign up for one.

No. She’s ADAMANT about getting 24/7 care and I just got chewed out by her because I refused to sign up for either shift. She basically said since I’m leaving I should be more available earlier in the week when I haven’t prepped for this trip or going back to school AT ALL. She knew I want to go back and plan to. She just figured in her head it won’t be until next year? What? I need my prereqs too. And she can’t handle her kid for a couple of nights?

It was about what we where talking about at the time, like they knew what I was already going to say. No he’s not a fast typer, and it was happening with everyone. Weird right??? Oh not even close to the amount of absolute weirdness going on. Some friends got new jobs, jobs that you would need to take a course for to be on the work site. Certain certifications. Well. Just like the last problem it wasn’t just one it was quite a few. I ask  “hey how’d you get that job, you need a certificate to work there don’t you” they would reply back “oh yeah weird hey” with a smug smirk on their face. I then stared asking people close by what’s going on things aren’t adding up everyone said “I don’t know what you’re on about”. Anyway I continued   About, and events would pop up in that same situation I have been in. Not similar, THE EXACT SAME. I’ll give a quick e.g. 
so say a few years ago I was at a party. And I was sitting on a chair and fell back with a corona in hand, 3 people helped me  back up 2 guys and a girl. I would be at a party some years down the track and someone would do that exact thing corona in hand falling off a chair similar looking people would help him up, ANDDD get this they would all be wearing the similar clothing that we had on. The dude that fell wore pretty much my outfit. They would help him up then have a solid stare at me. Ah but everything must be normal. What about the time I was sitting outside and one of my neighbours who constantly works on motorbikes hired a “local company” I’d never heard of before. Which was meant to be a handy man company. Anyway I see the car pull up and they talk and whatever and then the neighbour says jeez thanks for the hammer. AHAHA what a hammer??? You work on motorbikes every day and you called a handy man company for a hammer. AW FUCKKK ME. This shit is not even close to what has gone on. I’ve also spoke to some of the local disabled, that have been in my town as long as I can remember. He would approach me I would talk to him not wanting to be rude and brush him off. Done that for years then one day he spoke to me in a different tone quite intelligent for a short period.I was shocked, haha what I replied. He continued talking as if he spoke the same that whole time. Then we got the people with no jobs. All this happening is in the last few years btw. The people who I have known to not work and are on welfare are buying cars and renting houses. Yes people on welfare can do that but getting a $6000 car and renting a home that’s worth at least $200 a week rent, comeeeeee onnnnnn. Every time I ask questions to people I get the same answers “I don’t know what your talking about” and “I can’t say what you are experiencing but iii experienced this one” and then blabble on. Even my parents are acting shady something that they never have before, blankly hiding some truth for answers I’m searching.
I’m going to end it there if I want anyone to actually read this haha. Some quick answers for replies I think I will get. Yes I have been out of town and yes I do feel like Truman, if I was to continue writing what has gone on you will see how. Although I wouldn’t see what makes me so special for everyone to know my business, plus my life isn’t that interesting, but neither was Truman’s and he had millions of viewers. I have even left my state. But I do get this feeling certain people already know of me when I arrive at places. Yes I can elaborate more on this topic, trust me I’ve kept it very short and just what has happened in my town so people will actually read this. Yes part of thinks they know what I’m thinking and already going to do like it’s pre determined. If I where to compare this to anything I would compare it to the movie “The Game” with Michael Douglas and “The Truman Show” with Jim Carey. 
I live in Australia if that helps out all it might considering Australia is “not real” haha.
I may have not giving enough information for you to give me an answer, I’m happy to give more as I’ve said. I just hope I’ve giving enough information for someone to maybe help me with what’s really going on what people are hiding from me. I know they are hiding something. 
Thanks",19Aug2019,1

Just so you guys know, it's gonna be cheesy AF, also i've been on this sub for 2 so have mercy, i don't know where else to go with this.

I've met her, at first she was just a crush i had in 8th grade, but even after getting rejected once we stayed friends, and i thought i was over it, with time the feelings came back, even stronger, we started doing stuff outside of schooltime, we texted until the early morning hours, i tried to distract myself from her, but every relationship i had failed, because i was told it's either her or my then current girlfriend... 

When i was in a relationship, i could see it in her eyes, that she didn't like it.

None of her relationships lasted, because of me. Her then boyfriends always became jealous of me, because i knew everything about her and she knew everything about me. 

The last relationship she got into, i cut all ties with her, broke up contact... she's now engaged to that guy... i just wanted her to be finally happy... half a year after i cut all ties, i couldn't hold it anymore and texted her, she was angry and cussed me out, but instead of blocking me, she kept replying... i stopped replying and she blocked me on every platform.. now i'm engaged aswell, but every 2 or 3 months i'm thinking about her, still love her and would dare to say that if she texted me, asking me to burn out with her, i think i'd do it...

It's been 3 years since our last conversation and it's still bothering me...

By definition: that means those who actually get stuff done and are actually useful aren't as respected as they should be.

But this job has been kind to me. I genuinely enjoy working there, I've been there for a couple of years and they're kind enough to reimburse me for my schooling.

But anyway, very recently I was offered an assistant manager position in one of the departments and I took up the offer! But then I began to think what if I can still go further? To maybe a department head manager and from there to store manager and then to corporate?

My school offers a business management certificate that can be completed in one full time semester. Even though it's outside of my education major (my ultimate goal is still to be a teacher someday) I figured I could work on that certificate at the same time as my degree. This certificate would definitely give me a boost in moving further up and even in another company should I choose to find another job someday.

How should I explain to a judge? How should I dress? Professional I assume. These questions might be too legal for general advice.

I am having a hard time with this person depending on his negative selfthoughs and about the society, others and so forth.  To be honest, I have had a dark view on everything too but I have started to realize that I am what I do so I do whatever I can with being a ray of sunshine and love.  He is a copy of his negative pears,  I think he is codependent by their negativity, he also feel like he needs to have control over me, he is not listening to what I say like what I need and why, he is just saying what he think is best for me.  I like this guy alot but I want my own life and unfortunately I feel like he is objectifying me, maybe because he don't know anything else and maybe because my whole existence was about codependency when we started this relationship.  I am working with everything here but I feel stuck maybe becauase it isn't about me but both who needs to change. He is insecure about being physically close to me and I don't know what's that about I think in general he owns this messed up belief system about realationships and such, he doesn't even want to listen at me, my reasons.

304,"Hi everybody. I’m gonna try and keep this concise as possible but here’s the situation. 



My little sister and mum moved in with my grandparents (my mum’s mum and my mum’s dad) because my grandfather has had a stroke and my grandmother has dementia so she needs help. She’s in her early stages of dementia so she’s somewhat functional but is very paranoid and extremely forgetful and can get aggressive. 


They moved in about 9 months ago, and ever since my grandmother and mum fight constantly. Slowly escalating over the months to now recently where my grandmother uses knives to threaten to kill herself or hurt my mum or my little sister (who is twelve). Last night my sister even got hurt from my grandmother because she very shallowly stabbed her finger. I’ve tried to tell my mum time and time again that she’s not obliged to stay there, that they can put grandma and grandpa in a nursing home and that their safety comes first, but my mum insists on staying. I had a huge chat with my little sister about doing something and that she needs to move because she’s going to end up with PTSD and trauma. But the problem is that there’s nowhere to go for her. I (21) can’t have her over because I live with my dad (which isn’t her dad we are half siblings), my grandmother (father’s mum) and older sister. My older brother and his wife live too far from her school, and other options have been exhausted. I’ve told my sister to take up extra curricular activities at school to keep her mind off things but it’s getting way too overwhelming. 


I was in a similar situation when I was 9 years old when I lived with my mum and stepfather and my stepfather was abusive so I stared living with my dad, but she doesn’t have that option (because my little sister’s dad is estranged from our family). 

I just don’t know what to do. It’s extremely disturbing to see my little sister go through this because it’s not fair on her. She’s essentially trapped in a situation that she never asked for. Help?",19Aug2019,2
305,"Hi,
So I met this guy on Grindr and today was our second time meeting. The first time, we just had sex but we clicked very well. We are both really into EDM and raves/festivals and just get along extremely well... he seems like a perfect match for me. 
I feel like he’s way out of my league, but he makes me feel so good about myself - telling me I’m perfect , model status, etc. 
Yesterday he took me to the movies and out to eat and to the beach. We did drugs at all these places, and just had a fantastic time. We got back to his house and had spent lots of time talking , doing drugs , drinking, sex, watching tv etc. it was literally the best night of my life. I’ve never felt so adored by anyone. 
I know it might sound crazy since we’ve only met twice, but I kind of feel like I am in love with this guy. He makes me feel so good about myself — like I’m more than a sex object. One thing that may be an issue however is I’m 18 and he’s 34. He fell asleep and I woke him up and asked him to take me home (I had told him before I had to be somewhere in morning) and he told me to shut up and go to sleep (not in mean way at all). 
I kind of started “whining” because I wanted to go home but not too much and apologized several times. We were still getting along great and cuddling, I just wanted to go home and couldn’t sleep. 
The thing is - I feel like when I do drugs I am very annoying. I apologized 1000 times for this and he said I’m fine and that he’s not mad at me. I’m kind of worried that I made him lose interest. 
We woke up at 2 am , cuddled some more and talked a bit , then he took me home. He told me that I was begging him to take me home in my sleep, but then said he was joking. We didn’t say anything at all on the 10 min car ride home. 
When he dropped me off , I told him how great of a time I had and thanked him again. 
I messaged him on Snapchat after he dropped me off and apologized for making him get out so late - and he opened my message without replying. I am so so sad, worried that he has lost interest in me. 

I really need advice on this. What should I do? Should I leave him alone and hope for the best? Do you guys think I’m thinking too much into this? I’m really fucked up still.

At that point, he started getting very handsy and even went in for a kiss.  Nothing *terrible* happened, but she is still pretty upset about the whole thing.

310,"For context: recently a new member has become active on one of the smaller fandom subreddits I’m on. From their very first comments, nearly everything they said sounded similar to comments I’ve made in the past. They’re quite good at rephrasing them so that they’re *slightly* tweaked such that they don’t look identical, but a lot of the same ideas, turns of phrase, and more than anything nearly an identical writer’s voice make their way into their comments. A lot of my comments on this sub are mini-essays, in which I write a lot of content, so it isn’t like somebody is copying my voice saying “oh yeah! awesome episode!”

At first I was just impressed somebody else was this similar to me and happened to become very active on the same sub. I honestly didn’t think anything other than: they independently write like me and think like me. But the more this user comments, the more obvious the mimicking becomes. They’ve even started copying the way I format comments on episode discussions, including key phrases I use to talk about certain ideas and characters, and everything down to the tone and structure of the writing.

What’s the best way to deal with a copycat online? Is there even a way I can have a polite, open online conversation with him/her without it coming off rude or extremely assumptive? After all, this is an internet stranger, so I can’t say with certainty that this isn’t just who they are—I only have my own strong gut feeling built up over the past several weeks. I’ve also had a copycat once IRL, and this person’s personality even reminds me of my former friend. They don’t do it intentionally but it’s still infuriating. 

I don’t even want to comment on that sub anymore because I don’t want to keep giving this person more of myself to mooch on. It’s been unsettling having somebody hijack my writing voice and repurpose it to their own personality. I feel like *I’m* the one who’s losing my identity. It almost feels like the only solution now is to step back from this sub that’s brought me a lot of joy and which I honestly spend a lot of time on, and I hate that.

311,"This would be quite long since my counselor is not around. I have always being surrounded with hypocrite people in which at one point I really hate to be hypocrite. I hate seeing people doing job irresponsibly, dishonestly and not give it to the fullest even though he have been paid at full.  I realized that I'm going to be that kind of employee, looking at how irresponsible I am as a son, as a student, as a member of a group projects. Realizing that, I think I want to drop my college degree and maybe get a job with less responsibilities like a cashier,, or maybe just commit suicide because I think I am not suitable to live in this kind of world. 
I have more reason to drop my college, and it's all because of my perfectionist/idealist trait. My grade is always higher than effort than I gave that I think I would lying my interviewer/employer. Besides due to inconsistency between effort and the grade(rewards), I think I start to detest job with more inconsistency between effort and reward. And I think engineering is the kind of job. Being cashier is much more simple and less responsibility, how long you work is how much you gain. 
I'm still thinking should I drop my college degree to do something that suitable with my traits/characteristics. Or should I stick with it and become hypocrite, harming others life, bigger responsibility, forced to be suitable for me even though there is more person that are more qualified, more interesting on the jobs. I think I would just steal other's job opportunity, just like how I stealing someone's scholarship because just how incompetent I am.

312,"I've had two jobs in the past two years. Before that, I was a reliable employee who stayed with my employer for 5+ years each time until the businesses wound up closing for reasons that weren't related to me.

I've always had a hard time dealing with super aggressive A-type personalities. Sometime in the past few years I've gone from being a very passive person to a generally calm but secretly very angry person and I was fired from my last two jobs after getting into massive arguments after I was pushed too hard.

After the last time, I started seeing a therapist every week and I feel like I've made a lot of progress dealing with negative emotions.

I need advice on how much of this I should talk about during my interview tomorrow, and if I should even mention that I've been going to therapist. 

If I get the job I'd be working alone for most of the time.

321,"My dad had a really shitty divorce with his ex wife (my ex stepmother). After the divorce he became very depressed and got drunk almost every night. This is when I started to get really angry. I grew to have such a hatred towards alcohol that everytime I see my dad with a glass of wine in his hand, I can't help, but feel frustrated and overwhelmed. His girlfriend at the time was going through menopause and had several medical issues after some stupid doctors fucked up one of her surgeries. During this time, she would often fall asleep on the couch and it would just be me and my dad watching movies and stuff. I dreaded everytime night would come because I knew I would have to hear a long ass drunken speech/monologue from him. Alot of the times they were about love. Often they were about me not knowing everything about the world and just because I'm a teenager doesn't mean I'm a genius. One time he talked about how the fucking earth was gonna end either in my times or my children's times. I sat and listened to it all because I thought I had to, because he was my dad. During this time, my Dad and his girlfriend had bought a bar that they worked at it almost every night and my dad also worked in real estate during the day. I only really saw him in the morning and late at night where he would be super drunk. This meant that I was often alone at the house after school for quite a long time. Several times I remember yelling out at the empty couch. Explaining my rage. Cursing at my father as if he was actually there. Those were some really shitty times. 

Anyways he eventually stopped drinking after one night that was really shitty. What happened doesn't really matter to the story. He stopped drinking and actually started to be really great to be around. His girlfriend convinced him that he had ADD so he started taking pills for that and for a while I felt like I had a dad. One day though he started drinking again.  At first he seemed fairly in control of the whole thing. Then shit hit the fan. His girlfriend started having medical problems again. At some point she actually fainted and had to be brought to the hospital. She lost alot of blood. After this whole thing happened I saw a change in my dad. The night she was at the hospital, my father and I stayed at home and watched game of thrones. He got so drunk to the point that he grabbed my thigh thinking  I was his girlfriend because she often cuddles with him on the couch. This was the third time he had ever done this to me. Eventually his girlfriend was well enough for her to come back home and she's been there since. Unfortunately she still hasn't gotten better and my dad has gotten into getting drunk again. One night he got so drunk that he started following me around the house and actually blocking me when I tried to get to the remote. He wanted to talk to me, but when he spoke it was just random bullshit. I ended up going into my room and blocking my door. I freaked out and had kinda a anger/panic attack. The next day he said he was very sorry and that he was gonna start taking the pills that made him not want to drink. He told me was gonna stop. I believed him.

Of course I was wrong. I explained to him one night how triggered I get when he drinks. I explained to him why I'm so angry at him all the time. I thought he listened. Then this week he drank again. This time with my two little sisters in the house. We were watching avengers endgame. He paused the movie and started talking about his divorce to the girls. I have never felt so furious and betrayed in my life. We ended up watching the rest of the movie, but then he started talking to them afterwards. By then it was around 8:30 or so. He said so many things that he shouldn't have and it frustrated me so much. I asked him what was wrong and he was confused. I explained that normally when he drinks its because he's sad. He still didn't understand and wanted me to answer some dumb question about colors or something. I said I didn't want to play his game. He said that he would only explain why he was sad if I played his game. His girlfriend then chimed in that I'm only gonna piss myself off more if I try to talk to him. She said it as if I was the bad guy. I went into my room and had a rage fit. The next day he did not apologize. His girlfriend did not mention it and nor did he. They ended up going straight to bed without saying anything about it at all. They did the same the next day and the next. I felt as if they were avoiding it. It pissed me off even more. This whole week I've felt more angry at them then I ever have. 

It's not just drinking either though that has frustrated me. My dad found out his ex wife's account password and had been badly hiding the fact that he had been stalking everything she had been saying on her Facebook messenger. When I told him how much it made me angry and how wrong it was for him to do that, his remark was that when he sees how much his ex wife is an asshole on messager, it makes him feel less pain about the whole ordeal.  His girlfriend supports the hacking. I'm frustrated at her too. I realized that she literally did nothing to stop my dad from being a drunken piece of shit throughout my freshman year. She just let him do it. Never told him to shut up. She's always been defensive of him and always makes me feel like I'm a narcissistic villain of some sort. She also has such an angry tone towards my little sisters. When they don't want to eat the food she makes, she basically commands them to. I figured out that if I hold my little sisters hands when they are eating new or different foods they feel more confident and actually try it. I explained this to my dad's girlfriend and she freaked out on me saying that ""a 16 year old has better parenting then me"". As if my fucking age is like a mental handicap or something. Anyways with all this frustration and anger I texted my actual birth mom and asked her if I could stay at her house for two weeks. Normal I stay one week with my mom and then the next week with my dad and then the pattern continues. I've never asked if I could stay two weeks before. I felt super guilty about it because the rest of the day was really nice. We went bowling. We had a little barbecue. Then we went on a neighborhood walk as night began to fall. It was alot of fun. When I told my dad while he was setting up the barbecue, that I was gonna to stay an extra week with my mom, he asked why. I said ""because I want to"". I then walked into the house and left him. I felt really shitty after that. I still do. He sounded hurt. The thing is these people are really nice and loving alot of the time. They aren't bad people and I really do love them. I just can't get over the fact that my dad basically betrayed me and told my sisters a bunch of shit. It's makes me imagine that he could do what he did to me, to them when they get older. I can't handle this shit anymore. I don't know what to do right now In my life. I started taking lexapro because I have bad anxiety and my dad's girlfriend thinks it makes me overly angry, but I view it as  making me more confident to speak out about the bullshit I see. Tomorrow I'm going to my mom's. 

What should I do? How do I fix everything? How do I end this never ending shit?",19Aug2019,2
322,"I am a college student (20M), currently home for the summer. I like to think I share a pretty close relationship with my sister. For the sake of this post, let’s call her Jane. One of her best friends is “Mary”, and my family has known Mary’s family for years.

A few months ago, when I was visiting home, one of my friends asked me if Jane and Mary were “a thing”. At first I was confused; Jane had never been in relationship, and I hadn’t heard anything about it. Later, I told Jane about my friends’ question— somewhat expecting it to play off like a joke. It sort of did, but in her response, Jane didn’t confirm or deny anything. I kept my suspicions, but didn’t say much else about it.  My mom may have been in the room when this conversation happened, but she didn’t seem to absorb anything we were saying.

Today, I saw Mary’s older sister(my age) in a public, crowed place. Both of our families were around and about, but it was pretty noisy. There, Mary’s sister tried stealthily asking me if my parents knew about Jane and Mary. Again, I was slightly confused, and my response was “I don’t think I know about Jane and Mary”.  Apparently, Mary had told her sister that I already knew— which I sort of did, but not exactly. I have all the hints, but no sort of verbal confirmation.

So, my question is, what should I do from here? Jane hasn’t come out  to me or our parents(as far as I know), and I certainly don’t want to take that agency away from her. On the other hand, I may have already done that to a degree, and Jane might think I’ve known for a long time, based on the way I framed that initial question. What’s the best way to give my support? Should I ask her about it privately? Or should I respect her right to come out when it’s best for her and stay quiet?

Thanks a bunch reddit.",19Aug2019,1

I feel it’s a bad idea for me to try and talk to this person to get closure because it’ll end in me looking desperate, annoying, etc. So that isn’t an option for me.

I want it to be sentimental or at least get the message across that i thought of her deeply, so a card with money won't work.  I know y'all don't know her like I do but i'd love to hear any ideas.

A brief description of her:

\- she's laid back, low-key punk style, loves piercings, loves her cats, collects guitar chips from different concerts, doesn't like expensive clothes, likes weed but probs has enough of it, doesn't want furniture or decoration, likes tye-dye and hippie pants, loves incense (but has a lot already), dyes her hair often, and probably doesn't want bath/body stuff.

My only gift ideas i came up with that she might like:

\- new piercings/gauges 

\- lingerie

\- lululemon leggings that she said she likes but would never buy cause fuck that lol

\- bong but idk if her mom would kill me or not

\- tye dye or skater apparel

332,"I am 29 I grew up in a small town in Northern England but I have always had a big circle of friends, never home almost never having time to see them all- life couldn’t be better!

334,"I'm married, 34 m, only person in my department at work, report directly to CEO.  I am happy with my wife, our sex life is amazing, I'd never cheat on her. My coworker is 42 m, divorced twice, bit of a dog when it comes to women. He works under the manufacturing manager, he is a supervisor with about 10 or 15 subordinates. Call him R. Our company moved to a new location in a new state about 18 months ago. I had been with the company since a few years prior and he is one of the new people we brought on after the move. As a result of this, lots of people at work have their social lives almost built around the office / factory. This guy seemed like one of the good people until this incident. I considered him a friend worth trust.

A couple of weeks back, me, him, and two other coworkers went out for drinks after work on a Friday. All guys, I'm the only one who isn't single. Our plans to get a few beers at a restaurant ended up expanding to include a trip to one of the other coworker's apartment, call him P. Once we got there, we drank until around 8 pm when R says ""we need some girls over!"" and then me and P said ""sure"" and ""yeah why not call some girls over"". I had no reason to be a party pooper because I always meet my wife at 10 pm when she gets out of work. I knew that girls coming over would be unlikely anyway, but even if it happened, I'd be leaving not long after they arrived, or my wife would be joining us, so I had no concerns about how it might appear, otherwise I'd have disagreed about more guests or left on my own should the situation become weird. Also I want P to find a gf, I have known him for years and he got screwed over in his last relationship. It'd be unfair for me to interfere in his chance at socializing with women. 

Anyway a few min after we all agreed that having girls over is OK, R starts txting someone. I ask ""who are you txting?"" And he says the name of one of his subordinates, call her L. I had spoken to her earlier that day and I knew she was out with some other girls from work. I said ""oh cool, I think she's out with the other girls, maybe they will come by"" then I didn't think much of the situation. About an hour passes with R still txting and he says ""Bitch didn't answer! I told her my friend used my phone to txt her!"" and the rest of us start teasing him because any woman would see through that ""wasnt me"" line and it sounded so desperate. I thought that it was silly for him to txt someone who works under him, but it ain't my problem. Anyway R leaves shortly after, rest of us three guys listen to some music, and I leave when my wife picks me up on her way home from work. 

Fast forward a couple of weeks. Now R is giving L hell every day because she is using her phone on the factory floor. New policies make it more strict to use phones at work. L sits up front so she is easy to see and gets reprimanded more often by R than anyone else. Maybe R is targeting her, maybe not, but I don't care, it's not my problem or my department and I know that L can talk to HR or R's boss if she wants, it's widely known in the company that both are approachable and helpful and kind. Anyway R's reprimanding of L reaches a boiling point this past Friday and he gives her a final warning. So she runs to R's boss, call him G, and she is screaming and crying so loudly that the whole office can hear it. She tells G that since she rejected R's advances via txt, he has made her life at work hell. After G calms her down, her shift is over, and she leaves.

Now is where *my* problem begins. G calls in R to confront him about txting a subordinate at the end of the day on Friday. Desperate to make sure his boss knows he is not making 1 on 1 advances to a subordinate, this piece of SHIT lies to G and says ""OP sent that txt from my phone"" and G calls me in the office. G asks me what happened and I tell him. G and I are both in agreement that R is being dishonest. R is in a panic, screaming desperately trying to save his job, even though it's not on the line. I don't argue with him even though he continues  vaguely saying I sent the txt, but each time G asks, I tell him i was not involved. I end up leaving the office out of frustration, but I am certain that G knows I did not do anything wrong, and I remind him that he can ask the other two coworkers if he needs the truth from a 3rd party. G and I are at the same level in the company heirarchy and the three of us had said the discussion would not leave the office so I left work without speaking to anyone else about the incident.

After work was over I confronted R via txt. I was really mad that he'd lie about me like that. So now he is saying I didnt use his phone but that I asked him to txt L, also a lie. I didn't do that either. That's the version he told P, who says he knows I didn't use R's phone, but that he can't remember if I suggested he txt L. 

And I think R is targetting me because both of the other coworkers we were with, they are very close with R's boss for over a decade now. He can't lie about them, he thinks he has a better chance lying about me. Because he is sticking to his lies, I had to explain it all to my wife, and she's fine with it because she trusts me, but she's very upset that there may be a rumor at work that I tried to chase another girl. 

What do I do now? Should i go to HR and explain? Should I have another meeting with R and G and explain that unless R backs off the lie and admits I had nothing to do with it that I am reporting the problem to HR and / or the CEO? Should I let this die down? Should I tell L what happened in case R has also lied to her, saying I txted her from his phone?

Honestly I am still a bit shocked... R seemed like such a good guy and now he is appearing to be a weaselly little pervert. And i fear his bad rep is going to ooze into mine because I hung with him a few times and considered him a friend.

**TL;DR: coworker is lying saying I used his phone to txt his subordinate and asked her to hang out. He is changing the lie depending on who he talks to. Not sure what I should do about it.**",19Aug2019,1

Now I make my living of it and it is going super well! And I am ready to move there and start the next step together.

But he isn’t... he is taking online courses to study programming, because he would like to do get a job in that field. Which I really admire! It’s just been taking a really long time, and I feel my patience running out.

Also he is incredibly immature for a 17 year old both physically and behaviorally resulting in him not having a girlfriend, car or even a job.

There were debris everywhere along with dust and i can’t stay in that room anymore. When I emailed the landlord with photos, he just replied 
“Hi, we have paid half the deposit for the roof work to begin and within 2 weeks it should start in your room” 

He did not send anybody to clean the fallen ceiling pieces, and since he lives in a different city far away in the same state, we  have no access to him via phone, he just has a lawnmower who he pays to do all the other maintenance work in this aging house. 

Concern: we need to get out of the house by breaking the 1 year lease contract the 3 of us signed and I was hoping we would get our security deposit back due to health concerned? 

Since we are international students, we are a bit scared to do anything extreme already. No one has come to see the broken ceiling debris yet it’s been 4 days and the roof work has not been started yet.

I've never had a pet so don't know about how much space they take, but I assume all living things need a ""spot"". I told him to take the master bedroom so the dog would have room as well. He would also have to take a bigger portion of the rent (60/40) to be fair as the master is about twice the size of my room.

Was I being selfish? I mean, the dog will take up room. His food, towels, and everything will need storage. Am I being unreasonable for thinking this will all be taken from the mutual space so it's only fair he'd take the master and also pay more?

But of course he doesn't want the master and was offended that I said the dog taking up room would be something he should pitch in for.

Thoughts? We'd both be on the lease, not actually bought yet. Should I just avoid, since he got offended so easily (but this is a big financial decision and I don't want to damage the friendship long term).",19Aug2019,1

I’ve never liked shaving the private parts because of razor burns, waxing scares me and because of health reasons, both of them would get really messy (Been fully bedridden for almost 2 years, so that would not end well). 
Basically.. I decided to take a tweezer and see what happened. I’ve never heard of anyone doing that, and I don’t know if people just don’t talk about that stuff or if it’s just not something people do. 
So I laid there and were about to do it, but the more I thought of it the more it started hurting, so I started going fast so my brain couldn’t understand what was going on. I got tired because of health reasons again so I decided to wait until the next day. 

It took me 2 days to complete half of it. 
And at that point I wanted to wait and see before I did the rest of it. 
The days went by and I was really smooth (not to mention it bled a few times when I accidentally pulled out the roots,, is that dangerous? Anyway) I’ve never felt so smooth I think and I thought I discovered a new life hack. 
But then.. I started feeling itchy. I thought it was just the hair growing back,, and partly it was that but... Every. Single. Hair. Are. Now. Ingrown. 
Like all the hairs are stuck under a layer of the skin, so I have to scrape that layer off and try to pull it out. (I know this is disgusting by the way)

So my question is.. why? Why did that happen? I’ve never had problems with it before. And is there something I can do to help? I’ve pulled out many already but they just keep coming. 
I’m a really paranoid person because I’m already severely sick so everything feels deadly to me. I didn’t use any cream or shower before or anything, because I can’t really, since I’m bedridden. Also the hair that are growing back are way easier to tweeze out than the first time, like the roots has gotten significantly weaker. 
So yeah.. any advice? It’s red and really irritated. If an ingrown hair becomes infected, what do I do? I want this to work because it saves me much energy!

A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it.

364,"I was looking to rent out a place for myself (currently crashing at my friends) and a week back I got very excited to move in to this place I had seen and took out a loan from my bank. Rent was manageable, but I had no money saved up for the deposit (intern). 

This was all based on my impending conversion into a normal employment, which for some reason is not happening right away and that would take another 5 months at least. Based on this info, I decided to continue stay with my friends and postpone getting my own place. And hence wanted to cancel my loan with the bank.

But the problem was I had made it into an FD (same bank account), so that I would not end up utilizing a penny for anything else. Now the bank is considering it as utilisation of funds and have told me that I can't apply for cancellation, but has to go for the preclosure and pay some amount, which is to the extent of 20% of the interest on the loan amount.

Now I don't know if I should go for preclosure (which I can't afford right now) or just continue with the loan, even if I do, what do I do with that money?

Second, my renewed permit at 17, I look dead in the face, like the mughshot of a shooter, and third, which is me now at 18, I look like a homeless alcoholic who does meth. Sometimes I pull these out and just set them side by side and it all just hits me, the things that I've done to myself. Not even with drugs or anything, but just losing sleep alone and not taking care of myself has deteriorated my appearance and mental health to the extent that it's almost hard to believe I don't use anything. It's kind of funny at first but it just makes me so fucking mad. At myself and at my parents. I used to get sad about it but now it just fills me with rage. And cant tell people, especially girls, are scared of me because I'm a bit of a big dude and I don't talk much and look unkept and have massive eyebags from not sleeping.

&amp;#x200B;

Some stuff that happens I just can't fucking take it. It makes me so mad I just want to punch people. I just spent a good hour on 4chan telling some pedophile to kill himself for saying ""people hit the wall at 13 years old"" and talking about which ages betwerrn 2-13 are the best and why. Pedos are the lowest of the fucking low and I hate them.

When I go on walks in the park in the pile of shit area I live in and I see a condom on the fucking ground I want to find out who did it and just beat the fuck out of them. Fucking idiots. Is it really that hard to go ANYWHERE else you braindead fucks? If someone gave those idiots a lobotomy, I gauruntee you they'd be just as stupid as before you took out the poor excuse for brain matter they have.

&amp;#x200B;

And I can't handle the absolute fact that we mean nothing. We mean nothing. We don't. When you die, you are gone. When your mom dies, she's gone. When your friends die, they're gone. Nothing. Poof. Poof. Poof. Every damn second a soul becomes maggot food. It doesnt matter if i hang myself from my belt right this second because I'm just going to poof away within the century. I've been traumatized by this since I was 13 and it has not stopped eating at me since. Even when I was 6 and I believed in god I was constantly terrified I was going to go to hell because of the things my mom told me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm always mad or sad. Only time I enjoy myself is when I'm joking around with my PSN buddies. I have managed to completely managed to deconstruct myself and my personality and crush it to a fine pulp. Friends and family mean nothing to me anymore. I don't go to family reunions because I don't care about them and wouldn't if I tried. My siblings matter to me and that's it even though there's no good reason for me not caring. All the old games I used to play feel like shit to me, I dont give 2 fucks about movies or shows.

Above all though I can't stop being so fucking mad. I'll never know what it's like to have a friend for more than 1 year. I've never had that in my entire life because I'm as poor as you can get without being a bum and constantly moving areas. I have nobody but my 2 sisters and we don't even talk because were always clacking away at our phones. I cfould really go on and on with this.

Might as well close our journey right?

I recently texted her for the first time in a long time and it felt a little awkward. I asked if she wantes to hang out for old time sake and she said she's busy and will leave soon this week.

Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

382," So here's the situation. I currently work as an IT service desk in Sydney and recently gotten a new manager who started 2 months ago. essentially i was working at a pleasant environment and my previous manager was hot desking in Queensland. My CIO wasn't a fan of that and needed a manager to be present at the Home office. When he first started he wanted to know how everything is running and asked about things like working from home (entitled to work 1 day a week from home) how lunch break works, ticketing system that we're using etc etc. i told him that as long as 2 people are on the phones then that's sufficient enough. we also have voicemails that users can leave and in turn we log a ticket from them or they can send an email and it automatically logs a ticket. currently there is 8 of us including my ex manager who works offsite. After a while he started to make drastic changes with one of them being lunch breaks. we now have a fixed scheduled lunch break spread out throughout the day. I got 12:00pm then the next person 12:30pm, 1:00pm, 1:30pm,2:00pm and 2:30pm. let me also mention the fact that if i happen to be on a call and it goes over my schedule lunch time the person after me gets delayed. His reasoning behind his decision was ""I need maximum phone coverage"" like we are somehow getting 900 calls a second. I was working from home on a friday and came back to work on monday and saw my manager who put a table facing towards all of us and directly behind me. Now keep in mind that everyone else in the office usually has their table faced towards the window. On that friday a colleague asked him why he doesn't do that and his reasoning was ""because i want to see what everyone is doing"" several people have pointed out that he looks like he's micromanaging but he obviously denies it and spoke about how his previous manager micromanaged him years back and it was the worst yet he fails to notice that he is doing the same thing. its the little things that makes me thing he's micromanaging like knowing the exact precise time someone is getting their hot chocolate or sending messages through skype asking certain individuals if they are taking calls.

Hi,

I'm 28, soon to turn 29, and I've been going through a sort of existential crisis for the last year about the prospect of turning 30. The problem is that my 20s were a bit of a mess because of really bad anxiety and depression. I feel like I've wasted the best years of life and it's grating at my soul every day how far behind I am compared to other people.

I began to notice really bad social anxiety when I left school for college. I attended college for 3 years and didn't make a single friend. In my 4th and final year, I slightly came out of my shell and got to know 3 or 4 people. I partied with them as much as I could, however, I didn't gain any lifelong friends from the experience like the vast majority of people do.

In fact, the decade has been an utter failure socially. I haven't made a single new friend since I left school aged 18.

Career-wise, I've also failed. I majored in a pretty esoteric field of statistics known as actuarial science. I got my degree and I worked for only 12 months in a trainee role in that field, from age 23-24. My social anxiety became unmanageable in an office environment, and I also hated the thought of working 8 hours per day on Excel and MS Access for the next 40 years.

I randomly decided to call myself a writer in late-2015 and carved out a living as a freelance writer. I don't earn much but I get enough to survive. I have no colleagues because I work alone on my laptop, and it's been that way since September 2015, which is now almost 4 years ago. I log in to Facebook and see pics of former colleagues out partying, going to each others' weddings, and doing activities together, and I feel like an idiot for taking the isolated path I chose.

Objectively, I have had some cool experiences in my 20s. I went to southeast Asia alone in 2013 for 6 weeks. However, comparing myself to other solo travellers, I was nowhere near as sociable as I could or should have been. I spent much of that vacation taking in sights and cities alone because of my social anxiety.

I made a couple of backpacker friends in Laos and partied with them for a week or two; I went out for drinks with a French guy I met at a cooking class in Thailand, and I went out with a group of backpackers on Khao San, but that was it. Oh, and I had to go home early from my backpacking trip because of a bad flare-up of panic attacks.

With the nature of my writing work being location independent, I decided to return to Thailand in 2016, which is a place I particularly loved during my backpacking trip because of the amazing food there. I lived there with my (Thai) girlfriend for 6 months. While that might sound great, I still spent the majority of my time alone working on my laptop.

I returned again to live in Thailand in 2017 and 2019, again for 6 months in each year. Again, though, my social life was non-existent to sporadic. I had a combined total of about 15 nights out with other travellers/expats during those 2 years.

I forgot also to mention I went to Australia in 2015 on a working holiday visa. I stayed at this really extroverted backpackers hostel but I only spoke with maybe 3 or 4 people during my stay there and it was sporadic interaction rather than becoming friends with them. I worked in a supermarket and on a butternut squash farm for a combined total of 3 months before returning home with my tail between my legs because I felt too lonely, depressed, and anxious.

Anyway, as you can see, I've spent much of this decade really isolated. I've tried to do things despite my anxiety and depression but they've always got in the way and ruined those experiences. I can't help but regret it all and wonder how different my life would've been if I wasn't socially anxious or depressed. How many more friends I would've had; how much more I would've got out of all those experiences I mentioned.

I travelled also to Budapest alone in 2017, but you won't be surprised to find out I was genuinely alone for 70% of my stay there. I have good memories of a pub crawl and boat party, but what kind of guy goes to a new city, checks into his sociable hostel, and wanders around alone most of the time?

It's like if you write the story of my 20s down on paper it all sounds ok but only I know the subjective isolation, anxiety, and loneliness I've felt throughout this decade and throughout these experiences.

I needed to get that off my chest so thanks for reading. I guess the advice I'm looking for is how to come to terms with a wasted 20s?",19Aug2019,3

396,"For context, I'm 18, about to go to university in another country.

These last few months I've been working on myself and getting proper help. I've always had problems with fitting in and making friends, partly because of some personal issues. I've improved a lot and now I feel so comfortable being myself and not caring about what people think, and accepting my differences.

I'm going to travel to a foreign country to study in university in about a month. I'm really looking forward to it, studying what I enjoy sounds great, plus I'll get to practice speaking a language that's not my native one and meet new people.

However, I am also nervous. As I said I now feel more at ease when it comes to socialising. I decided to stay in halls for first year and I already got to know a few people in my course, as well as other first year students, through social media, and I can't wait to meet them irl and to get to know my flatmates.
The thing is, the people I'm talking to all talk about their fun stories from high school, or how they can't wait to go out and drink. Nothing wrong with that, that sounds fun and I can't wait to have a good (and responsible) time. But it makes me feel insecure because I don't have any stories to tell, I have no experience partying, I don't even know the names of drinks. I don't even know how it is to hang out with a group of people and just... talking in general. I told them that and they were pretty chill about it and gave me some nice advice, and were really nice about it (I was scared that there would be too much pressure to drink in uni, but the people are pretty chill so I feel a bit relieved). Still, I'm scared that they will realise there's something off about me. I don't want them to think I'm a faker and that I used to be an absolute loser.

I guess my best bet is to stay true to myself, even if that sounds frightening. I'm probably just overthinking it anyway, as I usually do.
If you have any advice for my inexperienced self, though, I'd be super thankful!

So the original plan was that my stepmom, my dad, my little stepsister, my stepbrother and I would be going on the trip. 

However, this morning I was in the car with my dad on our way to the mall in order to buy se things for the trip tomorrow. All of the sudden he says: ""I haven't decided whether I should tell your stepmom that there's a possibility that only you and I will be going."" Let it be said that I wasn't aware of this arrangement that he had made. 

I feel like this is a jerk thing to do on his part and this isn't the first time he's done something like this. I want to call him out for it but  I don't know how he'll react and I'm already having a fairly anxiety induced day so  I really don't want to get shouted at. I'm also leaning towards not going on the trip tomorrow if he does decide to not take the rest of the family along.

And I feel that I've found the root cause, her mother. And before anything else, I love my MIL, but she is just too positive, so much so that any real criticism, of anything, is ignored. And it's not just about my fiance, she does it to me too.

Flying is just like a video game for me, it is literally like bringing flight simulator of windows to real life; fun to do and learn at the beginning but then it dies out for me. I don’t know if I’m just being lazy an irresponsible with my step dad that have already spent 90 thousand dollars of his hard earned money that he worked his ass off just to give it to me and not wanting to study.

My parents have even told me that I’m going back to Venezuela and that my dad ( he is actually my step dad) will stop paying for me and that my mom will be forced to go back to Venezuela to live with me, and that will cause a separation between the two because they won’t keep in a long distance relationship (I’m in the US right now).

413,"So here it goes, it was a family reunion type thing for thanksgiving i believe, and it was at my stepdads side of the family’s house. I didnt know any of them, they werent my family and my stepdad was a piece of shit so they definitely werent in any way “family” to me. We had an akward long dinner with bits of small talk, i was 8-9 at the time and i moslty was hanging out with my cousins. My step dad’s stepdad (well call him “g”) kept asking me to sit on his lap. (Keep in mind im not biologically related to him and i just met him that day when my stepdad introduced me) That already was odd because i was a fairly big child and i think 8ish or 9 is a bit old to be sitting on a lap. I kept finding excuses to leave like going to the bathroom or getting more food, but he kept calling me back to him. I said i didnt want to a few times and acted like he didnt hear me, which was bullshit because i said it fairly loudly. He was pretty weird like that the rest of the night and i was uncomfortable and my cousins were looking at me like “wtf is g doing to u”. Eventually dinner was over and my mom and stepdad were walking to their car, and g told them he wanted to walk me to my cousins car with him and he’ll bring me right back to them. It was a pretty fucking long walk to my cousins car and my energenic little cousins were trotting to the car, i wanted to run with them but g kept holding me back. He started giving me a shoulder rub but his hands were no where near my shoulders, to put it bluntly he was massaging my nipples. I kept trying to squirm away but he would just squeeze me harder and stay stuff like “come on, spend time with me dont leave” when i tried to squirm away. His wife (my stepdads mom) started walking up to us because one of my cousins left a toy in the dining room or something like that, shes very drunk and stumbling, She hands off whatever she went to us to give, and when hes talking to her i slide away and trot to my cousins so he thinks im busy hanging out with them and wont try to get me next to him again, i finially caught up to them but when he caught up to me he grabbed me again. We still werent at the car and my cousins leave me again and trot away from us, and g starts massaging my nipples really fucking hard like to the point of pain where i cant walk good. We finally get to my cousins car, and they drive home, now its just me and him walking another 15ish minutes to my moms car. (I swear everyones car was parked about a half mile away from where we had dinner) and he keeps doing the thing. We get to my moms car and she looks angry and asked him why it took so long and he said it was beacause i was playig with my cousins, which is odd because he wouldnt let me play with my cousins because he wanted to give me a “massage” instead. Me, my mom and stepdad drove home and that was the end of it. I kept thinking and thinking if it was an accident or his hand slipped or whatever the fuck else. Its been really bothering me lately (im 12 almost 13 now) and it doesnt make any sense how someone can accidentally do something like that!! Its a big difference your shoulders and your nipples and maybe his hands reached that far because his hads were long or some shit. I dont know what to think about it im trying to figure it out but i cant. I just need a fresh opinion from an outsider on this sorry if im rambling its 4:23 am and i cant sleep",19Aug2019,0
414,"Hi, so my sister usually ends up giving me tons of her clothes every year, because she's a shopaholic and wants to throw them away, so she tells me to take the ones I want first and then throw the rest away. I only take a few pieces usually, but I noticed that my sister always ends up grabbing them a year later, out of my clothes, and just wearing them. Whenever I tell her why she's wearing my sweater for example, she just says ''you know it was mine right'', and I just tell her I know it was hers, but I would just like her to tell me she's gonna borrow it. Instead anytime I confront her, saying it's rude to act like it's their clothes when they gave it away a year ago, she tells me if I don't shut up she will just take them back and hide them at her boyfriends house. 

I didn't mind this at first since she would usually ask me or tell me she was gonna use it, but this year she started taking anything she wants, and blaming me for not asking HER to give my sweater back, when I didn't even know she still had it. Does anyone know how to deal with this without wanting to scream? I really don't know what to do, since she really doesn't listen and just gets entitled :/",19Aug2019,1

Very curious what others think of my situation. Am I desperate? Probably. Should I stop caring/looking and let it come naturally? Back to the trusty hand? Tinder sucks for anything less than 10.5/10 perfect men. Maybe I need to get a girl in CA/Europe. NA women never give me a chance.

I’m an INFP/ENFP so l’m naturally inclined to help people, have adventurous/imaginative thoughts and dreams, and appreciate having the freedom to express what I feel. Initially I had wanted to study medicine but then I discovered the cool field of bioengineering and decided to major in it, however my parents shut this idea down due to not having “many career prospects” in the future for bioengineering in my country, and it kinda upset me. They told me to look into medicine. So I did, because well I’ve always had an interest in the human body. So I started searching about current med students’ and physicians’ thoughts on their lives now and realized that med school and residency are REALLY DEMANDING like REAAAAAALLLYY and they might even manage to break a person and take away their creativity and spark, I‘m really scared for that as I love my creativity and imagination. Don’t get me wrong,  I love helping people and the human body, Im just not sure if I’m cut out for med school after reading all the negative and life-affecting aspects it.

430,"I (24F) spent around 1,5 years ""unemployed"" (by choice, I was't looking for job) studying to a test to work as   
administrative assistant at a court in my country. I had just graduated and I was 22 years old. These tests are very hard because there are many candidates. I applied for more than one job, and in one of them there was like 80k candidates and my position was 115 (they only classify 1k, and these people are able to get summon up, but not necessarily will). They summon up more people as other people retire or quit, but they are not obliged to summon up everybody. There are big chances I get summon up, but I can't know if I will or when. They can convoke people for 4 years. 1 year since I was approved was passed, so I have 3 more years and there are 30 people left until it get's to me. 

In january this year I decided to get a job and I started working at a place that I ended up not liking. On my first day I had already hated it and I said to my boyfriend and family (I still live with them) that I would be there only for a week and that I would quit. After one week, I was located in another department that was way better then the place I was before, but I still wasn't exactly happy, but I was okay. In february I saw a really cheap plane ticket to Spain ( I live in South America) for November and me and my boyfriend decided to buy it. The plan was to get the tickets and I would quit my job to go (and he has vacations, I don't, only in september next year), but we decided that when it was closer to the trip we would analyze the situation and decided if I would really quit. The decision was mine. 

I was ready to go. Everything is planned, cities, hotels, city tours (everything is refundable thought). But last week I received an e-mail saying the airline changed the flight time, and it made me loose another flight (that I could buy again because it is not that expensive). I could either accept the change or choose another flight time, or ask for refund. The possibility of getting a refund made me really confused. Sometimes I'm  superstitious  and I started thinkin maybe this was a sign for me to cancel the trip and stay in my job. Things are better at work. I can't say it's my dream job, I work a lot (44 hours a week), but now it's part of my routine, I'm used to it, I'm closer to my work colleagues. It's kind of boring, but it's okay. Being honest my family has enough money to support me while I'm unemployed until I get a new job, but of course I like having my financial independece. I'm a little afraid I can't get a new job after I come back and this worrys me too. However there is the job I applied to, maybe it won't take too long until they contact me (but it is not certain)

Also I'm very anxious and travelling has been a trigger for me, but I absolutely LOVE travelling. I know it would be a little challenging, but I don't want to stop doing things because I'm anxious. My boyfriend was looking forward to this trip also, another reason why I didn't wan't to cancel it. I don't know if I'm being stupid for quitting a job to go on a trip, or if I should enjoy things, go to my trip and then when I come back I work things out.

438,"Hello. I am a 23 year old girl that used to post nude photographs of myself on reddit and other websites, mostly for attention. I always tried to avoid posting pictures with my face but I repeatedly would be asked to show it, so eventually I gave in and started posting them. Most of the time they'd never get above 90 upvotes before I got scared and removed them. I also would send nude photographs of myself to people I would chat with in chat rooms and occasionally they would have my face in them, but I would usually ask the person to not save photos that include my face, and to not save at all preferably. Now that time has passed since I've engaged in this kind of activity, I'm having guilt and regret about what I've done. I just feel like I went down the wrong path and may have potentially ruined my life if these image somehow surface in the future. I just think of my parents and my life before I did anything like this and how I was not as 'open' and 'sexual' and how I miss those times. Now that I've made this kind of content, I feel like I'll never be able to be innocent or 'normal' again and leave the house knowing that this kind of stuff will make the light of day. Am I being egotistical? 

I have really bad anxiety and a few days ago, someone on a dating app asked if I knew my videos of me doing 'things' were 'all over the internet'. I remember the video that had my face included didn't go above 5,000 views I think. I literally almost had a heart attack and I got super dizzy and wanted to vomit. I told him I removed those videos months ago and he said okay, and then I asked if he saw them on other websites and said no, just the one that I uploaded to. The reason I know he wasn't making it up was because he used specific details of that video when he told me this information, and said he had seen me on this dating app where I previously lived. Then, he asked me if I wanted to meet him IRL and I said no and deleted my account promptly after. So, he set me off but also freaked me out for no reason. One of the main reasons why I uploaded videos to that website (one time with my face in the video..) was because you can't download videos from there. For some reason I keep having this persistent anxiety in the back of my head since talking to this person that they'll notice me in town and that a lot of people somehow found a way to download the video with my face or have seen the video and that I'll be noticed IRL. I guess all I'm trying to ask is, can someone please help me calm down and stop worrying about this? I can't stop worrying that tons of people have saved my photos and will keep them forever.

444,"Look. This isn't what it sounds like, but it's pretty much what it sounds like. I started dating this guy Eric (fake name, obviously) half a year ago, we went to the same middle school and high school, and we got in touch during my sophomore of college. Eric was in a relationship a while before we got together, but it ended rather terribly when his ex accused him of domestic violence and slandered his name on social media. It then stuck to Eric that he was a ""woman-abuser,"" a danger to the community, and that no one should hire him. 

I never paid much attention because I didn't really know Eric at the time nor his girlfriend, but I felt sympathy for his girlfriend... A lot of time passes, and I notice that Eric is now hitting me up on social media. We would chat from time to time because we had the same taste in music, and we would share songs back and forth. I decided to message him to hang out one night because he didn't seem like a bad guy, he actually seemed really nice from our conversations. I did however keep that incident with his ex in my mind. 

That night I first hung out with him, I asked him what exactly happened with him and his ex. He explained his side of the story, and I listened and sympathized with a grain of salt of course. He explains that what happened with his ex was an exaggeration of what actually happened, and to make a long story short, it always takes two to tango. However, as I found myself hanging out with Eric more, we saw that there was definitely a strong connection between us. We started dating, and as time went on I could see that he wasn't completely healed from his past relationships and the incident with his ex. He would act out in ways where it would show that trust issues and insecurity was still something he possessed. He also had severe depression which brought up some issues in our relationship, but I had empathy for what he was going through and I wanted to work things out. Sure, anybody else in a relationship with Eric at his current state of mind might've deemed him as ""toxic"" or ""abusive"", but I don't believe that to be so in his situation. I just think oftentimes people have certain mental health issues that need to be addressed and worked through, before trying to build a relationship... We broke up recently, but it was an amicable breakup that was best for both of us.

Throughout our relationship, I never felt like I was in danger or that Eric was about to hit me. He would break down after a long day when his anxiety was too much, and would just cry to me about what happened with his ex. From the story he first told me when we first hung out to now, I've been piecing every part and I truly think his side is more truthful than his ex's. 

To get to the point, Eric's ex has called me names on social media for dating him which I think is really petty and unnecessary. She tried to make it seem like she cared for my safety with Eric, but never did I receive a direct message from her. She constantly jokes about what happened on her social media, which is why I think she's full of shit. I know this is not my place at all, but I really do care for Eric, and I truly don't believe that what was said online and on the posters that his ex stapled around town is true. I don't plan to call anybody out in a disrespectful, but I feel like many of the people who follow me on social media know about what happened.

446,"Hello, I'm 21 and well to start off, My grandma recently just passed away. She meant a lot to the family and it effected the whole family majorly especially my mom and my uncle (Grandma was the mother for the 2 of them). My sister and I stayed by her side at home watching her peacefully sleep until her breathe was the last one in this Earth.  We miss our grandma a lot since she made all the food for the family ever since I was born. Now that shes gone it quite a challenge to accept her death.

Currently my Uncle is setting up for the funeral service and life from here on out will be going really fast. First my uncle had a talk with my sister and I about life after the funeral. For now most of this is just planning ahead so things can change after the funeral. My uncle is planning to sell the house so that he can move out and go to his relatives in Vietnam. Before he does though, we all going to find a new place to live and set everything up for a stable life. After finding a new place, things will get complex. First our uncle will talk to my sister and I about living in the real world, as we still have yet to know much about it. Second, once the knowledge have passed, my uncle wants me to take over the responsibility of taking care of the family in things like paying the house bills, taking my mom to work, etc. Finally when everything is settled my uncle will say his goodbyes and a new life begins.

Now the plan on paper seems decent, but the only factor that might hinder this is me. A little history about me is that after graduation of high school, I decided to find some work, but no luck so far. I had a few interviews but not a job though. As for college, FASFA couldn't help me out pay for classes. So I just spent time on seeing what I actually enjoy and what I don't. This is from 2 years ago. Well you know where this is going to go. Since I barely have any experience in the real world, taking this huge responsibility is overwhelming me. The more I think about it the more confusing it get. Thoughts like ""If I never had a job before then how can I live in a stable new life"" or ""Nobody wants to risk hiring a person who have no experience or went to school in the field."" are quite stressful. I try to be positive as reality is pretty difficult without anyone to support you. The most important things to me is my family and if I can't succeed then later on I be just left with nothing just like my uncle and I really don't want that to happen.

At the moment, I just really don't know what to do. I really want to help but I just don't know where to begin as once after the funeral, all of this responsibility will be thrown at me and it might crush me. If you have any advice that might help me please do tell. I'll update as time goes by.",19Aug2019,1

The fact I used to get good grades just fucks it up more, because now their expectations are super high.

449,"Hi everyone,

I \[29/F\] had a very brief romantic fling with a guy \[35/M\] at work. Basically, I got drunk at his house, and then he said he wanted to sleep with me, but he resisted because I was drunk and he wasn't surer if I was capable of consent. It was going to progress to a relationship, but it never did.  I always felt he was the one that got away.

I contacted him recently for some assistance with work-related activities, and he has been very obliging. He said to contact him if I need further help. I asked him to coffee, and he said 'of course'.

I am hoping for a friendship, not sure what is on his mind.

What do you think his thoughts are on the situation? Would you have contact with an old flame if happily married?

Many thanks!",19Aug2019,2

458,"TLDR; essentially the title.

Met this guy from Tinder end of last year and we had drinks for a few hours. He was super nice but lacked aspirations (turn off for me) and was very self deprecating. I then moved 100 miles away and blocked and unlocked him on social media so we didn't follow each other.

5 months later, I move back, and he requests to follow me. I suddenly felt guilty as hell. I messaged him and apologised, saying that I wasn't looking for anything serious and didn't want to waste his time, hence I blocked him (which is true). 

Anyway, we chat every few days for a couple months and after declining him asking for drinks again, I decide to ask him myself (not sure why, I guess in all honestly I just wanted to date around). He said yes and we set a date - which is tomorrow. 

For context, this is the type of guy who replies almost instantly. I have been very busy with work so I reply every couple days and still receive a message back within an hour. I don't know what was going through my head when I asked him out, but I regret it.

I don't want to waste his time, and I don't want to go out with him. He's clingy, has no aspirations and in all honestly I want more for myself. At the same time, I'd feel horrible ghosting him again, even though I know it would be for good this time.

Should I just go to put an end to this? Or is ghosting him a feasible way out, knowing that I am then not wasting his time?

Growing up I always wanted a dog. I seriously remembered begging my mom for a dog since the age of 5. I go to college a year later my mom gets them a dog. 
Both my younger sisters got braces. Growing up my mom would “joke” about my buck teeth. Never got me braces. So as an adult I asked her if she would go half on braces with me and she agreed. Halfway into my treatment, she “didn’t mean to leave me out to dry” but she did. She said she couldn’t afford to help me with the payments anymore yet my youngest sister gets knocked up and she’s planning and paying for a baby show. 
We also moved around a lot. There was 4 years in a row I went to different schools. She finally got her shit together for them. They have childhood friends, they got to grow up with. I also never got that. 
I also called her the day I was putting my dog down to tell her. Thinking maybe she could offer some help or words of encouragement. Boy, I was so wrong. She asked if she could call me back, that my sister and her baby were about to leave. I just feel like I have never been important to her. She knew how much I loved my dog. He was my everything, my 1st dog. The dog she never got me.  I just wanted a couple of mins. 
What’s really putting the icing on the cake for me right now is that she is coming to visit me. Her and my aunt. They had to delay the trip because of a death. I’m totally fine with them coming 2 days later but what really hurts me is that she didn’t even tell me that she was coming at a later date. By chance I spoke to my aunt and she told me. I called my mom yesterday and asked her why she didn’t tell me sooner. She said that it didn’t even occur to her to tell me. Those words hurt me so bad.

I was a little controlling. I would get jealous (we both would). We got way too comfortable and didn’t see family and friends enough. We were like a married couple and she thought we were too young for that. 

All of this led to her falling out of love with me. We lived together for 2 years and recently moved an hour so we could be close to her fam and friends. Now I’m stuck here for at least a year+. She’s two streets down.

A few nights ago we hungout and I was pathetic. I was practically begging for another chance. She shot it down just saying no and being kinda cold. I told her I had to block her and not see each other for a while. 

Well the other day she texts me saying “I wish we could hang right now, you’re the easiest person for me to talk to and we can’t even have that now. I guess it’s my turn to be depressed.” 

We hungout and she still says she doesn’t want a relationship with anyone right now but didn’t shoot it down in the future but doesn’t want to lead me on or promise anything if it doesn’t work. We were hanging outside and she was crying to sad songs. We hugged and cried. At the end of the night she was just waiting in the car and I was like “so do you want me to kiss you or?” And she said yeah, it happened and she was like “ahh it’s so weird now, it feels familiar but so different.” She said she actually still is in love with me but it’s different now. She texted me the next day saying I know we have a chance to work in the future 

We were deciding if it’s best for us to work on stuff by ourselves and not hangout or continue to hangout with no expectations. I’m not sure what to do. I want her back but I need to work on not acting like that. 

Well yesterday she saw my story on snap and thought I was on a date and she said “have fun on your date I have one tonight too”. I asked her why she’s trying to hurt me and she said “you can sleep with other girls but I can’t even hang with guys?” (I told her I slept with another girl since the breakup when she asked). 

I texted her last night saying how’d it go and she left me on read at 1:30 am. So she definitely fucked this dude but I can get over that since I have been with girls since too. I just don’t know if I should hold on. I said get even and let me know if you want to keep seeing people because I have to if you’re going to. Not sure what to do.

I was already working full time whilst doing a college course,so I felt that everything would work out in the end. 

My ex turned on me not far into the pregnancy. Verbally abusive and was very controlling. I had to call her every night for a couple of hours,on some occasions Id end up falling asleep.... Just to get abuse in the morning. I felt physically trapped(I still do). She stopped me seeing my friends and family(turned my family against me).

I ended up losing my job so things just got worse and worse. After months and months of people telling me to just leave her(even my course tutors got involved) I finally caved and ended things.

And then the accusations and abuse got worse. Got accused of stealing money,never loving her etc. Got threated that her father was gonna ""set me straight"".

Now our son is 5. He doesn't want to see me,but is alright with facetiming(usually consist of pulling silly faces and the little games that is on facetime)I havent physically seen him in 3 years as Ive got no way of getting there(I never have been able to drive),but I face time him twice a week(last week i didnt as my mental state hit an all time low). And always pay what I can afford each month(around 15% of what i earn),Im only on part time but been looking for full for ages. 

Now Ive found a place to rent,it is going to cost pretty much my entire pay check meaning I don't know if im gonna be able to pay my ex. But if I dont pay the rent and deposit,I will be homeless,I have no where else to go.

Im disgusted that this is how my life turned out and I hate the fact I feel no connection with my son,all I ever see in him is my ex. I just cannot see past all the abuse and toxic abuse I had to deal with.

I seriously have considered just walking away and let my son enjoy life with my ex and her fiance. In my situation,Im not capable of being a father to my son.

1. I go to community college and it’s a medium sized campus. Last semester I spent a lot of time with my ex girlfriend there. I had a class with her and then we would always get lunch and just spend a lot of time there. I was never a big school guy. She actually motivated me a lot. I felt like I finally had something to work for. Anyway, like I said it’s probable that I will run into her someday this semester. We are friends. We talk about once a week or so (I know that’s unhealthy because I still have feelings for her.) but all is good. The only bad blood is that she started dating a close friend  of mine but I’m over that.

I spent the whole last semester with her and I’m nervous to go to school because I feel empty. I don’t have her next to me and I just wanna give her a big ol hug. I don’t know.

480,"I was offered a job with the local city government and need to let them know by today or tomorrow if I would like to accept. The job is technically in the realm of my degree, but not quite. I went to school for Mechanical Engineering and the job is basically Civil Engineering (working with transportation departments and construction). The pay is lower than my current job, but I never went the engineering route so I understand the low pay based off of lack of experience and it being an entry level job. I currently am a teacher and the school year is quickly approaching. I finally felt like I was getting my bearings since this will be my fourth full year and I’ll be teaching a more enjoyable subject matter. I like teaching, but I know I do not want to stay in that career path forever. I’m worried that if I don’t pick the engineer position it will permanently close the door into getting anything technical since it has been almost 10 years since I graduated from university with my engineering degree and have no experience other than my research projects during that time. I also feel like civil is not really my calling, but experience is experience. Lastly, I also am having issues with leaving at the very start of the year and having the students start with a sub rather than a teacher (area is not really favorable so it is difficult to find teachers). I know I am good at teaching and have made valuable impacts to students, but I am wearing myself ragged and may have already burnt myself out. I have been trying to work my way towards a job that I could work remote from at least 50% of the time because I think it will help my mental health. I’m sorry for the rant and rambling, I have just been driving myself crazy and am looking for any sort of guidance period.

482,"Here’s some backstory: 

Last spring semester I was a sophomore in college. My roommate and I were convinced that we were both going to make spring semester the best semester we’ve ever had. After Christmas break, we arrived back at school and went to a few parties. We ended up going to the bars, I went home with a guy I didn’t know, and long story short I was assaulted. I’m not the type of girl to encounter such a horrific scenario and do nothing, so I went to the hospital, got a SANE kit completed, and went through the Title IX process with the university. After three months, the university wanted to expel this man, but after a hearing (included myself, his lawyer, him, and a few representatives from the university) they closed all sanctions. He will be returning to the university next fall like nothing happened. 
While this was happening, my roommate got caught smoking weed on campus. Whenever you get in trouble with the police, they follow up with the university. She was going to get suspended for over a year, because this wasn’t her first offense (other offenses included use of a fake ID, possession of alcohol underage, etc). So while I was going through my Title IX case, she was worried about getting suspended. 
In March my roommate SOMEHOW defied the odds (she had a great lawyer) and appealed her case, and ended up staying on campus. Meanwhile, her and I got into a huge fight, so I moved out into my new room downstairs in the dorm. 
So, yeah, now we hate each other, and she had been my best friend since sixth grade. 
My semester was full of other small things, too. My best friend decided she wanted to transfer. I had mono for two weeks. I ended up getting a 2.5 GPA. With everything going on, I found myself drinking not just a few times a week, but every day. I never ate, I lost almost 20 pounds. It was a mess.

So, tomorrow I’m moving into a house off campus. There’s seven other girls, including the girl I lived with who was about to get suspended. I still love her dearly, but whenever we tried to discuss things in the past she’d ignore me. I’m absolutely petrified to go back in fear of seeing her, seeing my assailant at the bars, fear of not getting my grades up... You get it. 

Anybody have any similar stories? And if so, how did you cope? What did you do? Obviously “think positively” but I need straight forward step by step advice on what I should do.",19Aug2019,1

485,"I really didn't think this would be hard as I already have a full time job and have been working since I was 16 so have plenty of experience.   


I currently have a full time job as an administration assistant in an accountancy firm. I have been working for here just short of a year. Before that I was an admin assistant for a business to business telecommunications company for just short of 3 years. Between the ages of 16 and 20 I worked in cafes and a supermarket.   


I work in the city centre (about half an hour away from where I live) from 9AM till 5:30PM. I have been trying to find a job in the city centre nearby so I can start work at my second job from 6pm till 11PM latest - to ensure I can still catch the last train home as driving and parking in the city centre would pretty much cancel out my second wage.

&amp;#x200B;

I have applied for a cleaners job, I have applied for multiple waiters jobs, and more recently, I applied for a delivery driver job 8 minutes way from my house (I have a car fully insured with MOT, which I made sure to mention in my covering letter).   


I haven't so even as heard back from any of these. It's so frustrating as it's not as if I don't have the skills for the jobs I'm applying for as I have worked in those industries before, I even studied catering and hospitality at college. I need the second job to help pay off some debt quicker, as I have other things I want to to save for so need my money to stop going into  paying off my debt.

I’m really depressed, and I have severe social anxiety, like, the worst social anxiety I’ve ever fucking seen in anyone. I’ve never had a job before because the thought of going in for an interview fucking terrifies me and I hyperventilate. And obviously at my age I have to get a job soon or my parents will probably kick me out. I don’t get along with my father so he probably would kick me out if my mom wasn’t a bit more understanding of my situation. I don’t know what the fuck to do with my life, I think about killing myself often because I see know possible future where I will ever be happy. Oh and here’s another thing that I don’t expect many people to understand, I have a phobia of driving. It terrifies me. And that severely limits the things I can do and places I can go. I think it’s a side effect of my anxiety. So if I ever do get a job, it’s just going to be some shitty minimum wage job within walking distance where I perform menial tasks for the rest of my existence. I see no fucking point to live like that. One thing that gives me hope is that possibly one day I would find a girlfriend who is understanding and would be willing to provide for me, so basically I would be a house-husband I guess, which most people would ridicule me for even saying I want that, because it’s only socially acceptable for women to be housewives. But I can’t get a girlfriend because I’m not very attractive, my anxiety prevents me from leaving the house, and I get so fucking nervous around women it’s ridiculous and they think I’m a freak. My face gets all red and I just go quiet and it gets awkward. I know someone will say, go see a therapist, but how the fuck can I talk to a therapist when my social anxiety is so bad I feel like throwing up just from thinking about talking to someone I’m not comfortable around.

Here’s the part, it’s an outdoor/festival kind of environment and everyone’s probably gonna be intoxicated to a certain point, and I don’t wanna feel like I need to drink so much to get rid of that anxiety. I’d definitely want to have a few drinks (not with the intention to just numb my anxiety). 
What kind of preparation can I do before the event so I’m not stressed? I know my partner would be hanging out with his crew (they don’t usually hang bc they’re coming out of town) so they’d def be doing some catch ups. I definitely wanna join the convo and have people get to know me and I’m so afraid it’s gonna be one of those situations where I sit in the corner and be confused and fucking left out.

499,"I'd really appreciate some insights into what is normal problem solving when dealing with a violent 4 year old (recently diagnosed with autism)

My nephew (4 years old) was recently diagnosed with autism.

He has been violent since about 18 months. It began with biting shoulders of his parents. Then pinching, he would bite and pinch other children in his day care as well. 

His younger brother was born 1 &amp; 1/2 years ago and is constantly pinched, pushed, bitten, body slammed etc. So younger brother is always clinging to his parents I assume from fear/anxiety.  

Recently 4yr old pushed as hard as he could into my pregnant belly while I was sitting down. It was very painful and upsetting. Prior to this he has never been violent towards me. His parents way of dealing with the violence is to actively ignore it. 

Im not sure if a professional told them to respond this way? He sees several different specialists. 

His mother has  complex anger problems and mood swings. I wondered if he was mirroring her behaviour more than anything else? He is often not behaving frustrated or angry before the violence (not obviously anyway). He has never been violent toward himself either.

Is ignoring his violent behavior normal? I worry they  are not teaching their son empathy by ignoring his behavior instead of explaining what he is  doing 
Is not appropriate and why.

I am very hesitant to let him be near my newborn when she is born because of his propensity to violence. I worry it's just going to keep getting worse.",19Aug2019,2

509,"Hello!

I’m a full time employee in a warehouse attached to a retail location. In the warehouse, aside from supervisors, there are only two full time positions. 

I have one of those positions, and I’ll be discussing the differences between myself and the other full-timer (my opposite). 

Technically speaking, the two of us are of equal standing. He has a few years on me, I have a forklift license and a few other qualifications on him. All in all, we should be treated fairly and equally. 

I have a car, he does not. This is the one thing that apparently makes it okay for our employer to schedule me all over the place time-wise, often giving me 6am starts, 9am starts, and closing shifts all in the same week (my next week schedule has me going from close to open day after day all week), while his schedule’s variations are literally a few hours. His earliest start time is 10am, and his latest is 12noon. I’ve asked my supervisor about this, and all he said was that it was because I had a vehicle, whereas my coworker busses around the city. 

I have other coworkers who bus, and their start times, while not as wildly changing as mine, are much more so than my full time coworker. My supervisor even made the joke of saying if I were to sell my car, I’d get more shifts like that, which still smells like bullshit to me, as you shouldn’t be scheduling your employees based on their means of transportation (I understand leaving a bit of leeway for employees who do use public transport, but IMO it’s unfair to employees who own vehicles to treat them differently because of that, everyone should be held to the same expectation). 

I’ve discussed this with my manager in the past, and all that happened was my coworker went from working a steady 11:30 shift to working the occasional 10:30 or 12:30. 

I don’t have issue with my coworker getting these shifts, I have issue with my manager saying the schedule is supposed to be fair (his justification for scheduling me wildly, saying I have to work a few closers here and there, but then also scheduleing me for 6am in the same week?) and then scheduling the other full timer (whom, in theory should have the same availability that I do. Our company has a policy that full-timers are only allowed 1 day a week where they don’t work, my coworker is religious so his is Sunday, I don’t give a fuck so I haven’t signified a day I’d prefer to have off, as I feel that allows more freedom in my schedule. The policy also states that you can’t restrict any time-period on your days-on, meaning my coworker should technically be working just as many 6am and closing shifts as me, if my manager really is intent on making the schedule fair) a much more preferable schedule to mine.

I didn’t want to get into this, because I feel it makes it a little too personal, by my coworker is a known slacker on the job, time waster, literally everyone talks about him in the same breath; that he’s not good at his job and he wastes more time than he spends being productive. 

So I’d just like some advice on how to talk to my boss, HR, supervisor, whomever; as this is something that bothers me; having to work ridiculously variating hours (compared to my coworkers) while the other person, who’s supposed to be my equal, has hours that are very desirable. 

My place of employment is not unionized, and located in MB Canada.

514,"I've been best friends with this girl, Abby, for like 10 years or more. She's always been realllyyyyyyyy shitty with money, and I tend to generally pay for things when we go places. I don't mind this to a point, but I'm starting to be annoyed with it. 

The expenses there aside, I'm starting to think that she steals from me when she can. The first time I noticed and thought this was about 5 years ago when my sibling died unexpectedly. Abby lives in the same town as me and my sibling/family and was over to go the funeral. Another close friend of mine came in from out of town and that day my mom gave me and the out of town friend $30 for gas each because we're broke early 20s/late teens at this point. She didn't give any to Abby as she is in town and wouldn't be driving after she got to my house. I would drive everyone to the funeral, and my out of town friend had a 4 hour trip each way. Well about 20 minutes later the money in magically missing off of my desk and I had to ask my mom for money again. (for note, my parents are on the high end of poor, but definitely not middle class even, money is tight). I figured at the time I must have misplaced it, but I moved out a few months after this and never found the money like I expected to after tearing my room apart. 

This event has always bothered me, and I always assumed she took it, but I didn't feel I had the grounds to say anything (nor was I in a good emotional state to do so). Flashing forward to now, Abby asks me for money a lot. I have a decent job, and for our age group I do really well for myself. I usually dodge the question, because I don't want to just flatly say no, but in total I've given her hundreds and I know I won't see any back. She does have a 40 hour/week job that pays pretty well, and she has no major bills aside from car payment and insurance. I'm unsure if drugs are an issue for her, but I'm starting to consider it as an option. 

This weekend I drove her somewhere and now my headphones are missing from my car. My gut reaction to this is that I must have misplaced my headphones when I cleaned my car out to take her, but with our past I have doubts about misplacing them.

519,"My dad had a car crash before I was born and my mum got cancer when I was in my teens. When she passed I moved in with my aunt (her sister) and although I’m now 27, moved out of home, I am only now seeming to have real emotional trauma from this whole situation. 

I adored my mum, ofc I don’t literally mean I thought my aunt could replace her. My mum was always so loving and supportive, without knowing it (till now), I have desperately been trying to seek the same love and validation from my aunt to fill the void. Unfortunately my aunt is not only not maternal but very emotionally shut down. 

She is not career minded or academic, never left her home village and believes as long as she can keep a roof over her head and her beloved dog, she needs no more, and to want more is selfish/greedy. (I am not knocking this lifestyle at all, just giving you an idea of the type of person she is).

I have worked hard since leaving school. I have a good job and in 2017 moved to mainland Europe from the UK for work. I now live a life that’s by no means extravagant, but I’ve done well for myself. The better I do in life however, my aunt says an initial “well done” and then seems to be quite cold for a while.

In my teens she put me down a lot, made jokes about my small boobs, acne or cellulite, and it had a heavy impact on my self confidence. These days she comments about me having expensive taste. She always notices if I’m wearing new clothes, asks how much they all cost, even mainstream high street stuff, ASOS etc she finds expensive. She never contacts me, if I didn’t call/text we would barely speak. When I come home (every 6 weeks or so), shes happy to see me but tells me to “make sure I leave my old room as if I’d never been there”. 

I will be eternally grateful to her for what she did for me and I love her so much, but she reduces me to a shell of the person I am, other family members &amp; my bf get quite angry about it. I try to please her like one of her dogs, but I’ve come to realize I’m never going to get that approval I’m searching for. To be honest, it’s brought back a lot of grief from when my mum died. It’s like.. a second confirmation I don’t have a mum and will never have her again. 

I want to know how I can rid myself of this guilt I feel not being who my aunt seemingly wants me to be. How can I feel at peace with the fact I will never get that love and support from my aunt I crave, and actually stand up for myself when she puts me down? My family see her as very emotionally controlling. I’m so conflicted because she did so much for me, but I know that my relationship with her has become quite toxic. I feel like I’m grieving all over again.

TL;DR - I moved in with my aunt when I was a teenager and  have ever since tried to make her proud of me. 10 years on have come to see I will not get the approval I’ve been craving from her and I’m struggling with the realization. How do I free myself of these feelings of guilt and indebtedness?",19Aug2019,1
520,"Hey guys,
I just moved back to Australia after living in America for the past 5 years. I couldn’t afford college there and I would have had to get a visa. I spent my prime development years there. Just turned 18. I made a lot of friends and had a really great teenage life. I had to move back to Australia recently. My dad still lives in the states with my brother and my mum passed away 4 years ago. I’m staying with my grandma, but I’m not that close to her. I really don’t have anyone out here. I have a job now. And I am pretty much self sufficient. My dad can’t help me much money wise. I am a very strong person. Obviously I still have him and my brother, but time zones are very off and he has a job. I can’t talk to him or my American friends that much.  this leap from having friends, and constantly being social to me being all alone for the majority of my time, is kind of taking a toll. I’m thinking a lot which is good sometimes, but has also led to very negative self reflection. I don’t really know how to deal with this loneliness. I’m not doing any studying or anything right now and it’s kind of hard to make friends. 

I just need some advice for how to cope with loneliness.  And maybe options for making friends in a not desperate way. Also maybe if you guys have any good books about introspection or self help or anything.

532,"Hey Reddit!

So this situation I’m in requires a bit of a back story. I live in the United States. Back when I was about to finish 10th grade I was an excellent student mostly A’s and the occasional B. I was full of hope and ambition about the prospects of my future. I wanted to go into the field of computer science and eventually get into cyber security(still what I want to do). While riding on these high hopes and expectations I started the eleventh grade. I enrolled in the dual credit(completing high school and college credits at the same time) program at my local community college through my high school. The 2016 Fall semester starts and so far so good, I’m killing it in every class and I also become increasingly social and outgoing. Everything was going pretty great, I was happier than I ever was in my life. All of this literally comes crashing to a halt, when I got into a major accident in September of 2016. I was going straight through an intersection while it was my right of way and out of nowhere someone in a SUV decides to make a left into my dinky little car. The car was totaled and all the passengers in the car were injured. Thankfully the injuries weren’t too bad and everybody  made a full recovery. Anyways, this accident sent my life into a downward spiral I could have never expected. After the accident I got extremely depressed and I was self loathing because I could have prevented injury to loved ones and I couldn’t(as I was an inexperienced driver back then). This depression led to other bad habits like procrastination, overeating, becoming more reclusive and virtually no physical activity etc. If you look through my transcripts you can see the downwards trajectory of my grades following my accident. Somehow I managed to graduate high school. By the time of my graduation I was 50 pounds heavier and severely depressed and I was in no position to join any undergraduate program. So I decided to take a break from school for one year to improve my mental and physical health. In the past year I have made huge strides towards recovery. I joined a gym and lost over 50pounds and I started a media production company. Now I feel like I’m in a position to restart my academic journey and realize the dreams that I had for myself some years ago. Now I need some advice from you all, how do I get back on track. I have completed 39cr hrs and have attempted 59cr hrs. I want to get into a local 4 year program. I am grateful for any advice you all have. Thanks 🙏🏽.",19Aug2019,1

535,"So this is my first post on here and I’ll give you the run down. I’ve been married to my husband for a year and we live in our own house with an 8 month old kelpie puppy. My in laws live on the same property in a seperate house with their two dogs.

I know what everyone must think, never live with or adjacent to your in-laws. However we get on for the most part (if you remove some social and political opinions from the conversation) and it’s a good situation financially for us to save up for our first house together.

So, four months ago we rescued a puppy. I’ve never had my own dog before and I now work from home so it was an ideal and exciting prospect for me. It has not been without its difficulties. Kelpies are high strung anyway but my poor pup is really an ultimately fearful and nervous thing. At first he showed signs of aggression, was underweight &amp; fleabitten, and barked obsessively all day at me and everything. But we rose above it and I’m delighted to say he’s amazingly well-trained, obedient and sweet. We’ve bonded very well and he’s become the perfect oversized lapdog that i’ve dreamed of.

Except for chasing the horse. My in-laws own an elderly horse who has free roam of the acreage and sort of acts as a wild lawnmower. It’s not remotely tame and tries to bite whoever goes near it. My in-laws border collie chases it mercilessly and my puppy quickly learnt from her to do the same. I wasn’t having this, I feared him getting kicked and trampled so I work continually on his recall and walk him on a lead when near the horse and go for long walks elsewhere and have built him a large house yard. It works perfectly well for us, he gets enough exercise and I love the walks. Also I do realise I should’ve thought about the horse before adopting but honestly it didn’t come to mind at all as a potential issue until he started doing it.

Yet, for some reason my in-laws loathe him (which is odd as everyone including our trainer and vet ADORE him and compliment me on how well behaved he is). They think he is too hyper as he gets a bit wound up when greeting them, and they think I’m “suffering” as I have to walk him and that I should “just give the damn dog up”. 

It’s obviously become clear to them that i’m not giving him up so they’ve turned to advice. The advice being to “belt” him or “beat the shit out of him” as it’s “worked for all their dogs”. Which... it hasn’t as they’re extremely disobedient and still chase the horse. They have now brought this up four times with me despite my protests and they have begun to imply I’m too weak to have a breed like a kelpie and that he needs “a firm and aggressive hand”. 

The trainer who helps me with my dog has also worked with them on theirs but they totally ignore her positive reinforcement advice as over sensitive nonsense. I hate being around them now and can barely hide my fury at their treatment of my dog and their own. I can’t trust them to dogsit anymore and feel my relationship to them weakening. My husband just tells me to ignore them but I’m not good at letting things I care about drop. 

Is there any advice anyone has for me? Am I being too sensitive and should just turn the other cheek or is there something I can do to make them see that beating a dog is not a training method! 

TLDR; my dog chases the property horse and my in laws are pushing me to beat him in order to get him to stop",19Aug2019,1

539,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible but it needs some explaining. I have depression and a couple weeks ago started TMS therapy for it. TMS stands for transcranial magnetic stimulation, basically you sit in a chair and they lower a magnet onto your head to send pulses directed towards a specific part of your brain. The treatments are 5 times a week for 6 weeks to start with. It hurts a bit when you start but over time it'll get better and feel more like tapping. The usual nurse took last week off and the pulses to my head felt weaker so I thought it was just me getting used to it but today the regular nurse came back and I think it felt stronger. But maybe I'm just imagining it? What if it's my fault because I wasn't sitting in the chair in the right position?

My best friend recently revealed to me that he got a DUI several months ago, and his court showing will be in 2 weeks. After researching, most likely than not, he will get his license taken away from 6 months - 1 year. NJ is fairly by the books, so I doubt community service can be an option. It's his first offense, and he's definitely feeling remorse. He's a great guy, and this is a lesson for him well learned.

I've never seen him so distraught and stressed out since there will be so many complications such as work, travel, convenience, etc. My friends and I aren't familiar with this kind of situation, so we're unsure of how we can help at all. He's used to driving around everywhere, plus his commute to work is around 45 minutes everyday, so he'd either be taking a car service or using public transit.

Has anyone ever been in this kind of situation or have any ideas on how we can help him feel less stressed? Any advice is really appreciated, thanks!

CONTEXT:  Events leading up to the DUI. He was at a birthday party and there was a person there that he didn't want to be around, because he knew it might've led to a fight/just bad environment overall, so he wanted to go home. I'm not justifying his actions in any way. I wasn't there and, I wasn't able to stop him. He left quietly and didn't get far before he was caught. He knows he fucked up and knows it could've been much worse. At this point, I just want to know if there's anything we can do to help him in terms of getting through this.

548,"My grandmother died three weeks ago, and in her last month my grandfather asked that my gf and I move in with him so he wouldn't be too lonely- not in his house but on his property in the 'summerhouse' (something he's been asking us for 8+ yrs).. This 'summerhouse' is literally a shack with two outlets in a 50m\^2 space where the walls are damp, the floors are concrete and it's full of 70s junk.. it's not exactly liveable but I have always been close with my grandparents who were married for over 50yrs- my grandmother was very happy to hear I would be moving in with him before she died.. 

As well my grandfather and I made a verbal agreement where he said he would give me his old car, would pay me 1K for every month I live there + would guarantee me a couple million in inheritance for moving there- because my gf and I were giving up living in a city center apartment to move out to a shack in the farmlands pretty much.. in exchange I would have to move in by the 1st of the month, this gave us about 1 week to clear out the 'summerhouse' and move in- both my gf and I work full-time corporate jobs so we spent all of our free time the past 3 weeks setting stuff up. We made the deadline and have been 'living' there for about 2 weeks now- we've more or less been living in chaos and out of suitcases that whole time but just this weekend we finished setting everything up.

Now all of a sudden, my grandfather is enraged with us and has decided he doesn't want us living there but wants my younger brother to move in and has basically kicked us out and keeps talking up my younger brother.. Additionally he is constantly insulting us with everything we do and locking us out of areas we had previously agreed on sharing (ex. laundry room, garage, storage room etc.) Furthermore in the two weeks my grandmother has been dead, my grandfather has been out every day searching and scouting for a new wife (literally only talks about missing my grandmother to steer away from uncomfortable topics or when he's talking inappropriately), it's literally been like 1.5 weeks since her funeral... I am just speechless and disgusted, never knew he was like this...

So my gf and I took this deal for a few reasons: 1. to support my grandfather who I felt bad for before my grandmother died 2. to test and see if we like living on the country-side (we do, and if he didn't exist we would stay) 3. because my grandfathers property covers a huge piece of farming land where my girlfriend and I wanted to farm in the long-run 4. because of the money we were promised in the verbal agreement... 

Now due to my grandfather's flip out and my younger brother saying he would move in if were didn't live there, we are basically left with nothing, have been stressed and wasted the past month, are hated for some reason, and are kinda expected to move out asap.. The longer we stay the more rooms we are locked out of and the more we're hated by him.. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice on how to deal with this situation without being off worse than before we moved?

TL;DR My gf and I left our city center apartment to move in with my grandfather in the farmlands to help him out after the death of my grandmother based on an oral agreement which ensured us financial benefit, and now within 2 weeks of living there and just getting our place settled my grandfather has canceled the agreement and basically kicked us out",19Aug2019,3

We could commission based off meetings booked/held.  A great way this was happening was through an online platform in which customers would write in, we'd get there info, and set the meeting.  Rinse and repeat and you end up booking a lot of meetings.  The last SDR before me booked 27 in a month, which is about $2,000 bonus - and he said every month he was banking around there.  This morning, one of my bosses says our new commission plans will not include this type of meeting - only meetings that are booked going outbound, not leads that come inbound.  This really fucks over what we were told, and additionally, we're still in charge of monitoring the site for customers and booking meetings...even though we don't get paid for them now.

I am super sick right now and just need to sleep and relax so I can get over it but he's dependent on me entertaining him, I am also a student and cannot afford to keep feeding him every single meal and he hasn't offered to pay for groceries or make anything, my roommate is very annoyed with him staying here because he is messing up our apartment, hasn't showered in days so he smells awful, he took a huge shit in her bathroom the other night and didn't flush it, etc. He has completely overstayed his welcome and has become a burden in our place. 

I am unsure what to do. I feel so sick right now and I do not need to be worrying about him being here. I'm tempted to ask him to stay in an Airbnb for the mean time so I can just sleep this sickness off and to give a break to my roommate. I love my brother, but he is very clueless sometimes and will not pick up on little social cues like giving people their space, offering to pitch in, cleaning up behind himself, etc. What can I do and how should I confront him?",19Aug2019,2
552,"Hi All, need some guidance on what to do.

I am in the field of Architecture. After working in the public sector for my whole career in a project coordinator role. I took a leap of faith into a new job in a firm that at the time seemed like a dream job. After spending 3 months here, I am found that I am miserable. I hate waking up and getting into work in the morning. I’ve been assigned multiple projects with no training and am overwhelmed. The public and private sector are very different (obviously) and I’ve expressed this to my manager. I also asked for resources to help but they are having issues with resourcing . On top of that the person who was supposed to be my mentor quit a few weeks ago.

This position is a temporary position through an agency. There was hints of it being converted to a permanent position but that is not firm. I want to go back to the public sector or more of a PM role. I want to know how I should put this short term employment on my resume or explain to potential employers.

As well as, I feel extremely embarrassed by wanting to leave so soon. I’m also anxious about what people will think. The people are nice and the resources (when they are available) have been helpful and great. But like I said I truly am unhappy here.

Long story short - I am unhappy in a position I just started working in (3 months) I want to start looking for a new position now , as I know the hiring process is long for some places. Especially in the public sector. Need advice on how to put this on a resume, and for explaining to potential new employers.

Any general advice on my situation would be appreciated as well.",19Aug2019,2
553,"Basically 5-6years ago they were inseperable, a false rumour started and this friend cut her out of the social group and spent a long time slandering her. It haunted my girlfriend for a long time as she was left with no one and had to rebuild her social life.

Around 6 months ago, this former friend sent a text offering to be friends again, my girlfriend respectfully thanked her for the message but declined whilst also saying it would be great for when they pass eacjother they can say hello and things need not he awkward and that shes seen her child and its beautiful etc etc.

Since then she's seen the boyfriend of this friend several times and they'e had casual chit chats and laughs, nothing more than pleasantries but no awkwardness. 

Just yesterday she was in a local burger place and this friend, her boyfriend and a couple family members were in there. Girlfriend is all smiles ""hiya"" etc etc. On leaving the boyfriend aggresively said to her ""offered you a fucking olive branch and you didnt fucking take it"" and walked out of the shop. Girlfriend was stunned and held it in but then came home crying.

She feels like she has so much to say to them to set the record straight and all this other stuff. I tell her to literally waste no thought towards them and they don't deserve her tears. She talked about writing them a letter and i said that they should be in her past and shouldn't control how she feels in anyway. She could win by simply ignoring it amd living her best life.

The last few nights, I've been having a lot of sex dreams involving this girl I use to be good friends with. She was extremely attractive, but we fell out of touch about 3 years ago. It's happened 4 or 5 times now. 
I do currently have a girlfriend who I live with, but it's not like I believe I am cheating on her. 
I've considered the possibility of being sexually frustrated in my relationship as it's been a while since my gf and I have done anything, but I also just think it's odd that the dreams are constantly of my ex friend.

Am I waisting my time here? I feel like when a guy really likes you you don’t have to say that you feel neglected.

565,"I got hired right out of college at a membership organization/association doing member services/data analysis. My job and benefits are wonderful, but it all feels so... soul crushing. I’ve been here for three months and I’m having a hard time deciding what to do about my situation. A few things to consider:

1. The job pays me decently, but I have a feeling I could be getting paid more for the same work. Most of my job is based around CRM salesforce, and I am responsible for data analysis/report creation (neither of which I am certified in... I am self taught and do not know much about the data analysis industry thus my confusion on how to proceed in terms of looking for other work). I am paid $45k per year and I live in DC. There was no salary negotiation for this role. I put my desired salary as $45k (a HUGE mistake on my part of not putting a range— I’ve since learned to always put down a range for salary expectations) and they obliged, making me think that I am underpaid and could be making a lot more had I negotiated properly. 

2. The job gives me incredible benefits. 100% health, life, dental, vision short term/long term care insurance... the whole shebang. I also have a 14% 401k match that has a vesting age of 6 years. They also provide commuter benefits, so I do not pay for my own transportation to and from work. 

3. I don’t know how much potential there is for growth at my current organization. My position was created for me (nobody occupied the role before I was hired), and the responsibilities are not clearly defined, leaving me with the ability to define the role (but not necessarily get paid more for additional responsibilities moving forward). The organization I work for has a lot of turnover among associate level staff, mostly due to a nepotistic/close knit leadership structure at the top level. 

4. Building off of this, the management and leadership in general is insufferable. It’s incredibly nepotistic and hard to deal with, and the top level individuals are incredibly influential in the career advancement of associates. While I feel like I do good work, I also get the nagging feeling that I am not “cut out” for the company culture, and furthermore, I do not feel like my work is recognized. I have brought a lot of value to the department I work in (which I have been keeping track of in a small notebook that shows my accomplishments so far in the job), but my supervisors are not helpful in any way with feedback. They do not provide any guidance on projects or tasks, they are hard to reach, and there is virtually no transparency in terms of expectations. Also important to note that this organization does not have a HR department. 

5. I am still in the very early beginnings of self discovery, but I can’t determine if this work is just boring or if it is not cut out for me. I have a feeling I’ll get burned out within the year, but at the same time, I don’t know if I’m just being naive and temperamental about the job... not sure if this makes sense, but I guess I’m still figuring out if I hate this job or if I hate the idea of “work” in general. 

I can’t decide what to do. It’s obviously way too early to leave or negotiate a raise, but I also don’t want to or underpaid for the work I am doing right now. Is there an easy solution here? Should I wait it out and get more job experience, or should I begin looking for other positions that may suit me better? Am I being unrealistic with wanting to be fulfilled in my job?",19Aug2019,2

Hi everyone, I will try to make this short.I just need to know if I did the right thing.

So, I(22M) have an older brother(26M). He was always an asshole to me growing up. Beating me all the time, calling me names , excluding me from playing cool games, and telling my mother that I smoked weed,He also used to criticize all my friends and tell my mom they were bad influence.

Well, we grew up, and he changed a lot. First, he started smoking weed with me, and started to hangout with my friends (the ones he used to criticize), and everything became a lot more cool. Of course, I still had a grudge with him, because well, he was always an ass and never apologized .

Even though he is a much cooler person today, he still is kind of an ass. Always acting like he is my father, disrespecting me, yelling at me, and giving me long lectures about how I'm lazy and, in his words, ""keep snorting a fuckload of cocaine with my friends"".

This is very exagerating, and I will always lose my patience with him. He can't give me lectures, my life is much better than his,and I'm much younger. I have my own money, and he never worked in his life. Anyway.

Yesterday, we were all out drinking, and at one time, he just started insulting me out of nowhere, saying he was going to tell my mom I ""keep using drugs"" (dude, we smoke weed together), and a lot of other stuff. I was really mad, and my girlfriend brought me home. When he came home, he kept texting me saying that our house is not a hotel,so I shoudn't be bringing my girlfriend too.

Okay, that's cool. I said nothing.

Today, I woke up and heard my brother saying a lot of stuff to my parents in the kitchen,like , really bad-mouthing me. Some minutes later, my mom came talk to me and she started to give me a huge lecture, full of stuff my brother shoved in her head. One of her points, is that my friends ""are going nowhere, will never finish their colleges, or really work somewhere"".This made me really mad, because he keeps calling me a ""druggie"" and always said that about my friends too. Now, he friend of my friends, and keep saying bad stuff about them?

I got REALLY pissed. I called 3 friends that I knew he used to say shit about, and told them.Told them to not call him, because he looks at them like he looks at me: a druggie. Behind their backs, he would fight with me saying shit like ""you only hang out with those cocaine druggies"". Stuff like that. This got me really angry because some of my friends are drug-addicts in recovery. I mean, it's been a month since one of them touched cocaine and I',m proud for that.He can't keep saying shit like this.So I told my friends everything.

Well, not even an hour later, some of the guys wanted to fight my brother. I sent them screenshots from my conversation with my mother, and said that everything she was saying, came from my brother. Well, shit hitted the fan pretty fast.

My brother kept calling me a liar and denying everything.He never really said specific names(only sometimes), but always criticized me for hanging out with them for example. An later, he would also hang out with them!

Anyway, he kind of apologized to everyone, said he didn't talk about them to my mom, yadda yadda yadda. Some forgave him, others blocked him and don't want an excuse. I blocked him too.I'm tired of him, I always gave him chances to not be a bad brother, and he kept doing his shit. I presented him to basically all my friends, and is really not okay for him to try and give me lectures about everything. Worst of all, keep acting like a father(we did not have one) even though he has no moral authority, and never really tried to gain my respect.

I'm done with him, I already told all my friends that I will NOT hang out with them if they are with my brother. Some understood, some just said they will not call both of us on the same day so we woundn't be together hanging out.That's okay, I don't care if they continue to being friends, I just don't want to hangout with my brother anymore.

So, am I wrong here?For telling my friends my brother bad-mouthed them?For cutting him out of my life?I said to him to never talk to me agaii mean, it may looke like I completely overreacted, but me and him have a long history of fighting and he lecturing me, and me being quiet about it.

We were fighting a lot at the time and I felt like I couldn’t just say no or else we’d go on a full on war and now I’m in my second year and I thought I could stand 4 years of this but my program is rigorous and extremely competitive. I know I can pull this off but I’m sure I’m not goin to be pursuing this after college and I feel like this is so not worth it anymore. They have to pay thousands of dollars for this. I’m sleep deprived and depressed and asked my mom if I could drop out and find scholarships so they won’t have to pay for anything anymore and she just got angry at me calling me ungrateful and that she’s exhausted and I’m springing this up on her, that I chose this course and I should’ve pursued something else. I reminded her that she forbade me from going to pre-law because I was going to go to hell and she didn’t address that. 

So what should I do? I’m feeling so stuck and helpless, I just really want all of this to stop. Am I wrong and just being lazy and ungrateful like they said?

587,"So here is the deal. I have a family member (parent) possibly looking to move to my current state. We (Parent, my wife, and I ) have been talking about the possibility of splitting the cost of a new larger size home. 

My wife and I do not have that much equity or money to put down on a home. If we were going to buy a home ourselves, we would be looking at around 400k for an okay home but nothing special. Depending on factors the house would most likely be around 1700-2300 sqft. Doing this we would have PMI because we only have about 5% for a down payment and have to do a 30 year term (qualified for 4% interest rate 4 months ago).  This would more than likely be in an older area or be in a subdivision in flatlands / developed former farm lands. 

If we go half on a home with our family member, we can buy a much larger home for around $700-800k that is brand new from the ground up and designed with what we want (similar design tastes). The family member would be bringing in the 20% down payment from the sale of their current home (which they would recoup upon sale of the new home). We would be splitting the payment and it would be roughly the same payment as if we bought ourselves in the low 400s. Also we would avoid PMI because of the 20% down and the term would be only 20 years or about $350 extra a month (each person) if we went with a 15 year. This house could be in a much nicer / desirable area and would be in a community with clubhouse, pools, fitness center etc.. The home would be around 4500-5000 sqft or more. It would also have a finished walk out basement (roughly 1600-1900sqft) with a bedroom / bath and Rocky mountain views. This home would also be closer to the metro area. 

Here are some things that I see:

Pros: 

* The house would be much nicer / in a nicer area / appreciate faster and have a new home warranty
   * A quick equity calculation shows roughly $154,000 equity earned for my wife and I (full equity / 2 - downpayment put by parent) on shared home vs $124,500 equity earned for our own home of $421,000 after 5 years.
* We could all help each other out with utilities / other tasks like home cleaning, dinner, and transportation
* We have been away from family for about 6 years and it would be nice to have family close by
* We could gain equity faster and avoid PMI 
* Easier for my wife to get a job closer to the metro area (more options)

Cons:

* Paying the same as having our own home but we would not have our own whole home and be living in the full basement with use of the other parts of the home
* We could get on each other's nerves
* Longer drive for me to work (when i have to go to the office but mostly remote)

588,"I am 15 (M) and my parents have been divorced as long as I remember. My mother got custody. I get to stay with my father every other weekend. My dad has always been the fun parent. Whenever I go to his house, we hang out, watch movies, and go places. He is also the supportive parent. He makes sure my grades are good, buys my clothes, pays for my phone etc. My mother is lazy and doesn't work. She plays computer games all day everyday. She doesn't let me go outside, leave the house, buy stuff, get a job, etc. My only choice is to use my phone all day. I'm just looking for ways to make the time I'm at her house pass by quicker.

589,"Its a trait I've had for a long, long time, enough that its been pointed out often.

On one hand, its good: being self-critical has pushed me to be better, but it needs and on/off switch where I can just say ""whatever"". I'm in a downtime period and all I can think of all the time is how much I've fucked up this or that, and I really want to free myself of that constant anxiety.

There are also some mistakes I make socially that get me super flustered, but then I think too much about them and my reaction is oftentimes to hide away... when really, not caring would have been ideal. I can do this sometimes, but other times the stress is awful (like right now).

What are some steps I can take to get my self-criticism under control?",19Aug2019,1
590,"My (new) fiance (M, 28) has only been around my parents 5-6 times, but each time tends to alternatively shut down or speak over them/me. We just got engaged and my parents are in great consternation because they think he is entirely arrogant/doesn't exhibit empathy. I am concerned about that behavior, but not considering it a red flag because he does not exhibit that behavior anywhere else (friends, coworkers, waitstaff, peers, other adults). I do want to speak to him about it because I don't like that it is happening with people I care deeply about.

591,"Exhausted and on mobile, sorry for typos.

Before I start this story, here's a bit of background: I go to a very small private school in a small town where almost everyone (mainly students) knows each other. I had a rough start this morning, so this situation stood alone would've not had me as upset as I was. The peer (we'll call him Tuck) has had a past with sexualizing girls (middle schoolers especially) in our school, lying, cheating, stealing, etc. The only reason why he hasn't been suspended is that he claimed he was 'suicidal' to get out of suspension and getting kicked out (the principal didn't want a lawsuit). Everyone in our school doesn't like him, he's flat out rude and irritating, but we still treat him professionally in a school setting (on the other hand, he doesn't). The principal's   


In first period, I was talking amongst my friends about how being tired wasn't an excuse to not do work, etc. Tuck went up to the front to do something, and heard me saying ""Being tired isn't an excuse."" He mumbled under his breath ""Something something stupid bitch, no one cares about your opinion."" and walked away. I've had a rough morning, so at this point, I was in tears. I'm a very sensitive person, but I know that this wasn't a good reason to cry over. I started to sob and excused myself from the room to go clean myself up in the bathroom. I come back (still visibly upset, but better than before) and sit and wait for the between the class break. My principal comes into the room and hollers for me to come outside, everyone was ""wtf"" at this point (they knew the situation and were upset with Tuck, but ofc Tuck ignored it and didn't care). She takes me outside, I try to explain the situation but she's upset about the fact I left class and continues to call me a liar, lazy, and manipulative. She threatened to suspend me for being upset over 'something so little' and refused to listen to my side of the story. I come back into class, sobbing once again. Everyone in my class is pissed off, wanting to go stand up against her, but knowing her she would suspend the whole junior class.   


Am I overreacting? What should I do to settle this?",19Aug2019,1
592,"This is so sensitive because it’s my mother...this woman is the most appalling chewer I’ve ever encountered. And I’ve seen a lot. Maybe it’s worse for me because I’m around it all the time, but it seems to have gotten more gruesome. Think of a loud, echoing cavern filled with heavy suctioned slop, being mixed by oozing, slimy slugs.  That’s an accurate description of her eating. It haunts me. 

She’s very sensitive to me saying anything about it. Maybe she’s lost her patience with me mentioning it over the years. However, it’s gotten to the point that it literally physically pains me. It overwhelms my senses and makes my skin crawl. No matter how loud the restaurant, TV, or conversation, it’s all that I hear. She snaps back at me “Well, leave the room then!” And that’s the thing...I do! It’s so intense that we never eat or socialize together anymore because of it. And she’s noticed me being more withdrawn, but hasn’t made any effort to be more conscious of her own mouth.

What do I do!? Mentioning it to her doesn’t work, but I can’t be around her during meals anymore.",19Aug2019,1
594,"So I play this really nerdy but fun game called Magic: the Gathering (specially EDH for anyone who knows what that is). A couple of months ago I lost access to the car I was using and couldn’t make it all the way to my local game shop to play any more. Then the one other gay man in our play group set up a weekly thing at his place which is much closer, I can walk there but he’s also willing to give me a ride. And they’re fun, get to play with multiple friends while drinking, smoking, and having a grand ol’ time.

Even though he’s not at all my type he’s been flirty with me ever since I moved into town Dec 2018, which I’m ok with because it’s kind of developed into a joke. Or at least I thought it had.

I recently found out that if I’m not attending the game sessions then they just don’t happen. In part because it’s best with at least four and I guess sometimes without me it’s just three? But plenty of times we also have 5-7 total so it seems odd *any time* I’m not there they can’t find a fourth. Like they didn’t have it for two weeks while I was out of town.

And then when I got back into town with news I’d be moving again he was extra flirty and really seemed like he wanted me to stay instead of getting a ride out that night.

I’m not sure what to do, it feels awkward but at the same time I’m gone again in about 6 weeks anyways. Any advice would be appreciated.",19Aug2019,1
595,Hi to everyone. What variations or short names can you tell for the name Chaizat? Anything that comes to your mind,19Aug2019,1
596,"Here is some background info so you can get a better sense of the situation. 
My husband and I and our two children (4 AND 6) having been living with my inlaws since February, when I suffered through a traumatic ruptured ectopic pregnancy that caused me to go septic coupled with breaking my foot a few weeks later... Needless to say I was out of work for a bit and also needed extra help while I recovered. My husbands parents also have his baby sister, her current boyfriend and two children (ages 2 and 7) living in the home with them. It is alot of people under one roof, but luckily it's a larger house. So, my baby sister, here I shall call her J, is/was a young mom. Pregnant at 15, mom by 16, now two kids from two different fathers, both of which are either hooked on drugs or in jail or both or some sort of combined, rotating pattern. 
I have had a tough relationship with my husbands family. We seperated for two years before reconciling differences and it was long enough for his family to build up some resentment torwards me, but for the most part, things are okay now. So, J has a bad habbit of putting men before her kids and her parents enable her to do it by letting them all move in with her and more or less raising her kids as their own. In order to understand the depth of her selfishness, to what degree she chases dick over her kids wellbeing, when her youngest was 7-8 months old, she lost custody of him for a year. Why, you ask? She took him to urgent care one evening because ""he hasn't stopped crying in a week"" and low and behold, this infant has a spiral fracture of his femur. In an infant who is unable to crawl, this is a very suspicious fracture. The only way to sustain this type of fracture in an immobile child is by twisting the leg in a motion similar to wringing the water out of a wet towel. The only think possibly more suspicous is the fact that an injury this severe would have been noticed much sooner than a whole week.  One whole week with a broken leg she delayed in taking him to the doctor. The family mostly agrees it's because she knew her boyfriend was responsible and was either trying to play dumb or cover it up for him. So, we already know that she makes bad choices. She has custody of her children now, and for a few months after regaining custody she seemed like she was really turning her shit around. Was doing good at her job, was staying organized and responsible, wasn't dating. But then she met this guy at her GED classes and she has started to spiral again. Almost a year they have been together and he moved into the house during week 2 of their relationship. I shall call him F. F is a recovering heroin addict, which J conveniently forgets to mention to her family (not the first heroin addict shes dated either).   I recently caught him fucked up in the shared kitchen of our house, hovering over the stove, nodding out, pupils tinier than needle points, scratching himself. I'm not stupid. I am ten years clean off herion. April 16th 2009. I can spot that stuff from a mile away in the dark, blind folded. I was alarmed, and I texted J and asked her if everything was okay with F. She came over to our half of the upstairs to tell me that he was really tired and didnt sleep well, and she said ""I told him to lay down and go to bed because he is almost acting like he is fucked up."" 
That's not acting, sweetheart. Although, this she already knows. About an hour later I went to their half of the upstairs and asked If I could borrow some q-tips and J says I can and motions torwards her bathroom door. Their bedroom is the only bedroom with a private bath, and they both go in there to smoke cigarettes out the bathroom window because they are too lazy to go outside and they are the only smokers in the house. So I open the bathroom door and F is in the bathroom standing at the window, COMPLETELY nodding out. Like, eyelids half closed, slack jaw, wavering back and forth on his feet like hes gonna fall out at any minute but he doesnt. At this point, he nods hard enough that he drops his cigarette by accident, on his barefoot, burning himself, there by snapping him out of it a bit so to speak. He leaves the bathroom and as I am trying to text J and ask her what the hell is wrong with him, she walks into the bathroom. I asked her again if everything was okay with F, because he looks like hes messed up on dope. She then proceeds to tell me some bs line about how ""he had a little something"" and this vague ""I dont think it was all herion maybe some pain pills mixed in."" As if that makes it any better. I tell J that if she is aware that F is using, in this house, and something happens where social services comes, that if she loses her kids again, she probably wont get them back. She starts crying. I ask her where F is now and she tells me that he left to go drive around. I ask J if she thinks theres any left or laying around (I am concerned from a safety aspect with kids in the house) and we search through his belongs and the bathroom to make sure there is nothing an unsuspecting toddler could get to. I end up telling my husband, and my inlaws about the incident the next day, when F actually has the nerve to ask me for a couple percocet (healing from broken foot). I text him back and tell him after what had happened the day prior, I was concerned and obviously I was not gonna condone this behavior and give him some. Then, I proceed to tell my husband, and my mother-inlaw about the situation. They both believe me and have my back because they know me well enough to know I wouldnt make this shit up for no reason, however when confronted directly, J lied straight to my father inlaws face and now my father inlaw says I am just being crazy, more or less on a witch hunt as retaliation to her actions and attitudes torwards me. She has him wrapped around her finger. It's a whole big thing, complete with nasty family text message groups of ""he said she saids"" and passive aggressive body language around each other inside the house. 
This was a few weeks ago, and for a while it was a bit like tip toeing on eggshells. I refuse to leave my kids  alone with either J or F and have kept a distant, but watchful eye of him to see if he is sliding back into dependency. Things were okay but now, just yesterday, I am almost positive he was messed up again. Tiny pupils, kept going out to his car, coming back in. Scratching away at his back, sides, arms, everything. J ended up taking her boys to my husbands brothers house, and normally she would have left her youngest with F, and I know from talking to him that F DID offer to watch him, but J took him with her anyway, leaving F home alone with us, making me feel like she knows hes fucked up again too. 
I dont know what to do. I dont want my kids around this shit, but the drama that comes along with trying to convince my VERY delusional father inlaw of his substance abuse is equally terrible. He is verbally abusive torwards my motherinlaw and she will never be able to have her say because of it. I live like that though, I tell him exactly what I think he should be told, which makes our relationship tense to say the least. My going out on a limb and accusing F of opiate abuse triggers a landslide of familial drama, all detrimental to my owns children health (yelling and scream profanities and hateful slurs in front of them), so I just dont know what on earth I should do.",19Aug2019,1
597,"Any advice for someone in my situation? I have been working from home for myself for years and really enjoy what I do, but while entrepreneurial life offers a lot of flexibility and independence, it can also be stressful AF. Knowing if something goes wrong or business fails somehow, that I don’t have a degree to fall back on is quite anxiety-inducing. I have my kids to think about, not to mention shitty health care options being self employed. I decided that I need to more stability, and going back for an education will give me more options and help me feel more financially secure. 

I start soon and am feeling intimidated. I married super young at 19, was born and raised in a fundamentalist religion. At the time since I was heavily entrenched in those beliefs and church culture I didn’t pursue a degree, dropped out of school and instead immediately focused on having babies and being a wife and stay at home mom, as was expected of me. I left that religion a few years ago and got divorced from a bad marriage, and now I look back on those choices and want to slap myself. But I can’t change the past and would rather look forward.

I haven’t been in school for so long, and now I have all the added craziness of single momhood and working on top of classes. I know it can be done and many do it, and I am determined.... just also scared. Does anyone have any advice for me going into this? Thanks so much",19Aug2019,2
598,"I'm in my late twenties, and I am living with my parents because I am saving money to buy a house with my SO. 

My family has never been rich and we've always been struggling financially to some degree. Ever since I got my first job at 15 I've always helped out with bills here and there. I always knew that my parents hated asking me for money and that as much as it sucked giving away my hard earned money, eventually they would pay me back. 

For the last few years my dad has not been working, so essentially the only income in the house is mine and my mom's. My mom makes very little, but not little enough to receive social assistance, and I make around 45k/year (I also have a part time job which I picked up last year for extra income which goes towards my gas). Now for the last two years, my family's money has been especially tight between bills and an increased cost of living. My parents have been asking me for money more often and I haven't seen any of the money back. In the last three months alone I've loaned them around 2k. 

This whole issue has been taking a really heavy toll on me. I am really trying to save aggressively for a house. I have my own bills to pay, I have student debt to pay off. I have never said no to them and I feel an immense sense of guilt and duty towards them, so saying no to them seems impossible. In my culture, family is everything and I can't just cut them off. 

I don't want to sound like a spoiled brat for complaining about my parents, because I love them a lot and I know it's hard on them. But I am trying so hard to move onto the next phase of my life and it seems impossible to do it without hurting them.

599,"I am currently studying abroad, one week in, and I am just not seeming to get along with my roommate. I feel like mostly everyone else is already very close with their roommate, and they all go out together all the time, but that’s not the case with my roommate. She quickly made a group of friends, which is fine! But I just feel really left out. I always invite her out when I go out and she never does the same for me. I don’t want to demonize her, she’s pretty cool and hasn’t been hostile at all towards me, it’s just not like we’re really friends either. 

I am getting a little lonely and a little worried that I’m just going to be spending a lot of time by myself if I don’t switch roommates. The program director is allowing me for a switch, but he wants me to talk it out with my roommate first, but there’s nothing to talk out. Since she hasn’t done anything wrong, I can’t confront her and I don’t want to confront her for simply making friends or for not including me, because she’s not obligated to do so?? I would want to say that I talked to her when I didn’t, but one way or another she will be involved in the switching process. So, I’m just not sure what to do.

The second part of my problem is that I have to find another set of people who are willing to switch. I have talked to quite a few people who are not very fond of their roommates (about 2-3 other girls), but I think it’d be very awkward for me to ask them to switch. I am not sure how to even bring that up. 

So, maybe I should just stick with my roommate. One of my friends has her roommate leaving in 5 weeks, so I could always switch then too. I am just feeling a little lonely at the moment and I’m not sure how to go about this.

603,"I'm \[F21\] currently trying to get a Job. I got a part time job that doesn't pay well and it's not a good long-term Option after dropping out off University last year.

I applied to some Companies but my biggest Problems are:

1. I have no idea what i want to do in life.
2. I rarely get a reply. The companies don't tell me if they got my application or if they rejected me.
3. When i get invited for interviews i get so nervous that the interview is a total failure.

I'm usually a confident person and have no problem approaching new people or talking to them but this is so important to me that i literally forget what i want to say or dont understand what the Person in front of me just asked during interviews. I have to add that i only had two interviews so far but they went horrible.

This made me lose hope because i'm searching for over a year now. I admit i'm a bit lazy too but whenever i look for new jobs i start crying and my heart starts to beat faster. Today i got an email from a big company with a link to an online test. If i pass i get invited to an interview but they will redo the test to an extent during it. As soon as i read the email i started crying and couldn't calm down for like 30 minutes. It's not because i was happy but because i'm so nervous to take the test and fail again.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still living at home and my parents and i get into fights very often now because of me not having a Job. They want me to lower my standarts of getting a well payed job but they also ""complain ""when i suggested a job that doesn't pay well but i would love to do (Kindergarten teacher as an example) because ""People who have that job need 2  jobs because they can't live from the salary. Ask \[Neighbour\]. She needs a 2nd job"". 

I know they are partly right because nothing gets cheaper these days and i need to think about my future but they really don't help me at all.

I understand they want the best for me and i'm really sorry that i get so passive aggressive whenever they mention anything related to that. Recently my Dad got really mad because where i live (Germany) you get money from the state for every child. There is no problem as long as the Child is underaged. As soon as the child is 18 you have to prove the child is either going to university or they are trainees. I'm neither and now we might have to pay back 3000 €  if i can't prove i'm actively trying to get a job. This really fucked me up and made me even more nervous.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know what to do anymore. I think my mental health really gets worse because of this and i don't have the motivation to look for a job and apply because it will just end up with me crying for hours and not being able to sleep because i'm so worried.

 I hope someone can give me advice. I don't really know what advice i expect. Maybe someone was in a similar situation or can just help me with a way to calm myself down. Really just a few nice or motivational words might be enough even.

We had abused that and she relied on it so much and shed say she needs sex to feel a connection with me otherwise its as though im cheating. Ive had few girlfriends due to her controlling nature and the ones that only she approved of whereas she could talk to any guy she wanted as long as i just had faith in her loyalty. Her eagerness to meet my dad too soon became her downfall as she quickly showed off to him what kind of person she was and disappointed him yet made me fight for her dignity and prove that shes a sweet and respectable girl. 

With this feud her parents are also seeing that shes not going much anywhere in life; She doesnt have a degree or a drivers license and keeps jumping back and forth in her jobs. she comes from a good family and so do i but we both have many failures we see we need to work on. Throughout our relationship, i encouraged her to be better and make the right choices and what shed promised, she was afraid to commit. She underdtands that she cant change and become a more positive aspect to me and my family, unlike she can even do for hers. 

And now this boils down to her cutting loose ends today. She says she will still care for me and not let me be alone and we can rather be really great friends and help each other out like we have been doing and promise to treat each other eith respect. She understands that her parents are retiring in a year and want her to be independant since my family isnt going to foster her. knowing shes afraid she cant live up to my families expectations. 

My question is, should this grace period be a time for us both to reflect on ourselves better and keep our families happy? Everyone says we always come back to each other and even if we take a break, we always somehow wprk out our situation and unite.",19Aug2019,1
610," I dated two guys out of this decent sized boy, friend group and the first one thought I cheated (which I didn’t) but the second dude I did cheat on him.. with people online.. it was a big problem doing that, I would basically have video sex. I’ve stopped that behavior and he forgave me but after talking to my first ex he decided that I’m a bad person and I know I’m a shitty person for cheating and I don’t blame him for thinking that. I broke up with him and we’re still kinda friends and he said that my first ex was getting that whole group to hang up on me, ruin my socially, mentally, and hopefully not physically.. I just don’t know what to do, I know I’m in the wrong but I can’t handle a group of boys hanging up on me. Now I have friends that will help but I don’t know what to do to avoid them or even defend myself if the time comes. I just need advice of any sort please, and as a note I do not wanna go to the school about this cause I’d have to say I cheated and all that stuff. Just, I need help on how to avoid them and defend myself, please I need help even if I am in the wrong",19Aug2019,1
611,"Pretty much for as long as I can remember, I haven't had a good relationship with my mom. My dad has always tried to stick his neck out for me but my mom always finds something wrong with what I do.

She favors my brother heavily, downplaying his mistakes and actions while exaggerating mine. 

What prompted me to write this was that we recently had a plumbing issue where our bathroom shower was somehow leaking into my bedroom and creating a puddle of water. My parents were convinced that I had either spilled a bunch of water or that I wasnt properly drying myself off after I shower.

Recently I realized it and I found a way to prove it by showing the tub actually flowing a small stream of water out which would accumulate over the course of a shower.

When I showed it to my dad he acknowledged it but my mom continued to insist that it was because I wouldnt properly dry myself off. She kept going on and on about how it was my fault that the area was flooding.

I've been going through this for so long and it's becoming harder and harder to keep doing this. I think she's gaslighting me, along with my dad in a way. Something happens and she tells a completely different course of events that makes me seem like the villain, and my dad goes along with her course of events because it makes it easier for him, in the end, to agree with her. 

Then, after having yelled at me and blamed me for things, they wait a couple hours and then pretend everything is normal. Like they havent told me nasty things or blamed me for stuff. They get angry that I'm being curt or rude because I don't immediately move past it.

Currently, my dad is mad at me because he tried to talk to me to figure out why I have an ""attitude"" and I told him that I didn't want to talk to him because we've already had the same conversation time and time again. I'm always the villain in this house.

I don't know what specific advice I'm asking for but anything would help. I can't currently move out but I just need something to get me through this, anything.",19Aug2019,0
612,"So, this is a really long kind of a multi-layered situation that I need advice on.  TL;DR at the bottom. 

For a little background information that is going to be important during the rest of the story, I have a best friend, who I'll refer to as T. We've been friends since we were in middle school.  I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder and depression. T has severe depression and anxiety. It's something that we bonded over and have always supported each other through. T has a fiance, M. M is one of the worst people I know. He is abusive, and I truly mean that. He gets in her face, screams at her, tells her she's stupid, and that she needs to lose weight. I've seen him call her gross, and disgusting. He has her trapped. They have credit cards with each other, linked bank accounts, car loans... everything. At one point, she was working three jobs, and he was unemployed. Guess who decided that his car was a piece of shit and that he needed to buy a new one. M also has a DCF case against him for child abuse (again, this is an important detail). He's not a good person at all, despite her trying to push that view on me. T asked me to be the maid of honor in her wedding, and even though I really hate M, I wanted to support T, so I said yes. 

Situation #1: Two years ago, I got married, and she was one of my maids of honor (I had my three people in my bridal party and they are all equally important to me). For a month or so before the wedding, I knew that T started to hit a depressive low. I know that keeping her busy and not letting her stay in her bed all day was one of the best ways to help her, so I would ask her for help with little things, whether it was running errands with me, or just going or a ride. 

At the time, she and her finace, M, were having a lot of issues. To be clear, they always have a lot of issues, but at this point, it seemed like she was finally going to break up with him. I have tried to reason with her to leave him, but I know that she won't leave until she is ready to. Anyhow, during the last week before the wedding, M threw a fit, and told T that he wasn't going to come to the wedding. Of course, my soon-to-be groom was perfectly fine with that, as was I. T was even okay with it because she said that he would have ""been a wet blanket"" on the whole night. We had a stand in for him ready to go and everything, but at the last minute, he decided he was going. 

So, the day of came, and my maid of honor was texting her finace the entire day, arguing with him, because apparently now he only wanted to stay for the ceremony, and then leave...with her. I was getting pretty upset at the thought of my best friend leaving the reception prematurely when I know she wanted to stay, until she informed me that they would be going to the reception. The ceremony was beautiful and I was completely over the moon. On the way to the reception, my husband and I drove separately from the rest of our party. He asked me what I did all day (even if we spend the whole day together, we ask each other this. It's just a weird thing we do). I told him about T and I getting our hair done, and told him about T and M arguing over text all morning. My husband seemed pretty bothered by this, but let it go.   


When we got to the reception, we made our entrance, had our first dance, and mingled a bit before sitting and having our dinners. Shortly after dinner was served, (it was honestly about ten minutes after), T comes over to me, gives me a hug and kiss on the cheek and tells me that she has to go... I was ripped, but I swallowed it down and let it go. I would have liked to spend part of my evening with my maid of honor, but it was more important that M finished his food fast so he could peel out of the parking lot and make a scene. I still get angry thinking about it. 

Situation #2: Starting in late 2017, T, my other really good friend H and I are in a group chat together. Fast forward to May of this year, we talk every single day about everything and nothing at all. There hasn't been a day that we don't talk to each other. Since the wedding, I've only seen T maybe twice, which is ridiculous because we live all over ten minutes from each other. T is still with M, and are still having some pretty serious issues. T has an older sister who is addicted to heroin. Her sister had a baby while using, meaning CPS was called and that baby was taken away. T was eligible to adopt the baby, but because she was in a relationship with a known child abuser, she would have to leave him in order to adopt. 

For a moment, it seemed like she was seriously considering leaving him, but then suddenly decided that she didn't want to go through with it. This was extremely strange to me, considering that a couple days prior, she was looking at cribs, and trying to think about how she was going to child proof the apartment. 

A couple weeks went by, and were all still talking in the group chat. Nothing really drastic as far as conversations go. T and I met up to have dinner together, then we were going to go back to her apartment so I could help her clean. She was just starting to get out of a depressive low, and had two weeks worth of dishes to do and general cleaning around the house. I took to the dishes and she started the other cleaning. We were talking and laughing a bit when I asked her if her and M were going to set a date any time soon. She responded ""I don't know. We might just elope"". I said back ""That's fine! I wanted to do that too. I would still like to be there"", to which she said ""Of course""!

Now, fast forward to the end of June. I get a text from my husband saying ""Wait, did T and M really get married or are they Facebook married"". I looked at the text for a minute, before screen-shotting it and sending it to the group chat. I asked T outright if this was true. Below are her exact words: 

"" To make a super complicated and fucked up story short: yes. To exploit money out of my family that back fired and the world is super angry with me.  So M and I decided we wanted to elope Because neither of us wanted a wedding because drama in the family is disgusting.  So it slipped at my dads house and my dad blew a fit that he wanted to walk me down the aisle and blah blah blah...  So we agreed to have people over my dads house and that was all fine and dandy because we talked about it and we could invite my dads side who is super generous and it would go towards buying a house"" 

In another message, where I asked who was there, she responded "" My dads side of the family"". I told her that it was fine. She had said that she wanted to have a real wedding, and I told her that she can still have one. then I told her that I wasn't mad, I was just hurt that she didn't tell me. She said sorry and then I tried to help her not argue with her husband because now he was calling her stupid for something else... again. A couple days go by, and I don't bring up the wedding thing at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

Situation #3. Her mother wasn't invited. Her mom raised T and her little sister after they were abandoned by their alcoholic father (the one who paid for T to get married). T refused to talk to her mother, not because she was mad at her, but because she knew she did her wrong. Her little sister who has a toddler was not invited because she doesn't like M. Their mother doesn't like M either, but, here's the kicker on that... T was babysitting her little sister's toddler the day she got married. 

I found out there were pictures. A lot of pictures. It wasn't how T described the situation at all. She got married married. She had flowers, a cake, the whole shebang. To make everything sting that much more, her other best friend officiated. She had M's best friend next to her at the altar. Seeing those pictures sent me so far down the rabbit hole... Her little sister was messaging me, and told me what day it happened. May 25th. So, that means that my best friend lied straight to my face when I asked her if she set a date. She then lied about who was there and how significant the whole occasion was. 

I went into the group chat and started scrolling... and that's were I found it. Our chat from May 25th. The three of us, purely by accident, did our make up exactly the same way that day, and we all had a good laugh about it, sending each other pictures. That wasn't the only chat that we had that day. It was pages of messages during the entire day. It was like the more I looked into it, the more I found out how much she lied. The more I saw, the more it started to really hurt. 

Since I was already chatting with her, I wrote to her "" T, I dont want to upset you. But I saw the pictures, and I know that this was a bigger deal than you are leading on. I also know that \*\*\*\*\* officiated. I am now really hurt, and I need to take a break. Give me a couple hours. I really need to talk to you about this, but I need time"". She responded "" That's fine. I never got to finish telling you how things ended up the way they did. Take all the time you need. I expect you to be hurt. I get it and I'm sorry"". Please keep this in mind: T is an avoider. She avoids talking about things that make her uncomfortable, especially when she is in the wrong. She also uses her anxiety and depression as an excuse to run away from situations. I know when she is fibbing and I know when she is being truthful about it. 

Me:  Okay. You need to tell me everything. I dont care how long it takes.  Type it all out. I won't say a thing. 

T:  I'm sorry I didn't respond last night. I worked late and had plans change and I ended up falling asleep really early. I'm mentally not okay right now, but I owe you the best explanation I can give you because you're an amazing friend to me and I was horrible. So the last thing I told you was that my dad wanted a reception. As we all know, I'm a push over. M and I both told him we just wanted to elope and call it a day. He insisted that he wanted to walk one of his daughters down the aisle because that's always been a dream of his. He knew that my little sister wouldn't let him do that because they aren't on talking terms. Despite me insisting that eloping would be best for everyone because there is too much damn drama between everyone, my dad kept guilting me into making this get bigger and  bigger. At this point, M and I sat down and said well if he wants to throw us a party so be it. We want to buy a house and his family is generous so let's do something at his house and call it a day. He agreed to that until something else changed and now he wanted it catered and at a venue. M and him screamed and yelled at each other over it. It was getting really out of hand. My dad somehow won that argument which I have zero idea how because I've never seen M back down when he cares so much about it. Because we planned to elope, I already had a dress and rings ordered. We ended up agreeing to this crazy wedding thing despite neither of us being happy about it. When it came to the guest list. It was small and there was no wiggle room. We had very limited seating and we kept telling ourselves that this was for the best because we wanted to buy a house. We were greedy and wanted to move as soon as possible but we needed a few thousand dollars more to make it happen. I cried so many times thinking about the people who weren't going to be there. M did too. This wasn't at all what either of us really wanted. It was my dad's dream. I haven't spoken to my dad or step mom since that day. As for \*\*\*\*\* officiating, we had asked him to marry us when we expecting to elope because it was someone we both were friends with. It was supposed to be a nice surprise and the happiest time of my life, but instead it flipped my life upside down and spiraled me into this depression that makes me want to kill myself. I'm sure this didn't do much other than make you more upset and didn't really make anything better so I'm sorry"". 

At this point, I was really hurt. So I responded: 

 Here is my big thing with literally all of this: You lied to me. Straight to my face. In fact, to make matters worse, I know you didn't get married last month, which was June. You got married on May 25th. But, let's sweeten the pot here, because you sent me and H a picture of your make up. That was the day the three of us accidentally did our make up the same. Serendipity. We talked the day before, the day of, and the day after. I saw you on June 14th. That was two weeks after you got married, unbeknownst to me. I even asked you ""when are you guys going to set a date because I have to get my matron of honor duties started"". And you said, this is a direct quote, ""I honestly don't even know anymore. We might just elope"". And I said ""thats fine. I'd still like to be there. We can just have a big party after or something"". You could have told me then.   I'm gonna come clean about something. I messaged \*\*\*\*\* yesterday and called him an asshole for not saying a damn thing to me, your mom, or your sister. If he was your friend, really your friend, he would know that it is fucked up to not invite them or even tell them about it. Its not like he never talks to me or had contact with me. His response was baseless and malicious. Bottom line, is he is always going to be that friend that cushions your fall. He wants to be the guy you run to when things go south, because he hopes he will be with you one day. Whether you see it or not, that is the reality of the situation. He's your pat on the back. T, I'm always going to be the friend that pushes you to be better because I know you can be. I'm not your cushion. Hell, im not even nice sometimes. But im honest, and i would never do anything to hurt you. Right now, you dont need an echo chamber to bounce your thoughts off of. You need direction. So I'm going to give you some really tough love right now. This is not coming from a place of anger. But I need to voice how I feel.   I feel completely, utterly betrayed by someone I consider a sister. You lied to me. That's the long and short of it. I could never and would never lie to you about anything, no matter how small, and you managed to lie to me about one one the biggest decisions of your life so far. I can't forgive you for that, because you haven't told me why. Why I wasn't there. Why you didn't tell me. You could have said ""Hey, I'm getting married today, don't ask questions. Just wear a dress and show up"". And I would have been there, no questions asked. All it would have taken was a text, which we were already doing that day. So, no, I dont understand why you couldn't. You involved James, your supposed other best friend. Not me, who you talk to every single day. \*\*\*\*\* was ""kind"" enough to inform me that I probably wasn't invited because I am emotional, and that I am a bad friend. He also said I shouldn't be calling you my best friend because I called him a fucking asshole, and that I should be ashamed of myself. You let him know every detail of your wedding, and I got nothing. I talk to you every day, throughout the day. I'm not jealous that he was there. It doesn't make sense that he would be there. He doesnt have your best interests at heart. Hes a yes man. I would have given you a backbone, so you could put your foot down and say no.   Here's the tough love:  You, my dear, fucked up. Reprehensibly. Irreversibly. You could have put your foot down at any time. You're not a push-over. You're easily manipulated by male figures in mildly authoritative position, and you very easily get brainwashed. But you're also stubborn and stand your ground when it really matters to you. So I'm not buying the whole ""I got pushed into it"" thing. There is a little caveat during the speech, which if you had an actual officiant, and not the guy that has been trying to get with you since high school under the guise of friendship, they would mention the phrase ""speak now or forever hold your peace"". You could have said ""I can't go through with this. Not everyone that I love or care about is here and it's not right"". Money or not.   None of this is you. This is not who you are. It's so disappointing. You don't even look happy in the pictures I saw. Maybe you it was the weight of your lie starting to grow on you, maybe it is because you know you have just made the biggest mistake of your life. Idk. I wasn't there, so I cant be the judge of that.   I know you hate conflict and want to avoid it. But, you made this one.   I don't know what else I can say. I dont hate you. I'm not even mad anymore. I'm just really disappointed. I still want you to come and talk to me about all of this. I am still your best friend. I love you. I will still make mac and cheese for you, but you're getting elbows, not shells""

Then radio silence. Five days and she didn't respond to me in the group chat, text, phone calls... nothing. She completely cut off contact with everyone for a couple of days. Her husband has a history of being near violent with her, so her mother, her little sister and I started thinking the worst. I even went to her apartment and left a note saying I just wanted to talk to her. I came to the conclusion that she did not want to be friends anymore, because thinking that M had violently murdered her went out the window when I saw that he was posting on FB. I sent her a message pretty much saying that I've been friend broken up with before and that if that's the case, just send a one word message back. She responded to that and said that she just didn't want to talk to anyone. I respected that and let her be for a bit. 

A day or so later, she said she was up to talk about it, I asked her a bunch of questions, including ""Why wasn't I there"". This was her reponse: 

 Was it worth it: yes I'm extremely happy with Ma and it's fucking bullshit that people keep asking me that like they want the answer to be no.  I'm 1000% confident in my decision.  I made over 5k from the wedding so yes, I made money. But unfortunately I can't use it for a house like I originally planned because it's being used to pay bills and allowing me to live the same life I was living before.  I can't speak for what \*\*\*\*\* thinks. That's not my battle to fight.  My grandmother knew when everybody else knew.  M's family wasn't there and they are the most supportive people ever because none of them are making either of us feel like shit about getting married without them. They were excited and said congrats and they love us no matter what.  M's bff was on my side. He lives with us so obviously he was involved.  Flowers Etc. did my bouquet. All the other flowers were fake and I arranged them.  I got my cake from Love Bakery. I've known the owners for 5 years and that was the only thing I got that I really wanted at the wedding.  I knew you were stressed out with school and finishing up so I didn't want to add any additional stress. **You were having what seemed like daily panic attacks as it was** and I didn't think it was right to add to that.  I didn't tell you the day of because I was stressed out and didn't want to add anything else to my day that didn't need to be added. I told you I didn't know when I was getting married because I wasn't sure what you or any body else would say when I told you it already happened.  You weren't there because the only friends I had there were M's bff and \*\*\*\*\*. \*\*\*\*\* officiated because he is a mutual friend of us both. After talking about it, we had asked James since it originally was supposed to be just us and we didn't want to pay a justice of the peace to do it. Since James had already been ordained, it made sense for him to officiate.   my little sister and my mom weren't there for the same reasons. It was just my dad's side. I didn't want any extra drama there. It might not have been yelling wars or direct fighting but it would have been snide comments from both sides. Complete and utter awkwardness for me because I would have felt like I needed to talk to my mom and sister the whole time and I wouldn't have been able to do what I wanted. My mom and sister both dislike M so it would have been constant questioning and stress about my happiness and if this is the ""right thing to do"". I originally planned to go to AZ this summer and have a ceremony and reception out there for my mom's side because my entire life is always two of everything, but everybody on that side except my grandparents have just interrogated me instead of saying congrats.  I understand I was wrong in some aspects of how this all happened, but I still am happy I did it. Life may not be any different than before we were married, but I'm happy and that's all that should matter""

It has been over a month and I still haven't gotten over what is in bold. I have never and would never throw her depression or anxiety in her face like that. That hurt more than the lying. We have barely talked since then. My other best friend told me to stop talking to her and let her come to me to apologize. It has been two weeks, and the only time she has messaged me, was to tell me that I needed to watch her niece for her.   


So I need advice. What should I do? How do I move forward? How do I let any of this go? Please, anything will help. I feel...lost.

615,"I'm a bit concerned in regards to having some sort of infection rise upon my feet. The reason I think that way is because I wear socks all the tIme, with the exception of showers and when I go to sleep, and I'm afraid that might be bad for my feet. I've been using socks all the time ever since about 4 years ago. I'm yet to have had any strange things occur on my feet.

I know that the simple solution would be to stop using the sock, but my mind won't let me. I get this strange, unconfortable feeling of showing my feet which leads to the use of socks.

I'm wondering if there's a type of sock that prevents infections from nesting on my feet or a lotion that protects my feet from fungi.

617,"So i recently found that my 13 year old sister was being bullied. She keeps mentioning how much she doesn't want to go back to school and that she wants to transfer. I asked if it's because she was getting bullied and she started crying and left. I let her do her thing for two days then approached her. 

I said that it was ok and that no one knows except me and our brother. The fact that our mother didn't know, and that she wouldn't, is what helped her open up about it. She says that they call her fat and ugly in the hallways and all her friends are in high honors while she is in on-level classes. So not only is she getting verbally abused but she feels stupid because all her friends are in smarter classes than her. 

I asked if it was a specific group of people and she got very emotional before saying no. Which means it is a group of people but she didn't feel comfortable telling me so I left it at that.   


I feel very stuck and don't know what to do. If I tell her school not only will they do nothing but she'll be even more bullied/ostracized for it.

619,"I recently got dumped the last couple of days ago by ex girlfriend, and I finally realized maybe it was for the best since there's some things I want to work more on myself. Honestly this breakup made me realize I need to be more mature and ready in other aspects for mainly myself and the way I deal with certain things.

&amp;#x200B;

I was planning on meditating more to bring more self peace with myself so I can feel comfortable living and doing things alone because as of right now I don't like being alone. It makes me uncomfortable and depressed, not in relationship aspect but I would have to talk to my friend non stop or so.

I was curious if anyone had any advice with being more patient with people, and be more patient with myself without getting so angry or anxious with others and myself.

What would you recommend in forms of self love?

Please don't say: ""treat yourself!"" ""take a warm bath"" ""buy yourself some clothes""

I want long term, and healthy solutions. Yes, those are things to comfort myself in that time being, but overall it's not really going to change how I feel about being alone.

We live on an old traveller site that was illegally developed  a couple of decades ago and has since expanded to around 250 properties (mainly static caravans and 'chalets').  The site is still predominantly owned by one family who charge £105 a week in rent. At a guess they are turning over around £26000 per week or close to £1.4m a year between them.

Now, these people are pretty unscrupulous when it comes to both site maintenance and their treatment of tenants. I'll give you a few examples:

When my partner and I moved in, the place had a huge problem with black mould, it was beyond filthy and it was damp. When the toilet broke, it was replaced with one that was just slightly less broken, but that left an open gap straight down to the sewer pipe. The water pipes and gas bottle regulators freeze in winter when uninsulated, ventilated, tin boxes sat on breeze blocks get very cold indeed. Basically, the landlords do the bare minimum to keep their properties legal, and even that's dubious.

There aren't enough bins and the few we have are usually full within a day of being emptied. Bags get piled next to them and over the next couple of weeks, the rats, cats, dogs and seagulls that wander around the place spread it everywhere.  In summer the bin stink is partially masked by the numerous leaking drains and sewers.

Electricity costs more than double the national average – something that is usually illegal. They found a loophole using sub-sub metering. You get the general idea.

Most people move here because they have no other choice and are in no way, for the most part, bad people. They have come off the street or have physical or mental health problems that prevent them from working. Most people scratch by on benefits, so there's not a lot of money around. Oh, and we also live in one of the most deprived areas in not only the UK but the whole of Europe.

Obviously there have been a number of complaints about the place both to and from the local council, but nothing gets done. The problem is that if the Council tell the owners to get more bins for example, the owners ignore them. They might threaten them with a fine or such like but the owners have the power to make several hundred people homeless if the council push them too far. The waiting list for council housing around here is years long already so they don't have a hope of being able to re-house this number of people.  So it's easier to ignore the problem than take drastic action.

The same is true for each individual tenant too. Everything goes through your landlord; If you need an electricity card or gas bottle, you call them and they will bring it... at some point. All post goes to a site office and will be delivered by whoever the landlord can find... at some point.  If you become too much 'trouble' the landlords can and do make things very difficult. Fear of being made homeless can make people pretty compliant, and many here are too scared, disillusioned and apathetic to fight back in any way.

One guy was 'lured' here with the promise of a job. Instead he does odd jobs when the landlords need him and often grafts for 10-11 hours a day.  For a full days work he gets paid anywhere from £5 to £20. When he told our landlord that he wouldn't work for less than £20 a day,  he was threatened with violence and eviction.

I'm pretty sure that gives you an idea of the problem at hand. Obviously we want to get out of here ASAP but don't want to just move and abandon the problem. There is too much 'out of sight, out of mind' in the world already.

Talking to the landlords could get us thrown out. Talking to the council hasn't worked. The chance of getting any number of residents to cooperate on something would be slim. 

So what can we do to even start to fix the problems?

My OH and I managed to crowdfund and organise an event for a local charity last year so we're no stranger to fund raising and crowdfunding 'something' is feasible – but what?

We've considered setting up a charity, but the amount of bureaucracy is ridiculous. We also contacted many homelessness charities before we moved here – none of them were able to offer any tangible help.

Other options could include trying to fund some sort of non-profit housing association or similar.

We have time, the internet and open minds. Our other resources are pretty thin.

Please, wonderful people of Reddit, what should we do?",19Aug2019,1

The charge is a check fraud charge and it is a six month sentence. My daughter she seems to be handling it fine. I told her right away about it and she reacted pretty calmly. I told her mom did the wrong thing and is rightfully serving her punishment. They have a good relationship. The main problem I have is she will see her mom in a jail jumpsuit and see guards and other inmates that could be intimidating.My daughter doesn’t seem Scared but rather enthusiastic and excited but I still am not sure it is a good idea. Seeing someone she knows in jail could “humanize” the place. You want to go remain a place for “bad people” and seeing her mom there will probably take away that effect",19Aug2019,0
622,"I have been working at an income tax place for about 2 month now. About two weeks ago I started doing income tax courses online during work. I studied this weekend as well and I still haven't understood anything. I just don't think I'm the best fit for the job. I feel like such a failure. I mean there's other people that can do it, why can't I!! I really want to quit but I wanted to wait until school started, which will be in 1 week. Because if I quit now I feel like I won't be able to list the experience on my resume and much less get a recommendation from my boss. Sometime this week I believe she is going to test me!! I wanted to quit until school started so that I won't look like a failure and can get off the job on good terms. What should I do? What if when she tests me I don't know what to say or blank out. I really don't know if this job is for me! I just feel so dumb and incompetent! Why won't the information stick. I even tried looking at an income tax and I didn't get it.

623,"So, to cut a long story short, my grandma has Cancer, and my family and me only heard of it today. I am very close with her, but today there was a problem: When i sat down in the small room filled with relatives and my grandma crying, i just couldn't.  
Sure, i was sad or angry, at least i think i was, but i could not cry. This problem only amplified with the time, as i got happier and happier by the hour, and now i just feel okay. Not overly happy, but not sad either.  
I really, really love my Grandma, it's not like i don't. I tried to make myself cry the entire time.  
Nothing works. And now i sit in my room, typing this story on my Computer.

625,"So i dont know if this is worth a post here, but i wanted some advice. From the beginning:

I had a friendship with a girl (callin her F), since we were 3 years old, we were together in the kindergarten and one year in elementary school. Since my parents both worked fulltime, nobody could take care of me after that, so i was always at her place, because her mother was at home, so we got real close friends.

After some years in elementary school, i changed schools because, most of my friends were at another school and it was overall better there, because of the change i lost contact with F.

After some years i found her on facebook, was about 13-14 at that time and we got in contact again. We were writing much on facebook and then moved to Whatsapp and were writing there everyday, we talked about about everything.

In this time i even thought she wanted more than be friends, cause she always talked about her bf and what an A\*\*hole he is and that she could leave him and when she broke up, we started to even send hearts to each other (then it was nothing special to me, but now it seems like a total obvious sign, but i was 14 and not thinking about something like this).

But the texting got a little bit less at some time and my phone broke and i also switched my phone number, so the contact broke again.

Until i got her number again 2 years later, this year, and tried to get in contact again, so i wrote her, but she seemed not interested, answered short and after a few messages, it was already over.

So if you got an advice, how i should behave there, because i really enjoyed talking to her, please tell me.",19Aug2019,1
626,"During my grade 11 year at High School I screwed the pooch. Started to smoke weed and cut a lot of class. Grades went down the drain, failed a couple courses and hit rock bottom that summer. Grade 12 I picked myself up again, was able to catch up on a couple of courses but am currently short 8 credits (2 courses). This summer is nearing its end and I don't have my High School Diploma, no job as of right now, and I'm in a really dark place. I would have to head back to High School as a failure to finish off 2 courses, while all my lifelong buddies are heading out to University or have plans for next year. When looking at the big picture, I know that my situation doesn't seem dire at all but I can't help but feel like I'm stuck and I don't know what to do next. I am going to apply for a job this week so that I can at least get some income. 

Couple things to note -

 I have a hefty scholarship trust fund that neither I nor my parents want to see go to waste. My English mark is decent (high 80s) and that is a big factor for most universities. I'm currently living with my mom for free but once summer is finished I will be charged rent. I have no idea what I want to study in University in the slightest.

630,I’m 20 and lately I’ve lost a lot more friends than I ever have before in my life. And it’s usually pretty malicious. 2 have blamed my girlfriend and one blamed me for being childish. It breaks my girlfriends heart seeing this because my friends have become her friends and she’s nothing but nice to any of them.

631," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d been snotty. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly.

632,"In February, my grandmother, my last grandparent ever passed away. I’ve cried about her a lot. When that happened, my grades started lowering. I couldn’t focus in school. I stressed out a lot more and even thought about suicide. I stay in my room a lot more often and barely talk to my family. We don’t talk to each other unless it’s to go to a place or to eat. That caused me to feel uncomfortable to sit down and talk to them. But another reason is that I’m extremely shy and I can barely talk to anyone IRL if I wanted to. Ah, I’m getting off topic. So back to my grandmother. To this day I still cannot get over the fact she died. She was the only person who I actually and genuinely felt cared for. I didn’t want to lose her. I often have mental breakdowns because of this and say it’s my fault for probably stressing her out at times when I’m being difficult. The last thing she asked me was “Aren’t you bored?” But she said it in Khmer which I only understand a little bit because I need to study more. I gave her a confused look but I didn’t know how to reposed back because, again, I only understand a little bit. When she died, I felt so guilty.

633,"I need some advice. I have a property that im renting out to a really good freind of mine. Hes married with 3 kids. Im only charging him almost what my mortage payment is and helping him with the bills,since he was struggling with money couple years.He has been living there for 6 years,with the same payment. I know rent has been going up,but the payment has been the same. If i were to rent the house i would be making at least $300 every month. 

He hasnt been good in paying me every month,sometimes he gives half one week and the other half in 2 weeks. Also,i should mention im payigng the bills.

What should i do should i still let him live there or tell him is time to go and rented it out to somewhere for what the rent is. This has been stressing me out lately. If i were to kick him out,how should i tell him? He has  bad credit so it would be hard for him to get another place.

635,"I'm a 38 y/o woman.  I've lept very far from my comfort zone and instead of settling for disability I'm going to college.  Except...I'm still painfully disabled. I'm doing basics online, but what would be a good career choice for a person like me?  

My disability.....my neck is leaning.  Driving is one of the hardest thing to do.  Walking is very difficult.  Reaching is often a major task.  But ultimately I CAN do things, just in a very compromised way.  I really look like I need help, and people pity me.  And yes, it's painful.  

However, I work at McDonald's.  As crippled as I am I'm very fast, very efficient, detailed, and hard working.  They pay me well and they see my disability but they want me to stay.  The one thing I cannot do is take orders on counter.  It's too hard. I do it, but I probably shouldn't.   

One reason I've decided to do this is because I have one family member that has anything to do with my support. My mother, and she's getting old and is not in great health.  She is also very broke.  I feel I need something to fall back on for the day things don't work out at McDonald's anymore.

636,"Hello r/Advice! I would love to get your advice on how to improve your communication skills and *your* biggest **struggles** and **challenges**! Communication is something we use everyday, whether it be on autopilot or more of a conscious effective communication style. I would love to hear your own thoughts, advice or communication problems in your life!

2 Years ago I played someone that I was not, I played this ""gangster wannabe"" or whatever you wanna call it, the point is it swallowed me to the point where drugs and alcohol was a normal part of life. I was 18 at the time and I thought I was the shit... As you know, how you behave rub off on other people, especially younger siblings that look up to you. Same thing goes the other way around, the more I hanged around these people the more I started to behave like them. Here I was playing someone that I wasn't for approval that I didn't need. Its tragic that something dramatic has to happen for some people to change but hey... **thats all part of life right?** 

I remember it was a day in may about a month before graduation, and I remember waking up and thinking about my grandma who died of cancer two years earlier. I started crying and I chalked it up to hidden or repressed emotions that hadn't been expressed yet, little did I know it was about to be the worst but one of the most transformational days in my entire life

I walked upstairs and was greeted by two cop officers and the two of my crying parents, who were in as big disbelief as I was that morning. I heard the words that day that I never thought I was gonna hear in my lifetime about my little brother

**He was gone..?**

He had been in a car driven by minors, and one of the kids had “borrowed” the car from his dad. That day it was rainy and as you can imagine, fast driving, middle of the night. It did not end well and only one person passed away from that incident

I fell into the biggest depression of my life and stopped hanging around my “brothers” as I called them. They were not my brothers, my real brother was not with me anymore. I started blaming the world, people… myself. Because I was the one who taught him to act that way, which in turn attracted those people into his life.  

It was a dark period of my life, I was unable to eat, sleep and therefore lost a bunch of friends as well. One day I noticed that my older brother was buying self-improvement books, I borrowed some and started reading since I wasn't doing anything better with my time anyways.  It wasn't until I read “**Psycho-Cybernetics**” by Maxwell Maltz that my life turned around dramatically. 

When I stopped blaming the world or people and having this “victim mentality”. If my brother was here today, would he want to see me depressed all my life? There was this one simple idea from that book that has stuck with me ever since and that was. 

“Truths” are things you cannot change, a loved one passing away, you losing a bunch of money gambling or whatever

“Opinions”, however, that is something we do have control over, its how we interpret the truth. Ex. truth is, I lost a loved one, an opinion is something like - “I will make him proud, I want him to look down from the sky and see his brother making a huge positive change in the world” or “What is the point anymore? I will never be the same…” 

Theres a great true story on this as well.  There was this man swimming in Hawaii and this man was swimming a long way off shore in deep territories and long story short... he got his leg bit off. **He should have been mad right?** The truth is the man in Hawaii that lost his leg was **not** mad, upset or felt sorry for himself. He was however **concerned** about.. the shark! **His belief was:**

He was responsible, not the shark because in the area he was swimming in he knew there was sharks. So if he was thrashing around, the shark might have thought it was some kind of turtle or other food for him. His **concern** was that people might get upset and go and hunt down the sharks in that area to prevent stuff like this from happening again. **The meaning he put:**

It was all a learning experience for him, normally people would probably go: ""I am crippled for life, I will never be the same... I will never be able to do X and Y again"" 

&gt;*Its* ***never*** *the event that determines how we feel, its the meaning we associate to the event that determines how we feel and that meaning is something we create when we communicate to ourselves* 

Ever since then, I have improved my life and mindset like day and night for the past two years. To change your reality, you first have to start with your thoughts. It's not the law of attraction, its science. Your dominating thoughts, determine your beliefs and values. Your beliefs and values determine your choices and actions in life. Your choices and actions determine your results in life.

&gt;*It's the small choices every day that compounds into massive changes* 

# These are some amazing beliefs you can adapt to get another perspective

* **People are not their behavior** \- Its very important we separate behavior from who a person **really** is. Just because X did Y **does not mean X is a bad** **person** but that X's behavior was bad or unacceptable. Lecture the behavior not the person
* **There's always a positive intent behind all behavior** \- Even if someone wants to commit suicide? Yes... since for **them** it would be more **painful** to live, rather than die. Remember all behavior is either one of two things. Either its a decision to move away from **pain**, or its to move closer to **pleasure**.
* **People do the best they can with the resources they have** \- Appreciate people for what they are and understand that everybody has fights and obstacles they are trying to overcome. ""**There are no unresourceful people, there are only unresourceful states**"" - Next time somebody yells at you for no apparent reason... **Change their state**, don't feed their anger. Give them something to remember, when you treat someone good even tho they treated you like crap. They will remember it for a long time
* **The meaning of communication is the response you get** \- meaning that if you Ex. say to a loved one ""I love you"" to someone and they respond inappropriately. Don't get mad, sad or discouraged, change your approach instead. Maybe it was your tone? volume? body language? As experts point out, **what we say (the actual words) is only 7% of communication**. The rest of the 93% is **nonverbal**. Come at it from a different angle and be more conscious of the tone, body language and maybe say it using words that has the same meaning? Ex. I want you to know I deeply care about you... 
* **No matter how thin you slice it, theres always two sides** \- Even if you are 100% right in an argument, theres **always** two sides of a coin. An up and down, an inside and an outside. the law of opposites. Be open minded and understand that we all can learn something from everyone, life is easier and happier that way

And yes i'm a huge Tony Robbins fan if you haven't noticed yet haha. Truly one of my heroes and one of the most influential and inspirational people in my life. 

Sorry for going on a personal development tangent, but thats one of the topics that lights me up inside. I now am trying to **improve my effective communication skills in every day life**. I hope we can all agree that we can all learn something from everyone no matter the level of expertise or experience somebody has since life is all about **growing as a human being**. If anybody has any tips, advice or maybe **share** your biggest **struggles** or **frustrations** when it comes to connecting to other people in a deeper and more effective way, please do.

638,"So... here's a little background. I lived with my (27F) sister(25F) for 5 years. It was never the most comfortable of arrangements as her boyfriend lived with us as well and I forever felt like the third wheel. I recently decided to move out and let my sister know. She asked, as a favor, that I pay an additional 2 months rent (not including last month - so 3 months in total) to help her transition into paying my portion of the rent. I decided that to help my sister out, I would pay the additional few months on top of the new rent I was paying - essentially paying for two places at the same time. 

While I was packing and prepping to move out, I mentioned that I would like to take the Instantpot (a joint Christmas gift given by my parents). She immediately became hostile and said that she uses the Instantpot way more than me. Deciding this was not the hill I wanted to die on, I let it go. She has since kept everything that has been gifted as a joint present including a Dyson vacuum (don't even get me started). 

One day when we went out for dinner, my sister mentioned that she had purchased a spare bedroom bed ($1500) and her and her boyfriend are getting a greyhound ($600). This irritated me as I had paid her extra months of rent to ""help her out"" and she goes and spends the money on other things. Admittedly it isn't my business how she spends her money, but I found it curious that she was desperate for my help with rent and managed to ""scrape together"" an extra $2100.

After moving out, my sister mentioned that there was some mess left behind in my bedroom and bathroom. I thought it was fair to go over and clean up. I've since been over 3 times as my clean up was not up to her specs. She sent a text with a list of things I hadn't done. I had reached my boiling point and sent her a message back telling her that asking me to come over for a fourth time to mop and clean nail polishes under the sink was ridiculous and she wasn't being accommodating to me at all. She called me immediately to tell me that I was lazy, ungrateful and that she shouldn't need to tell me what to clean, I'm an adult and should have it figured out by now. Out of anger, I exclaimed that I didn't appreciate her using my money to buy a bed and dog and thought that she was being selfish and entitled.

We hang up the phone and within 15 minutes, I get a phone call from my mom asking me to explain why I made my sister cry.... she had called my mother to explain the situation. I also received a text from her boyfriend telling me not to come to the house again and that he sided with my sister. 

Long story short, we're heading on vacation in a week and I know she's going to be icy. AITA here? Should I apologize to make the family vacation smoother for everybody?",19Aug2019,1

640,"warning: on moblie.

so basically i moved into my (f/19) first apartment in february, and my lease is up in march. since living alone a few weird things have happened that i really don’t know what to think about.
the first thing that happened is that my toaster moved from the kitchen counter to my coffee table in the living room overnight. it was plugged in when i went to bed and it looked like it was neatly put on the table when i woke up.

the second thing is i am missing a bowl. i had four and now i only have three. couldn’t find it when i looked for it.

the last thing is my air conditioning temp switched from 68 degrees fahrenheit to 72 degrees. it’s never done this before.

i am not sure if i am being paranoid or not, but i know that two of the maintenance men for my apartment building went through my stuff when they were there for to check on the apartment. they said they were looking for power box issues but a drawer and a closet were both left open when i came home both no where near the power box. i don’t know if this is related or not but figured i should mention it since it is weird. this happened after the toaster thing and before the bowl disappearing. 

so far the only logical explanations i can think of is that i am sleep walking, which wouldn’t make sense for the air conditioner bc it switched when i came home from work, but would explain the toaster and bowl.
i have also been told monoxide poisoning can cause paranoia, and forgetting moving objects around but i am not positive about that.
hidden cameras are being ordered soon but i still would just like some advice on how to not feel like there is a squatter in my house.

641,"Hey y’all 

I recently landed a job that provides me with some pretty sweet health insurance. I’ve been meaning to see a therapist for some issues I have, particularly dealing with my home life and insecurities, social anxiety, and occasional panic attacks. I don’t know where to start, how to look for one, etc. 

Any help is appreciated!",19Aug2019,1
642,"This is a murky situation and I haven't thought about it much since it happened 6 months ago so I'm going to do my best to recount this. I'm 24.

I became involved with a guy (John) I met on a summer program, it was clear that we were interested in each other. He initiated things and initially I was put off by his arrogance but I figured there was something deeper going on (he seemed to be putting on a show) and being me I thought I could help him be his true self or something equally niave. So we were flirting. Nothing physical. A lot of long chats. And I was really set on the idea of us becoming a thing at this point, again, thought he was a good guy hiding behind something else.

We took a trip across the country to stay in a caravan at the seaside with mutual friends. It was a drinking, swimming, BBQ, card playing kind of a deal. For one reason and another we ended up sharing a room, bunk beds. I remember not being surprised that this happened bc we liked eachother and I was hoping we might kiss finally. One night we were drinking a lot and for context I can't handle my liquor. My friends sent me to bed at 10pm, I was DRUNK, very drunk. Can't walk drunk. John came in hours later. 

I struggle to remember much of this but I'll say what I can recall clearly. He climbed into my bottom bunk but I don't remember him asking or me asking but it's possible I was up for spooning - I really liked this guy and wanted something romantic with him so I never wanted to spoil it by being too sexual too soon. I'd only ever slept with one person, boyfriend of 4 years. Next thing I remember is him kissing me but my face moving, I'm so drunk I can't move and I'm falling asleep inbetween kisses. I keep trying to force my eyes open because it's finally happening (the kissing, the start of something etc etc) but I can't stay awake. Next thing I remember is pain between my legs as he is forcing his fingers into me - I'm dry and tight and his hands are huge but even that can't keep me awake. I try to kiss him back BC I'm saying to myself in my mind, wake up, stay awake and it's consentual. I can't stay awake though and my body is limp and I pass out. I wake up again to him forcing my head down on his dick and I gag, I don't remember how I got there. He's not completely hard. He says something like ""get on top"" and lifts me onto him. I wake up a lot more because I'm in so much pain - he's a big guy. It won't go in. I keep trying to lift myself off saying ""no it's not working"" but I don't know if I said it loud or clear enough because I was so drunk. He kept trying for a few more minutes (I think?) And I can't remember any more after that. 

I wake up the next morning and he's in the top bunk, not in mine. He is already awake, on his phone. He asks me if I want a cuddle, I'm cold and it sounds nice. He comes down and I lie beside him. I remember being happy in the morning because we were cuddling and it was ""cute"". I ask him what happened because I can't remember much of it. He insists I asked for it, that I was really keen and asked him to do everything. I take that as fact because I really liked him so it sounded fair and I couldn't remember. We didn't speak of it again. 

(We then were ""seeing"" eachother for a few months. Would best be described as him getting at the benefits of me being a girlfriend and me getting no security. He told me he wasn't seeing anyone else but I know now that he was and lied about it. I have blocked him everywhere, no contact at all. We had consentual sex once but it was very violent and I had bruises all over my body. I wanted to have sex but I didn't want it to be violent.)

Was I assaulted? It's blurry for me because I really liked him, continued to date him afterwards and I genuinely struggle to remember important parts. Can't stress enough - I really liked him and really wanted us to be in a relationship. 

If I was assaulted, how should I proceed? I don't even know how I feel about right now, let alone how i will feel about it when I date somebody new. I basically don't know how to proceed with this. Any advice appreciated.",19Aug2019,6
643,"Sorry if this is long or confusing. I’m at wits end when in comes to washing towels. My Fiancé and I have agreed I do my laundry, he does his, and I have been doing the teatowels, bedding, sofa blankets, and dog’s blankets by unspoken agreement. Mainly because either I do them or I have to nag him to do them and I’d rather not be a nag. My fiancé is in charge of towels. We have enough towels to make it through a week and a few days when they are washed. But the towels are hardly ever washed - let alone folded. Since we got engaged almost a year ago, the towels have been folded and put away maybe 3-4 times. I’m not meaning to count- it’s just such an occasion that I remember it. I’ve now lowered my expectations - I can accept not ever having folded towels, and I have told him this recently. I have made it clear I just want clean ones and he can just stuff them in the cupboard unfolded. I feel like I’ve made this really easy on him. I’ve even offered to put the towels in the dryer if he tosses them in before work and I’m on a day off. Still though, days can pass with no clean towels. 
   Ideally I’d like to solve this so he does his part: but right now the only thing I can think of is to  just claim a pile of towels as mine and do my own towels and let him have some he can use and leave as long as he pleases. This is because I’m at the point where I feel I am just rewarding him putting off stuff if I wash the towels (which I have tried not to do lately as he is an adult). So maybe separating them would at least make it not my problem and force him to eventually  take responsibility. 
   So obviously I can just give up and do my own towels. But I already do almost all the cooking and grocery shopping and I have enough to do already. So do any guys (or others)  have any advice on how to get him to actually do his share of laundry? Besides this issue, we have a great relationship that I don’t want to ruin. I’m just getting so fed up with towels getting put off. Anyone else gone through this and solved it? 

TLDR; I do majority of laundry, and Fiancé is supposed to do his clothes and the towels. Towels hardly ever get done on time so we run out of clean ones regularly. Guys or other people who have been through this issue - how would you recommend approaching the issue so he does his share?",19Aug2019,1
644,"I really don't know how to start this besides saying that I need advice because I really dont know what to do anymore about the situation. My parents have been married for 26 years. I cant complain about my childhood, for me it was the best. My parents were very involved in my life, sometimes a bit too much. Some context: I was raised in a very strict cuban family. It was always just my mom,dad, and I. They were my everything and I've always had them in a high pedestal. I love and respect them dearly for they have been through everything with me. Truly they were my bestfriends growing up. 
But then everything changed when I turned 19. My mother was diagnosed with stage 4 colon and liver cancer and that rocked my family to the core. Everything changed instantly like night and day. For the next 4 years my father was by my mother's side for everything and anything she needed. My mom found peace and refuge in my room. She had asked me to move out and live with my boyfriend at the time (now my husband). Prior to the cancer I had mentioned the idea to move out but she was very against it. But after almost dying she decided to let me go and see me live my life. *prior to this I had an 8pm curfew, so yes very strict parents. It worked out in the end because I became very independent. Got into college, got married and my mom was around to see everything happen. 
Fast forward to 4-5 years later, my mom is now better and her cancer was in remission. She honestly is a warrior! However, things at home weren't the same. My mom was noticing that my dad was distant and cold. Saying mean things and honestly just being an a-hole. To keep this very long story short, one day, out of no where, he tells my mom that he is done. He wants her out of the apartment, to go live with me, he says his life has not been a life for the last 4 years. He was very aggressive and throwing stuff around the house. At this point in time, I lived right across the street in a house to accommodate my horse of a dog. I had an extra room and I remember how I ran to my old home, my parents apartment, to see what was going on. I found a very enraged man that looked like my father but wasn't acting like one. I immediately went off on him, grabbed my mother's things and began moving her to my house. This all happened on mother's day weekend last year 2018. 
After that, my mom's liver cancer came back but luckily she started to live with me and it went back into remission.
My need for advice comes that now he's pretending as if nothing ever happened. Wants to talk to me and my husband and pretend like things didnt happened. As if he didnt kick out a sick women out of his house, as if he didnt kick out his wife! Also, when all this happened not even a week later he moved some random women into my old home... I cant even look at that apartment as my childhood home anymore. I miss my dad soo much but it feels like I haven't seen him in the last 4-5 years. When I see him all I see is someone who used to look like my dad. I dont know what to do about him. He also never divorced my mom to keep getting health care benefits. My mom, dont worry about her, shes living her best life now. She can go out as much as she pleases, cook whatever meal she wants and literally do w.e she wants. Shes my idol, my queen and deserves nothing but the best.  
Any advice would be greatly appreciated! I know the post may seem like it's all over the place and I'm sorry for that!",19Aug2019,4

650," Sorry, long post and title speaks for itself.

Basically, my husband and I finally had a weekend to celebrate our anniversary after having to delay due to birth of our child right before our first wedding anniversary.  So we book the place we stayed at when we got engaged and took our infant with us while the rest of our kids stayed with other family members.  We live in a rather small community and usually everyone out here is great about helping others out when in a pinch.  I've had a 16 year old neighbor (3 doors down the street) babysit some of our kids before who was wonderful.  Smart girl, plays sports. . . Sports is life kinda chick.  We made sure to compensate her very well in hopes that she would always want to be available if/when we need her for our four, sometimes five kids (every time she's babysat our two 4 year olds, we paid her $50 for 3 hours, basically all they do is play cars and watch a movie, super easy).

Anyways, so we actually had two trips booked back to back (one to fly to another state with our kids to visit family) and then our anniversary trip was the following weekend.  Prior to the first trip, I reached out to her Mom to see if she would be cool with her daughter staying overnight at our house with our dogs while we were gone.  Her Mom says she's totally cool with it and to reach out to the kid to sort out the details.  So I do, I have her over to show her what she'd be doing (sleeping in our bed with dogs, feed them and let them out about 3 times a day) and told her to not worry about picking up dog poop, walking them, or any other tasks.  I told her to please feel free to help herself to our fridge and snacks in our kitchen, set her up with wifi in case she doesn't get good reception in our house, showed her how to use out Netflix and Hulu.  Pretty much, the girl had it made here.  Very easy money, didn't expect her to do anything she wasn't already doing at her house with their family dog.  I asked her what her rate was, and she said she had never house/dog sat before and didn't have a rate.  I told her I would look around online to see what something like this usually goes for so I wouldn't be ripping her off.  Of course, online I found all sorts of rates for our area, anything from $10/night to even $80/night and also providing more service than we asked for.  

So she stays at our house for the first trip that we're gone for.  About halfway through she calls me in a panic and sounding worried that apparently our 2.5 year old dog broke our screen door when she went to let them out that day.  Figured it was kind of weird since she said that she was letting them out with them on leashes, but whatever.  We have security cameras outside our house (though this incident would not have been caught on camera) and we never looked at them while we were gone since I trust her and know her family.  I tell her not to worry about the screen door, we'll fix it when we get home and thanked her for letting me know right away.  When we get back from our trip, we paid her $125 for 4 nights (breaks down to $31.25/night).  I was out back to school shopping with my oldest kids when she came over for the money, and my husband said she looked elated to be receiving that kind of money.  I told her to just hold onto our house key since we'd be leaving for our next trip 6 days later.

We leave for our anniversary trip and we're excited to be down 4 kids and only have baby which is too young to leave, but that's all good, it's extra special bonding time with him and us for the weekend.  Not long after getting to our destination, getting upgraded to the best room there, and settling in, I get a text from her saying she realizes she said before she didn't have a rate, but in the future she would be charging $40/night.  Ummmmm, okay?  She couldn't wait until after our trip to tell me this?  I get that she's saying it's for in the future, but this of course makes us feel like we've ripped her off and taken advantage of her.  I don't respond, I'm not going to spend my weekend working myself up over it.  The next morning I get a call from a neighbor asking if we're expecting teenage girls at our house (our oldest kid is 8).  GIRLS?  Plural??  I said no, we should just have one girl at our house watching the dogs.  Then the neighbor asks then if we were expecting a group of teenagers at our home the week before.   Obvious answer here, OF COURSE NOT.  I'm livid.  I call my Mom who lives in the same neighborhood but of course can't ever be bothered with watching our dogs (they're big and she's a little dog person).  She goes over to our house, introduces herself (the girl only opens the door slightly and is blocking the entry with her body) and says she has some returns I asked her to pickup for me (while waiting for her to answer the door, she hears a door from inside close).  She reluctantly lets her in, and my Mom immediately notices the door to our master bedroom is closed, odd.  She goes straight for it and finds another girl hiding in our bed.  Mom does a walk around of the rest of the house, grabs the bag of returns and leaves.  After this, we immediately log onto our security system which is able to pickup conversations in the house from outside if you turn it up enough (however, it will not record footage if you log on and listen live, bummer).  We can hear the girls in the house flipping out and the sitter telling her friend what a bitch my mom was, walking in like she just owned the place (lol, whatever) and thank god she didn't come the week before when she had all her other friends over (named a bunch of guys and another girl), then they're obsessing over whether or not they hid the shot glasses good enough or if they thought she could've seen them.  They're literally freaking out, and the friend asks where we even were and when we're expected back.  Sitter tells her that her Mom said we went somewhere a couple hours away and we won't be back until the next day.  So they both calm down a little bit, she tells the friend she now wishes that she hadn't sent me her last text regarding the increased rate but that she'll just blame it on her Mom so I'd understand.  Then brags to the other girl about last time she stayed here and her friends and her went to the river for the day, they all got hungry so she gave them a shitload of our kids snacks (don't really care about the money aspect of that, they're dollar store snacks but damn it's hard to shop with 5 young kids).  They're laughing and every now and then you can tell the sitter has a freak out moment while her friend convinces her it'll be fine, and then she even agrees that she'll just tell her Mom that she was too scared to be there by herself so she had her girlfriend over, and that her Mom would know what to say because she's the best liar.  Okay, so apparently this isn't just as easy as calling her Mom at this moment while we're out of town to handle this.  

At this point my husband and I are both stressed beyond belief, our house has been hosting teenage hangouts.  Imagine someone getting hurt on our property.  I'm calling everyone I know in hopes they're available to go over there and relieve her from her services and save our dogs from all these shenanigans.  Luckily, I reach my cousin's wife, their AC had went out the day before so perfect situation to have them go stay at our house instead now.  I text the girl that my cousins AC went out and I offered our house to them since they have a young baby, I ask her to let me know when she gets back to my house so I can have them go over there because they'd need a key to get in.  I also ask what all would be included in her services for that increased rate.  It works, they meet at my house and exchange the key without a hinge.  Keep in mind, I still never responded to her text regarding a rate increase.  So right after she gets the boot from my house, I receive this text: 

Sorry, I'm not trying to make an issue.  I was surprised when I was paid $25/day when I was staying over.  Most of my friends get paid that for just stopping in once or twice a day and letting them out versus kinda house sitting and staying over.  When I looked up the rates online for home pet sitting it was a lot higher rate.  You guys have paid well in the past so I didn't think it was going to be an issue.  I guess I should of done my research before I accepted the job and that's my bad.  I'm sorry.  I'm not trying to charge you more now.  I was just saying in the future or next time.  My mom said that I should talk to you about it.  Hopefully I didn't do anything wrong to not finish my job this weekend watching the dogs.  

&amp;#x200B;

I don't respond to the text, it's obviously far too much to get into and at this point we're trying to salvage and enjoy what little is left of our weekend getaway which we rarely get to do.  At this point, we are obviously shocked at the audacity, number one asking for more money, claiming I only paid $25/day when it was 4 days, not 5 so I actually paid her $31.25 and didn't ask her to do hardly anything.  Number two, to ask for rate increase after disrespecting us and our house.  The audacity and entitlement is strong with this one!  

So we finally get back home yesterday, my house is trashed (short notice of her dismissal obviously didn't leave her enough time to clean up and hide evidence).  I've got kids gummy fruit snacks smashed into my carpet, cheerios scattered on my floor under the couch (this is not from our kids, they are only allowed to eat at the table in the kitchen), candy cane wrappers littered on the floor, some fell off the counter and into the second sink in the kitchen under the infant bath.  Our liquor cabinet has obviously been gone through.  Starbucks cup with some dudes name on it in our trash.  Door to our kids bedrooms are not closed like how I left them to keep dogs out.  I'm irritated.  We now get to spend our day unpacking, running all bed linens through the laundry because I can certainly guarantee our house has been used a teenage safe space to fuck.  Call me stupid, I realize it NOW.  Did my husband and I do similar crap like this when we were teens, yes, but never someone else's house and certainly not three doors away from my parents who could potentially pop in at any moment.  

I notice on facebook her Mom posts a picture of them all out to eat for dinner.  I text the girl telling her we're just getting settled in and to let me know when they get back from dinner so I can swing by to pay her.  They end up not getting home until after 8 p.m., baby and another kid are already in bed asleep.  I schedule a different day this week to pay her.  She's clearly dead set on making it a point to say she will come to my house even though I've said twice I'd swing by her house.  But no, my husband and I plan on going to her house while her Mom is home too and give her a chance to tell her Mom what she's been up to at our house.  Obviously we cannot have this conversation without her parent there and I'd want to know if it was my kid.  More than likely she thinks we only know about the girlfriend and will probably trickle truth that to her Mom in front of us, and we plan on telling her there's still more she needs to disclose to her Mom.  We were able to hear a lot through our outdoor security system.  Probably also bring up the audacity she had to ask for increased rate after what she's been doing in our home.  I know her Mom has no idea so far because I know I would've heard something from her by now fishing to see what we know to potentially cover for her daughter.  

Honestly, very thankful we pieced it together.  My husband and I both deal with traumatic experiences of being cheated on.  I can't help but to think what if one of their little boyfriends left something behind, a girl dropped an earing, someone left behind a condom wrapper, etc.  We would be having some serious problems and we have never given the other a reason to not trust and that could've been ruined because of this spoiled, entitled little girl. 

Not sure if I'm looking for advice, vent, or both.",19Aug2019,5
651,"I’m sorry if this is a stupid question and I might be answering my own question, but I feel like sometimes I’m just over-reacting.  Sorry that it’s long as well.  I’m sorry if something is incorrect. I haven’t posted much before and the reddit community is, kinda scary lol.

Anyway, I’ve been thinking about going to therapy for mental health for a long time, since middle school, (I’m 20) but wasn’t able to when I lived with my parents.  I feel like I can’t keep friends and if I try, I feel like I’m forcing a friendship which I don’t want to do.  I feel like all my friends get irritated with me or annoyed and we always seem to lose touch. I might get a message once in a while but the conversation will seem to trail off and when I try to make plans with friends, they’ll either say they have plans or we will set something up and then they don’t show up.  I have had good friends but they’ve all moved away for college. I know when people are toxic but even good friends have lost touch like this.  

I’m extremely introverted and generally nervous. I live in a small town. So new people are hard to come by. I don’t go to college and I work at a small office of about 7 people where everyone is significantly older than me and most have kids my age. 

I had gone to therapy before but it was a type of conversion therapy disguised as family therapy (long story) and that generally turned me off from therapy for a while.  I know now that a lot of therapy is not like that. My parents are extremely religious (I am not) and believed that mental health therapy doesn’t work; that praying to god was the only thing that did. My parents did not approve of being gay so I grew up hiding my feelings from everyone. 

Some days are good. I’ll feel happy and willing to take on the world. Others are bad and I feel unable to do anything besides lay in bed. The latter has been increasingly more common.

I hate that feeling. I want to feel like I can do things, like chores around my house or go somewhere new and experience something cool.  When I don’t want to leave my bed I feel even worse because I know I’m wasting a day away and I start to feel completely lost in life.

I don’t want to be put on drugs that make me lose a sense of personality, I was told that a lot of the times therapists put people on medication to make them “happy.” (This is my family speaking so I don’t know if it’s true)  I guess I just want to be able to talk to someone without feeling like I’m burdening them with my thoughts and feelings and be given a professional advice about what I feel and how to cope.

652,"I try to keep it short because I’m still at work. This guy who I don’t know too well met at the bus stop yesterday before work. We talked and he figured he would run to the store to buy an energy drink before the bus arrived and asked if I wanted one, I said No but thank you. He bought one anyway and I accepted it and thanked him. Nothing weird, I thought it was nice of him.

Today I had 20 minutes to wait for the bus and I went to buy a sandwich and an energy drink. I thought of what he did and figured I’d return the favour, I know he likes those energy drinks and bought one for me and one for him. I thought nothing more of that.

653,"So I’ll just make this as short as possible. 

Basically, in October I will be coming up to a year of owning my condo. I really love it and I’ve put a lot of work/time/thought into upgrading it this last year. I mean new floors, paint, fixtures, appliances, art tailored to the house, etc. Almost everything updated and new. 

But now I’m looking at buying a dog (larger dog) this next spring. 

I don’t feel like it’s fair to raise a dog in a place they can’t run around or be let outside whenever they want. Sure, I will walk her and take her to the park very regularly ... but it’s not the same as just being able to go out and lay in the yard on a nice fall day. You know? 

So now I’m met with my dilemma ... I really want a house, but I still enjoy my condo. 

Do I sell and try to buy a small new place that will fit better with my soon to be new life of being a dog dad and start my home improvement all over again. This will mean buying a “downgrade” of a home and moving out of the neighborhood I love. (I live in a very safe and fairly expensive area - but only because I got very lucky with my condo price.)

654,"I had a friend way back in highschool my freshman year. She was extremely boy crazy and at the time. I was dating a guy and she would flirt with him and be very blatantly disrespectful about it.

After we graduated they started dating and they now have a kid together. I’m not bothered at all by any of this. Because he and I barely lasted two months. I had no attachment to him. And I am happy for them. I honestly don’t care what they do. That’s their life. 

Fast forward a few years later on and I guess they broke up because they both added me on social media. They both removed all pictures of them together. So I assumed as such.

657,"So I will not mention any names to keep this confidential, but one of my long-term best friends (22F) is suffering from an undiagnosed mental illness. It’s obvious. She has a huge fear of being excluded and goes into fits of rage and jealousy. She’s been a very anxious person for as long as I can remember and I’ve always pushed her to get help but she refuses in fear of being medicated. Finally, she was put on an SSRI to treat depression and anxiety together. I am also on an SSRI so I was able to offer her an insight on what it is like to be on them. She is so worried about the medicine changing who she is and making her feel weird. I was happy that she finally agreed to be put on medication since she will not do anything else, but now I’m worrying that this is not the kind of medication she should be on. For awhile she isolated herself out of the blue from all of her friends. She self medicates with drugs. Mainly alcohol, but has used opiates and methamphetamine in the past. I was able to help her out of her addiction with stimulants and things seemed good for awhile but now she is just worrying me. She came to a moving away party for my friend this weekend and ended up getting blackout drunk, which is not uncommon lately from what she told me that night. It’s hard to stop her as well. I did not want her to drink like she did, but it’s hard to put a stop to it when one minute she’s fine and it’s like the flip of a switch and she’s completely wasted. While being this inebriated she went out to my friends car to talk on the phone with someone (car did not have keys in it). All of a sudden she comes in frantically to tell me that the people in the car are freaking her out and that I need to kick them out. I follow her to the car where all the doors are open and she’s freaking out and pointing inside the car. She keeps saying “you need to do something they need to leave they keep saying stuff.” At that point I calmed her down and told her that we were the only ones there and there was nobody in the car. There was no possible way there could be anyone in the car either since I live in the rural country and everyone else was accounted for. She was skeptical and kept saying “you better not be lying.” This scared me. I’ve never seen her have hallucinations or delusions. But for the rest of the night she kept mumbling things that just did not make sense about God and Jesus and she’s not even a religious person. And the next day my other friend told me that she was saying dark things to her that night. Stuff like how she is “addicted to being depressed and loves hitting lows and freaking out and going crazy on people” she also said that she cuts her hips and loves the way it makes her feel. I’ve never heard anything this bizarre from her until this weekend and have never had any reason to believe she was anything other than anxious and mildly depressed. She is completely clean of drugs. Does not smoke weed and is drug tested. Does anyone have any idea what this could be? And what could happen to her if this medicine isn’t the right one for her? I’ve been keeping an extra close eye on her ever since and my other friend has been doing the same because we do not want anything bad to happen to our friend. Please any advice would be helpful.",19Aug2019,1

660,"So I have these two really close friends. Let's call them Luke and Leia. Luke has had a crush on Leia for a long time,almost a year. He asked her out in March but got rejected. We all remained good friends. Leia thinks Luke moved on... He never did.

Months later, I have a big break up with a long relationship and I felt pretty sad. Leia being a good friend talked and texted me daily. And eventually we both started to flirt a lot with each other. one day she asked me to come to her place.

One thing lead to another and I started taking a liking to Leia. However I wasn't ready for another relationship so soon. I told her how I felt and she concluded this. She wanted to be friends with benefits. The idiot I am accepted eagerly.

Basically we kept this relationship secret (idk why she wanted to keep it that way) Luke still thinks he has a shot,despite me trying to convince him to move on.

661,"I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 3 years now. He’s about to go on a trip with me to meet more of my family in a different country. The thing is, I have a weird history with my cousin and I don’t know if I should mention it to my boyfriend. 

When my cousin and I were little, like 5 years old (we’re about the same age), I would call him my boyfriend. Long story short, I had seen his penis. We had kissed as kids. As teenagers, I kept my distance from him, but then he’d be inappropriate and smack my ass. Trust me, incest is the last thing I want. And I’ve been trying to avoid him but still be civil whenever I’m visiting from the states. I think he’s gotten the message too that what we did was wrong and shouldn’t be done, but he and I haven’t spoken about it ever and I don’t know if I should just leave it alone. I’ve told my mom a long time ago before I met my boyfriend and she also says I should just avoid my cousin.

Since my boyfriend will be meeting the rest of my family, should I tell him to avoid my cousin? I KNOW that my boyfriend will hate him instantly and I don’t want bad blood. I don’t know what to do. Should I just keep it a deep dark secret? I don’t want to hurt my boyfriend either by keeping secrets.",19Aug2019,1
662," I will try to keep this as short and concise as possible. If you are familiar with Canada/ live there you are probably more likely to help. Up until last year I lived in New Brunswick my entire life and moved to Ontario to pursue a PhD in chemistry. At the same time, my long distance (3 years) boyfriend also moved to Ottawa for a new job. The primary catalyst for me moving to Ontario was for him. I hated doing a PhD and decided to take a leave from it in June and have not been able to find a job in this city (Ottawa).

I have a Master's in Chemistry and as you can imagine, it is frustrating to apply to jobs and not even get a chance for an interview. With this, all of the financial income is on my bf (i have a part time job to help out, but its not much) so I feel guilty whenever I go out to buy something. We also tend to fight a lot about financial and general stuff and last weekend we had a stupid argument but that for me was the straw that broke the camel's back and I have realized that I may not want to be in a relationship right now and maybe need to work on myself.

So, my current situation is that I can leave the relationship, but I do not have the financial support to stay in Ontario on my own. Meanwhile, I do have parents to fall back on in New Brunswick until I get back on my feet. Literally all of my roots are in New Brunswick (friends, family) and since I have moved everything here has just felt...wrong. I just hate not knowing if I am making the right decision to go back to NB or not. This is a lot of information and I may have left some stuff out so if anyone has ever been in a similar situation and can help I would very much appreciate it.

663,"So tonight my mom invited me to come have dinner with her and her new boyfriend of 1 month and a half.
I am feeling uncomfortable based off of my mother's previous instances.

To start off, my mom got married at a very young age and hasn't had much in the dating life since she has been committed to one man for 20+ years.
She is recently divorced from my dad, who is somewhat abusive. (Not physically)

She tried online dating and has been talking to NUMEROUS men, meeting up with them, going out to places with little to no other people. 
She even continues to talk to these people after she's already went on other dates (or dating another.)
She even takes advantage of out of town relatives by inviting these people to their house to ""cuddle.""
She has done a lot to show me that it is unsafe and irresponsible, and certainly would not want her daughter to do.

Perhaps the biggest offender:
This new man, we will call him John, wanted to take her two states away to play tourist for the day. This drive is easily half the day.
She has been dating John for less than a month when this happened, and had known him for less than 1 month. and was all for it.
I tried to talk about it to her but I'm ""unsupportive"". My sister talked her out of it, but they still went across the state to his parent's house, which is still better at least.

Another kept saying that he just wanted to tie her up and have his way with her. This same guy also took pictures of her car, license plate, among other things.
She continued to hang out with this guy.

Personally, I think it is irresponsible and dangerous to date, or go on continuous dates with multiple men whilst dating some of them, sneaking around late at night to go somewhere deserted without telling anyone, and deciding to go across 2 states with a man she's met for less than a month ""just for the day"".
Everything here makes me very, VERY uncomfortable. I'm trying my best to let her know how I feel, but she thinks I'm being unsupportive, only my sister can really get to her, and she lives far away too.

For clarity, I honestly don't care if my mom is with another man other than my dad. He is an asshole, and I just want her happiness. But, I want her to he safe and responsible in her pursuit.
She has done a lot more for me to be concerned with her safety, but it's too much to list here.
She is 45, and seems to be acting more like a teenager than I did.

TL;DR 
I don't approve of my mother's relationship because I think she is making  irresponsible, dangerous decisions. She wants to meet up with him and I for dinner. What do I do?

669,"Hello, I could use some advice. My girlfriend and I have been dating for about two months. I knew she was clinically depressed when we started dating. She cut herself a few weeks before we meet. My family found out by stalking her Instagram, where she uses a bunch of hashtags that are a little off putting; ""#unstable, #ugly, #depressed"" etc. They are very much against the relationship now, because they feel she will always be inclined towards depression, and that it would be dangerous to have a baby with her if she is depressed. I recently found out that her grandfather killed himself, and her uncle is permanently in a psychiatric hospital. Her depression doesn't worry me too much, because she is always happy when we hang out and talk. The main thing that concerns me is that she is well over $4000 in debt, and she is continually using her credit card on frivolous things, like fast food and a new haircut. My family doesn't know about the debt. 

My question is, are these valid concerns? Would I be an asshole to break up over these things? I do like her, but I hate the tension it is causing my family. What would be the best way to break up with her, I can't really just say my family disapproves of her, I'd worry what that would do to her mental health. Thanks for any help",19Aug2019,5

676,"My bestfriend (idk if I can really call him that) demands all kinds of things. We are very good friends for a long time and just recently became bestfriends. I don't know anymore if it was the right decision to call him my bestfriend since we only talk about deep topics. He said he doesn't want to be alone and needed someone like a bestfriend. That's why I said that I can be his bestfriend since I thought we understand each other well. But recently, he he's been having anxieties and blames me for it because he always feel like he's unimportant around me. He said I was the only one benefiting our friendship and I was really insensitive. So I thought it was the case and thought I was wrong and apologized to him for taking him for granted. However it wasn't really the case after all. I evaluated and thought over and over when did I go wrong and when was the time that I didn't reciprocate but all I could think of was I did nothing wrong and treated him well. When he had a problem I was there to listen to him, when he needed advices, I gave him a lot. It's not only one time when he had meltdowns and everytime he has one he always blame me for it. He always say that I didn't appreciate him and really felt unimportant but it's ironic that he was the one not appreciating me. I tried explaining my side to him and things relating his insecurities and how to overcome it but he never listens to me and always think he was right and making me feel that I'm the bad person. He always said how shitty and bad person I am and I did nothing to defend myself since I don't know if I'm really bad afterall. Whenever I'm around him in those times always makes me feel like I'm really a bad person. I can't even talk to others on how I felt because he said not to talk about it to anyone and I feel like I'm not allowed to talk about my side. He always believed I'm the selfish one for not reciprocating and I always apologized for it because I thought it was true. But I felt like he was the selfish one afterall. He always demand that I treat him fairly (I didn't know what that means because I've always treated him fairly) but I just found out that what he means by that is I should always give him all my attention. He always gets jealous when I talk to others and demands that I talk to him too. I always talk to him but whenever I talk to him it's like he's not interested in what I'm talking and doesn't contribute to the conversation and whenever I talk to other people and had fun with them, he said that he feels like I don't  like him. He always want me to start to talk to him a topic that would interest him but he himself doesn't open a conversation. I know he has insecurities and anxiety but it's just tiring to be someone who is so needy and doesn't contribute to the friendship. Right now I feel like I'm just some tool and feel responsible for him always. I always feel like he just call me his bestfriend because he always fear of being alone and needed someone to understand him. 

I was holding onto our friendship because I fear that it would be wrong and would regret it later if i let go. I am afraid that if I would let go he would feel unimportant. I am afraid that he would think he is alone again and be anxious why he isn't enough. I wouldn't be able to look him in the face again if ever he would feel depressed because of me. He wasn't like that and I wanted to be bestfriends with him because he is a good person and I felt comfortable opening up to him. He was a person whom I thought I could grow. But right now, I always feel like I'm walking on eggshells when I'm around him and talking to him. I feel pressured that one action of mine would probably make him feel unvalued again. I am afraid that his perspective of me is true because he saw a tweet about something like ""I wouldn't feel unimportant if you never made me feel that way"" and shoved it in my face. I always apologized for making him feel that way. I understand him that he just wants to feel valued and he is sick of losing friends (since it was the case). Moreover, I feel like this friendship isn't really genuine and instead forced. I feel like he only values me because I am something he needed, someone who could handle his emotional capacity and will always try to understand him; someone who will make him feel validated. I also think that's why he is still holding onto our friendship too because even though if I haven't met his expectations (make him feel validated) I was the only one he knew who would be patient to him and handle all his shits. I just want your opinion on this guys and I would like to know what to do since I find our friendship really tiring.",19Aug2019,0

678,"Hey Reddit! I'm not really sure if this is the right sub, if not let me know I guess...

Where do I start? 

I grew up in a third world country and moving when i was really young meant i didn't know my dad was abusive. Maybe it was the alchohol? I was 4 when my mom use to get me involved in their fights, telling me he was a bad person etc. I don't understand why we then moved countries when I was 6 but yeah. I was 14 when I became the human shield for my mom ; they'd come back from the bar and argue about my dad cheating on her again. She'd find my crying in my room in the dark and leave me alone.

&amp;#x200B;

I moved back to my country of origin at 17 alone. My parents were never very supportive of school and obviously thought I was dumb, forcing me to drop exam subjects but I carried on anyway. About 6 months later I'd met my bf and things were a little better, except for his extremely bossy mother - he would have to drop everything for her or she'd have a temper tantrum so he'd often be late to seeing me. I probably should have ended it there but I didn't know anyone, I was only just 18 and hated my family. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically went through a lot trying to keep a job, live in a new house with girls who were horrible to me and trying to study but I got through it and thought things would get better. The course finished and so I moved to another part of my home country. I didnt have Math or Science so I went to night school whilst working 3 jobs to support myself. After another 6 months of that, I applied to a college for the next level of my education. My dream was to be a doctor, wether or not my parents thought I was intelligent enough - which they would remind me I wasnt.

&amp;#x200B;

After 2 years of working 2 days a week and going to college 4 days, I never had enough energy or money to do much more and so was happy that my boyfriend would drive down to see me when he could. His father then passed away and his mother became mental, mood swings all the time, telling people she'd kill herself, wouldnt shower, screamed at anyone who tried to help her in a way she didnt want... My boyfriend then went back to university and our relationship really suffered. My friends at college were a lot older than me and didn't even want to know what was going on in my life ; like that my family had moved back and I was sleeping in a small double bed with my mother for two years at the age of 20-21... I didn't like anyone. Not even the people I worked with! I realise now it was the depression. I just felt like I was worth more than some stupid shop job that I never really enjoyed, only to get away from my family. Couldn't even have freinds over if I wanted to because my family would never leave!

&amp;#x200B;

Some more shit happened and my mom left, leaving me with my little sister. My little sister began to be abusive so I moved out. We never got along, she'd always spread shit at school about me because i was always sick (pneumonia). what do you expect in a third world country?! Anyway, I left her and had to move into my boyfriends mothers house as I hadnt even finished college thus had no money.

&amp;#x200B;

Once I'd finished college, I applied to medical school and was accepted. The summer before I left though, my boyfriends mother forced me out because I had said that it would be a good idea if the family received some counselling for the loss of her husband. And so, my fight with life continued. I lived in my car for three months and then went to Med school. I got one semester into school and found out I have brain damage. I feel like everything I did was a waste of time. My memory is going and I'm unable to speak sometimes, I shake all over and have extremely bad vertigo so my dream of being a doctor is over. 

My boyfriends mother has done more crazy shit and so he feel isolated from his family too - along with not being able to grieve for his later father etc.. His depression is bad too. Some days we just dont eat. 

What's the point of carrying on? People say it'll get better but it never does.

685," 

So me and my friend have had some very personal conflicts and issues. I won't go into full detail, but now I despise her. The other day, I left my phone's charging cable at her house, so I decided to ask her if she could give it back. This morning, I drove to her house, rang the doorbell, but noticed she wasn't home. However, the door was not locked and I could open it. I went to the living room where I last had the cable, and sure enough it was there. I was about to walk out when her cat, Tom, walked up to me and hissed at me. I kicked him hard with my foot and I went into her kitchen, and then I saw a glass of some pop on the counter. I was just pissed off, so I grabbed some isopropyl alcohol from her laundry room and put some into the glass. I forgot how much, but it was more than a few drops. I got out of the house, and drove away.

What legal trouble can I get into? I don't know if she drank the poisoned pop, but she most likely did. I haven't heard back from her. I think her cat was alright, but I did go hard on him.",19Aug2019,0
686,"So basically, I have a girlfriend. I'm 19, she's 17. I think she's an amazing person with a lot of good qualities...only problem is I'm not in love with her. I don't feel like she's my other half. I don't feel like I want to spend the rest of my days with this girl, however, she is obssessed with me. She is head over heals for me, would do anything and is madly in love. So why else do I want to break up with her?

First of all, we get into fights a little too often for my liking. She has really bad trust issues and their difficult to deal with sometimes. Secondly, I'm going to be going to college in a few days and we're going to be a 2 hour car ride away from each other. She insists we'll get to see each other but honestly I have no idea how we're going to pull that off. So first I was thinking I can use the distance as an excuse to break up with her, but she told me last night that if I ever try to break up with her because of distance, she literally would not let me break up with her because of that. So I guess that's not an option anymore.

I've been thinking about breaking up with her for a couple weeks now, but just last night she got me a huge gift box. It contained bracelets, dog tags with loving messages, food, and jars of sticky notes that include things she loves about me, physical features she loves about me, memories we have together, etc. She put so much work into all of it and spent all of this money, it was the most thoughtful thing you can imagine. You can see by this point why I think she's such an amazing girl.

The problem is I'm just not feeling it with. I don't want to come off as an asshole nor as if this stuff doesn't mean shit to me; **nobody** has ever done something like this for me before let alone how far she went. The point is though, we're just not meant for each other and I know that. I just don't know how I'm supposed to break up with this girl now. How can I break such a precious heart? I could just be honest with her and tell her I'm not feeling it, but if you ask me, *that's* being a heartless asshole who doesn't care about another person's feelings. I don't want to do it that way...how could I?

I know that the sooner I end it the better because dragging on something that's not meant to be will just make it worse and harder for the both of us, but I'm simply at a loss. Perhaps I will figure something out, I really just needed to get this off my chest. But if anybody has any ideas or suggestions on how I'm going to address to her that we need to break up, I will take whatever I can get. Any advice would be appreciated.

However, in the summer of my 10th grade year my club swim team fell apart, forcing me to relocate to another club and focus primarily on high school. So in the beggining of my 11th grade year, I went to this new club team that was just absolutely horrid. The club was overcrowded, everyone was mean and terrible, and the workouts for written for the top swimmers which led to no coach attention for me and never being able to complete a full workout (worth mention that this also led to me being lapped so many times and having to sit on the wall just because I had to wait for people to pass me). This year was one of the hardest years of my life. I never ever swam well at meets, and I would constantly cry because I would always gain an exorbitant amount of time at every single meet. I literally witnessed my strokes get worse and slower due to just completely wrong workouts. By the time senior year rolled around, I actually counted down the days where I could just swim high school during high school swim season. Now high school wasn’t awful, I didn’t love swim practice, but by the time districts rolled around I would always get really excited and swim well, the team element was also really there because I loved all of them. While I was looking for a college, I inevitably thought that I should look for a school where I could either swim varsity or club swim, it was a part of me for so long and after swimming my last high school district race, I straight up sobbed (this told me I probaby should continue swimming). So, I decided to go and swim Division 1 for freshman year of college because I thought it would definitely be better in a different environment. While the workouts were definitely better for me, the people again were absolute trash. Ontop of already having freshman year struggles, they made it so much worse. I had thought I was friends with many of them, but I always found myself feeling like I was the nuissance and they would always get together without me. By the end of the year I dropped them, but it still didn’t make it much better. I inevitably thought I was just burnt out and needed a break, so when swim season ended in March, I probably swam about 20 times from March-til now. I can safely say I don’t miss it at all but I do love the feeling I get after working out and when I do well. I like the feeling swimming gives me, but I hate working for it. I go to swim practice because I have to, but I never actually want to. I’m motivated to stay on the team so I can have somewhat of a social life and I’m scared that if I quit I’m going to be losing a major part of myself and be bored all the time. As much as I am unhappy, I literally can never imagine myself quitting. Please please help! Any advice is thoroughly appreciated.",19Aug2019,6
688,"So this is my first post on Reddit in its entirety, let alone the r/Advice S.R so I really don't know a lot about it. And I don't know if this is the best place for this kind of post, but I don't have much of a choice.

Nearly 2 months ago now, I left school after finishing my GCSEs (I live in the U.K, those are our exams for you non-Brits.) I had 2 very good friends at my school who are 2 years younger than me but they act more mature than any of the people from my year/grade. I asked them if they had any social media accounts so that I could not lose them when I left. 

I have social anxiety and whenever I want to say something I always chicken out and don't say anything, so this just lead me to moving on and leaving the school without an address, a phone number. Anything. My social anxiety I guess made me forget that asking for an address or a phone number or something was an option and I wish I could've changed the actions I did.

I was wondering if there's any way I could reconnect with them. I could go to the school and talk to them through the gates but I don't want to be put on some kind of register because that would be creepy AF, and a lot of people would question what I'm doing. I've looked for any social medias I can, and so far none have turned up any results. Is there any way I can find them? Sorry if this is a garbled mess, I really don't know what I'm doing.",19Aug2019,1
689,"Hello

I'll keep this short

I was recently promoted to Project Coordinator in a lumber mill in BC Canada.

I receive a quarterly bonus based on the margins and success of our install branch, for which my efforts are responsible for.

We have a profit/loss sheet that shows all profits and deficits for each job, in detail. Our labour costs go against the jobs profit (IE: what we pay our installers per hour)

On our profit loss, my Project Manager and I noticed that the payout to labour was incorrect, and too high. The profit loss states $25/h per worker for a total of $50/h (two guys)

However, our labourers are both only paid $20/h, not $25. On average, this results in about a 10% loss in profits. Given our profit margin goal is 30%, a 10% is actually quite a lot!

My bonus is derived entirely in quarters from this profit.

When we brought the descrepency up with Administration, it was verified this was accidental. Great! Perhaps my bonus will be higher now!

This is where my problem comes in; upon informing Administration, instead of fixing the problem and allocating money where it should be, Administration came up with a reason, on the fly, to put this 10% profit down as ""gas"" used by the vehicle against the job ....

This seems unreasonable to me, and obviously is Administration seeking to save money. From what I understand, fuel for the work vehicles is a write-off...

I suppose a company can do whatever it wants with its profit/loss application... But this seems disrespectful and dirty to me (like even at me as a person given it effects me, and in my position in life heavily so).


Additional info that might be relevant as setting precedence:

I work as a project coordinator at $17/h after 9 years of being with the company. Obviously this speaks volumes about either myself or the company and I try quite hard, even in the face of a particularly, on occassion more often than not, toxic and amateur work place.... Without making too many bias accusations.

Anyway, I'd like to know if this is something they can do or if I am actually being screwed..

I'm fairly ignorant on subjects like this and am simply trying to look out for myself.

Thank you for any input",19Aug2019,3
690,"I’m taking next week off for a much needed vacation in Mexico. However I just got the opportunity to go to Thailand with some family members. Traveling with them is great because they’ll pay for accommodations and food, saving myself a good chunk of money. I also found a ridiculously cheap round trip ticket making it the perfect getaway. 

However the dates land the week AFTER my week vacation in mexico, requiring me to take another week off of work. This is an opportunity that I’m afraid won’t come by again and I want to take advantage but I’m afraid to ask for another week off of work. My boss is very passive aggressive and I’m extremely non confrontational. Should I go? I don’t believe I’ll be fired, but it will be uncomfortable to have the conversation. 

For more info: if I end up going, I would be coming back to work on a Monday- needing to leave again on Thursday for a work conference. Given that this is a work trip I wouldn’t be concerned about it counting against me but wanted to add for context. 

I did also request (months ago) two weeks off in December for the holidays which were already approved. However I only have 3 weeks vacation, if I go to Thailand it would make it 4.

I only planned on doing it for the summer, but during the interview when I told them this they basically told me that I was going to be working during the school year, too. Things have been going fine, Ive been working about 3 5 hour shifts per week up until school has started. When school started, I told them Id only be working Sundays, which they were fine with. The issue arose when they scheduled me for 9 hours in one day (next Sunday). I obviously don't want to work a 9 hour shift, so I asked my manager if I could get it shortened yesterday. Normally, they'd be able to get it fixed really easily and send me on my way, but something apparently was different this time. She said ""It's already scheduled, so it is your problem now and not mine."" I now have to either work the 9 hour shift, get someone to cover part or all of it, or just quit my job. I seriously am curious as to why she couldn't do anything for me, especially since they were able to help me get a shift covered in a days advance, whereas this is 7 days in advance. I really don't have much of a desire to work during the school year, and I'd like to try working retail next summer. My dad thinks I should wait until saturday, see how much homework I have, and if I feel I can't manage working a 9 hour shift then to quit.

693,"Heya Reddit,

Throwaway because my other handle is pretty recognizable.

So I stumbled into a niche career early on. I’m not college educated and honestly have no real marketable skills aside from being a big organized and savvy, but a lot of people are - I’m not special. I’m now in my my 30’s, financially doing well, I support myself and my husband (also doesn’t have a degree but takes care of the house, chores, pets and errands and wouldn’t make much $ at a 9-5)

Anyway, I’m at the point where I hate this job. It’s total customer interfaced, hours on end having to interact, no down time to just zone out for a few mins, always have to smile, fill gaps in conversation and be totally ‘on’ and face to face in meetings for 2-6 hours at a time, sometimes up to 3 a day of meetings are 2 hrs.

Outside of bathroom breaks and short pauses to prepare my next presentation (30 mins), it’s an 8-10 hour daily loop of this grinding emotional labor.

After hours is all about email and marketing, from the moment I wake up to the moment I fall alseep, I’m always keeping up on things, conforming presentations and answering questions for clients I’ve already answered a million times, often emails without a point, just then sending ‘thoughts’ after we’ve already hammered out the details..

My partner is very supportive in all ways but financially and we’ve chosen this route because I can’t do my job without that at home back up.

So everyday I struggle to get though it, I dread it more and more. I know some are thinking I’m horrible because I’m complaining about having a job in the first place but it’s literally sucking me dry. 

I’m responsible for all our finances AND retirement so quitting isn’t an option, I’d make maybe 1/5th at any other job so I’m stuck in this weird trade off with at least 20 years before I can afford for us to retire. 

So my ask: those in similar spots - how do you do it? How do you make yourself want to get up each day?
How do you handle your commitments without giving all of your energy away. Is there a good way to find balance or is that just the trade?",19Aug2019,1

I'd like to see what advice has worked for y'all in the realm of picking your battles.

I struggle a lot with not wanting to be passive aggressive and wanting to stand up for myself, but it seems like I always pick the wrong situation to assert my position on. 
I'm not sure if I just ask the opinions of the wrong people, but it seems like when I assert myself, I always feel like a complete asshole.
But when I don't, I feel like a sniveling coward.

703,"Hi everyone!

For some background, I've been with my boyfriend for a little over a year. In the last couple of months, i've gotten closer to his parents and siblings and I finally feel that they are starting to see me as one of the family. They are kind and smart people, so I kind of can't believe what they've been overlooking when it comes to my boyfriend's brother's girlfriend.

The brother (let's call him James) and his girlfriend (let's call her Sara) have been together a little over 3 years. From what i've seen, she appears to dominate his entire life. Sara picks out what he wears. She tells him what he's allowed to eat and drink and when. She tells him what courses to take and what clubs to join. She screams at him in front of the family and bosses him around. He isn't allowed to drink alcohol (despite being a guy in his 20s with no alcohol issues) and he certainly isn't allowed to go to parties. He has had to give up entire nights of fun to be on call to go pick her up despite her never doing the same for him. On two occasions in the past 2 months, i've actually seen her lash out and hit him in front of his family. She plays it off as ""playful"" but I can tell that there's malice behind it. Also, it's just super gross to hit people, ""joking"" or not.

I think the family is under the incorrect impression that 'girls can't abuse boys,"" but what she is doing definitely seems like emotional (and maybe physical) abuse. The way she speaks to him, treats him, and acts around his family is absolutely disgusting. I can only imagine what's going on in private, as i've walked by his closed bedroom door and heard yelling a time or two. Sara is getting more and more bold in her actions and it really rubs me the wrong way. I can tell that James doesn't like the way he's treated by the way that he reacts to her, but I think that he feels that he can't do any better so he will not stand up for himself or leave. Sara is a pretty girl and James the picture of what people would consider to be a stereotypical ""computer geek."" He doesn't realize that he doesn't deserve to be treated this way.

Reddit, i'm torn. Something messed up is clearly going on, but i've just been accepted into this family. I've never been a part of a big family, so this is a very happy time for me. I don't know that I want to ruin it by starting drama with one of the girlfriends or coming across as a meddler.

705,"there. Here's my situation. I'm a 26 year old who majored in mechanical engineering. But I always wanted to major in literature and psychology.

When I got out of highscgool I didn't know what to major in. My parents encouraged to major in mech. After 2 years I wantd to change to an english major but my parents were against it and I didn't have any support from anyone. I blame myself for not standing up and actually making the decision. After graduating with a masters degree in mech, I got employed in a company. I hate my job. I hate that I come with no energy to read a book or write or even workout. 

I always imagined myself majoring in English or psychology. I loved the idea of being an English professor in some university. But as much as it hurts to say it, it's too late now.

My financial situation is not good. I have to keep the job to pay up my student loan and to give some to my parents because they are sick. However, I feel dead inside every time I go to work because the regret of not majoring in English and pursuing my dream. 

I have no problem going to university to obtain an English degree but I fear that for a 26 year old to do that, his chances to be a professor are slim. I need at least 8 years to have enough experience to apply as a professor. I would be 34. But I can't see myself as an engineer. It sucks out my life.

This caused her to fall out of love and leave me. Now I’m stuck an hour away from my work and friends and everything reminds me of her.

I tell her I have to block her and move on when we leave, and she texts me 3 days later saying she misses hanging out and I’m the easier person for her to talk to. We cry and hug but she still doesn’t want a relationship with me or anyone but she texts me the next morning that she knows there’s a chance we can make it work.

She tells me have fun on your date I have one too. I asked why she wanted to hurt me and she says “you can sleep with other girls but I can’t even hang with guys?”

Well I text her how it went and she said she didn’t go and stayed at her parents. We end the text by saying let’s go no contact for a few weeks and there’s a chance we’ll get back together either then or in the future.

Either way, it doesn't solve their depression (they refuse to believe mental health as valid). I've already traveled in the past with them and it's very stressful.

Toxic behaviors that happens when I say no include: emotional manipulation (I raised you, it's our culture that you don't leave me, no one will help me), strawman arguments, blaming, provoking, yelling, using past mistakes against you, holding things over your head.

And when I do appease them, somehow, they find something to get angry with me and STILL project the same toxic behaviors. So either way *kind of* sucks.

I've been saving up to move out and actively looking for jobs to be able to afford it, so that has been in the process. 

What would you do in the mean time? Would you travel with your parent just to appease them and sacrifice your mental clarity or would you continue to say no to their perception of happiness?",19Aug2019,1

723,"Both my parents are extremely heavy spenders, my mom loves purchasing designer clothing and my dad loves purchasing tech stuff. Despite my parents making a combined income of $320k, they have asked to borrow money from me several times to pay bills (this summer alone they have borrowed $6000 from me) as I have over $20k saved up from working part time, lucrative CS internships, and holiday/birthday money from my extended family.  This money however will not be sitting in my back account as I am using it to pay for college (I decided that I wanted to pay for college, including meals and dorm, by myself). 

They also borrow money from my little sister who earns money from working as a waitress after school. Both my sister and I are the opposite of my parents as we save money while our parents continuously spend it. 

While my parents have never failed to pay me and my sister back (albeit after 2-3 months), I am concerned with their spending habits and am bothered by the fact that they have to rely on their daughters for money while both of us aren't even 20 yet.

I have already sat down and spoken to them about this to them three times to which my dad replies that he'll watch his spending (which he does not) and my mom replies that it's her money and she can do as she wishes.  Both of them still continue to spend money. This has been a reoccurring problem for years and when I was 12 I had to manage my family's finances because of it.

724,"It’s been a long time coming, but this is probably one of the most terrifying things I’ve done in my life. I love him so much, but I know our relationship is beyond unhealthy. He was really emotionally abusive when we first started dating (in high school), and when I finally started sticking up for myself, things got a little better (I know I should have just left then, but I was young and dumb and going through a lot of other things). However, there’s still a lot of other issues, the big ones being: I’ve never caught him actually physically cheating on me, but I’ve caught him, multiple times, getting so close to it that, if he didn’t do it, he probably should have, because I would have been just as hurt (found incriminating messages). I find myself obsessing over going through his phone when he’s sleeping for evidence, even now, and I know that’s a terrible, messed up thing to do on my part.
He also has a pretty bad temper, and whenever I try to even calmly bring up some issue I have, he takes it as a personal attack and gets angry, then tries to apologize with the “I’m sorry but I didn’t mean to” line. Also, when I’ve tried to discuss personal issues with him, like me feeling depressed, he lashes out at me, or just straight up ignores me.

I don’t even know why I’m posting this, I’m just so nervous and heart broken about having to do this. He’s my first and pretty much only relationship, he’s the only friend I have, and doing this means moving back in with my toxic family because I have nowhere else to go. I’m nervous about how he’ll react, worried that I’ll chicken out, worried that I’m doing the wrong thing. 

I would just love any advice on how to go about this, how to stand my ground and not give in to any begging, and any words of encouragement would mean a lot.

I’m about to finally have a talk with my boyfriend about me not being able to Orgasm by just penetration. I am very nervous and scared. We have been together almost 5 years. Don’t get me wrong. He is great in bed but recently he’s been satisfied and i- well i haven’t been able to “get off” with him. I’ve realized it’s partially my fault for not telling him when it was first happening but when he gets off he always apologizes for doing it so quickly. I just need more clitoris stimulation. I always orgasm when he’s “eating down there” (TMI) but he’s tried this new technic of gently biting and —it kills my sensations. HELP!!

Last week I went on vacation to Mexico with my family and yesterday we came back home. I got sunburned on my forehead, nose, cheeks, and shoulders. I woke up this morning and when I looked in the mirror, my entire nose was peeling! I had gotten sunburns like this before and my parents would always tell me not to peel them because it would leave marks but I never listened and would secretly peel little bits when they weren't looking....but this time I peeled the entire thing off. I also noticed that the skin above my eyebrows was beginning to peel and so I picked at it and when I noticed that the skin under was white instead of pink I stopped. 
 So now my nose is pink with tan spots because those spots wouldn't peel and there's a white spot above my left eyebrow

728,"Sorry, this will be a bit long.

I recently rejected a few offers from entertainment companies. However, I have been actively chasing this dream of becoming an artist/ an Idol for three years now (passively, for 6 years). So after heavy conflicts with my parents to get away from home; a year ago I came all the way here, learned the language and attended many auditions. And I got accepted. Many actually showed interest in me, it was easier than I thought. But while I was here I started to realize.. something is wrong. The system here is totally wrong. Nothing is the way it seems. After talking to some friends who already debuted as quite successful artists and people who were working in the industry, I KNEW I was right. The system here is so f\*cked up. I don't wish to end up like them and go back to a place darker than the ones I've been to before. I can't go into detail, but here's the thing.. I quit high school and since I'm 19 now, I can't go back either. I also am not willing to. I looked at colleges concerning arts (meaning drawings, which is sth. I'm semi-good at), but they all require you to graduate first.. well, I already knew, but now I'm just at such a loss.. I feel like a failure, giving up on this.. going home empty-handed. I know that this is not what I want anymore, but I lost a dream that I have been chasing for so long. What should I do about life now? The future? I have been thinking about this for 3 months, with no clear answer.. I know I am definitely interested in all sorts of arts and in becoming an artist, just not HERE anymore. By arts I mean drawing, singing and dancing. However, I'm also aware that the knowledge&amp;skills I acquired during my time here are only beneficial for this specific industry.. which I'm trying to get away from. Meaning, all the strict teachings and techniques taught to me are of no value now.. believe me. I sacrificed good relationships and effort, time and opportunities; only to find out that I don't belong here. My sister told me she is proud of me, but I just feel so empty.

 I feel like Dorie and Marlin in Finding Nemo, both of them abandoned their home, swam to the darkest part of the ocean for the sake of their goal, found a light in the darkness which gave them brief joy.. only to be crushed by disappoinment and fear, after realizing that the light belonged to a life(/fish)-eating beast. Now.. if there is somewhere still left for me to go, where do I go?",19Aug2019,1

I’ve been in contact with an organization but lately our communication has been cut off.  I do have a job!

I’m going to keep forward and sneak out of my house early to go to my dorm. I just can’t believe I’m going to start a life without my family and being homeless.

730," So I was talking to this guy I met online for over 2 years. He is from the west coast and visited me twice on the east coast (he stayed up to a week once) We would do everything and anything. Even after he would leave back home we would talk daily, over text only! 

 I knew for a fact that he was single so that wasn’t it; I will never understand why but I accepted it. One day, like many others, we were texting and he asked me for a picture. He always asked me for pictures and videos and he would reciprocate. I sent him two and I never heard from him again. 4 months later  (after I deleted his contact from my phone) I received a picture from him; the picture was of a doodle and had two hearts. No text or anything (I believe that was a way of him checking if i bollocked his number) I did not reply but I wanted to.. BADLY! 

5 days later,  I went out for drinks and had one too many. Unfortunately, I did reply to his random doodle picture and sent him a smiling emoji. He did not reply to that. I wanted to send him a paragraph, I wanted to ask him why hasn’t he messaged me.. but I didn’t.

733,"Dear redditors,

I'm a 21-year-old student and I live in a shared appartment of three people. While we all get along well, I consider one of them my best friend (and in the city where I study, away from home, he's basically my family). He told me he would move out to move in with his girlfriend two months ago. Of course I was disappointed at first, but it's only 15 minutes away, so I expressed my concerns that I feared we could lose contact, since as roommates we mostly hung out and didn't actively go out often to do stuff (as I said just like siblings), e.g. we never sustained a texting conversation 'cause we would see each other anyway within hours/days. But he reassured me that he feels the same way and that he would try.

After that, everything was fine until the semester ended at the end of July. I was happy for him and we talked about his new flat with his gf and how they would arrange it etc. Now, he will move out in October, but we're on a break from Uni and I'm at home/going abroad and he's also doing stuff. And when the new term starts, he will already be gone. So our last evening as roommates was already 2 months prior to him actually moving and he forgot the meeting. So naturally I was pretty pissed at that since I came back to town one last time before the holidays specifically for that. And then he told me he would text me to maybe come visit me in my hometown before I'm going abroad, which he never did and after I texted him again, it was already too late to make any plans.

To judge his character a bit: he's very uncomplicated, doesn't think a lot about stuff, not organized at all, only texts back every other week (although he's always on his phone) and usually needs to be asked to be involved in plans and never suggests anything himself. On the other hand, there's me: overthinker to the extreme (see the length of the post already?), always keeps in touch with everyone of my friends, always wants to initiate stuff.

So I'm not sure what my question is. I just want to stop overthinking the whole thing. I am definitely not jealous of him (as in having a girlfriend and moving on with his life, I'm totally fine with that and still love the student/roommate/party life I have). I was not even concerned about losing him as a friend until now (I'm getting a new roommate as a replacement, I actually thought of it as a new chance to make even more friends). But I'm just so disappointed in him not caring. I suggested a bunch of things/hobbies we could do to keep in touch on a regulary basis, but never got any response. And the fact that I'm already in the same text-back-any-other-week-cycle in his phone (which of course he mentioned so often as we were still living together that texting back annoys him blabla) just makes me sad.

How long would you guys keep on trying before breaking contact?

I'm really angry and I actually want to be honest and tell him as soon as something bugs me, but I also don't want to be a pussy all the time (although he knows me well enough to get that this is just me caring too much). I have been in similar situation where I overthought many scenarios and always kept my mouth shut so the overthinking never stopped 'cause I never told my feelings.

Would you just tell him how mad I am/was (even though by the time I see him next, **now** will already be 2 months ago)?

Lastly: How can I stop overthinking even though I know that I can't change the situation anyway and I'm not gonna be able to talk about it as well until October?

740,"I believe I signed a contract under duress and was coerced into doing something I didn’t want to do. I had to hide the duress and the truth of the situation to the lawyers while signing the contract out of fear my boyfriend would abandon and dump me. My boyfriend wanted me to do something for him, so this was his idea. I am being vague on what the situation involved for privacy reasons. 

I tried to back out before and in response, he dumped me, so I knew he’d do it again. It was an emotionally abusive relationship, so if it sounds confusing to why I’d stay, that is why it was hard to leave. 

I want to sue him for making me sign the contract under duress and coercion, which would make the contract void. However, he is extremely wealthy and his lawyers will rip me apart. It would bring major psychological stress to me and my world would crumble. Proving someone signed a contract under duress is hard and I will most likely lose with how terrible my luck is. 

The issue is that he is still financially supporting me. He gives me a credit card for $10,000 a month and will be paying for my rent. Due to my mental health issues, I do not work. He is my main source of financial support. If he leaves, I will be living off savings, which is doable, but I’m scared to start new and my future isn’t very bright. If I sue him, he will become an enemy and I don't have many people in my life. I worry I'm biting the hand that feeds me and I'll regret it.

744,"So, I met this girl in the 11th grade and have known her for 9 years now. I always found her interesting and we moved from being very good friends to best friends about the time we were in college. I developed feelings for her around the same time but she was dating someone else then. It was not a healthy relationship, but I always supported her in times of distress. Eventually she broke up and I was always around to help her heal through it. It was reaching the point where I couldn't hold my feelings for her and about 3 years back I confessed to her what I felt. 

She went with the entire narrative of not being in a position to date at that time and not being ready, so I didn't think much of it and just let that pass while still being there for her. About 2 weeks later, entirely out of context she texts me a selfie with a guy and she says that's her new boyfriend and she is excited to introduce me to her. 

The narrative that I was initially fed infuriated me. I was thinking on the lines that she could've just said the truth that she wasn't attracted to me and it was not happening. That would've sufficed. I confronted  her with the same logic and she still wanted me to just stick around regardless. I finally then just told her that this is unhealthy for me and I need to move on, and that I cannot keep in touch with her knowing how I feel, how strongly I do and that all there will be left for me to do all over again would be to be stuck with my emotions around her and never really move on to a healthy relationship with someone else (since it wasn't possible with her). She still didn't understand. I began to feel like a doormat and then it got ugly.

I didn't  speak with her for 3 years and she still tried to get in touch with me every 6 months or so, but I just had a casual conversation each time and never spoke to her myself for the sake of my own good.

I dated someone for a while but was single for the most part of these 3 years.

Now, finally starting January 2019. She broke up with this guy she was dating and had been trying to get in touch with me and convincing me to meet her every now and then. Finally during one such conversations in May, I just tell her, again, that I still have residual feelings and it is not healthy for me to go through this again. 

She calls me the next morning and just says, let's try and see where this goes. I couldn't believe this was happening, but in such euphoria you ignore all the red flags and just go for a ride. That is what I foolishly did. 

The bottomline still remained the same. I was still listening to her bitch about her ex, still doing the same old 'being around for everything' part. But I didn't care about any of that. We were also doing all the other things people who are dating generally do.

The things which stood out were that she didn't want anyone to know we were seeing each other (we have a pool of people in the mutual circle), she was scared to be seen in public with me, and that there was too much mention of her ex in every conversation with constant comparisons between him and I.

She said 'I love you', she started planning for the future because apparently 'We've known each other for so long, the understanding ought to be great' and I was still foolishly going for a ride.

Then one fine day around 2-3 weeks back, she said that she wanted to take it slow and that we have officially never said that we're dating or in a relationship and she still needs time to recover from her ex. She still expects me to be around in the same capacity but has created so much ambiguity, I don't even know where we are right now. I had a conversation with her about it and the biggest red flag that stood was when she said that she didn't really feel that way for me when she said we should try and see where this goes but she only did that because she didn't want to lose me and then eventually 'she developed feelings for me'. 

Now with this taking slow thing with no tags and total ambiguity, I have no clue what is happening and if I am one bit withdrawn because of this confusion, then there is again a controversy and fight over this. She has been constantly cold and whenever I ve mentioned it, it has turned into an episode.

I feel this was a bad idea from the start and I should again cease all communication with her and start my moving on process all over again. The only trouble being that I am too attached right now and it is getting difficult for me. But I still feel this is a necessary pill to take. But I have no clue what really is happening and what I should do.

Any advice?

3 days ago, the friend that stopped playing Xbox got back in touch via IG and we began talking about a possible ‘reunion’ of us 3. The day after we made a group chat (gc) and began talking about going to a theme park. When I asked about when we should go, both replied with ‘Idk’. 

Now ik what you’re thinking, this is fine so far, they just need to sort out a time and day. When I asked the friend that got in touch what his mum had said about the day he can go, he left me on seen. About 3hrs later, I messaged him again with a question mark but he hasn’t read it. However,  I sent to the gc ‘When shall we sort this out’ and they both saw it but had no reply. The second friend normally waits to reply until everyone had said something but the other friend just said nothing. 

Today, I asked the awol friend if the trip was still on. Nothing. I asked the other friend if he knew when he could go. I also mentioned the fact the trip seems to be not happening because of the lack of communication. He actually replied but with an ‘ok’. I realised this was to the other message and then said ‘you didnt answer the q 😂’. He then said ‘idk’. I didn’t want to seem rude so I just said that I was sorry if I seemed rude and he said it was fine. I then asked him about the awol friend and if he’s heard from him recently. He said no.

766,"I have been at my job for 18 months. I developed my role and with my previous boss built it up into a senior role. I am the title-less manager of a team. When my old boss was around, I was fine with this arrangement and he and I spoke frequently about career trainings I should do and where I should go until the end of April when he had to leave our company for personal reasons.  For the whole month of May (even when I was supposed to have PTO and worked anyways) I was Acting Director. When my old boss left, I was promised the sun and stars by former boss' boss Jennifer, probably so I would not jump ship during the transitional time. 

New boss Diana was hired and I was very honest with her about my frustration with how everything had gone down. As I helped Diana transition into the role and manage our team/deliverables, Diana told me that her first action as Director was to promote me. There are 9 other people on my team who I manage who have a different job title than me. She has had me functioning as a senior manager of my team, but I am not being compensated financially or with the correct title to have these functions. She even had me sit in on reprimanding a colleague where we had to pull someone back into training and even had me do a separate audit of a different colleague to see how he was meeting his performance improvement goals (he was not performing and was actually let go).

Over the last 2.5 months, Diana has been telling me that the only delay in promoting me is her getting a minute with J. I have been patient but also have started thinking of finding something new, as I can't pay my bills with empty promises. I am also getting married in October 2020 so the time-frame for me to find a new job and not have to deal with the mutual stresses of finding a new job, starting a new job, going without a paycheck while payroll kicks in, and planning/paying for a wedding is quickly shrinking. My coworker was just promoted to a different department, and I am just feeling very discouraged. I asked Diana for a timeline on my promised promotion, and she said HOPEFULLY by Thanksgiving (3.5 months away) but more likely before the end of the year (4.5 months away)

Last Wednesday, I was working on a deliverable for Jennifer and she shut me in her office and would not let me leave for 4.5 hours while I worked on it. She would not let me go get water (she got it for me) and had me borrow a laptop charger from her neighbor even so I could not return to my desk. Jennifer joked with Diana about how someone did this to her when she was coming up professionally and it taught her so much, and how she could tell once I was getting stressed but kept my cool.Jennifer was proud of this demeaning experience for me where I was treated not like a professional, but like a child. The next day, I had to return to her office for 2.5 hours and then Diana told me to leave for the day since she knew this was a rough experience for me.

Diana is still pulling me into all these emails, calls, and meetings to answer as manager of my team, but I am not the manager. I have not been promoted and frankly am questioning what is the purpose of me jumping on top of things when it is not within my current JD. I am treated differently and was even questioned when I said I had to work from home even though all of my other coworkers do it since I have to set an example. Diana has it on her brain that I am going to look for new jobs too I think. She told me last week that I looked so nice that had I been wearing more makeup, she'd think I was going to a job interview. Even today I told her I had a sensitive question (I approve my coworkers' hours in the system, another function not in my role) and she assumed I was going to quit. No, I was going to ask if someone's overtime hours were approved by her in advance. 

Honestly, I am burnt out and upset. I have started talking to recruiters and do not think this role is salvageable for me anymore. In the interim, can I stop working as hard as I have been considering I will never be compensated?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I am being mistreated in my work environment and performing functions that are more than my job description, but not being compensated. Promised promotion does not seem like it is happening. Should I stop working as hard as I look for new jobs?",19Aug2019,3

769,"I’m a senior in high school, this year I decided to take an AP literature class and I’m immediately regretting my decision. The problem is not with difficulty or content, I can handle those things as I’ve taken AP and honors english classes throughout high school. There was a 300 page book we were assigned at the beginning of summer “apparently” that I somehow never got informed about. I have other friends in the same class and this never came up in conversation with us, we didn’t even talk about school because it’s summer and who the fuck wants to talk about that. Somehow the fucking e-mail they sent out to other AP literature students never got sent to me, and I never found out about the assignment. One that is worth about 10% of the semester grade. 

Long story made short: I found out about the assignment after I got sent an e-mail about it the night before school, and I didn’t even own the book. So I said, fuck it, I’m not going to waste 20 hours reading the book, annotating every single godamn page, and writing a 1500 word essay about it. All for what? Half credit. Oh hell no I’m good. Now I’m sitting here, a week in, with a 30% in the class and in a deep hole. The teacher is an unhelpful bitch, and I only have a week left to switch courses. 

The main problem is that my parents are so against me not taking this class, and moving down a level. They think it will hurt my chances of getting into a writing school if I take 1 regular level English class. It won’t, I got a 5 on the AP Language national exam, and have enough credits that I can fill out the college writing requirements 3x over. Should i just go behind their backs and do it? I can’t get myself out of this hole at this point. It would actually hurt me far more to stick with this class as it would ruin my 3.77 GPA. Helllp.",19Aug2019,1

777,"If you don’t know what this is about, look into my profile. I would just link the post, but honestly there’s quite a bunch at this point.


So, my Akita is still missing. My mom sold her and wanted a smaller, cuter puppy, and she bought one and is refusing to tell me where my old dog is. So, I’ve been looking for her everywhere. So far, I’ve tried to extract info from everyone around me, contacted most vets in my country (with more on the list to call), filed my dog as missing with her chip number and some details, and I’ve still got more to do. 


Of course, I still have this new puppy to take care of, almost exclusively by myself. Just like I did with my old dog, since my family had nothing to do with raising it. Though, they do want to play with this cute lil pup sometimes, something they never did with our old dog.

Anyways, now that I know how absolutely repulsive family &amp; moms behavior is towards our animals, I decided to take things into my own hands in a couple of ways. One of them was to finally neuter and register our three year old cat, and take my dog to the vet to have him registered to my name. I went on r/AmITheAsshole to see if I would be wrong in doing this behind their backs, and reddit said I wouldn’t be, so I went through with it. It did not go smoothly at all.

Sparing the details, since it’s 12am and I’m tired as hell after today, my mom hit me, once, and tried to pull my cat off me because she saw me  going to put him into the car. The dog was already in the car at this point. She yelled at me and told my maid to take the cat away. My maid, being on my side but not wanting trouble from mom, took the cat (without the crate) and went inside. I followed, and my mom followed me. She was continually yelling at me while I was looking for my cat, and threatened to hit me for disobeying her. I looked at her and said I’ll call the police if she gets physical on me, because I will absolutely not accept physical abuse of any form from her. So that was when she said “Go ahead and call the police!” and did a small hit on my shoulder. I told her to quit being a child, and kept looking for the cat. My mom was trying to pull the crate from my hands, but I simply held her hand and pulled it away one by one each time. I ended up finding the cat and putting it in a box. Though, because of how she was tailing me, I couldn’t close the crate door and so I had to hold it vertically like a basket and not allowing the cat to jump out. Once I had the cat like this, my mom blocked the doorway outside. I put my back against her and slid past her, barely fitting and she didn’t out up much resistance. I began walking to the car, so then she called me mentally insane and didn’t follow me. I was able to leave.

The cat is gettung neutered now, still at the vet (decided to leave him there)and the dog was registered but not neutered since he’s too young (which I expected).  So that’s how it went. Came back home, mom wouldn’t look at me, as usual.


So, during all that yelling while I was trying to find my cat,  she said a lot of things that were extremely worrying. How she’d do to my cat and dog like she did to my old Akita, how she’d resell the new puppy. For about two hours now, I’ve been looking for dog/cat collars online that have GPS tracking and won’t unlock unless accessed by me, so that I would have my pets locations at all times and my mom wouldn’t be able to remove them. If she sold them, locating them would be easy this way. I wanna know how I can do that, if any of you can tell me...and uhm, I guess this really is an abusive family. 


Honestly, the story is pretty warped up there. A lot of details were spared because I am seriously not bothered to type them at the moment, I apologize. Though, it gets accross the main events and how my mom acted, which is all that really matters. I know that I didn’t ask for any specific advice, but honestly please fill me in with any info that might help me. Any sort of wisdom, or perhaps a method to not allow my mother to steal away my cat and new dog.

At first, the old theater manager and his buddy were talking to investors about opening up a new cinema, but that never went through. Now I'm 17 years old and a senior in high school, and I have been researching and writing down ideas for getting a cinema together in basically that whole interval.

783,"Hi male (18yrs) here, but recently I’ve been delving into discovering more about my sexuality and so I met this guy off of social media who lives in a different state than me. He’s 18yrs old too and he’s also trying to discover more about it his sexuality. He thinks he might be bi. We’re both guys who have been straight all our lives but think there might be more there. It honestly started off as nothing more than just exchanging nudes, but it’s grown to more than that. We talk a lot over Snapchat about our lives and talk about deep stuff going on. But last night he just let me know that he’s hanging out with this girl tomorrow that he’s liked for a while and if things work out and they begin talking he said he has to cut me off and stop snap chatting me. The thing is he tells me that he’s really into me and even though he tries to not like what we have, he really likes it. I don’t really know what to do here and I’m realizing that I’m actually developing feelings for this guy. Also no one knows that either of us might be bisexual so it’s all just a big secret. But I feel like it’s not fair to the girl he might start talking to or me that he is doing this.

787,"Don’t really know what to do. Maybe I’m just reacting poorly but I’d be lying if I said his words didn’t affect me.  To give a brief timeline of events:

- I started this job a couple months ago
- I’ve gained 20-25 pounds since then which I realize is a lot
- Boss keeps making fun of me

My previous job had pretty shit pay and my current one pays a lot more per year than my old one. Naturally I was pretty happy and with this extra money, I ate out more often. Took my family out more often. Pounds kind of just piled on before I realized, dang this is a problem. I’m not obese, at least not yet but I’m chubby. Before I would say I was an average weight but now you can definitely see the weight gain, especially the face. 

I know I need to lose weight so I started going to the gym more, changed my diet a bit and I’m definitely seeing results. Lost roughly 5 pounds over the last 2 weeks but I’ve got a long way to go. 

My boss has noticed this weight gain and every couple days will make a fat joke. For example today when he passed by my desk, he said “surprised you still fit in that chair” and starts laughing. My coworkers have been pretty chill, don’t really laugh along or just tell me afterwards to ignore him which I know I should. My coworkers tell me it’s pretty normal in his culture to bring up peoples weight as a way to encourage them to lose weight but honestly it’s pretty embarrassing. 

I haven’t talked to him yet cause I don’t know how he’ll react and I don’t really want to turn this into a big deal. He’s the CEO so I don’t know if going to HR would do anything.

Currently my plan is to just keep doing my thing, lose the weight and hopefully he leaves me alone.",19Aug2019,1

Problem is, I let all those emotions out, but they mostly ended up being negative, angry feelings. I feel I now callously speak my mind to almost everyone. I've hurt strangers and close friends.

I hate being this way. I feel that I'm driving everyone away from me and I'll end up alone if I can't fix myself. It's been a few years and I'm searching for advice or books on how to balance myself.

I really love her.

So, today she visited her parents house, she didnt visit them for months. Then when she came back, she was all sparkling and romantic, she came to me, sat next me and kissed me on the cheek and then said ''i missed you''. So, she likes me right? because she missed me and kissed me?

She (And actually me) had to marry each other because of our parents, then (after conflicts with them) we ended up getting ignored and disowned by them and we had to become independent, we live alone and i work now. She told me months ago clearly that she doesnt like me, after that she didnt talk about her feelings towards me.

But now that she kissed me and missed me, she likes me right? :)

797,"Missouri's foster care system needs fixing. To help you understand why I say this, I'll tell you my story...

So my late father would repeatedly beat on my mom. He would beat on me too. When my mom finally got the courage to leave him, this angered him so much. He went psychotic. He told her that if she didn't stay around so that he could beat on her, he would use his influence in government to get me and my little brother taken away from her.

He eventually did. 

What happened was, he had a case worker come in my mom's house to investigate her and her treatment of me. They found no signs of abuse whatsoever. So then they changed the story from physical to sexual because sexual has no apparent signs like bruises. They inspected her whole house and eventually found our food supply. We had almost all the food a family of 3 could eat, with the exception of us being low on meat. The case worker grossly exaggerated this to say that she was ""starving me"". We were literally getting money for groceries in a few days. They also argued that I must be starving because I was skinny. Yet that was because I was an active child. A police officer came to remove me with no struggle. Yet in the officer's report he said I assaulted him. I never did and my mom and grandfather (Gerald Gilpin) can attest to that. First they said I kicked him in the balls and sprayed him with bug spray. There was no bug spray and I was too short to kick an adult there. So then they changed the claim to ""punched"". 

Past that, I was checked into a mental hospital. There I was forced to get up at 1am every single day and go across the halls to another side to a ""school"". They also had staff there who would laugh at and tease me. 

Then I went to a facility called ""Child Center of Our Lady"" on Natural Bridge road in the St. Louis area. They allowed my mom short visits, but eventually completely terminated her rights. There they also made a false claim that I had an imaginary illness just because I was a little ""too"" active. Whatever that means. 

After that I went to a foster home in Russellville, Missouri. There I was treated like a second class human being, not allowed to have friends over or be at a friend's house. School was my only escape. Even there, some of the teachers laughed at me behind my back (I overheard a lot). I stayed at that home for 4 years and was constantly shamed for saying stuff that they thought didn't make sense and bullied by the older kids in the home.

Next I reached Champagne, Illinois. I was almost adopted but for some reason or another they decided that they didn't want me. So they turned me back to the system where I was put in a psychiatric hospital.

While in there, I stayed kind of quiet and tried not to attract much attention. Of course, I was only there for a month. I'm not sure where it was.

I was then moved to a foster home of a Jehovah's witness who was also a widow. There I tried to get along with her but she was always angry and calling me names. One time she even left me at Wal-Mart while she drove several miles away. This was in Jefferson city and her name was Harriet Neiner. 

After that, I was kicked out to move to Marshall Missouri to a facility called Butterfeild. There I had all nice things from my past that I had received stolen. 

Then they moved me back to the same psychiatric hospital as last time and I stayed there for a month. I was bullied there ruthlessly to the point where they had to seperate me to the little kid's dorm. 

And like clockwork, I was removed and put in a facility known as Valley Springs Youth Ranch in Black Missouri. There I spent two years bullied and ridiculed and beat up and wrote up for nothing by the staff.

After that I was moved to a facility in Raytown which was an ISL (adult facility). Eventually I was moved back to VSYR for three weeks until they could find me a place to stay. 

They found me a place in Hannibal Missouri that was a behavioural ISL called Williams II. I spent my full time in there being bullied and ridiculed. 

From there I moved to a facility in Jefferson city called Cyma Care. In there, I got a Facebook and my aunt and mom and cousin located me. Then a client there beat me with a folding chair and pressed charges because I defended myself. I ended up having to leave there. 

Now I'm in Ferguson Missouri taken far away from my poor mom. They continue to treat me like a child here, and I still have a guardian.

As for my guardian, he said openly that he'd rather see me in jail or in an asylum than on my own no matter what. He is currently being investigated because he is suspected of stealing money from me and many other clients. 

Hear my story, and let it be known: nobody deserves this life. Cut off the foster care system. Refuse to be employed by the state until things get fixed. We don't need this happening to others.",19Aug2019,3
798,"My son has started school at Kindergarten and on thursday of last week, he told us he went to speech class that had marble drop and the teacher told him ""black people are gross"" and ""black people are dirty""!!

He said he would look into it but this is clearly not the case.

800,"Hello,   
I´m feeling quite split in two regarding my attitude towards my career and work. I´m 32 with a wife and a kid.   


Supershort background: I have worked with a couple of things but always been studying (it´s ""free"" where I live) so no debts. Academic background: Psychology major (yep useless) and a trade school education in ""digital business"" basically dip your toes in everything hipster like ""ux-design, project management, facilitation, ""growth hacker"" etc.   
Worked part as a digital strategist at a ""creative digital agency"". Pretty much a bullshitter doing a little bit of everything. Pay was bad, working hours slightly above average, it all made me cynical.   
Was involved in a project building fibre glass sculptures for half a year. When that ran out I was unemployed for almost 6-7 months, Had interviews, two or three offers (very bad pay), 10000 rejections and absolutely no self esteem left. I learned i´m not exactly hot stuff employability-wise, only way I managed to get through was that i´m good at talking, appear to know things and appear to be a decent worker.  


Since I´m a psychology major I managed to then get a state job as a career coach for people with neuropsychiatric diagnosis. I basically try to help people with different experiences and/or diagnosis how to get into the working world/society. My jobs involves a lot of down time. Part individual coaching sessions, smaller part basically baby sitting during different activities, part leading activities, part is doing a bunch of different things, running instagram, being involved in communication projects via film etc.  
Pay was a lot better (i´d say average, not great. But a big step over the offers I was getting), working hours average. Took it to rebuild my finances (during this time my wife got pregnant and we had our lovely daughter).   


It´s been about two years now and like most jobs it has *some pros and cons.*   
**Pros:** Pay is at least average, somewhat free to schedule my days, short commute, a lot of down time where I´m allowed to read or when I can study/do some things I enjoy learning. 

  
**Cons:** It´s not ""secure"", not so much growth, bad management (ha), slow organisation, pretty negative vibes from co-workers.   


***Another con:*** I feel a lot of shame for my work and myself. To the point that I avoid old acquaintances from school etc because I want to avoid talking about it.  Both personally, like i´m not doing what I supposed to be doing and I feel anxious when i´m ""wasting"" time at work.   
Also ideologically, this is state funded, so basically tax funded, meaning my pay comes not from producing value, it comes from taxes and if people knew how bad it´s run and how little people are working it would be a scandal. So that bothers me as well. Which I suppose I could rationalize with that I´m just taking back what I´ve been taxing my whole life and everything becomes complicated and stupid. (Where I´m from taxes are very high).  
It´s been almost two years now and I feel increasingly overwhelmed and stressed. On the one hand I feel like I should try to move on.   
On the other, I don´t know where I should go. Since my employability is so low it could be really hard for me to get a job that pays like this. On top of that, I can´t think of another job that I would like so much for it to be worth to sacrifice the pros of this job, especially the down time aspect of it as well as it being at least somewhat ""free"". It feels as the alternative is to learn a trade, slave away for some company for a couple of years and then becoming more senior and just continuing slaving away. My interests aren´t exactly pulling me into to a ""marketable skill"". I tried to get into UX-design but just couldn´t force myself to learn it.   


I´m confused and I don´t know what´s exactly what´s wrong with me. I´ve made a lot of mistakes but also some reasonable choices. finishing high school, Neglecting my interests for being to irrational for a career choice, bachelors degree and another education.  
Working night shifts to be able to by my own apartment, never been a burden on anyone financially, especially not my parents - this is one of the few things besides my lovely family that I take great pride in.  


My current plan:   
Still working and saving money.   
Taking therapy once a week.   
Pursuing my projects and interests on the side.  
Sort of trying a variation of George Costanzas ""the opposite"". Where I will no longer try to be rational and think ""well, UX design is a booming field"". I´m currently only two things, keeping my family a float and pursuing my interests. That´s it, trying being all rational about my choices sure didn´t work for me.   


Any advice? Sorry for the wall of text.",19Aug2019,1
801,"I (21M) have been dating this girl for a little over 4 years, we will call her S . Back in May we had a talk about going on break because she was going back to school and will be working 3 jobs and is starting a chapter and will also be leaving next summer for Australia for 4 months. We go to different schools and i will also be working so we would barely, if at all, see each other until she goes to Australia. We ended up dropping the subject and decided not to go on break.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago, we brought up the subject again. This time we came up with pros and cons of the break and figured there were more pros then cons and decided to go on a break. 

I am a camp counselor and I rarely go out to bars or anything of the sorts but after just getting out of a 4 year relationship, my co-counselor who is also my neighbor and best friend since birth says I should go out with him and the other counselors from my camp to help get over it. He also told me that one of the girls, we will call her N , was interested in me. I decided it couldn't hurt and went out. For the passed two weeks we would go out and i would spend time with N and have an amazing time. I am usually a huge introvert but with her it was easy to break out of that shell. 

After that week i started to feel guilty about going around with her when i still held huge feelings for S and i felt like i was leading N on, which i had a talk with her about and she was completely understanding which just made me feel even worse about myself, if that makes sense. I decided to have another talk with S and she said that she would want to end the break and see how things go. However, when i was with her i couldn't shake away the feelings I had for N.

Now I am stuck in a situation where I have feelings for both people but I don't want to hurt either of them. To me I feel like I am just a complete asshole and am being selfish but that's beside the point. I need advice on how I should make this decision, or even who I should choose.",19Aug2019,1

806,"So I recently moved into college for the upcoming semester and met a really nice, funny, sweet guy. We get along amazingly and are bringing out the best in each other (I’m making him more extroverted, he helps me with my anxiety, etc). He’s planned to take me on a date later this week to make our situation official. We even live in the same dorm which makes it easy to see each other often. The problem is that his ex also lives in the dorm and she’s a little... odd. They had been in a 5 year relationship in which she was very controlling, abusive, and derogatory and he wasn’t happy at all, but when they broke up she refused to let him go. When she found out he and I were talking and interested in each other, she confronted him and referred to the situation as her “having competition”. I was willing to talk to her, try to be friendly, and he and I were hoping she’d get the idea that he’s moved on. Well, today we tried that: I met her and we talked, but our conversation was obviously forced and we “laughed” at each other’s jokes. We hung out with my (soon to be) boyfriend and some of his friends and this girl had the audacity to try to put herself closer to him than I was. She’d try to lean on his shoulder, show him things on her phone, even made a few attempts to grab his hands - he kept telling her to stop and he seemed pretty damn uncomfortable. I smiled through it and even made small talk with her, but I’ve officially realized that either she goes on her own or I force her out. Thankfully, I know her attempts to get back with him aren’t working because he’s made it very clear to me that he really doesn’t like her and won’t let her emotionally manipulate him back into a relationship (which she’d done before). He doesn’t want us to argue in fear she’ll really go off the rails and do something dangerous to me or herself, so how do I get her to back off without it becoming a full on fight to keep her out of the relationship?

Extra details to add: He told me that there is no competition, but any girl knows that an ex that sticks around is going to create a struggle. Hell I was polite to her the entire time, but we were practically having a silent argument over who got to be closer to Him. I had to physically make it difficult for her to get closer to him without it being obvious I was blocking her off, but everyone noticed we were doing that to each other. There was even an unspoken standoff to see who would leave first, and when she did, my STB boyfriend literally did a countdown from ten to make sure she actually left and wasn’t hovering outside the door. His friends let out a sigh of relief that she’d finally left and he hugged me like a teddy bear. They don’t want her around either, so the sooner she can gtfo the better.",19Aug2019,0

810,"I am a college sophomore and am finding myself being attached to my parents now more than ever. When I first started colleg in a different state, I was so excited to be on my own and didn't call my parents much, only for pressing matters.

However, I just moved back for my second year in college and after spending the whole summer with them, I find myself missing them like crazy! I feel the need to call them after every little thing happens and whenever I have questions. I also get really sad whenever I think about them. They both work, so I'd really like to stop feeling like this because they're living their own busy lives.

I have never felt this way before and am very confused.

In both 2015 and 2016, I kept having these situations and right now im expirencing it again. I have been nonstop stressed.

813,"I apologize if this is gonna sound whiny, or long-winded or whatever, I dunno, I'm still in shock.

I'm from Ontario, Canada, and I've fallen into an OHIP gap that is destroying me.

I've been having these migraines since I was a teenager and they've only been getting worse and more frequent every year, until about 3 years ago, when they became a daily occurrence and resulted in trips to the ER for IV pain relief. I got sent to specialist after specialist, and none of them could figure out what the issue was, until I switched dentists, went in to get a new nightly bite guard made (because I clench my jaw in my sleep), and he realized while taking the molds that my jaw bone was not in its socket on one side of my mouth. He sent me to a TMJ specialist, and, lo-and-behold, my jaw joint got fucked up during orthodontic work I had when I was 14, and the migraines have been caused by the bone rubbing against my joint every time I talk or chew. The specialist informed me that I would need jaw surgery.

My contract for work expired around this point, so I lost my job and, with it, my extended health coverage. I went to an oral surgeon, whose consultation I had to pay out of my savings, and he gave me a consult and an estimate - $4800. None of that covered by the Ontario government, because it's considered a ""voluntary"" surgery. And then I found out that after the surgery, I'll need a minimum of $3400 dollars of further surgical work done (also not covered by OHIP) in order to fix some of the underlying issues. That was the BASE PRICE. He estimated close to another thousand of post-op work on top, so roughly $9,200 by the end of this.

So my first thought is ""holy shit, I need to get a new job ASAP and get some kind of coverage, ANY KIND OF COVERAGE back"" but, here's the kicker - between all of the minor surgeries and finally the big one, I would need to get a full time job for coverage and then immediately take close to two months off in order to get all of my surgery done. Like, I could not screw over my employer like that. How terrible would that make me look as an employee? My dad had offered to help cover the cost of the surgery until I can pay him back, but that was when we thought it was just the $4800. I only found out about the additional $4400 an hour and a half ago, and I know he can't afford to help me out on that amount, he was struggling with the first $4800.

I don't know what to do. I'm in excruciating pain daily, to the point where I can barely function, but I can't afford the surgery to get me out of the pain. And even if I choose to wait for the surgery until I get another job (where, again, I would be kinda screwing over my employer), there's no guarantee that they would cover the work (I checked, and my last job, in the same industry, would have covered less than a grand). 

I'm kinda stuck and hoping for suggestions. This is probably out of reddit's pay bracket though, but I'd appreciate any input at all.",19Aug2019,1

815,"I’ve travelled back home from a week away with my girlfriend visiting her family who live 5 hours away because my family dog is going to be euthanised on Wednesday.

My parents, who were emotionally abusive to me throughout my childhood, lured me back and said it was for the best. I knew I would feel guilty if I wasn’t there when my dog was put to sleep. As soon as I get back they started poisoning me against my girlfriend because she has not been very sympathetic to my dog dying (she’s not a dog person) despite living with us for three years.

I am living with my parents after graduating and haven’t been able to get a job yet. My girlfriend also lives with us. She returns next Tuesday but they are going to make life hell for us.

I am supposed to start teacher training in 3 weeks but I will have to live at home for another year and deal with this shit. I can’t do it anymore but I keep getting rejected from other jobs (10 rejections so far). I can’t move out whilst I’m doing teacher training because it’s unsalaried (it’s a graduate degree).

They are poisoning my mind. They are saying my girlfriend is poisoning my mind. I don’t know who to believe anymore. I don’t do anything for myself anymore. I exist to serve others basically.

I don’t want to do teacher training anymore. I can’t see myself enjoying it and I can’t live here any longer but I have no way out. My girlfriend has a job here and has moved away from home.

I have a casual job at the moment (10 hours min. a week). I could keep this for a while longer to keep me going. I could certainly get a job with my current company elsewhere but there’s no progression as it’s a weird/niche field.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to stay here.

They are telling me to break up with my girlfriend because she’s a bitch. They’re just getting angry at her because there’s no one to get angry at over my dog’s death (they treat him like their child).

I just want to grieve and spend the last few days with my dog but they keep going on about her. I have too much on my mind.

They’re drinking excessive alcohol right now and getting more and more twisted. 10pm at night. I have nowhere to go but £500 to my name. I could get a hotel but then what? I can’t pay for a room every night.

Sorry this is incoherent. I have no plan. Nothing. I can’t deal with this torment anymore but I’m too much of a pussy to kill myself.",19Aug2019,1
816,"Ok so this might be a bit long, but I will really appreciate any advice here!

First some general information:
I am 18 years old and I recently started at my first job. It’s a part-time job working in a fast food kitchen place. I started about one month ago, and I have worked around 10 times now. 

Up until my last shift I’ve always had someone experienced there helping me - but at the last shift I was alone for the first time. When working here you handle customers, the phone, the food, cleaning up, restocking etc., all by yourself. 

When working alone, at times with many customers, I really struggled with keeping track of everything and everyone’s orders. This was extremely stressing and I really misliked the work then. At times with lesser customers it’s definitely manageable, but this was also in the middle of the week, and the weekend is always busier. 

Currently I’m not seeing myself capable of handling weekends alone because I am not so organised and good at handling stress as I previously thought I was.

I am very conflicted about what I should do here, I feel like I have two options, but none feel right...

Option 1: Quit. If I quit I will be done with the work and I won’t have to do it anymore. This means no more high stress and frustration.  But quitting would be hard as I’m just about done with my training period and I would feel very bad towards the owner - who has spent money on having me trained. I except that I’m now needed there to. Quitting would cause others to have to work more while the owner looks for a new employee.

This would also mean that I would be without a job. But currently I am not in extreme need of money as I have little expenses - so taking some time to find a new job would not ruin me.

Option 2: Continue working. If I continue working there I might get more control over the work and be able to manage the periods with many customers. 
I don’t know how long I see myself at this job, especially not at the moment as I struggle when there’s a lot going on.

Continuing the job could give me more control, but I also feel like that would anchor me more to the position - thus making it even harder to quit in the future.


So what would you do in this position? Quit and get out while you’re new or continue and see if it gets better with time?

All advice is greatly appreciated!",19Aug2019,1

819,"I went out of Friday night with some friends. I don’t drink much anymore so my alcohol tolerance is kind of low but essentially I got wayyyy too drunk. I was at a bar with friends and somehow I ended up being outside the bar and the bouncers wouldn’t let me back in. Probably because I was too drunk. 

I then remember having to pee and trying to call my friends who were inside the bar but I locked myself out of my phone I’m assuming cause I put in the wrong passcode. I must have gotten in some guys car because the next thing I remember is being in a passenger seat and telling him I really have to pee. I vaguely remember him stopping so I can pee on the side of the road and getting back in and apologizing profusely to him. Don’t remember what happened after but I remember looking over while he was driving and he was touching himself. Then I remember he stopped the car and him putting my head down to suck his penis and i think maybe I did a little because I felt bad but then told him I can’t do it and then I remember him trying to get on top of me but I told him no please and closed my legs and he stopped. I remember him saying he will take me home but I also remember him putting his fingers in my vagina while he was driving. I got home and my roommate saw me. They said they saw me get in a car once they were coming outside and assumed I got an Uber home. I checked my Uber and lyft history the next day  and I had no order history. I was missing 40 bucks ( I had 60 dollars in my wallet) so maybe I offered some guy 40 bucks to drive me home? 

It’s just such a weird situation because I remember bits and pieces and I keep trying to figure out what happened. My roommate said it was about 30 minutes in between when they saw me get in the car and get home. My place is about 20 minutes from the bar without traffic. I didn’t tell anyone that I think I was sexually assaulted by the person who drove me home because maybe I instigated it without remembering and I’m too embarrassed. Not sure how to stop trying to rack my brain over what happened and how to stop feeling bad about it. I took plan B in case something worse happened that I remember and I’m going to get tested for stds in a month. I guess I can use this as a lesson that my alcohol tolerance is not what it used to be anymore and to not binge drink. I just need advice on how to stop thinking about it?

821,"I moved out and into the apt I'm currently in when I was 18 and my boyfriend was 17, we are now 21 and 20.

She constantly tries to get us to pay in cash and when we give her a check she acts mad, she even tried to say I didn't pay her a few times when my check was written and went through on my bank statements. She has walked into our apt without notice, we confronted her about it and called the actual owner of the apt that runs multiple places and lives far away. She then tried to do it again and kept threatening to kick us out for unknown reasons. Everytime we even mention a lawyer she steps down, which like, come on just stop acting crazy. She constantly stalks us, asks me why she never sees me around (I'm busy it isn't any of your business what I do) and will continue to say rude shit to us. I explained that I felt uncomfortable with her coming in without permission or notice and asked if we could change locks and her response was ""do you really think I could be threatening to you?"" Then tried to back track saying she never came in without a notice and when I told her she already had to apologize and talk to her boss about it she said ""well I thought we worked it out like adults."" What the fuck is happening? In our apt complex we have cards to fill money on for laundry. Problem is we need her to do it. She will often harrass us and try to ask us personal questions and even make comments about when the last time we did our laundry. Yeah bitch I do it at laundry matts or friend's places now because you are a creep and bully. I have confronted her many times and tried to work things out even asking if we did anything wrong but she never tries to make nice conversation. I assume we never have simply by the fact that she tried to kick us out only a week into being moved in because my boyfriend wasn't on the lease with me. I looked at the rules and the only person that needs to be on the lease is someone over 18 that is making payments. I even called the person in charge and he said it didn't matter at all as long as 1 person was on the lease. I have also called and complained to the owner that she will harrass us, stalk us, etc and he said she never had complains before and apologized for the 1 time we threatened with lawyers. We talked to our new neighbor that is a young woman and she said she already had her harrass her a few times about her baby being noisy during the day, which we never even heard. We talked to all the older people and she seems to be nice to them so I'm assuming she hates younger people here. I went online to look at reviews and every single negative review is because of her doing illegal shit or harrassing people. I love the apts and they are the best for the price we can afford at the moment. I hate confrontation and I hate having to see and face a bully all the time. I know we can get her in trouble with the illegal shit but I don't want her to I just want her to be fucking nice for one day. What can I do to actually fix her being a bitch to us?

828,"Hello all,

Since the oil price drop in 2014 that affected a lot of people in the Canadian oil sands industry, my father hasnt been able to find a stable job and my mother is unfit to work due to complications from chemotherapy that has left her unable to do a lot of simple things for more than 5 minutes at a time. 
Because I knew how crappy out financial situation was, I decided to hold off on uni to get a full time job to 1) help support my family and make life a little less stressful for my parents and 2) so I could earn some money for university. The job I got isnt a bad paying one but it's something I wasnt planning on doing for more than a year tops. 
Nearing last July, I was ecstatic to go to university and hopefully fulfill my dream of being a doctor in 8 or so years. I had full acceptance, residence payed for, classes set up, and everything I could do to prepare myself as best I could to go and start uni. 
Then my dad dropped a bombshell on me and needed 18k asap as we could lose our house if it wasnt payed. I reluctantly agreed to pay the money, thus emptying my account. Still thought I'd be ok with student loans and everything until it got to a point where my parents sat me down and told me they would have to move and sell our truck because they couldnt afford it. 
Again, I reluctantly said that I would work another year at my same job so everything would be ok money wise. Now I'm paying a good amount of money for bills that I may be in debt in a years time.
My friends told me to stop giving them money and move away, which would make me feel shitty and put my family on their ass again.

I don't want a memory of that person in a casket. I've seen this question asked before and the consensus was that you are the asshole if you don't go because funerals are for the living and you should go to show respect to those grieving. But I'm the one grieving and I think I have the right to mourn in my own way. I was closer to that person than 90% of the people that are gonna be at the funeral. I know that he would understand. One of the comments on one of these questions was

&gt;YTA for focusing on how YOU feel instead of thinking about the people who have experienced a great loss. Funerals are not about you, it’s for the people who are grieving. Seeing people pay their respects to someone you love is a great comfort.

That was obviously a different scenario, but in my case why shouldn't I focus on how I feel? This has been very hard for me and I'm just trying to keep my pain at a minimum. Funerals are for the living I don't think it's disrespectful to the person gone. And it's not disrespectful to the immediate family because I am that immediate family. if funerals are for the people grieving then I think it's disrespectful to force or shame someone into going to their siblings funeral.

They started saying I'm rude and all and stupid shit like that so I closed the door. Then I saw the younger fella climb my wall and I told him to go away.

835,"So I recently got a new job and on my first day this guy a couple years older than me was showing me around and how to do everything. Let’s say his name is Eric. He seemed really nice and helpful and we were just having normal conversations and everything seemed fine. 
Then every single day that We’ve been there at the same time he’s followed me around constantly talking to me instead of doing what he should be doing. Again though it was nothing weird but he would not leave me alone. Then I noticed every single time I would look over at where he was he’d be staring at me. He’d be outside doing something staring at me through the window. He’d be up front staring at me while I’m in the kitchen. Whenever he had even ten seconds to spare he came over to where I was even if I was busy and start talking to me or tapping my arm. 
I was starting to get a little weirder out but I didn’t really think much of it. Then my supervisor comes over to me one day and asks me about it. He said that Eric told him he thinks he has a chance with me and that he’s noticed how Eric follows me around and stares at me all day every day and asked if I was okay or if I felt uncomfortable. I said that I was fine and it was a little weird but I mainly just didn’t want him to get in trouble for not doing his job. Then I said I don’t know why he thinks he has a chance because I’ve told Eric about my boyfriend multiple times because it has come up in conversation. My supervisor said that he knows but he doesn’t care and thinks he can get me anyway. 
Then I went there on my day off to get something to eat with my boyfriend and Eric was working and he seemed fine he was talking to me and being nice but not being weird at all. Then a few days later at work my supervisor and another coworker told me that after me and my boyfriend left that day he came back and said seeing me with him made him upset but that he still thinks he has a chance and that he wants it more now. 
Then I was working with Eric the next day and he was trying to get my number by telling me if I ever needed him to pick up my shift for me I could call him knowing that I do not have is number but it didn’t work. and then he literally told me that he looked at my schedule and requested to pick up extra hours at the same time I was working. Then he told me I should pick up a night shift when he was working so we could “hang out and talk all night” since the place we work at is slow overnight but we’re open 24/7. 
I was really creeped out by this so I told my supervisor and he said that he’d try to help me out as best as he could and watch over me in case he tries to do anything else. He also said that he would buy me pepper spray because he is starting to get worried to because all this guy does is stare at me wherever I go if he’s not legitimately following me. 
I don’t know what to do and I don’t know if I’m over reacting or not but my supervisor and every other one of my coworkers has noticed this happening and talked to me about it. I don’t want to be mean because this kid is nice but I also don’t want him to keep doing this or keep thinking he “has a chance” with me.

We spoke for a while and then I told her something and she left then 10 minutes later I get a message and I thought it was just someone random, but it wasn’t it was the girls boyfriend we talk for a bit about what we like and dislike, then he asked if we could talk on Snapchat, now here’s the thing I don’t normally give my Snapchat out, I normally just give my kik but this guy didn’t have kik so we had to use Snapchat, we got on quite well and we set up a date to meet and stuff, but today he’s been going on at me to take the pill, ( which I did already)  and I even told him, but he was still going on and on about, and a few hours ago he messaged me saying that the morning after pill don’t work this late.

837,"I had a friend 20F who I 30M attempted to make me her sugar daddy. She made out with me before going overseas. She attempted to make me her sugar daddy after crossing the Atlantic. I am very close to her family, am worried about her mental well being as well as becoming some kind of victim, and have absolutely concrete evidence that this is fact.

No, I don't think she is actually having sex with older men however she is using them for money and making them crazy for her.

What should I do? 

Option 1.

I really don't want to tell her parents what she is doing because it would ruin them as well as their relationship with their daughter.

Option 2.  Try to see if I can talk some sense into her.

We are not on speaking terms and I don't think I can talk her out of not endangering herself because I am under the impression that she has been doing this for years. I could always try to be on speaking terms with her but I seriously doubt it.

Option 3.

I would love to just do nothing. This is probably the best option for my relationship with her family however doing nothing would require me to constantly lie to her parents when they get back to America and I wouldn't be ok if something were to happen to her because I am the only person right now that can do anything about it. She just seems to put herself in danger all the time and put herself in positions where she could easily be a victim. I feel like she is in a position where she could be the girl from the movie taken with Liam Neeson.

I feel like I want reddit to convince me to do option 3 steering me away from doing what I believe is the right thing (option 1). I really want to have a clear conscience but I really don't want to create waves.

I've been on a really good track to getting better since my surgery, yet now I feel like I've been set back by a week.

I bought a book from a bookseller on e-Bay, without free returns, and seeing some of the comments about the seller I decided to cancel the order. The time gap (09:02 and 09:04 PM on Aug 15) between placing the order and cancellation was just a minute. After 14 hours (11:22 PM on Aug 16), I received a mail saying the order was not cancelled because the product has been shipped.

So I contacted the seller mentioning my concern, the seller responded mentioning the shipping department was extremely efficient :O . The product was not dispatched until this (Aug 19) morning according to a later response from the seller because I called out their BS by keeping track of the USPS tracking number they gave. Then they send a long lecture on how a buyer can't cancel an order but only the seller can. You can find all the back and forth at

846,"I'd love some unbiased opinions here!

Backstory: I moved to NC 2 years ago with a boyfriend. We broke up but I was in online school and had a good job so I chose to stay in the area. Figured staying put for a bit to focus on school would be good. The plan has always been to move to a new area next summer. I am just not a fan of NC. I have friends now so it sucks less but this isn't really where I want to put down roots. 

The problem: my company did a RIF so come September 15, I'm unemployed. No other companies are hiring right now for my job and probably won't until the new year (a lot of other changes were happening too). There are jobs in the area, and worse comes to worse retail, so it's not like I'm totally screwed. 

My lease is coming to an end in October and I have to provide 60 day notice to move out, so by the end of August I kind of need to make a decision on my status here. My company has been actively hiring in Phoenix, AZ where my aunt lives. I have applied already to this job at recommendation of my dad. I won't know for another month probably if I get it. If I get the job though, I'm going to end up having to break a lease for 2k since I have to resign soon. this got me thinking more seriously about my options.

So. Option one: stay put in NC, focus on school, get a job of some kind and move next year as planned. Pros: I'll have my bachelor's. I'd get some time to think about where I wanna live next more seriously, possibly save some money to help with the move. Cost of living is cheap. Cons: lease logistics cause my apartment likes to penny pinch. Probably going to drop income which limits ability to save. probably 1 month+ of unemployment. 

Option two: move to Phoenix, AZ in Late September/October. Pros: I have already applied to a job there, and I'd still be under protected veteran status for job hunting (I won't be next summer, does apply to NC too). School is online so it can come with me. I'd have some family support. Will probably improve mental health. Cons: cost of living increase. Moving expenses would come sooner than expected but I can afford it. I'd be moving without a job. Probably 1+ month unemployment. 

Neither is clearly better other than I don't really know for sure what to do. What do you think?",19Aug2019,1
847,"Hi everyone. F22 here. I have quite a complex family situation. In a nut shell my father was extremely abusive until my parents divorced when I was 13. I had a rocky relationship with my mum throughout secondary school which has since improved considerably but the past remains the past.

I’ve always found myself yearning for affection from (mainly) maternal figures. This involved teachers at school, lecturers at university and nurses when I was in hospital. I have this need to be ‘looked after’ and an obsession with being/acting ‘cute’ (not weirdly). I definitely look a lot younger than I am - probably around 16/17, which doesn’t help. All I do is day dream about these figures in my life - how I can make them proud, what they’d say if I did x or y. But ultimately it’s ruining me. I left school to go to university and my heart broke. My lecturers have their own children and they’ll never like/love me nearly as much as they love them (obviously) and my heart breaks constantly when they talk about them in class. I realise this is connected with my upbringing, and as I’m getting older and losing my ‘youth’, I’m finding it really hard to come to terms with. It seems my only source of happiness is when maternal figures interact with me in a positive way, and I don’t get this at all from my actual mum. 

Looking for any kind of advice, people who have experienced similar and whether there’s a name for this. Sorry for the rambling and thank you x 

TLDR: overwhelming need to be loved and shown affection by maternal/paternal figures. Only source of happiness but as I’m now 22, this is rarely come by and I’m extremely anxious about getting older.",19Aug2019,1
848,"Soooo, I am a pharmacy technician in Denmark, and I love my new job. My bosses are nice to me, and my coworkers are amazing! 
My bosses are giving me a lot of responsibility and letting me be somewhat of a little manager. 

I have had a feeling that, I could achieve more in life when it comes to education, and I have spoken briefly to some of my coworkers about it. One day my boss wants to talk to me. She told me, that I am made for much more, because she thinks I’m clever, bright, and I take a lot of responsibility. She said, that I should consider becoming a pharmacist instead.

Right. I want to educate myself some more, but I have recently bought a car, so that I can get to my workplace (it’s 50 km away).

849,"So a girl I've been seeing/dating but more so as friends with benefits deal for the last few months just found out she had a warrant in a neighboring County for skipping court there a year or so ago. She found all this out last week. 

Today she decided to turn herself in. I told her to write my number down on her hand and call me when she was inside with information and if she wanted me to get her out or not.

Well I just looked her up and she went in about five hours ago, her bail is only a thousand bucks but obviously she will have to repay that back. The problem is I have no clue when her court date is. She obviously didn't write down my number as I haven't heard from her yet. It killed me to see her mugshot on the website just now.

My question is this. I really want to bail her out because I hate that she's in there but I also don't want to find out she was supposed to just have court in the morning tomorrow and be out right after court. I don't want to bail her out then have her be irritated for spending a thousand bucks on her bail when it was simply one night in a very boring safer county jail.

Should I just let it ride out and let her handle it considering she didn't write my cell number down to tell me to come get her or should I go bail her out and tell her just to repay me in installments? (She's a dancer, a grand is a couple nights work for her tops)

I don't want to overstep boundaries but I hate knowing she's in there but at the same time I don't want to be Mr White Knight and have the first thing she says to me when she gets out is “why did you do that I was gonna have court in the morning it's not a big deal ""

She's a tough chick I know she can handle herself but I feel if she really thought she would need my help she would have taken five seconds to write down my cell number before she went in.",19Aug2019,1
850,"First of all, I hate that I’m upset about this, but here we are.

I have a FB account that I only use for posting/checking on my neighborhood page. I like to see what’s going on in the neighborhood, if anyone needs any assistance, things like that. My own posts on the page are about 90% me giving away things I no longer need, brand new things I bought to giveaway, some used furniture I no longer need and occasionally food. We live in a lower income area and I like to help people out whenever I can. When we first moved here, we were broke and really struggled financially, so understand needing help. Fortunately , things have gotten much better for my SO and I, so I want to help others now that I am able to do so. I never ask for any money for these things and I’ve driven things to people who needed them if they don’t have a car to come get them. Not trying to pat myself on the back, just trying to paint a picture of my general activity on there.

The other 10% of my posts are events going on, suggestions for the town, and the occasional silly post. 

I posted something today and a person I thought looked familiar “liked” it, I clicked on their profile to see if I knew them or not. 


A few posts down on this person’s page, I see someone else had screenshotted one of my posts on the neighborhood page and tagged the person’s profile I was on. The post I made was a silly one about a cloud that looked like an elephant that was above my neighbors house. Several people were ripping me apart in the comments. Some of the comments were “this b needs to be stopped “ “oh they bored today.” Then there was a screenshot in those comments of a post I had put up reviewing a local dog park with the comment“why is she posting this bullshit.” They were also saying how gross it was that I was letting my dog and my kid play in “brown water,” it was a cedar lake. The water is gonna be brown.

I was annoyed/hurt because I don’t actually know ANY of the people that were liking/commenting on the post. Yet, here they are talking about me, my parenting and how “stupid “ my posts are. Never met them, wouldn’t know them if I fell over them, but the way the post/comments were worded, lead me to believe that this was not the first time that what I’ve posted was screenshotted/talked about among these people. The person who posted both screenshots also didn’t block my name or my picture on a public post.

What brings me here though, is one of the commentators (who I have never met,spoke with or had any interaction with whatsoever) commented saying that I had blocked her before (not true) and that she had “called me out” because I was posting about people “bringing down the town” (also not true) and about “my” house when I lived at xyz address about how dirty “my” house was and it was probably disgusting on the inside and “my” house was part of the problem.

The thing that is bothering me the most is, I’ve never lived at xyz address. I’ve lived in the same house for 7 years and hadn’t lived in this town before that since I was 18, I’m 35 now. Even when I was 18 and living at home, it wasn’t at xyz address or anywhere near xyz address. And again, I’ve never had any interactions with any of these people in my life. 

I thought about commenting on the post and explaining my side of things, but decided that wouldn’t help anything and would likely make things worse. I’ve also thought about pming the person saying she “called me out” and politely telling her that I think she’s got me confused with someone else and that we’ve never met/spoken to each other. We have plenty of mutual friends on FB so I was thinking of telling her that one of those people told me about the comments. Obviously I would be vague and not name names. 

Ultimately, I know that I should just let it go, but my feelings are really hurt. I guess I just don’t understand the point of ripping someone apart publicly who isn’t harming anyone. Like I said, most of my posts are giving things away to try and help people. I consider myself a pretty nice person and I really enjoy helping others when I can. Now, I’m hesitant to post anything because I don’t want to be publicly mocked and talked about. I know I can’t control other people’s actions, but damn, my feelings are really hurt. 

So, what I’m asking is, what would you do? Would you confront the person/people saying things? Would you just stop posting? Maybe block the people involved? 

Thanks for any advice!!!",19Aug2019,0
851,"TL;DR I’m wondering if my (26f) parent (55f) is addicted to prescription drugs. She has a long complicated history of legal prescription drug use that I am only now realizing might be a problem. She is on many seemingly conflicting drugs that I have a hard time believing are all needed.

I’m wondering if my (26f) parent (55f) is addicted to prescription drugs. She has really struggled with intense mental health issues since she was a teenager, and has been on a changing list of prescribed drugs for over 30 years. We have a very strained relationship that I am only now beginning to connect to her drug use. I also have siblings that are addicts, whom she has treated poorly in my opinion. For background, throughout my life I have watched her struggle with severe depression, food addiction and recurring bouts of what I would basically call mania. She drank a lot when I was younger but has since stopped drinking. Off and on she does illegal drugs (pot, coke, etc) definitely to excess, but sporadically &amp; not every day. I’ve never considered until recently that abusive prescription drug use could be a factor in her stability &amp; mental health. Growing up, I was raised to believe that drugs prescribed by a doctor were safe &amp; that if her psychiatrist prescribed a drug or combination of drugs it was to help her. She has done things with the drugs I find irresponsible (trying to give them to myself or my siblings to help us sleep, get through a hard time etc. , or using them too quickly and witnessing her irritation that she has to wait a while before she can refill the prescription). I am wondering if this is her general instability or could signify a deeper issue with addiction. I recently learned that she is on multiple drugs that seem to be conflicting, for ex adderall, sleeping medications, muscle relaxers, SSRI’s, not to mention things for blood pressure etc (she is overweight and not in great health). I know this is a lot of info and I feel terrible putting it all out in the open (mostly terrified somehow she will find it and connect it to me, hence anon account) I just feel perhaps I’ve somehow missed a huge waving red flag all my life. I always thought her irritability, depression, tendency to sleep for days etc was just from her mental health, and then the medicine was working to make it better. To be fair, I also worry that I selfishly fixate on her failures and she give her a break. I had a really difficult childhood with her and am just trying to figure out how to have a relationship with her as an adult that doesn’t involve me making endless painful sacrifices. Any input would help, thank you in advance for reading.",19Aug2019,1

854,"From about 6-2 months ago I would take benzodiazepines almost everyday. Didn’t matter what kind could be Xanax, klonopins, or Ativan. Whatever I could get my hands on. To be honest looking back on it it’s clear how it negatively effected my life but while I was living it all I could think about was how it temporarily made my fears and anxiety go away. Years ago I was prescribed kpins during a major life change and used them to genuinely manage occasional panic attacks. However as time went on and I settled in I began to gain more control over my anxieties I eventually was no longer prescribed or seeing a psychiatrist and went off them. But recently I was in a period of transition that hit me really hard and managed to get my hands on some benzodiazepines from dealers when I would buy weed, instead of from a psychiatrist. During the high I would feel a sense of happiness, peace, and euphoria and it would feel as if nothing in the world mattered. This made me feel better but it also made me prone to lash out, make rash decisions, and more violent. If I was stressing about bills, my identity, relationship, or anything else. I could take benzos and it all seemed to melt away and I could not give a fuck about anything and be happy. At first it was something I would tell myself I would only do when times got really tough and that I could control it with restricted use but naturally that’s not how those things work. After about a month of periodic use I transitioned to using about every couple of days then eventually to every/every other day. I managed to keep my use hidden from family, friends, and girlfriend who I knew would have a big issue with regular benzo use. To be honest it was not very hard because taking a small pill can easily be done in the bathroom or even blatantly in front of people (I can swallow pills without any water). Once I became a regular user it was incredibly difficult to stop and things just sort of got out of hand. The began to get really bad just before my moms wedding I got into a big fight with my girlfriend of 6/7 years and it ended up getting physical which is something I’ll forever be ashamed of. She ended up not going to the wedding and during that time I managed to stay off of benzos for the 3 days I was out of town with family and during that time we made up and got back together. However, once I was back and had access again I was right back at it. Whenever I would feel self conscious, angry, or anxious I would eat a few mg and be relieved. I managed to keep my addiction hidden the entire time.  It came to a head about 2 months ago when I wanted to take my girlfriend to the lake for the day to hang out and chill. She had some work or something and I rushed her and rushed her and to be honest I had no reason to act out other than I was frustrated and drugged out. Eventually she got upset and just told me she wasn’t going and told me to leave or she would. I stuck around and she left. To make matters worse she had kpins from her doctor at her place that she got for her own anxiety. Of course I decided to take a bunch because I was stressed out and that only made things worse. She wanted me out of her place and decided it would be best to get her dad/cops involved to get this done. While I may not have always agreed with her fathers opinions and ideals I had always managed to be respectful in my interactions with him. But now off like 6mg of klonopin all my self control and filters were gone. He called the cops which I already had some ptsd about from a different time. Before the police arrived I left and went to get pizza and when I came back her dad and her were standing by the door which was too much for me and I told him off and essentially gave a big fuck you to him. At the same time I wanted my girlfriend away from him so we could deal with this together but being barred out my best idea was to grab her phone and try and walk away. At that point her dad runs and grabs me trying to get my girlfriends phone back. Although he may weigh more than me I am bigger so I wrestling tripped him (pushed him backwards while using my leg to prevent him from being able to step back to catch himself) and dropped him to the ground. I didn’t want to hurt him really just get him to fuck off/stop grabbing me. But of course a guy in his 20s taking a 50 year old man to the ground is only a bad look for me. So people gathered around and I got up and gave my girlfriend her phone back and drove off. To this day I consider it was a miracle I even got my car home in one piece. I don’t remember much else from that night other than trying to give my girlfriend my cat and I’m sure I said horrible disturbing shit to her over text to the point I was rightfully blocked. I went home and attempted suicide. The following day I discovered my girlfriend had blocked me on everything (and am still blocked now months later and haven’t heard anything from her since that day) so I stayed taking benzos for a couple days after that. Eventually, after the drugs wore off and I realized I needed to make a drastic change and had to deal with the reality of the situation I had created. I cried for a whole day and then called a therapist and got some recommendations for groups and organizations I could reach out to. I have since been to meetings and sessions but honestly they weren’t really for me. I’m just about 2 months clean and honestly this past week has been really difficult I feel I’ve destroyed the happiest part of my life because I couldn’t manage drug use. I’ve cried almost every night alone with my cat(which almost makes it harder because she also has a cat which I raised from a kitten for years) because my (ex)girlfriend and family still don’t even know what I’m going through. My family know I’m not doing well and do their best to be supportive but they think it’s only because of the breakup (which to be fair it is) but don’t know how hard it has been for me to be clean without my main support system. I’ve been doing my best everyday but it just seems to be getting more difficult and more lonely everyday. Sometimes I think it might be best if I just let her move on and find happiness elsewhere but other days all I want is desperately to tell her the truth and make amends but I’m so ashamed and feel it’s to late to make up. At this point I want to write a letter or email or something coming clean to her but I have doubts as to if that even matters after all this. Any advice is appreciated.",19Aug2019,1

857,"Its been a rollercoaster for the passed few months with a close friend of mine. We had at one point been practically attached to the hip, and in constant contact as well. We decided to finally go on an outing together for about a months. Let’s just say, it wasn’t all fun, but there were good times. However coming back home, everything changed. This person ghosted me for the first week of being home. I gave them time, after a while I tried my best to be communicative and address the issue ask what was going on. Multiple times I was told, everything was fine then it progressed to I don’t wanna hang out with you as much as before, one time even so much as saying that they didnt want the friendship, then the other party stated they just didn’t feel that the friendship was strong anymore or worth it. They had chucked it up to always being irritated, annoyed at me whenever I was around. In vicinity with other friends they would be passive aggressive and make sleigh comments regarding me, they would keep silent when other people said hateful things towards me, they themselves just told me that it was just who I was and the way I am that they didn’t like. 
Always claiming that they needed to get away from me or that they needed space yet at the same time always contacting and doing/saying hurtful things which were being perceived as wanting to cut ties but when asked these questions directly that person would always ignore it and never answer. Its been a game of cat and mouse with this person always saying one thing then always getting mad when I actually do as they asked, which was stay away or not contact them. 
But the gist is,  this person treated me like shit, which basically hurt like hell especially from someone you valued and trusted so much. I still fought for the friendship to salvage what I could. 
However, I think it is time to let go, (even other people have told me this as well) the past will never be, and the damage done is too much.

Maybe, the saying time heals wounds is true. 
But even if those wounds do heal, would you even consider being friends with someone who treated you like this?",19Aug2019,1
858,"Tl;DR at bottom

I recently got my first job but I'm not coping with it. The lady training me (fast food) snaps at me whenever I make a mistake and it really gets to me. I hate myself for being so sensitive but I can't do anything about that I feel... on top of that she has a very difficult accent to understand 


A month ago I was very suicidal and almost hospitalized for a suicide attempt. I am 18 now but since I was 10 I have been struggling with suicidal thoughts, severe social anxiety and chronic depression. I am no longer under child mental health services though as I am 18.

At work i spend hours constantly having her shake her head at me in front of customers, apologize profusely to the customers because I am slow, just constant down talking and impatient attitudes toward me. I know this is probably normal for a new job but with all my mental health issues I am very sensitive to it. I begin to hate myself at work for being so sensitive as well as being affected by all the fuck ups and it sends me into a depression that takes a few days to recover from.

I feel like I need to stick with this and maybe it will get better if I just learn and also I have been searching for jobs for months now.

But I don't know if my mental health can take it and I am just so lost as to what to do... I really need help

Tl;DR my mental health issues are affecting my new job and every minute at my new job is full of depression and self hating intrusive thoughts (telling me I should hurt myself) but I feel like if I stick through the training it might be ok. I really don't know what to do.",19Aug2019,5

862,"Hi, I am a 28, I am a girl.

I've been single all my life. I really don't understand what's the problem, you can't imagine how many tears I had thinking over this question. 

Some people say I'm pretty, some even say I'm really beautiful. I have some weight issues, I think I'm chubby but I realized this can't be the real problem because I saw girls way more heavier than me but in relationships.

The guys I liked never approached me, actually all of my crashes during teen years made me so traumatized as they never respond to my feeling and some even laughed about that straight in my face in front of school people. I had a severe depression which I think I finally overcome. I went to a psychotherapist, it helped a little bit but didn't change the whole situation.

I'm 28 now. I never been kissed. It hurts to know no guy ever sent me flowers to make me smile. I try to be nice, I smile, I wear cute clothes, I apply makeup and read so many books about relationships. Still no luck.

First I thought that I will find that one. I was raised in a Muslim family with all the educations and traditions which we belong to but my family is pretty much secular. I think I could find someone to sleep with - looks like not a problem to me. But I want to be valued. But no guy value me.

870,"Title basically explains everything. Since January I had been assigned to a wonderful mental health therapist. I would see her once a week as needed and my last appointment I had with her was in early July.

That last appointment she told me she would eventually be going on maternity leave around October or November. She said that that she and the health clinic I attend would make sure the transition to a new therapist would be smooth and that they would talk to me prior to the change. 

Fast forward to today. I called to book an appointment with her, but it turns out she had already started her leave. This is much earlier than I had anticipated and these appointments are important for me. The lady on the phone told me I would have to go to the walk-in section of the clinic to be re-assessed by their head psychologist and then assigned a new therapist. 

What I'm worried about is all of the progress and work my former therapist and I were able to achieve together. I know my file and all of my notes and experiences will be passed down to my new therapist.. but it just feels like I'm starting all over again.

We have always respected each other's religion (or lack of) and we discuss things and always draw a line regarding different religious topics/ 

We have had this conversation about the clothing before (about 9 or 10 months ago) and after I explained to him that in my previous relationship (which was abusive), my ex-boyfriend started telling me what to wear and I complied, until it developed into a situation where he would even have control over who I talk too or how oftern I would hang out with my family. It got bad. I told my current boyfriend I was not going through that again and that I wasn't raised to see leggings as a piece of clothing that made me disrespect myself. I have turned into a confident and independent woman with a much higher self-esteem than before which is why he started liking me in the first place.

There were tears and he supposedly understood and told me that it was ok. 

Fast forward to about 2 days ago, I was in my day off and went with my family. It was really hot and I wore leggings and a tank top. Nothing too tight about the tank top just a regular one and well obviously the leggings are tight. I am a thick girl, have my curves so regardless of what I wear, you are gonna see them. I hung out with my family all day, went grocery shopping and then came back home around 9 PM. He was already at the house and when I got home he got all serious and I asked what's wrong, and he said that he was just tired but he kept being serious. When I asked again he said it was because of my clothes, my leggings specifically, and the conversation went like this:

Boyfriend-I have already told you I don't like leggings  
Girlfriend-I wear them because they are comfortable, they are very thick you cant even see anything  
B-It's not about that, it's that you can see the whole figure of your butt and legs

881,"Hi there! I am in desperate need of some reassurance and first hand advice. 

I work in a major hospital system and, of course, the Thursday after a (Saturday) wedding where I passed around a joint with some old friends, I got called in for a random drug screen at work. My boss announced it in front of my entire department in a morning meeting (which I’m now finding out is an enormous HIPAA violation on her part). And then...Cue sheer panic. I hadn’t smoked for several months before. 

In a Sunday night anxiety attack after the wedding, I ordered Quick Fix synthetic urine and by some type of divine intervention, had it in my work bag with me that day. 

I successfully got the product up to appropriate temperature and used it without being detected during the actual deed. 

It was sent off to a lab for testing. The nurse who collected the sample from me told me the sample was acceptable for testing (temperature, color, no evidence of tampering, etc) and told me if I hear nothing in two weeks I can consider the test negative. She was very sweet and gave me no reason to think she was suspicious. I’ve heard nothing as of yet. 

Well. I’m five days in and the anxiety is so difficult to deal with. I’m on pins and needles all day wondering if the next phone call, email, knock on the door is someone informing me I’ve been found out and will be terminated. 

I work in a very specialized field and job opportunities are few and far between. I know, I know. Not taking any drugs would have been the best way to prevent this happening, but I don’t need to hear that right now. Believe me, I’m being harder on myself than anyone else could ever be. For a cherry on top, my fiancé just found out his position is being eliminated and might be jobless come November. I feel like my world is crumbling around me. 

My questions are:
- has anyone ever successfully used Quick Fix in a lab drug screen? (Not sure which lab)

- if the test is flagged as inconclusive or suspicious, what typically happens then? I’ve been hydrating to prepare for maybe having to give another urine sample which would need to be my real urine. Just hoping that small amount wouldn’t show up after 10-20 days. 

- do I have any other options to protect myself right now? I’d hate to think smoking ¼ of a joint once has the potential to ruin my hard-earned career. 

- if I do end up being terminated for this, how do I explain it on future job applications or in interviews? I feel like I’ll have a proverbial scarlet A on me and never work in this field I love again.

I was going to be a bridesmaid and took off work to try on dresses with her and hang out when she came to scout venues. However, a couple months later I found out the wedding was changed to a venue over a thousand miles away (she's marrying into a rich family). (She didn't bother to tell me personally). I told her I could afford to go and couldn't miss holidays with my family (her wedding is within a couple days of Christmas).   


She just kept pressuring me saying I had to think about it and it was really important to her. I said I'd think about it. Later I heard that the bridesmaids all had to buy dresses that were like $100-300 (and useless for any other occasion) and I had some other expenses.  I realized I just can't afford it and I told her firmly, but politely/nicely. She just said ""not even for a day"" and I told her I couldn't. She never answered me.

Meanwhile, the friend organized the bridal shower (which is in my city) has planned a mildly expensive day long event. She informed me the bride said I was still welcome. Bride still hasn't responded.   


At this point, I don't want to go. Honestly, it's been over a month, the bride never even bothered to respond to my polite ""I afford to attend your destination wedding."" At this point, I don't really want to see any of these people. I get that it's all ""special day"" but someone who won't even answer a messages isn't someone I want to spend another $100 dollars to celebrate.

890,"Hello friends,

I apologize if the organization of this post is scrambled, I really don't know how to ask for help for this situation because I'm scatterbrained right now from all the stress that I'm feeling lately

My GF has been in a tough family situation for most of her life and her morale is plummeting down over the past year or so. She lives in an extremely toxic household: her landlord &amp; his wife likes to blame their family for everything wrong with the building and break their own rules then blame it on her family and her mom most likely has severe paranoid schizophrenia and forces her children to live under her strict and paranoid regime.

Her mother always believes that there is something out to hurt their family and prevents my GF from doing many things. She isn't allowed to eat out without her mom around, she isn't allowed to talk to boys, she isn't allowed to hang out with friends (I have no clue if she's allowed to have any), she isn't allowed to eat certain foods (anything outside of ethnic range or spicy foods) and her mom searches through her stuff all the time to throw away anything she does not approve of. She also forces her to attend church and believes in prayer instead of medication; if my GF were to get ill, it would be her fault out of all other factors...

My GF has tried suggesting help for her mother but she does not believe that she has one. She also has no healthcare, undocumented and unemployed (my GF and her brother provide for the household). She has been controlling my GF's life since she was young and she doesn't feel confidant enough to take drastic measures or trust many people in her life. I'm not in a good financial spot myself and I don't have space in my tiny apartment room already, but I've already tried sending my GF a bunch of stuff to help her get through the day (like food, supplements and money) and I am obviously sending her a lot of emotional support. I feel like I could do more but I don't know what I can do at this point and it's starting to get at me as well.

Again, I'm sorry for the poor organization of this post, I'm capable of writing better but there are a hundred things on my mind right now. I'd appreciate any input that anyone has for my situation and I'll provide more details if they are needed",19Aug2019,2

I think he is coping with some deeper issues by using women to fill a void of loneliness and emotions he cannot process himself. He has gotten very defensive when I have tried to bring up these issues in the past, but now I would like to confront him and recommend him to see a therapist.
If anyone has any advice on how to go about this, I would really love to hear it. I’m afraid if his behavior doesn’t change, he will hurt someone, himself, and ruin our friendship forever.

893,"I’m 20, living with my parents, and currently working 2 jobs. My boyfriend just moved last week to Colorado for work and I’ll be heading there some time in January.

I would’ve left with him, but I got recently promoted to manager at my full time job, it’s a new business, and  the owners are a local family here that are currently working on re-opening their old business in another town so they’re focused on that.

My issue is that we just had manager leave and another is having a baby and is going on maternity leave soon. I would really like to leave sooner, but I don’t like the thought of leaving when there’s no one else that can take my position. 

I’ve talked to the owner’s daughter (it’s weird their parents have their kids take care of the business while they fund everything) and she appreciates me staying, but I really just don’t wanna be here anymore. I respect them and my coworkers enough to not dip, but I just feel so bad if I leave sooner than January. I realize there’s nothing else keeping me here other than my “ohhhh I feel bad” attitude, but I really don’t want to fuck over a local family’s small business. 

Please give me advice.",19Aug2019,1
895,"Had an abusive ex like most people had. Wouldn't let me have keys to the flat we lived in, made me pay him £200 to keep the noise down so I could go to work the next day. Then said it was rent I owed him even though we weren't living together at the time. Then when I did move in he lost his job and I had to keep the two of us afloat until we got kicked out and he left me. Anyway after this I've not had any serious relationships except I was dating a man who ended up marrying his best mates girlfriend and a man I fell in love with from Holland who came out as gay a few months back. A load of other shits happened but somewhat irrelevant. Anyway fast forward I meet a guy at this gig who's proper into me. He asks me out we go on a date etc. He ends up at mine and we don't sleep together but it's fun whatever. Anyway all of me is saying 'block him' 'tell him you're seeing someone else' etc. All things I shouldn't do. But I like him but am fuuuucking terrified. He's also 10 years older than me which for some reason mildly bothers me? And I can't stop thinking about the guy who came out as gay to me.

896,"Hey everyone, 

I just graduated from college this past may, and got a job working for a cybersecurity company. Since a kid, my goal has been to start my own business and since that obviously costs money to do, I had to get a normal job so I can save up to try to do what I really want. The job itself is fine, the CEO really likes me and I am working very hard to get the company off the ground. But every day that I am driving home, I can't help but think to myself, ""This is it?"". I feel miserable every day after work and all I have time to do is eat dinner, maybe watch a movie and then go to bed to do it all over again. I know it's temporary for me but it blows my mind that people work 9-5 jobs until retirement. I am not even a month into this new job and I have pretty much 0 complains about the new job itself, but I just don't know how much longer I can do this. If anyone has advice from similar situations, it would be really helpful.

897,"So my younger brother just turned 13, and since a few months now, my parents have decided to host foster children. This  meant that my brother and I (17) have to share a room. We've been clashing a lot lately, as he is just entering puberty and I'm about to leave it. I often try and get justification with my parents but they end up choosing his side in the argument, because he is their youngest child and they often get special treatment. 

So today, I came home (already in a bad mood) and all I wanted to do was run upstairs and be alone in my room for a while. When i got to my room, I saw that my younger brother had eaten chips and left crums and  a cup on the floor. He also forgot to turn off the playstation and TV.  I completely flipped and when he returned to the room, I started yelling at him.  He started yelling back and before I knew him, my hand turned into a fist and I had hit his face really hard. He started crying and I was genuinely shocked at what I had just done. I was frustrated, but that wasn't entirely his fault. 

Soon afterwards, I realised that he is in reality the best brother I could've wished for. After the fight, he cleaned the room. I also remembered the countless times he left the room because I needed some alone time, even though the room is his as well.

I feel so terrible and I think I might've bruised his face. What can I do to make up with him?",19Aug2019,2
898,"As a little backstory, I was hired at this company into position X. A year of training and work later, I'm ""restructured"" and put into position Y. I don't like position Y. It's way more numbers and data centric with zero upward motion within the company. However, it's my position now, so I do it well and to the best of my ability. Plus my manager is one of the best people I've ever worked with. She's incredibly supportive, has been helping me to add to my background with approved training, got me a promotion by creating the position and job description from nothing, and really is the best part of this job.  
I've been in position Y for 3+ years now. It's very much a job that nobody else wants to do, the only way to do it is manually, and I do it well (and get paid very well, thank you pharmaceutical manufacturing). The woman that initially hired me into position X has recently left the plant, and now her position is open... which is pretty much the position I was originally hired into. Typically, I would jump into this position. I know the hiring manager and would am pretty much guaranteed the job.   
HOWEVER, leaving this manual and tedious position Y would completely and totally overwhelm my manager, who is already taking over one of my teammate's daily workload as she's just left on her 6 month maternity leave. To make it worse, in January I have a specific report to create and it EATS MY LIFE for 3+ months. There's ZERO way she'll be able to do it with her team of three cut down to only one. The reason I was ""restructured"" to position Y in the first place is because the job was open for over a year and they couldn't find anyone to fill it and it needed to be filled by someone who had the background I did. This job will take a lot of time to fill and it would f\*\*k her life up three ways from Sunday to have this on top of everything else.  
Should I apply for my old position X and f\*\*k over my amazing, supportive, fantastic boss that I'll have to continue to work closely with, but be in a better position with more management opportunities? Should I keep my current position Y, and continue just plugging along and hoping that a path to management opens up at some point, but keeping a close bond with my amazing supervisor?",19Aug2019,1
899,"I'm in my senior year of hugh school, and I'm very active in several clubs and programs; like our Spring Musical, One Act, NAHS, chorus, NSHS, and the International Club. All of these have made me so happy, and it being my senior year, I thought I'd finally worked everything out to be perfect.

Until I got a job.

It was supposed to be only a PRN weekend receptionist job, where I was sometimes called in for evenings and weekends, while working every third weekend, but quickly turned into me being the permanent evening receptionist, and working every Wed and Thurs as well as every third weekend. 

This is where my problem lies: it's One Act season, and I'm finally able to be the assistant director and stage manager, I've been working toward this since my freshman year, but our practices are Mon-Thurs after school. Director says I can't be assistant director if I can't be there, and I'm absolutely devastated. 

My parents believe I should ditch One Act and keep my job, because if I ask to take 8 weeks off of evenings I'll probably get fired, but this is my senior year, it's my last chance to be a kid before I'm expected to make life changing decisions, and I just want to have fun with my friends and reap my rewards from a hard 3 years of slaving in these clubs.

The fact that I fall for people too easy. The fact that I don't eat enough and am probably slightly underweight.  The fact that I'm not happy with my body, that I don't like the person I am right now. 

I start thinking that no one, no matter how much they say it, cares about me and will drop me as a person at a moments notice. That they are only dealing with me because I exist. I start telling myself that no one likes me and that everyone would be better if I was just gone and didn't exist.

911," My sound taste is mostly hard-rock/metal (sometimes rock and some space for the good 90s hits).

However the society i had to grow up in, was all about that tough guy mentality. If you look weak, you will get your stuff stolen, beaten up or you will be just picked on. So, you know, to not be a punk, i need to listen to the oldschool hip-hop (now i listen to good newschool, ""good"" according to oldschool listeners and the good oldies), workout, look tough.

(growing up without a father \[he still lives, but he has taken alcohol over his family, he was abusive and at 5 i've watched him almost strangle my mother to death\], made my emotions fade away. I don't care about pain, only words sort of affect me short term)

Now i'm 18yo, 192cm and my body looks something like ""the prisoner that only trains his body"" (idk how to put it well in words, the point is i'm huge in muscles and people assume i'm a criminal based of my looks \[even that i'm not\].)

My looks don't represent my soul, i'm a deep thinker and quite a shy guy (i find people fake as it gets, not everyone of course, but i've been played by ""friends' and even girls i was in love with), supportive in a relationship (i take care of the person as best as i can without being a intruder in their life). Family is my number one. I value it the most out of the others. In a group i'm open, but whenever i'm at home/alone i get into this deep thinker mode. I tend to rethink my life, the people i surround myself with.

920,"I’m a first time mother, currently into the sixth month of pregnancy. The past month has been exhausting, and I feel like I’m about to break down.

My fiancé and I just bought our first house August 7th. Our relator was unreliable and the entire process was basically handled by my fiancé and myself. We had some troubles with our leasing office, which is a whole another story, so right now we technically still are renting an apartment until the end of September. 

I work in retail at a used book store and right now we are in our busy season. For the most part, my coworkers have been understanding of my pregnancy, but no matter how much I’ve tried to explain, the store manager doesn’t quite seem to get it. 
When I was in month four of the pregnancy, my doctor had sent a list of restrictions, one of which said no more than lifting 25lbs. Despite this, I was scheduled for hours day after day at our buying counter, where people bring in boxes of heavy books that I simply cannot lift. Not only that, but the store I work at is in a low to middle class area, where people looking for easy cash bring in some of the most disgusting books, covered in dead bugs, black mold, animal urine, or obviously fished from the bottom of a dumpster. I tried explaining to my store manager that I should not be working that part of the store, and it took my doctor sending in an updated list of restrictions this month, now saying I shouldn’t be lifting more than 10lbs (she recommended physical therapy for my back pain), for them to quit scheduling me at that part of our store. 

I had requested off work for moving over a month in advance, and yet they did not give me a single extra day off for moving. I actually had to have a coworker switch me days. I brought this to the store managers attention, and I was told that we were too busy and understaffed to have any time off, but that they could probably give me time off the next week. I asked again and was told no again, because they were training new hires. I have a week of unused holiday days and two weeks of vacation accumulated, and yet no matter how much I request, they won’t give me any time off. I understand that we are busy and understaffed, but they had months to replace the people who left and chose not to until just last week. 

My fiancé and I have spent all free time unpacking and trying to get our new house started. I haven’t had a day to just rest. My energy and patience are basically gone. I’m in pain constantly and I am aware that my hormones are starting to cloud my sensibility. I want to just quit my job, but know financially it is a stupid idea. I’ve read stories on r/pregnant and feel weak compared to some of the mothers who are working until their due date.

921,"Hi there, hope you have a wonderful day. 

24 y/o male from Norway here. For the last month, I have been feeling very ambivalent about a decision and it is very emotionally draining. 

I have been living in a smaller city called Trondheim for 3 years, where I now finished my bachelor in musicology. I have the option of going there another year, and then i will have a bachelor in music technology also. This will qualify me for having the option to apply for a masters in music technology in Oslo. The catch is that Trondheim is really small and I feel like the same things are happening all the time. There is not much more to gain for me as a musician here. 

The other option is just to move to Oslo now. I have a place to stay here, but i know very few people and i have no idea on what to do, beside getting a job. There is a lot of new stuff to potentially explore here and people that are making a living of music (which is my dream). I have some success with my music, but I dont make a lot of money from it yet. My biggest dream is to make a living of creative projects, and I dont see how a degree would get me there. 

Education is free in Norway, and it will give me a lot of time to do music, even if I live in a place that isnt filled with so many other opportunities. On the other side, I dont see how having a bachelor/ masters in music technology would get me a job in such a field. I feel this constant pressure to do something big with my life, and im also getting older.

So my partner and I have had our little bouts about things but they were minor and quickly dissipated into laughing afterwards. The thing is that we're both coming to the realization that the relationship hardly has any foundations keeping us from falling apart. We share less than 5 things in common but I've caught us in the middle of convincing each other that the only thing that matters is that we love each other. Sure, I am happy every time I see her and it feels so good to have someone looking out for you intimately. That friction and constant clash of interests is clearly becoming something we're gonna have to deal with sooner or later. For example, I like to play video games and her thing is going out to clubs. I stopped hitting up my friends for outings to arcades or hanging out in general because my gf is clearly not interested in doing anything I find fun. Can't go out alone cause then it gets brought up in an argument. I fucking hate comparing but my friends bring their gfs along even if they just idle by and talk with the other gfs. Oh, but when my gf wants to go to a club, it's either go or stay, she's going anyway and I never brought up any of the times she's gone alone. Kinda hard to split from someone you've been with for years though. What would you guys take to doing in a situation like this? Can't find it in me to end it abruptly.",19Aug2019,1

The girl knows I like someone, just not who. I don't want to tell her because I think she will be mad at me. I think she might stop being my friend and I want to stay friends with her.

I'm not sure but sometimes I get the sign that the guy might like me a little too. Maybe not.

This all happened within the last 2 years. Lately I had been thinking about just giving up on the people in that club and finally decided to leave the group chat, where everyone talks about movies, makes plans and invites everyone to parties.

This is dumb but I was kind of hoping someone would ask why I'd left. No one did and I hope I didn't seem like a bitch for leaving. Now I'm starting to regret it because it feels like I ended the only connections I have at my college. I'm shy and obviously not good at making friends so it makes me sad. At the same time, it seemed like something I needed to do because I felt excluded.

Did I do the right thing? Should I have tried to talk to them about feeling excluded? Or am I just totally overthinking it 🤷‍♀️

**TL;DR: I left the only group chat I'm in at my college with all of the people I've met in my film club because I didn't feel like they cared about me. Now I'm not sure if it was the right decision.**",19Aug2019,1
939,"Sorry for bad grammar, it's late


It's currently in the middle of the night and im sitting here and crying. I fucked up at school and I'm now repeating the entire year again. I don't really wanna get into details. I don't even care about the lost year. The reason why i'm crying is because I'm no longer with my old group of friends and especially this one dude that always has been there for me. I only knew him three years but those years where the best of my life (a bold thing to say with only 16 years ik). He always sat right next to me and helped me alot. We still go to the same school and I still see him everyday on the public transport. I feel so dumb for crying about something so dumb. I feel so dumb that only now I really regret that I didn't do something about my grades. I feel dumb.

It's just that I never experienced losing such a good friendship. I know that people separate over time and that these thing just happen but i'm still sobbing as I write these sentences. Normally I would ask him/them for help. My parents don't really understand me and are more worried that I don't get bullied or something idk.

But hey CryBaby technically u can still see him everyday and can talk to him. Yes of course but it just isn't the same as going day by day with someone. We both haven't got any time to do a hobby together or just meet and talk. I don't even know if he feels the same as me. All the other kids in my new class are somewhat loud and extremely childish (I'm also a child ik). They are completely different and we share no interests (We've still got a good relation but it isn't really that deep). Every single day just seems so long and weird. I feel sick and I hope that I don't withdraw myself to much and spiral down into something bad.

I don't think I will ever get a friend that good again. 
I never experienced this.
I don't really know how to handle this situation.

942,"Hello peeps, using a throwaway because idk how is this going to help me. It's a vent more than asking for advice because I really do know hows life going to turn out to be in the next couple of days.

I belong to a lower middle class family in India and have been going to college here in one of the most expensive Universities in Delhi. I had two years of scholarship and the course is of 4 years. I had the scholarship awarded to me because although I wasn't very good at studies. I was good at sports. There's a thing called sports quota here in India. 

Yeah you guessed it right. It's this stupid monstrosity of a career we call engineering. 
I was very adamant in pursuing it (still am) and earlier in my life I had the idea that let the first two years pass away I would easily get a student's loan to pay for the remaining two years. 

Last year I fell sick to dengue and it was painful as hell. It all happened so quickly and guess when did it happen. Just before the semester exams. My fucked up luck always works in mysterious ways. 

Due to that I couldn't score well in the exams and that is why now any bank or student loan entity isn't willing to help me get a student loan. They really do not care whatever your situation was. 

Anyway fast forward to a month ago. I was called in by the college office and was told that if I do not pay my tuition fees I wouldn't be allowed to sit for the exams. Hence I'll have to repeat the year once again(and one year of scholarship goes down the drain) This is fucked up. I do not know what to do and my parents adviced me not to study in the first place because we couldn't afford it. It's true that the poor should stay poor and the rich. Well the rich stay rich.  I literally have seen students in my university have handbags more expensive than my entire clothes collection. Life is just plain stupid. But I wouldn't blame those kids. Everyone is privileged in their own way. I was privileged with the sports quota for example. Anyway so now I get fucked in the most unromantic way in the coming days and there is nothing I can do about it.

We try to separate them by putting one in the only cage we have. Afterwords they are friends again.

They can escalate and start fighting each other by biting the legs, neck, and tail. The problem is (problem?) the smaller one takes all the abuse. His neck is caked in scabs, he limps because of an injured leg, and as of today his tail has been affixed to either down or halfway up.

The fridge is a total mess too. Theres days old stale food and weeks old cups of bubble tea and months old cartons of milk. 

I try to keep some of the spaces clean but its getting too much for me. I sent a message to our group chat last week recommending that we clean out the fridge, and one of my roommates did, but the other still hasnt.

Another issue is that I'm afraid they'll respond by saying ""well you dont keep things clean either"", which is partly true. I'm guilty of leaving things in the sink occasionally for a few days but its pretty uncommon. I also leave dishes in the living room, but never for more than a day.

948,"I've always found myself struggling to concentrate on a task and I get bored really quickly, but I never thought much about it and didn't consider possibility of having any kind of disorder.
At school I had great teachers and classmates, who were willing to help, so I was able to graduate with good marks and get into university. 
My first year at the university was relatively easy, because I knew a lot of stuff already, but since then it has gotten much harder and my GPA has been decreasing every session.
I see that a lot of my peers put time into studying more effectively than I do, but I dont feel like I can change how I spend my time for the better. Sometimes when I study I can subconsciously switch to doing something else and then remember what I was doing originally. I like my program, so the problem is not that I am not interested in subject, I just find it hard to be focused on something for a period of time. I can spend 15 minutes doing a math problem and then switch to writing a program only to get back to doing math in 10 minutes. This kind of approach doesnt work very well when I'm doing assignments and doesn't work completely when I need to study for a particular exam(that's what I have to do right now btw).
I've also noticed that I often find time allocated for the exam too small, even when my classmates don't. It's like it makes me a bit more time to wrap my mind about certain things. 
In the middle of the third year I failed 2 important courses for the first time, as a result I had a period of time when I felt depressed and anxious about my degree, but with the help of people around me I've got better. Since then I've been asking myself what can I do to improve my results. 

I am 20 years old and now starting my 4th year at the university, my original plan was to graduate after this year, but since I failed some of the courses last year, I will have to spend additionally at least half a year in the university. I know, that usually learning difficulties are detected and treated a lot earlier in life, so I'm not sure what can be done in my case.  Can I be checked for learning disability and if yes, then how? If I am diagnosed with learning disability, how will it affect my future? Do people with learning disabilities have trouble finding a job after they graduate? I can see why employers won't be interested in hiring someone who requires some more time to do a certain task than an average person for a job.

I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and I said 30th November then Sam bubbly pointed up with both hands saying ‘mines 21st’ and then sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays...are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted triggered  like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed/serious a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

956,"Ok so this happened this morning after an emotional loss last week on Friday (my wife and I suffered a miscarriage) and this was her first day back to work. She occasionally works the kid drop off lane at an exclusive gifted and talented k-8 school.  There is always drama caused by parents from verbal altercations to actual attempts of assault with vehicles and this morning my wife was a victim of such an incident. 

Here are the drop off rules:
Stay in your car until and pull all the way through to the end of the lot where there is a designated cone to drop off your kiddos. The process is tedious but it’s the fastest safest way for everyone to get to school.

You can’t stop prior to the cone as there is a long line of cars (parents dropping off kiddos) and stopping causes exits to be blocked along with crosswalks unable to be accessed but the major issue is traffic being blocked to a Main Street causing a huge cluster and a nightmare for safety especially for kids walking to school. 

So my wife who was already in a emotional state this morning because she has to break the news that we are no longer expecting to her colleagues who were all thrilled to hear we were pregnant. She was in the rotation for morning duty when a parent driving a Tesla SUV stops midway in the parking lot right in front of my wife and opens the gull wing doors to let her son out at the same time jamming up the 50+ other parents and cars behind her. 

This is my wife’s responsibility to keep the line moving ensuring the safety of kids. She politely asks the parent to please pull to the end in the designated spot for drop off and apologizes for the policy but reminds her it’s for the safety of children, the parent interrupts her stating her son shouldn’t have to walk that far because he is scared(it’s 40ft from the drop to the front door) and asks my wife who the hell she thinks she is telling her what to do? My wife begins to apologize again for the policy but before she could finish the parent asked her son to get out and told my wife to move before she closes the door on her head. As soon as the kiddo exited she hit the button to close the door, hitting my wife in the head with the door and swerved into my wife brushing the side of the car against her almost knocking her down. The parent floors it but is blocked by the other parents following the rules and then approached by the principal after several witnesses (parents and teachers) brought it to the principals attention. 

The cops were called my wife had only minor injuries and the cops charged the parent with harassment and said she couldn’t come back on school grounds? Not assault as there wasn’t enough evidence to pursue it. This parent is a psycho.... my wife is dealing with way too much and isn’t a confrontational or violent person and is in fear of retaliation from this individual. I’m beyond raging pissed and want to push for an assault charge and protection agreement against this parent. It could be just the anger but what should I do? What can I do? Should I let it go and let the cops and school deal with it or should I push for actual justice.

Although, I pretty much pay for EVERYTHING for my daughter and I besides mortgage and car insurance. I work 35 hours a week to afford daycare.

There are nights that I just want to end my life entirely. I am so beaten down. I cannot go into a behavioral science unit due to my daughter. I can't afford a councilor or therapist. When I talk to people about this I feel like a whiney brat. 

Someone can only take so much emotional abuse, right? 
My daughter is the only thing keeping me going right now. 

Please offer advice, anything, please.

TLDR; My parents insult and yell at me every night, but I cannot afford to move out. Please help.",19Aug2019,1
978,"So my girlfriend of about 1 month now, I knew her for 5 months befofehand, has problems with depression and other stuff but I recently found out something new. All of a sudden for about 4 days now she won't touch me, she explained after the first day that it started that she has been molested and raped when she was younger. She never got help and the ones who did it got away free. Well she's been dealing with it since and has episodes where she is repulsed by being touched. She was sleeping in my bed and now she sleeps in the Living room, won't hold my hand, kiss, etc. I understand why that is but I got to say it really hurts. Like I know this is super selfish and I tell her I understand why and it's ok but I can't help but feel sad and hurt. Like in my head I know I shouldn't be but my heart still hurts. What should I do in this situation?",19Aug2019,3
