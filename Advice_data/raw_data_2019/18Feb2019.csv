1,"So i am a wholesaler i don‚Äôt know Americans still have that honestly. In third world countries i believe it‚Äôs common. So basically my job is to travel around and create customers out of retail companies(they will buy my good to sell to common consumers).

I met one customer who has a lot of connections in a consumer line that my company normally doesn‚Äôt deal with. I thought i hit a jackpot here, because i am opening doors that have never been considered before.

She likes my goods and we finalized a sale with her connections and her herself. 

Now if you think i am being vague on the details i am doing this purposely.

The brunt of it, as the title says, is that she insulted me big time. Something totally uncalled for but at the same time we became as comfortable with each other as a customer/consumer relationship goes. So i can understand why she had the nerve to say it. I on the other hand have no respect for those who do not respect me back and when i heard what she said i said something i should never say to a buying customer.

I disrespected her professionalism and I managed to downplay in a very bad way the fact that she herself was opening me up to a market i‚Äôve never had the ability to enter before.

I believed i fucked up big time at first, but now that i look back on it i think i did the right thing respecting myself rather than taking that insult and walking it off. 

Disclaimer: her comment was not sexual.

I know i haven‚Äôt been very specific but I‚Äôd like to know how i could make this better and reestablish a strong working relationship, or should i just cut my losses and keep my pride.

TL:DR A a keystone in an entire market and I had a fight. Starting from her insult in which i fired back. Now we are not on good terms. Apologize or stand tall? ",18Feb2019,1
3,"So I have a friend who asked me to move in with him and I am having a hard time decide if it is a good idea. 

&amp;#x200B;

Currently I live in a 3 bedroom town home with my brother and my cousin. It's been a pretty decent situation other than my cousin doesn't always pay his utilities on time. Sometimes he can't pay rent right away either. I told him that I can't have him being late with rent anymore and so far he has been good about it. Although I'm worried because he lost a job recently because of some medical issues. He has had a few interviews so I guess I will see how it goes. He also owes me some money for helping him with his car repairs, he's had a rough life so I've been trying to help him get back on his feet.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess the pros of moving would be not having to deal with my cousin too much anymore. Another pro would be I'd be in a bigger town so maybe I would have an easier time making new friends and there could be much more activities. I don't necessarily live in a small town, but it is smaller than the town I would be moving to.  

&amp;#x200B;

The cons would be that the rent would be doubled. I have pretty cheap rent now because I live in a smaller town and have two roommates.  My living space would be quite a bit smaller. We live in a pretty big place now with a kitchen laundry room, living room a ton of closets and 3 stories and 2 bathrooms. In the new place I would be living in a one story apartment, smaller room and not a ton of closet space. Also there is only one bathroom. I imagine it will be harder to get my money back from my cousin when we would live an hour away from each other.

&amp;#x200B;

My cousin has been paying me back slowly, it's just a pain because he doesn't keep jobs for very long. Although this last job he really liked and he lost it because he had medical issues and wasn't able to be at work as often as when he was healthy. ",18Feb2019,1

I have savings to support me for a while, but I'm struggling finding employment that pays well, gives me good experience, and helps me grow &amp; contribute to the IT world. My finances are a mess and I've been backed up into a corner mostly. 

My options are to work my absolute hardest (still am!) on job hunting and go above and over the competition, start freelancing, or join the military. I don't mind the first two options, but the military just doesn't sit well with me. I'm afraid of how much of a commitment it is, and I feel like I won't ever have time for my hobbies at all. My family also thinks I wouldn't survive. I know that beggars can't be choosers, but I at least want to explore all my options instead of just giving up.

24,"So this is a long post because I‚Äôm opening up about a lot of things that I‚Äôm scared to tell people I know in real life.

 I‚Äôm a second year student in college (guy) and when I was a kid my parents were always working until late at night so I would be at home by myself everyday until around 7pm when my mom would get home (my parents‚Äô family friend would drive me home after school. ) Once my mom would get home she would start yelling at me for no apparent reasons (stress I‚Äôm guessing) and then I would go up to my room and sit there alone.  Because I lived so far away from everyone I didn‚Äôt hang out with many people after school and some of the friends I had left me for ¬´¬†cooler¬†¬ª people. As a result I‚Äôm extremely distant with people and have a lot of trust issues because I‚Äôm skeptical if people are actually nice or if they‚Äôre just trying to take advantage of me.

Nonetheless, I went to college and the first year I didn‚Äôt make any friends. I was out of state, didn‚Äôt know anyone and had somewhat of a really bad culture shock but I didn‚Äôt call my family because as you know now my mom would pick fights with me and I barely interacted with my dad my entire life. I fell into a deep depression and I started carelessly meeting up with random girls from tinder to have sex, walking around sketchy parts of the city extremely late at night alone and smoking weed and cigarettes until randomly in the spring I felt way better and my energy came back.

This year starts and I fortunately meet some potential friends. I still keep my distance, but they‚Äôre great people and I‚Äôm slowly becoming more comfortable with them. I still walk around late and do more adventurous things and I‚Äôve cut back on weed and cigs, but I stopped using tinder after meeting this girl named Ruby. I haven‚Äôt met a girl since the beginning of highschool that I really wanted to date until I met her around September.

We really hit it off and things were going super well but then after a while she stopped responding to my texts because I‚Äôm assuming I was too clingy. This really hurt me, but I really don‚Äôt like opening up and expressing emotions like this to friends unless they‚Äôre really close to me so I just kind of internalized it like I usually do and felt depressed about it until about a month ago.

All of the sudden I started feeling super good about myself again (this is what happened last year) and my energy came back at full force, almost like a drug. But a few days ago I started to feel that depressed feeling coming back and I‚Äôve been having an overbearing fear of being alone. I just want someone to hold and cuddle with and  it‚Äôs making me feel extremely sad knowing I don‚Äôt have anyone. I‚Äôm thinking of downloading tinder again but I know I won‚Äôt find anything meaningful on there. If there‚Äôs any advice for me please let me know.

I asked her if I could get vaccinated and she told me that she didn't approve but she'd look into it. Unfortunately, that was last year, and it doesn't seem like there's been much progression in the whole 'getting the child vaccinated' thing.

32,"I don't want to die, but I feel I have nothing to live for and am not living. 

I'm about to turn 36 and I've nothing to show for my life.  
As a woman there is the additional sting of growing older.

I'm single and don't see that changing any time soon because I don't even get to meet any men, this also means no children - I'm in survival mode so in a way it's not a priority right now, but it's not like I have time and I know not having a child will be the biggest regret of my life.  Womens purpose isn't just to be moms, but I'm not sure what other value my life will have and it seems to me people accept transitioning into middle age as they move onto their next stage of their lives - I can't just continue as I always have, I need something of substance to my life going into middle age and beyond.

I'm long-term unemployed, my disabilities make it impossible for me to job search and the roles I'd go into are so niche they're hard to find, I need support to help me back into work but that support doesn't exist - what help I do get...they don't really help at all, for the most part I'm doing everything right (I volunteer, I have a great CV, when I do apply for jobs I get interviews and good feedback) also I often find I know more about employability than those employed to help me. 

As I'm unemployed I have a lot of time on my hands but no money to do anything.

Worse again is that I have no friends at all - due to bad breakup I lost all my friends and my social life. I've no money to get out much and no hobbies to try to meet people, I do keep trying different things but nothing seems to stick and no matter where I go everyone already seems to have friends so aren't interested in making another friend. I'm terrible at making friends even at the bet of times but I'm finding it even harder lately, because I suffer depression and have no life I'm hardly someone people would want to be friends with. I have all this spare time and end-up feeling suicidal as I'm tuck with nothing but my thoughts, I try to find ways to get out the house but there's so little to do locally and I just really struggle to do what little I can find...it's so soul sucking to go places in hope that somehow you'll magically make friends.

I'm basically stuck in a rut and have been for ten years.

As I see it right now: 

A. At my age it's harder to find friends, most people settle into home lives with their existing friends or partner and that's that, it feels like I have to give up anything I might have enjoyed in my twenties like clubbing and accept a boring life. Is this my life from now on? If I won't get to have a family or a social life, is my life just another few decades of this misery? 

B. My depression is slowly killing me, this hasn't changed for ten years - is depression even something that can go away? My depression is due to my life, as I see it depression won't improve until my life improves but my depression stops that from happening as even the basic day-to-day is draining...it feels too difficult to even try to dig myself out of depression.

Friday evening, I took my car into Walmart to get the oil changed and two new tires for the front so I can have better traction. I paid for the work and drove off. I got on the interstate to go back home.

Friday afternoon he was taken into an intensive care ward, and throughout the night stopped breathing numerous times, so he was put onto a ventilator to breathe for him and put to sleep to help with this. He's been like this since and still doesn't seem to be getting any better. The doctors have diagnosed it so far as a severe case of Influenza A and flu-induced pnuemonia.

They're all quite religious so there is a good support network around them but I'm still really concerned about how we're all going to cope over the next few days. My dad was pretty much the rock of the family and without him we're definitely going to struggle.

Until today, I‚Äôve felt no urgency as I‚Äôve become cemented in the unemployed life, as I game away 95% of my time, with 5% for going out for weekly low commitment ECs, groceries, and chores. As I become more engrossed in unreality, the more I‚Äôve avoided SDN and Premeddit. As if I am the embodiment of low commitment, I also take a long time to reply to professional e-mails and inquiries. 

And maybe, I‚Äôm not all that enamored by medicine. I was grossed out by the rat dissection in biology lab. Although science and math are cool, some processes in the world can be unappetizing. I shunned learning Spanish when it would most likely help navigate one of the biggest minority cultures here. I went through EMT stuff but that didn‚Äôt jive with me and I‚Äôve avoided working as one. My research was only for resume purposes. ECs feel like a chore the more time I spent. Instead of working on improving so I can reapply ASAP or getting a job, I just game and maybe meme about my shut-in-self. Meanwhile, things that matter for adult life like my credit score have taken a sharp descent. And I didn‚Äôt care. Rather, I imagined calling to troll whatever institutions oversee and deal with my credit score, all to see if I could lower my credit score further like a jackass.

All I want is to be able to sustain myself and my personal life later on. A stable 6-figure paycheck, normal shifts, and lax hours is the utopian dream. If I could press a red button every minute all day and receive that sort of compensation, I‚Äôd do it since I learned from gaming that I can enjoy mindless grinding. My perspectives could be biased, even deluded but I don‚Äôt know if I have the time to shadow every job that might fit my criteria. Computer science? I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm interested in learning those languages and coding. Dentistry? The floor for entry APPEARS a lower than that for medical school, the investment return for pay + lifestyle are pretty good (n = 1). Research? Boring meh. Artsy stuff? I enjoy creative hobbies but seems too subjective and investment return will most likely be low even if enjoyable. I also love exercising but that doesn‚Äôt mean I should make a career out of athleticism. Law school? Not sure, floor for entry even at some of the T14 also APPEARS lower compared to med school, but the writing makes me hesitate even if IP law is doable for science majors. Besides, you have to be ahead of the curve to be employable. Being at the bottom of your class at a T14 JD seems risky. Teaching at any capacity? Maybe, but the stuff you might deal with as a teacher or professor also make me pause. For schooling up until high school, summers seem relaxed. Business or cubicle work? Seems like some places are rife with politics and drama. And honestly, my social persuasion skills and charisma are nonexistent. 

My parents and relatives have recently urged me at least to get some regular income (whether full or part time) and decide my career path by the end of this month before they just give up and label me like some failed cookie recipe (aka if not kicked out with no help of any kind, erased from the matter of painful conversations with my parents‚Äô coworkers, relatives, and friends). That means I‚Äôll have to decide IF I should still reapply for med and if yes, when. If not med, then what other options. And with my nonexistent real-world working experience and my EQ just bested by a pencil‚Äôs, find a job and be a normal adult. Even that seems easier for a cucumber.

(TL;DR) So here I am. Good on paper, but bad in practice and everything else. 

Problems: I don‚Äôt know where to begin for the paycheck now, where to look for my future career, and how to build character or be a well-adjusted adult human being.

Solutions: not found.

I appreciate your time taken to read my rambling, unstructured post (where like the meme-able POTUS, I interject myself, forget things, circle myself, and possibly contradict myself) and your two cents if offered. 

I‚Äôd also accept any diagnoses for neurodegeneration since as I‚Äôve gotten older these past 11 years since 8th grade, I‚Äôve become more prone to forgetting stuff, verbal mishaps and miscommunications, and just lower overall IQ probably. Or it's all in my head, who knows. I don't even know who I am.

This started today. I wanted to tutor for math, but I signed up too late, and ended up tutoring for Language Arts instead. 


Today was the first ‚Äúsession‚Äù. I tutored a kid in 3rd grade, and it was sort of awkward. I could tell he was bored. I was also bored. The session ends and after I leave, I tell my mom that I don‚Äôt want to keep on tutoring because I don‚Äôt really like it.


The problem is, before my mom got the chance to contact the organization to cancel, the kid‚Äôs mom tells my mom that he really liked me as a tutor.

51,"I'm having a bit life crisis, thought it might be good to get some thoughts/advice from redditors.

my life in a few bullet points.

I grew up in a major city in Australia (a bubble), silver spoon in mouth. good grades in stem, international awards in competitions 

Parents thought to send me to Stanford, studied a topic in the hard sciences, loved it, got good grades though, parents ran out of money, spent 7 years total working and studying to get my degree. Feel like there was a lot of time wasted. Perservered.

Married my gf during my struggles, we struggled together, at our lowest we were \~$180k in debt, the two of us, in a tiny hotbox with a mattress on the floor. She is the most beautiful, smart, caring and loving person i have ever met - i am blessed

Started PhD (another top University in Boston), turned out my entire PhD project was built on some kids data that he fudged to publish, supervisor in denial even with proof of the kids own raw data. Another 3 years wasted. Sick of academia and all the politics, perspective of the world shifted again - science is not the higher truth i once held it to be. Contemplating quitting.

My wife is patient and supportive, she's saved up a nest for us (\~$250k net usd) I've also been able to contribute by investing (lucky with crypto, good with rotating portfolio) and some scripting python algorithm for scalping the stock market/forex. Currently shifted porfolio and banking on deleveraging (there must be consequences to such a long period of zero interest rate policy), but who knows when/if it'll happen?

My wife wants to have a family, I'm in a bit of a crisis mode - can't help but feel like I'm a worthless piece of shit. Feeling inadequate from my failure to launch my career and needing to look sideways (I've started teaching myself machine learning and some scripting languages). Depression is taking hold, it's finding its way into the home too (can't seem to compartmentalize what's happening in this PhD), 

Mentally broken these days. I botch my interviews, in one interview blurted out all of the crap above at a partner interview at a major management consulting firm. I can't keep my shit together

I want to feel like a young man again with drive.
To people who got off of them: How did you do it? What were you taking? How long did the withdrawal last? 

Timeline/History of med dosage: 

8th grade/

2014: When I first got onto my medication I was put on 40mg of Celexa.  

Freshman into Sophmore/

2015 summer: Thought I was better, completely quit cold turkey; lead to bad withdrawal and depression like symptoms.

Sophmore year/

2015 fall: got back on them. 40mg

Junior year/

2017 spring: Decided I was ready to cut my dose in half. Went down to 20mg. Lead to severe withdrawal with suicidal thoughts, but eventually overcame it

Senior HS/ Freshman College/

2017 fall-2019 now: officially stable and mentally healthy. Happier than I‚Äôve ever been. I occasionally get down on myself or get a panic attack here and there, but not as bad. I see my therapist at least once a month.

I felt like I really overstayed my welcome too many times now to get away from my home so I've had to stay most times.

background-tl;dr at the end]

We met back in 2015, and grew extremely close in 2016/2017. We knew everything about each other, and I was at her house a lot, to the point where it was weird if more than a week went by between us hanging out. Her family got to know me, I helped her raise a kitten her family adopted, and overall, we were quite the duo. We had a fight in the summer of 2017, but it was quickly blown over as it came from a misunderstanding.

In 2018, she got a significant other, and shit began to hit the fan. She never had time to text or call, and even our constant hanging out began to die out. I felt pushed to the side, but I decided to chill out with it; she really loved her partner and I didn‚Äôt want to fuck it up by acting out, even if I did feel ignored. It all came to a climax, though, in April, after we went to an event together with the significant other and, due to miscommunication in planning, I ended up alone in a major city for twelve hours. I was fifteen at the time, and as a young girl alone an hour away from home, it was fucking terrifying. 
I went home that night and told my sister what happened, and she took the initiative to text my friend because she knew I‚Äôd just try to let it slide in order to keep my friend happy. A huge argument erupted, parents got involved, and it was a wreck. I took all of the blame at the end in order to try to make everything calm down.

It did eventually cool down, but ever since, we haven‚Äôt been as close. I started hanging out with others, mainly because I was constantly reminded of the fight when I was around her. She doesn‚Äôt really have any other friends at our school, and retreated to her internet friends. We were both busy over the summer, and by the time school came around in the fall, we just didn‚Äôt click anymore. It hurt to be around her; I was [and still am] a bit bitter at her refusal to take any blame for any of the fights she had, or to even hear my side of it, to the point where she‚Äôs still with the partner who was an aspect of the causation of the fight in April and has said quite a few rude things about me. I know that I fucked up, and I accepted it, apologizing to her over and over again, and it just seems like she can‚Äôt accept that she messed up as well.

We only have one class together this year, and we have lunch every day, but there‚Äôs always other people. We haven‚Äôt been alone in months, and I haven‚Äôt been over to her house since December. 

I do miss her, of course, but I‚Äôm not sure if I miss her now, or the relationship we used to have. I don‚Äôt even know how we‚Äôd be if we grew as close as we used to be; I feel like I‚Äôd be walking on eggshells in order to make sure we don‚Äôt fight again. It constantly felt like everything was my fault, that I always fucked up, and she was a perfect person who had to deal with it.

She texted me that she misses me, and I just have no idea what to say. Saying that I miss her feels like a half-lie, but saying anything else also feels like I‚Äôm not telling the truth. 

tl;dr-extremely close best friends in 2015/2016/2017, had a fight in spring 2018 where shit hit the fan and there‚Äôs still bitterness, at least on my part..

I spend more than half my day at work, and having the right boss with the right guidance and mentorship is so important. I've had such shitty bosses in the past, who verbally mistreat employees, gaslight (frequently), and provide no guidance for the employees' discernible future. 

Seriously, what do I do?

76,"So, I have an issue.


Let's get this out of the way so I can be judged: I'm a 32yr old, 330lb woman. (Insert fat jokes and fat people abuse here, ugly tits, any roll is a goal etc)


I have like, no libido when I'm with a partner. Usually less so by myself, except when bored. Watching porn with a partner to get going? Fuck no, it's uninteresting and makes me insecure as fuck. I find porn disingenuine anyway. Watching porn by myself? BORING. I don't do animated stuff, either.


Now, granted, I can get off if I'm into it, porn, partner, alone etc. If I'm not, or I lose interest, it ain't happenin'. I get severely uncomfortable sometimes watching kissing scenes or sex scenes in movies and film, for fuck's sake. I'm not a prude. I'm actually quite kinky.


Trouble is...well, to be frank, I'm not sure what the trouble is. Before we suggest diet weight loss, stop. That only gets a person so far when it comes to hormone regulation, and I've been doing Keto and Fasting to drop weight. Yay 11lbs in a month. It isn't helping.


I think it's a psychological issue. Why? Because from the time I was 4 years old, I knew what sex was, and knew that touching myself felt good. I remember fooling around with my twin brother when we were kids. He denies it to this day, but he remembers as well.


NO child should know the word sex, or what sex is at *4 years old*. I was obsessed with my body, relationships, and sex all the way into my adult life, up until I turned 30.


I used sex in my 20s to get men to like me, or want to date me, or find me interesting, and I thought it was all men wanted. I also thought it was how you were supposed to show love towards them to ""keep them"".


BOY WAS I WRONG.


I found that out the hard way when I was 20: Was with a guy who I thought loved me. He raped me. I got pregnant. Mother wouldn't let me about and she withheld my SSI. I'm mentally disabled, you see. I was forced to have a very painful, drug free birth. 


3 weeks after my kid was born, I let a drunk friend stay in my dorm room to get sober and drive home in the morning. Woke up to him raping me. Apparently, I'm a magnet for psycho men, because I'm pathetic, and ""easy"", and ""desperate"".


So now I'm psychologically scarred, and I don't know in what way. 



Whyyyyyyyyyy can't I get aroused watching porn? I used to in my 20s and when I was younger. Why is sex so uncomfortable? What the FUCK is wrong with me? And, lastly, what the fuck can I do about it?




Thanks for your time.",18Feb2019,2
77,"I have always wanted to date but I never felt comfortable. I turned down girls who asked me out. I never wanted anyone to value me. But it has been years since someone directly asked me out.

I had a nervous breakdown and went to kink events and even saw an orgy happen. But the uncomfortable sensation was still there: my lack of experience and my unworthiness.

Even at these events people found me to be really attractive but I just froze. If they knew my secret, how in almost 30 years I am still a virgin, I would have most likely been shunned from the community.

How big of a red flag is it to be a virgin at my age due to my insecurities? I am also not religious, I live with my parents, and I have no job.

I am just so insecure about someone finding value in me for me. It doesn't make sense.

So, my attitude use to be very nice and patient, but it is like I have no more patience anymore. I have silent rage, I don‚Äôt let out my anger, I‚Äôm still calm, but just, quicker to anger lately. For example, video games, something I use to laugh at and enjoy now, I don‚Äôt laugh I don‚Äôt enjoy them as much and I get angrier at them for no reason. I use to be happy all the time no matter what, it‚Äôs just like my anger has gotten worse. When I‚Äôm angry, my sentences are short and I just have this angry face.

My stress this year, has been so bad. School has me coming home crying, having mental breakdowns, higher anxiety, and I‚Äôve never had any of these because of school. I maintain all ‚ÄúA‚Äôs‚Äù besides Pre-Calculus, which is a ‚ÄúD‚Äù, and I hate myself for it. I try, I watch videos, but it doesn‚Äôt work. Ever since this semester started in January, there‚Äôs been so much to do, and every year besides this has been easier for me. My classmates even agree that they are throwing everything at us at once, and I use to love school but now I can‚Äôt even stand showing up so I skip a lot, and even catch up at home just to avoid showing up.

When I get home, I just sit down in my bed and have 0 energy. I can‚Äôt even bare turning on my pc because all my stress just wants me to sleep and die. I‚Äôm not depressed, I refuse to even consider myself depressed because I could have it a lot worse. I‚Äôm blessed, but I‚Äôm just so out of it.

I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I‚Äôm literally at a dead end. This weekend has been good, but I‚Äôm still suffering most of these issues. During the weekdays is when it‚Äôs always happening, my life is like it is on repeat. 

{Forgot to mention, I‚Äôm sure I have dyslexia. My word are always mixed up and I struggle writing essays, but still manage great grades, so I‚Äôm not exactly sure if I do. + my memory can‚Äôt remember anything, it gets distracted if I think of something else.

Long story short, my relationship of almost two years ended about 3 weeks ago, due to me becoming increasingly over reliant on the girl and eventually leading to an environment way too toxic for the both of us.

As I was checking their account because I want to know my nieces are not watching things they shouldn't, etc. While I was going thru it, I noticed that there were some sex films on the ""Continue watching"". Some films were Nymphomaniac, The Chosen Ones, Perfume. So, I used the parental control and then called my sister to let her know and so she could have a talk with her kids and/or husband about what they were watching. Instead she just laughed.

She says they won‚Äôt let her get help because ‚Äúshe should read the Bible if she wants to get better.‚Äù
Her parents also believe that a doctor would just prescribe her antidepressants, which they believe are just a sign of a lack of responsibility. They believe that if you‚Äôre truly faithful, god will heal you.
They are allowing her to see a ‚Äúreligious pseudo-therapist‚Äù (her words) about it, but she doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs helping her at all.
Trying to convince her parents with any sort of evidence or logic is really unlikely to work. She could also get in trouble for telling me this.

Everything was going great until his parents found out I was pregnant. His mom had snooped through our room and found a pregnancy test. She then announced to their family by herself about my pregnancy. I was pretty thrown off by that but I continued to give her the benefit of doubt that she is still a good person. My boyfriend's brothers warned me about her and who she is and what she does but again, I chose to ignore it. About a well after they confessed they knew I was pregnant his mother started to act very passive aggressive towards me. She would try to start drama with me but after my boyfriend and I basically yelled at her until she quit, she started to passive aggressively attack my health. Now I have severe asthma and allergies and she's been a long time cigarette smoker. She started to smoke in the house, leave windows and doors open as she smokes outside, started to borrow my boyfriend's car and then proceed to smoke in it with the windows up (mind you this is the car my baby will be coming home in). My boyfriend tried to confront her and his dad but she just blows up Everytime so we are at crossroads here. Well, his mom was just diagnosed with severe lung cancer, heart disease and asthma and you guessed it... She refuses to quit. I tried to close the windows the other day to save me from having my millionth asthma attack this pregnancy and she made the comment ""if you don't like the cigarette smoke in the house than you can just stay in your room"". That comment really sent me over the edge. She's now uninvited to my baby shower and I'm not even sure she should be in my kids life, after all she told my boyfriend twin brother that I'm ""just going to miscarry anyways"".

111,"*** PLEASE READ. Roomie (call her J) older sibling &amp; her sibling SO (also older and out of uni) stayed w us at uni for weekend. SO got so drunk, broke tables, got kicked out of our dinner reservations, threw things around our kitchen. We threw a party that night and suggested the sibling SO did not go to the party due to disturbing behavior. J has hit her sibling before at a uni party, also has hit men before, giving them black eyes. 

J &amp; sibling start to drunkenly scream in our faces infront of the party guests. IÔ∏è silently stand there and calmly suggest to older sibling that she is too old for this, she shouldn‚Äôt want to do this, she is years older. J gets into my face, makes me afraid, telling me to fuck myself and not to come for her. 

During the party, they start to hit the walls and yell at guests, scaring them. They announce to our friend who has struggled w an eating disorder that she heard she starved herself, making her cry. Then say things about my outfit and the way my face looks. J chased the Roomie #2 boyfriend saying ‚ÄúIÔ∏è will beat your ass‚Äù.  J and sibling barge in my room, get in my face, saying very erratic evil things. IÔ∏è got very scared J would hit me. We stop the party and guests leave, we go to friends place to sleep due to not feeling safe. 

We left the house w/o key. J is home and wouldnt open door for us to get our things. Our friends had car keys inside. Roomie #2 SO went to 
house with 3 men due to not feeling safe and no luck. J duct taped the windows shut. We had to call the cops, who saw videos of the night, and called for backup. They broke a window and J wouldnt leave bedroom.

My concern: I don‚Äôt feel safe being around her. IÔ∏è dont want to allow an unstable person to be an inconvenience&amp; burden me, Roomie #2, and our families. Me and Roomie #2 are very close and never raised our voices or screamed at J. Cops told us to call whenever J has an episode. What do IÔ∏è do? Do IÔ∏è sleep there? Or talk to landlord? ",18Feb2019,1

113,"Hi, I (M 23) recently found out my younger sister (F 14) and cousin (F 15) have been stealing makeup from the local Walmart. After confronting them, they claimed it was only a one time thing but my other cousin (F 15) has heard of several prior instances. What can my parents and I say or do that will stop them from continuing this behaviour? Confronting and disciplining them is failing. 

They have no reason to be stealing since both our families are fairly wealthy and have always provided for them to the point where they are incredibly spoiled and entitled. Im afraid they‚Äôre stealing for the thrill of it which will surely and eventually lead to them committing more heinous crimes.

117,"   I spent quite a while trying to phrase this in a proper way but I have just decided to be blunt: I'm going insane.

   My best friend (of 12 years today!) has been in a relationship with a guy (let's call him Anthony) for about 6 months now. I'm happy for her since this is her first romantic relationship she's had. She's also very happy with Anthony and she wants him to go to prom with our group of friends and even go to college with her. They seem to be doing well. But I'm not.

   We know that Anthony is a clinical sociopath. He and my brother used to talk and Anthony confided in my brother that he was clinically diagnosed as a sociopath years back. Me and my brother warned my friend but she dated him anyway (""I'll give him a chance! He could connect with me!"").

   I hate it. Don't get me wrong, I'm not jealous that they are together (I'm a straight girl and I'm fine being single). I don't like the fact that she's dating *him*. And now I feel like I'm slipping from reality.

   I'm obsessing over getting rid of this guy. I hate him with a passion (I sound like the overprotective crazy friend stereotype from a crappy rom-com or something, I know). He's a sociopath and he'll do nothing but hurt her. He's going to tear her apart one day and never even look back. He doesn't truly care about her in a deep way. He's going to find her weakness and exploit her and leave her with nothing. She's a game to him. Just a play toy. All the emotions that he displays are shallow and ugly. That's what they are and she knows this but she still doesn't listen.

   I wish I could just kill him. I wish I could strangle him or curbstomp him or gut him. I keep thinking about ways that I could. I have detailed daydreams about how I could get rid of him and save the both of us. I don't just want him out of our lives but I want him *dead*.

   And I've been like this for months now. Every time I hear about or see Anthony, I get so pissed. We even got in two physical fights for no sane reason other than how he was speaking to me or how he looked at me and I let him know how I felt.

   It doesn't make sense why I want him to die. He hasn't done anything particularly heinous. Sure, they've gotten in arguments, but that's expected of any relationship. But I just hate sociopaths. I hear about them on TV and the media and I see how easily people fall into the trap. It makes me sick...

   I don't want her to be manipulated. I don't want to be manipulated. I don't want anyone else to be. I want him six feet under. And I need help. 

**What is wrong with me? How can I get rid of this feeling?**

***Here's my question (tl;dr):*** I'm going insane over getting rid of my best friend's sociopathic boyfriend. What's wrong with me? How do I stop feeling this?",18Feb2019,2
118,"He's 21. I'm 18. He worked where be worked before I did but just recently got hired back in about a month or so ago. Since meeting him I've really started to like him. He's my type. He likes to talk, joke around, has a good personality, and also has goals. 

We talk. I'd consider us to be work friends but sometimes I just can't help but feel like I'm annoying. When I like people or am comfortable with them I tend to talk a lot and sometimes I feel like I'm just too much.

About two weeks ago there was chaos at work. My crush almost got stabbed by a customer. He went off on our supervisor for not responding quick enough and almost got fired. It pissed me off so I reached out to him online and let him know id be willing to defend him to our manager because what happened was ridiculous. He ended up not getting fired thankfully and didn't see my message until days later after I let him know about it. We added eacgotver. Exchange a few texts every now &amp; then. He randomly sent me a picture of him and his friends dog a few days ago. Lol. As a result of the chaos that happened at work he no longer works nights because he refuses to work with the supervisor. Since I work nights we don't work together as much. It's a long story. 

When we do work together he'll jokingly mimic me, randomly throw things at me or to me. We both joke around a lot. He does like to joke around with mostly everyone so I don't take it as flirting.  His sense of humor is definitely not everyone's cup of tea. I understand because  sometimes it's the same way for me. He'll say things as a joke but since I like him it kinda  stings but usually I just joke around back. A few days ago he told me to feel his shoulder because it's injured in some way and when I did he put his hand over mine to put it where he wanted me to feel. He calls me by a shortened name.  He laughs a lot and is on the touchier side but that just might be his personality. When doing trash with me at once something came back and almost hit us but he said ""as long as it didn't hit you I'm good"" but it's weird how he'll go from that to making semi harsh jokes. I play along so he doesn't know it bothers me sometimes. He'll go from being super talkative and open to just treating me lime everyone else. I'm aware of some personal issues he's going through.

Tonight I sent him something I saw that reminded me of something said at work but he left me on seen. He doesn't have a girlfriend but I've heard him tell other people about dates he went on. None of our coworkers with the exception of a few I'm close to know how I feel.  He may have caught on to the fact I like him but I didn't want him to because I genuinely don't feel like I have a chance with him.

Anyways, I've been thinking about him a lot. It's became a distraction for me at work. It can be fun but at times when things aren't going right it just makes me sad. I don't crush very often but when I do it's hard. I know people are going to tell me that I should just tell him how I feel but I can't get the courage up to do it and I just don't see him feeling the same way.

I know dating co-workers isn't a good idea. This isn't a career for either of us. He talks about leaving a lot aswell. It just sucks having strong feelings for someone and one sided expectations are leaving me disappointed and feeling down. I really like him. I want to move on but it's easier said than done.  This post was a mess but it's hard to explain the situation. I'm happy when we're talking and joking around. Now since we don't work together as often because of different availability I'm sad because we see each other less. 

Thanks in advance.

I developed feelings, he didn‚Äôt develop any, and then the emotional tension started. I felt like, how could you lead me on like this, and he didn‚Äôt think anything of it. Went on with our lives but began to become friends. Friendship grew over the year and eventually became quite comfortable around each other. Note that we‚Äôve done everything except actual intercourse. He just doesn‚Äôt have sex with people unless he‚Äôs serious. 

My thing is, he‚Äôs told me that he‚Äôs had feelings for me but just knew it wouldn‚Äôt work our long term (we are polar opposites). But the weird thing is how we continue to hangout and have a great time. He used to be opposed to cuddling but now asks me to come snuggle with him. I know it sounds terribly immature at my age to even be asking this, but I‚Äôm questioning whether or not he could possible be developing actual feelings, or not even be aware of it? I know for a fact he doesn‚Äôt hang out with other females ‚Äî all his friends are male ‚Äî and he‚Äôs very shy and doesn‚Äôt exactly open up to people easily. He‚Äôs said things to me like, ‚ÄúI feel comfortable around you‚Äù and has commented on things about me he admires.

Could he possibly like me and not realize it? Do I continue hoping something will blossom and change?

Im in high school, have few close friends but close ones are good ones (all but one is an ass sometimes albeit), like this girl who ive known for a long time, ive got severe anxiety and am horribly socially awkward, grades are average to sub par.  

Ok so heres the issue. Because im a social mess and my friends are dicks i keep everything bottled up and cant branch out due to social anxiety/general anxiety. My anxiety is at the point where ill do the strangest things in order to avoid human interaction (Making myself look even more awkward in the process). Essentially im a mess and my life is a mess and i cant talk to anyone about it due to anxiety. But theres this girl I like who ive been friends with for a while. Were not super close but as close as I can get with the whole anxiety thing. The only thing keeping me from becoming full blown depressed is the fact that she may like me. But im too afriad to ask her out or even to hang out due to anxiety and the fact that if she says no the only thing keeping me from becoming depressed will be gone and i feel as if my life may go to shit (Even worse than it is currently.) I just need some advice on what I should do. Sorry if this is laid out horribly im not really used to doing long things like this. Thanks. ",18Feb2019,1

146,"Hi.  I'm a 21 year old female who's had a decent upbringing.  I did well in school (4.0 GPA) and I had a good social life.  When I graduated from high school I moved to a large city and I became a recluse of sorts.  

I have an extremely hard time making friends or talking to people in general.  My social life has been pretty nonexistent and I only have my family or boyfriend to talk to.  This is concerning to me but, the problem truly exists inside my head.  Imagine you're strapped in a chair and you're forced to watch videos or listen to something 24/7; it NEVER stops.  That's how it has always been for me except it got increasingly worse since I've been out of school.

147,"I feel incredibly stupid about this entire thing but it is really important to me

So as a little bit of a background to the issues:
(Me)
I have pretty bad anxiety and depression along with a couple other wonderful things like that and my thoughts and anxiousness seem to worsen at night or when I'm alone (both is a nightmare)
I'm 17 so I still live with my parents 
I've been in a wonderful long distance relationship for a few years now and my partner has been with me through so much and never fails to make me feel safe and calm, even through tough parts of my mental health

(Parents)
Don't believe in my ""made up sickness"" that have been diagnosed by school therapists and brought up by counselors 
Don't really try to understand when I have ever tried to explain or open up to them about anything
Tend to be pretty close-minded
Like to track and control everything I do (to a point where it's too much-I would get wanting to know what your daughter is up to but you have to admit that there is a line, everyone deserves at least a little privacy-I can't even close doors in this house)
*this isn't trying to bash them it's just me trying to get a good point of why the problem is occurring*



Every night I sleep on call with my SO because it feels less like being alone and it's all I can really do atm 
I don't remember when or how this started but it made my nightmares less common and helped me to get better rest without feeling so anxious and having pretty bad thoughts usually (still always a bad day every once in a while but I've been getting better with some work and getting comfortable with how to handle things and opening up)
I thought my parents knew because they track everything and apparently (my mum just recently let it slip) they come into my room quite a bit while I'm sleeping to make sure I'm actually sleeping.

Now, I've never been a rebellious kid of any sorts and I have never done anything to lose their trust (never snuck out, went to parties, did drugs, had alcohol, stole anything, etc.-nor am I interested in any of these things)  Apparently I've just never had it the begin with because they do not allow me to do anything without them being there/tracking whatever it is.

It should be known that I've never been allowed to have anyone over at my house or stay over at anyone's house so it made it hard to keep school friends (nobody wants a friend they can't hang out with without going bowling with both of their parents) so I only have my best friend (who recently moved away) and my SO
My parents are also really quick to punish me even when there's nothing to punish me for
We have this thing we do every day before dinner (a little after lunch time but we don't eat breakfast or lunch together) where we sit with tea in our sitting room and talk for a bit but I don't have a seat because my little sibling broke mine so I end up sitting alone in the next room over on the floor anyways

The problem started a few days ago when it was time for our ""tea and talk time"" (I don't know what to call it) I was a few minutes late so as punishment they took away my internet for 24 hours which would have been fine(ish) I just wouldn't be able to sleep and would be pretty tired and anxious the next day
But they decided that it was going to stay off and haven't allowed me to be on it since (I'm on a shop's internet I'm stopping at and then I'll stop in tomorrow to check back) it's been a few days and I've been so panicky and out of it.  I haven't slept more than a few hours total and I've had so many panic attacks that it doesn't even feel the same It's more like I'm out of energy and I just lay here while I can't breathe I dunno.
It's not that great that I can't sleep alone and I'm not exactly happy this way but when I'm not alone I'm better

My parents have never tried to understand or help me with these kinds of things so I stopped opening up to them because when I would I would just be punished for ""making things up"" and ""being annoying""/""causing too much stress (on them)"" 

I don't know how to make them understand that it's really affecting me (I feel so stupid about this I really wish it wasn't this way but they refused to help me when the nightmares, bad thoughts and panicking weren't that bad and now it's gotten so bad that I'm afraid to be alone)

I just really wish they could let this one thing not be a punishment or at least not punish me for such a little thing as being two minutes late to sit alone for tea.

I'm really sorry this is so long I'm just trying to put everything out and not forget anything
Also sorry if this is a mess I'm exhausted and I can't think I just really wish I could sleep with my SO so I don't end up waking up from a nightmare/in panic constantly.

So recently I made a transition to live with my dad from my mum. My dad is on the on the other side of the country.

Mum said to me that I can move back anytime I wanted to, regardless of her health (when mum was at her worst that's when it was decided I'd live with my dad) like I was saying, I've been here for 2 months and I'm very unhappy. Last night I told dad I wanted to go back and live with my mum because I'm so unhappy. I'm so lonely and miss my friends and school so much. I told him this and he completely lost the plot. He said if I moved back to my mums I'd never see him again and that I'm never allowed to move back to live with her and I honestly don't know what to do.

153,".Hey guys,  
I met this girl at uni, I am the TA in one of her classes and she takes maths with me (long story, she switched majors, takes year 2 maths and freshman industrial design classes). At first she was really nice, she remembered my name perfectly and called me Danny (the short nice version of my full name Daniel) nothing much, we talk a while during class, and she asks me for a little help on some assignments, this is when I find out she had a boyfriend, mkay no biggie, I'll switch to friends mode. Fast forward to last Tuesday, we're in class the freshmen are presenting their projects to the teacher while I'm outside helping the others practise their presentations, she comes up to me and tells me she's very stressed and she might cry (jokingly), I, being the absolutely mature completely normal human that I am told her to go ahead, surprise surprise, she does. I felt like a dick and took her aside to calm her down, she eventually did, went ahead and presented and all was fine and dandy. Now I'm still feeling like a total ass after that and offer her a ride home, in the car she tells me that she broke up with her BF because she was bored and he really didn't love her, I gave her some advice, told her to wait a day and text him again blah blah blah, normal friends mode. We arrive at her place, I had to pick my sister up from school which was nearby in about an hour's time so she invited me in and we chatted for a while. That Friday she texted me and asked me if I was going to a uni party that evening, I was and so she asked if we could carpool I accept, she then asks me if I have plans for dinner, I didn't, we go to dinner, the whole ride she told me how she was doing fine, she texted the guy and he reaffirmed that he, in fact, did not love her anymore, then she tells me about a couple of cute guys she's come across since. We chatted through dinner, then we go for a beer, Its 11 pm now time to head to the party (We are late) A friend texts me that there is no one there and we should just skip it altogether, she still wants to go out so we go dancing at my favourite salsa joint (She loved the place and Is a pretty decent dancer big yes for my part) we end up heading to the uni-party at about 1 am, we stay there for like half an hour and I drive her back home. As I parked I considered whether I should go for a kiss or not, I figure it's only been a week since her breakup and her past relationship was fairly long so I hold back, and hug her goodbye.  
I really like her, she agreed to go to all the places I proposed and was very excited about everything, she always has the cutest smile on her face. What would you do?  
I would usually go for it but considering it her TA and if it goes wrong I'd still have to see her like 3 times a week for the rest of the term I really don't know.

So I‚Äôm a CS student. This semester I‚Äôm taking around 6 classes with 4 stem and 2 geneds. All are low level so it‚Äôs not too bad managing them. I‚Äôm also working as a data analyst for around 6h/week and waiting for a research project response. I don‚Äôt really go out and have some good close friends. I‚Äôm scared that when things get out hand, I might burnout. 

Some background info. I‚Äôm asian so the mindset of working hard has been instilled in my mind since forever. I haven‚Äôt found learning interesting at all until my junior year of high school. I don‚Äôt know what happens but I just find all the subjects are so interesting. The idea of studying and learning just glows inside me. Recently it has been stressful, I don‚Äôt really share with anyone since it‚Äôs not myself to share my feelings since I was a kid. Even when talking to my gf or parents, who are more stressed than me, I just listened and put on a smiley face because I have always been known as the brightest kid and always smiling.  I used to cry a lot in middle school but when I go to high school, I stopped. During winter break, I cry again but mostly because I didn‚Äôt feel like I work hard enough in comparison to my peers. But as soon as I have things to do and learn, I dive into them and forget about how I feel.

I‚Äôm just wondering if it‚Äôs normal to have emotions like this. When I‚Äôm busy, I don‚Äôt process them and just focus on my goals. However, I‚Äôm scared that one day it will come crashing down on me. Even when I fake smiling and hide my emotions, it don‚Äôt really bother me. Thank you for reading such a long post.

158,"So my 2018 ended great, but 2019 has been the worst year of my life and we‚Äôre only in February.

I‚Äôm a 17 year old male in my senior year of high school and I have great friends and a great at home life (in some aspects), but I can‚Äôt be happy anymore because of what‚Äôs crushing down on me. 

2019 started with me meeting someone at a New Year‚Äôs Eve party who I‚Äôve been going out with since then, until the day before Valentine‚Äôs Day. They told me they had feelings for someone else and that she did not want to continue going out. I had to throw out the flowers and chocolates I bought her. This broke me, she was my first kiss that meant something and someone who made me happy when I was with her, talking to her, texting her, etc... I‚Äôve been out on first dates with quit a few other people but never felt this way about any of them. I know I didn‚Äôt know her for long but it felt so real, I just miss her kisses, her laugh and everything about her and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. She told me the week before that she really liked me but wanted to take things slow which I also wanted and I don‚Äôt get what changed. She was the first girl I ever brought home to meet my family and the first girl I ever took out for an expensive dinner, I just liked her so much, I just can‚Äôt deal with every day marching on knowing we‚Äôre getting so much further from each other and that she feels the way about someone else that I feel about her. 

I also found out that my pet lizard is dying, which most people find stupid to care about but I‚Äôve had him for so long and knowing that he‚Äôs now in pain and uncomfortable is hurting me so much. I can‚Äôt let go of him because he‚Äôs the only one there for me on nights that I‚Äôm not doing so well but I know he‚Äôd be in less pain if I brought him to he put down. 

My dad is also in extremely poor health, and the doctor said he may not even make my graduation because of the level of stress he has(reason below), in combination of being over weight and having his mother smoked while she was pregnant and more. He owes me a lot of money (I save a lot of money because I work a job that pays about 500+ every 2 weeks and I only spent max 100 a week so I can lend him money) because I lent him the money to buy a sports car, and my mom also owes her boss money because my dad lost his job in the summer and couldn‚Äôt pay rent so my mom borrowed it from her. We‚Äôve never been in debt or owed money  before as a family  and it‚Äôs so scary. I‚Äôve offered for my dad not to pay me back and my mom to take the money from me to pay off the rent but they refuse. My dad works a full time job and so does my mom but now my dad has to do Uber just to scrape by and try and pay me back. 

And to make things even worse, I have to get tested for cancer again because the lump I have won‚Äôt go away from the prescription I was given for what they were hoping it was for and I think it‚Äôs getting bigger

My entire life I‚Äôve struggled with ADD and OCD tendencies and in the past few years depression, anxiety(social and general) , paranoia, and in the past month it has all come back worse then ever with an extreme relapse in my depression and recently have had serious suicidal thoughts and have even written suicide notes and started thinking about going to do it but talked myself out of it because I thought I would hurt my friends and family and the girl. But now that my friends won‚Äôt talk to me because I‚Äôm sad and they don‚Äôt wanna hear about it any more  and my family is stressed on scraping by and trying to pay bills and the girl doesn‚Äôt want me anymore, I don‚Äôt know what to do, and I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm going to something in another episode. I want to live, I really do but right now it doesn‚Äôt feel like it, I just can‚Äôt deal with it

I stopped taking all my medication last October because of how well I was doing but I‚Äôve gotten nothing but worse since New Years 

I‚Äôve tried praying but I have lost my faith because what kind of god would let this happen

I have an appointment booked with a mental health professional that I usually go to, but she is booked for the next month solid and I can‚Äôt get in till mid March, I‚Äôm scared I won‚Äôt make it till then, it‚Äôs never been this bad before and it‚Äôs not getting any better any time soon. 

I just don‚Äôt know how to deal with everything right now and I‚Äôm looking for advice how too

161,"**Background**: I am a white woman (26 y.o.) who has spent years doing diversity work, and I currently facilitate equity and diversity training for a group of 50+ coworkers at my workplace.  It is something I am incredibly passionate about and have very little tolerance for insensitive mistakes, especially around race.  I've been with my SO, a white man (30 y.o.), for 4 years and we've been living together for 2 years.  We've been discussing getting engaged once I'm done with grad school.

&amp;#x200B;

**Issue**: Given the recent news around politicians and celebrities doing blackface, we've had many conversations over the last few weeks about the topic, in which I have relentlessly torn apart those who have participated in such racist acts.  SO seemed to agree.  However, last night, we were with some of his friends and one of them (Friend #1) turned to him and said ""I didn't want to put this in writing anywhere, but I've been dying to ask for your thoughts on recent headlines...how do you feel about all of the blackface accusations?""  My heart immediately sunk as I turned to my SO in horror, my fears confirmed when Friend #2 said ""wait, why are you asking *him*?"" and Friend #1 responded ""why do you *think* I'm asking him?""  When he hesitated, I chimed in with ""What **I'D** like to know is how this hasn't come up during any of our conversations about blackface recently, and why I had to find out from your friend instead.""  SO explained that, when he was in college, he and his friends dressed up as the Ghostbusters on Halloween.  After a few hours of drinking, one friend suggested that, since he was supposed to be Winston, he should put black paint on his face.  He drunkenly agreed to let the kid put the paint on his face, and then proceeded to go out to the bars that way.  He insisted that he knows it was wrong and is completely ashamed of it.  Friend #1 tried to jump in and explain how hammered my SO was that night, and SO cut him off and said ""no, don't try to defend what I did. There is no defense.""  When we were finally alone later, he apologized that he didn't tell me himself, and explained that he is mortified and when he saw how angry I was about all of the politicians who have done it, he couldn't imagine what I would think of him if I knew.

&amp;#x200B;

**Advice?:**  I don't know what to do.  I'm completely horrified.  Not that there is any justification for what those politicians have done, but at least they could *attempt (and fail)* to excuse it with the fact that it was in the 70s/80s and they ""didn't know better.""  My SO doesn't even have that, this would have been around 2009.  Does this one event that happened 10 years ago outweigh 4 years of an incredible relationship?  If not just the blackface, the fact that he kept it a secret even though he knew how I feel about it?  If breaking up over this is extreme, what else can I do?  Do I ask him to join some of the organizations I work with for equity and diversity as a form of penance?  Ask him to seek therapy, sign up for some implicit bias training, and start reading his way through all of my books on race and racism?  Please help :( ",18Feb2019,1

All i want is in my life to live alone (since i don't have any friends or anything else anyways) and make money. But since i'm an immigrant i cannot work ANYWHERE. My parents and me got the E1 Visa. I'm not allowed to work anywhere the only thing i can do is work with my parents. They have their own business we export cars to Europe. All i do is cleaning up the cars and since i cannot do much work i only get 100$ per month. 

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately i have no working Visa and i also cannot get one. Neither do i have education since Germany it just kinda turned out like that. My life kinda relies on my parents unfortunately and i'm forced to work with them. Now that i'm 18 i could technically export cars with them right ? False since i don't run the business all i can possibly do sell cars on the yard but even that is complicated. Because i cannot choose my own cars because it's not my business and even if i would sell something the money would run into their business. That's why i wish to work somewhere else but i can't. Also i cannot go back to Germany so that is clear.

I'm wondering if there is someone out there with the same issue and same Visa (E1) and still be living with their parents.

Not sure if this is the right place to post this, let me know if there‚Äôs a better sub more fit for this kind of dilemma. 

For as long as I can remember, I've had issues with learning/keeping my grades up. No matter how much or how I study, i still never seems to reflect in my grades. I‚Äôve tried many things to try and get things to stick but none of them seem to work and I just don't understand why. is there something wrong with me?

In high school, I attended a supplemental learning/tutoring center that would help explain and go over topics covered in my classes, but things never seemed to stick. I hired a private tutor for math, which helped somewhat. 

Now, I'm in my 3rd year on university studying computer science. I've tried reading books on studying techniques, but i was having difficulty getting myself to sit down and just read the books, so I bought audio books, which helped somewhat. I've tried different note taking styles, i go through all the exercises in my textbooks. I still have trouble remembering the formulas and methods no matter how many times i implement them. I follow the basic after-lecture review and read the chapters covered then work on the related exercises right after my lectures when everything‚Äôs fresh. Which has been very difficult just to get myself to do. I review every day and try and do a couple problems daily, but I just don‚Äôt get things. I don't understand, am i fucking stupid?

Every day i find it harder and harder to stay motivated. No matter how hard i work, how many hours I'm putting into trying to study and understand the material, it feels like it‚Äôs all for nothing, and that only makes things harder. Unrelated, but my siblings are all successful, in the honors college, and have full ride scholarships. I‚Äôve failed 2 classes and withdrawn from 2 more. I‚Äôm a semester behind from switching majors. My friends and classmates all talk about how they're doing so well, posting pictures of their grades etc. I try not to take things personally, but it just makes things so much harder. I just cant comprehend how I put so much time into things and get nothing, where other people put the same or less time into things and do twice as well.

I'm trying to keep my emotions together while writing this, but I guess what I want to ask is, am I missing something? Is there something wrong with me?

Thank you so much for taking the time to read through this mess. I apologize if it seems scattered. 

If you have any advice on what I should do, please comment or DM me. You guys and gals are my only hope right now.",18Feb2019,2

174," I got a text this evening saying that my uncle, who adopted me at the age of 4, is on his death bed. I've known of his degrading health for 6 months or so.

Thing is, he finds it too painful to say anything at all. Not just that, I'm in California while he's in Chicago, half a country away. I have a short while before he awakes to think of what to say to him through the phone, held to his head to hear.

We have a very colored past and haven't seen eye-to-eye on many occasions. I know I need to be strong and do this, despite any issues we have had in the past. He always put character above everything. ""Intelligence and circumstance were disposable, but character would always shine through."" would have been his motto.

My drawback is this: I haven't much dealt with death amongst people. Almost all of my experience in that field is not with people close to me. What do I say?",18Feb2019,20

I write all the time (I post on NoSleep quite often and even have my own sub), and while I would love to make a full-time career out of it, that takes quite a bit of luck to have that big break... I mean yeah, I make money once in awhile off a story getting hot or from having one of my scripts optioned, but obviously nothing I can use to help my girlfriend and I really settle down together.

So I started applying to different jobs. I was in the process of landing a TSA gig. But on New Year‚Äôs Eve, for the first time ever, I tried pot (no joke). I took two hits and didn‚Äôt feel shit. Well, I had a drug test and medical exam February 4th for the TSA job. And you can probably guess what happened next: I failed the piss test. So I can‚Äôt even apply for that job for another 6 months. Goddammit, I feel horrible. I really feel like shit and haven‚Äôt even told my gf or her family yet. To make shit worse, I‚Äôll have another medical exam/piss test this week for a job I‚Äôve already been hired for as long as everything goes well with the exam. I want to be optimistic, I do. But if I failed the test on February 4th, what difference would a few weeks make? I‚Äôm terrified. And what gets me is that everything I‚Äôve read on-line indicates that you should be able to pass the piss test after just a few weeks... all I know is if I fail this one, idk. I think I‚Äôll lose my relationship and everything. My future. It just all makes me sad and miserable. I doubt I can stay with my gf if I fuck this one up.

I dated this girl over a year ago now, let‚Äôs call her Brandy, and I consistently have been feeling like I let something go with her that I should‚Äôve held onto for longer. We were good friends for years and she ended up having a crush on me, I went with it, and it was alright but then we broke up. Now we‚Äôre good friends again and I‚Äôm starting to have second thoughts. That relationship ended with her, in all honesty, just cause I got disinterested towards the end. However, I‚Äôm starting to think that might be the specific problem with me because...
I‚Äôm currently with someone else, let‚Äôs call her Mandy. We‚Äôre about to reach a year and we‚Äôve gotten real close, but I‚Äôm starting to feel the same way I felt with Brandy with her. I know exactly what I‚Äôm doing wrong; I‚Äôm not giving her enough attention, and I‚Äôm not showing enough affection to her at all at this point. I consistently try to put Mandy off until later, and it feels almost like a chore and it was the same way before with Brandy.
Except now I‚Äôm starting to realize that with Brandy things were really good and I threw that away for really no reason. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm gonna end up doing that exact same thing again. 

What‚Äôs wrong with me? Why can‚Äôt I keep interested in the same girl? I realize that I‚Äôm just a stupid kid that probably doesn‚Äôt have enough attention span for this, and I still know that I really like Mandy, but it feels like I just can‚Äôt help but be discontent with what I have. I feel really selfish and I probably don‚Äôt deserve to even be in a relationship; I would try and talk this out with Mandy, but I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôd get it and it would come off wrong.

185,"Long story but I'll try to summarize. I have this co-worker who I am kind of friends with. I say kind of because she's actually a pretty suck friend, but i haven't been able to cut her out of my life because we work closely together every day. I've kept things friendly for work, but i also did stop inviting her over or accepting invitations to hang outside of work. She may still think we're friends though.

She's been on her last leg at our job for a while now. Frequent call ins, stealing, drugs at work, and just generally not doing her job. Some of this i was the one to tell our boss about. I've had enough of her putting things off on me, taking advantage of literally everyone she knows, and acting like it's all someone else's fault. I had no intentions of being backstabby, rather our boss was one of the people being taken advantage of and i felt she should know. 

I'm pretty sure this girl has now been fired. I won't have the full story until I get to work tomorrow, but she's not on the schedule. So now come the real problems. 1. If she thinks we're still friends she may expect contact even though we no longer work together. I do not want this. I do not want toxic people in my life. 2. There's some worry from my fiance that she may ask to ""rent"" our spare room if her landlord kicks her out. This is entirely possible. She knows we don't use our third bedroom, and she may not have anywhere else to go. This is also a hard no. I feel awful for her son, but she has admitted to me many times that she spent her rent money on weed and stupid shit. She's also filthy. I've seen her house. 

In a normal social relationship i would have just cut ties with this person and that would have been the end of it. I've had no idea how to handle this though. I am very shy, awkward, and terrified of confrontation. It gives me crippling anxiety, especially if the person has a confrontational personality, which she does. I do not know how to tell her i don't want to talk to her anymore. Maybe it was a mistake to play nice for so long, but it was very important to my job that we get along and function as a team. Anyway, sorry for the novel. I'm a bundle of nerves about this and i could use some advice. How do I tell her we can no longer be friends, and i won't be helping her anymore?",18Feb2019,1

190,"I was riding in the car with my mother as we were driving through our neighborhood, when we nearly ran over this little Dachshund. 

We noticed he had a collar, so I opened my door and let him hop in. He was super friendly; very cuddly, and loved to lick. 

I check his collar; no tag. No name. No number. 

So, we took him back to our house. My mother posted his picture on some Facebook group for lost pets in our area.  
A few hours later, we get the the owner's phone number. He lives just a couple blocks away from our house. apparently the dog has a habit of getting out of the yard and roaming the neighborhood.
We drive to his place, and give him the dog (who we learned is named Willy). 

Even more hours later, around 8:00-10:00 P.M., Willy made his way back to our house, and began scratching at our front door. We let him in, of course, because we like him a lot.
The next day, the dude texts my mother asking if we've seen him, so, we tell him what happened. He comes back, takes the dog, and returns to his home. 

About 24 hours later, Willy is back at our house again. 

This time, the guy tells us to keep him all week ""if we want"". As I said, we like the dog, so we did keep him. 
Next week, dude comes back, gets the dog...and then another day goes by, and Willy comes back to us. 

This happens about three more times, and each time it took much longer for the guy to come get the dog. 

Now, this part is a bit anecdotal, but we all think this dude's an alcoholic. 
He can't take care of his dog responsibly. The dog is roaming around in our neighborhood (an, admittedly, very ghetto one), where people speed down the roads, and aggressive stray dogs run freely. It's not safe for a small dog like Willy to just be walking about. 

Tonight, after having Willy with us for over two weeks, this dude comes banging on our door at 11:00 o'clock at night, shouting (or, slurring, rather) ""git muh dog"". 
We didn't answer the door. We assume he'll be back tomorrow. 

At this point, we're in love with the dog (and so is our little terrier). We really don't want to give him up, especially to someone who isn't even taking care of him (someone who can't even keep him in his yard, when we have holes all over our yard, yet Willy doesn't leave).
We're going to be moving soon. We don't want to think about Willy becoming roadkill while he trots over to the house he thinks we're still in. 

My mother thinks we should microchip him, which should legally make him ours. I don't want to start a confrontation with this guy, but I don't believe the dog will be safe with him.

193,"I‚Äôm a 24 year old female living in California. I‚Äôm originally from rural Midwest. I have a lot of social anxiety and talking with people scares me. I‚Äôm never purposely rude to people but tonight I realized that I am a massive bitch. I need help. 

For about 2 weeks my boyfriend has been asking me to go to his coworkers birthday brunch. It was at a fancy lounge. I expressed to my boyfriend several times that I did not want to go and I was rude about it. I told him I would go even though I did not want to because in relationships I feel like you have to make sacrifices.  We go and it‚Äôs a daytime club. Like club attire and lots of drinking, not what I was expecting at all. I was dressed like a grandma basically and that made me insecure. I kind of sat around, I introduced myself to people but really only talked to my boyfriend. I did get up and dance a little but I mostly sat and bobbed my head to the music. I declined every drink offered to me (I don‚Äôt really drink.) I expressed to my boyfriend (in his ear, not around other people) that I really hated everything about what was happening and I got mad at him. 

We left early because my boyfriend had made an excuse earlier that we had plans during the night time. And when we got to the car, my boyfriend burst into tears. He said I embarrassed him by not trying to interact with the others. That I made him feel like shit. We do have some issues we are working through (he had a girlfriend when we first started talking, I fell in love with him and then found out) This makes me insecure about his all female coworkers. So I take out my angry about that situation and translate it into not trying to get to know his coworkers. He told me that he loves me but that his coworkers will definitely have something to say about my behavior and that I probably ruined ever having a decent relationship with them. 

I realized that I‚Äôm a massive bitch. I didn‚Äôt try to talk to anyone and I berated my boyfriend several times at the club. My social anxiety and anxiety in general is no excuse for me being a massive bitch. Just because I grew up poor in rural Midwest does not give me the right to be the way I was acting. I honestly did think I was being okay, just being shy until my boyfriend pointed out my behavior.

196,"Hi.  Thanks for clicking on my post.  TL;DR at the bottom.
I'll tell you a bit about myself and then explain how I feel.  Hopefully someone can direct me to where to seek help or answers.

When I was about 15 and getting into high school I noticed I had an extremely hard time focusing on what the teacher said.  I had to actively think about focusing and for the most part, that worked.  It took me forever to complete homework and I never studied because I would get distracted.  Surprisingly, I did well in school and I graduated with a 4.0 GPA.  However, when I brought up my issues with my parents they told me that I was just being a hypochondriac.  So, I just thought everyone had the same problems as me.  I'm slowly coming to the realization that this is not true.

You see, after I graduated I moved to a large city and became a recluse of sorts.  I have ZERO social life, but at my job my coworkers all talk about how they hung out with each other, or go to parties, or bars and whatnot.  I just don't do that, and, pehaps its because I'm not interested but, I'm also not ever invited.  I realized I just don't know how to speak to people.  I can't really hold a conversation because if I get too invested I can't shut up about myself.  I'm trying to work on it but I can't seem to make friends.  I'm lonely and don't really have anyone here except my boyfriend.  He makes things bearable.  

Sometimes I start to freak out about things if it bothers me.  One day, at work someone started being extremely rude to my coworker and I felt this tight pain in my chest. I wanted to run away and cry.  I know this sounds childish but I dislike confrontation.  I can't handle it and I either get angry or I cry.  When i was going through a rough time in my life  I would just cry for hours and my chest hurt so bad.  I'd freak out.  I don't really know but maybe it was panic attacks.  This happened when I was in high school as well.  I was really sad all of the time back then and sometimes I am now.  

Now, instead of freaking out as much, my mind is just constantly racing.  I'm always thinking about something.  If I'm really into a video game I'll think about it and how to accomplish my goals within the game.  If I find a new hobby I just can't stop thinking about it.  It's like being tied to a chair and being forced to watch videos of things 24/7.  I can't sleep.  I could stay awake for hours with my brain going 1000mph.  I've been taking sleep medication to help me fall asleep and it works but I don't like taking it.  I can't focus.  I try handling customers at my job, but I get distracted too easily.  The sound of a pen drop or chair moving distracts me as I'm counting back change.  I can't hold conversations with my coworkers because I get distracted and can't remember what I'm saying, or I'll forget what I was saying.  I'm genuinely interested in people and I like my coworkers but I have a really hard time remembering names or things about them.  Hell, I straight up forgot my coworkers name after working there for 6 months.  I sometimes wish I had a power button for my brain...

Ive experienced symptoms all of my life and I just need to know if everyone feels this way or if there is something wrong with me.  It bothers me that my parents just blew off my thoughts because, if I have these things, maybe I would have had a much easier time in life thus far with the proper support.  Am I truly a hypochondriac?  Where do I go from here?  Please help.

TL;DR
I have had many life experiences that show symptoms of ADD and anxiety.  I want to know if I'm just a hypochondriac or if I actually need help and I really do have ADD and/or anxiety, what should my next course of action be.  ",18Feb2019,1
197,"My ex-girlfriend who I have been no-contact with (we haven‚Äôt tried either direction to reestablish, although there are some networks her and I are both blocking each other) has presented some issues for me here several years later.

It was a young and inexperienced relationship with many ‚Äúfirsts‚Äù and many mistakes. We often had the disagreement of our parents versus our actions. Her parents likely, while I cannot confirm this, dislike me.

Here we are five years later, and her father is heavily involved in the community I live in. I have always loved being involved but find this to be a small barrier of being involved further, especially if it means that many organizations he ranks high in are barriers to community involvement.

204,"It's relatively mundane, really. We were talking and she brings up how her dad is giving her cup therapy. Didn't know what it was, so I researched it and asked her, and she said it was a process of what I mocked as basically making hickey pox to ""relieve pain and remove toxins from the body"". The ""remove toxins"" thing set off a tiny little alarm bell in my brain. Regardless, I let her continue with a few questions here and there. She then mentions how whenever it itches, she'd rub some of that essential oil lavender stuff on it to ""disinfect"" it?

I bought some kratom that is rather poor quality, it's just been sitting in a bag and other than trying it, it hasn't been consumed. It kind of made me sickly compared to what I normally take.

Despite coming from the source, it's very bad.

Admittedly, I should have done this earlier, and some people might think it's a bit scummy, but it took like a month to arrive, and when it arrived it came in with the storage bags popped, kratom powder got everywhere (I lost a good bit because of this), and it isn't really worth what I paid for it.

I told the guy this and he just said ""sorry"". Didn't seem good with English.

217,"Hey all,

I bought a house in a nice, middle class neighborhood about five months ago and am making friends with the neighbors.  I'm leaving for 14 days and arranged with the neighbor for her 11 year old daughter to cat sit for me in exchange for cash.  I figured this would be an easy way to make a connection and get some good cat care.  My cat is super easy, he just wants attention from someone, so I figured a kid would be the best fit for the job anyway cause she might have more time on her hands than my busy friends.  The neighbors have pets so I figure it's up their alley.

But what's the right amount to give an 11 year old for this very easy task?  The money's not the problem (within reason obviously), but I don't want to lowball or highball and seem like a weirdo.   I was thinking \~$7/day, rounded up for 14 days = $100...but that seems like a lot for a kid in middle school!  What if they don't do allowance in their family and a huge influx of cash causes some familial drama or something?

I can't remember anymore what an appropriate amount is to get at that age.  Also don't want to be that older person who thinks ""Five bucks was great when I mowed the lawn!""  On the other hand I remember a particularly bad petsitting

219,"Hi all, I currently go to school full time and work two part time jobs. 

&amp;#x200B;

One job pays minimum and only gives me 10 hours a week, and the other is an independent contracting job where I choose how much I want to work (usually 15-20 hours a week). 

&amp;#x200B;

My independent contracting job gives multiple bonuses and is double minimum wage, it's what really makes me money to live off of. Here is the catch, when I applied, I filled out a 1099 form and had to apply for a BTC. I have been saving up a portion of my checks to pay taxes, but I don't want to keep doing that. I was going to reapply my BTC, but it said I owe around $380 to reapply -- but the first time I applied, I only paid like $30. I do not want to stay here because it doesn't benefit my future, and I am tired of getting up at 6:30am to work from home. Keep in mind, I am a full time student who needs sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

Both these jobs are places I do not see myself in longterm, and don't want to grow in. I want to get into investment banking after I get my bachelors, meaning I would much rather work as a bank teller. The thing is, I just started these jobs around October 2018 and the job I had before that, I only worked there for 10 months. I want to quit my independent contracting job asap so I don't to owe so much for the next tax season, but my minimum wage job barely supports me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was thinking of quitting my contracting job (I can quit whenever), and keeping my minimum wage job -- but I would be pulling in about $500/mo... Although, I don't pay rent, I do pay for my car (gas, insurance, monthly payment), and food/fun.

i have no idea what to type, so im just going to start typing and keep going till i run out of words.


it hasnt hit me yet, im not sure its going to hit me as its the internet. im scared of people dying and me not giving a shit.

a few years back i met two random people in a game we became friends more or less. friend A is a nice dude, i never got along with friend B well. he was, he is kind of an asshole.

he tended to suck the energy out of whatever voice channel he ended up in, it ended up as a deathly quiet where it felt wrong to make noise. called me out when i fucked something up, called me out when i failed to do something right and ended up not really doing anything.

you can see why i didnt really see him as a friend, friend A liked him and got along with him well so we stuck around as a group i just didnt really talk to friend B.

he always seemed kinda tired, but i knew unlike me and A B was a proper adult (lets say 30s or so, i cant picture him much younger then that) with a proper job so i figured he was just that, tired. maybe he was, maybe he wasnt. 

(prepost edit: B also never yelled, never shouted, never raised his voice. always talked in a quiet/near whisper tone of voice.)



one day B sent us a message.

""You two boys want me to get you Stellaris before I die?""

A said he would rather B didnt die and spend money on things for us, i echoed what A said.

""Well, chances are pretty good that I'll be dead in about a month, so if you guys change your mind on that lmk.""

A asked what his cause of death was going to be.

""Me.""

i said i hope thats a smart ass answer.

""It is not a smartass answer.""

over a few days it was deathly still no one wanted to ask anything else, it felt wrong to say anything on the topic after that. it was made very clear what he ment.

thats about all there is right now.



i dont know what to do. its the internet so i feel i should just leave things be and go on with life, i was never close to him after all. but at the same time, i feel i should atleast try to do... something.

226,"Just today, [I received an email confirmation that I passed my Master of Research degree](https://www.reddit.com/user/Fart_Gas/comments/ars1pd/i_passed_my_master_of_research_degree/).

But now, for a bit of backstory:

1. I have been a failure since 2013, when I was in Year 12 of high school. In May 2013, I attempted to get into a Medicine degree because I wanted to earn more praise from other people and boost my ego and reputation - even though I was already getting large amounts of praise and had a massive ego because I could justify it with my high marks. Here in Australia, you have to take the [UMAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undergraduate_Medicine_and_Health_Sciences_Admission_Test) before even being considered to get into a Medicine degree. So I took the UMAT, and when the results came back in August, it completely derailed my life. Before then, I was a high-achieving student, and my predicted [ATAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Tertiary_Admission_Rank), based on my average marks, was 87. In contrast, my UMAT results were 22/100.
2. If you ask anyone who knew me back in 2013, they'd tell you that I played [Minecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft) heavily. The reason why I did it, even so close to the [HSC exams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_School_Certificate_(New_South_Wales)) in October (the ones which determined the ATAR)? Because it was like drowning my sorrows in alcohol, and at least the gaming addiction prevented me from becoming an alcoholic or drug addict. As a result, my ATAR ended up being 73.1, which is not good enough for Medicine degrees anywhere. However, I was eligible for a Bachelor of Medical Science degree, and that's what I would have chosen anyway if I wasn't concerned with my ego and reputation.
3. The most reputable university I could get into with 73.1 ATAR was [Western Sydney University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney_University), one which was heavily ridiculed by anyone with an ATAR over 90. If that wasn't enough, I really struggled - turns out that I did not have a good attitude for education and that being a glory hound is not conducive to academic success.
4. This is the point where I was forcibly humbled by failure. Knowing that some of the people I was a jerk towards had higher marks than me, I quit all social media because I would much rather disappear into obscurity than have people contact me asking for my marks. The other reason I quit social media was because I was ashamed to be alive. As my mother told me ""*God doesn't give you success because you refuse to be good when you're successful*"".
5. In the 3 years of my undergraduate Medical Science degree, I spent a lot of time in counselling. You see, it was depressing being a low-achiever in a university which high achievers ridicule. But I refused to give up, even though I am innately a quitter, because [I believe that if the world isn't a better place with me in it, I might as well have been aborted](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyLifeProTips/comments/anc421/slpt_cant_be_bothered_working_hard_in_life_are/). Being humbled was very hard on me, and to keep myself humble was a constant battle to suppress my innately vile personality.
6. I finally graduated Medical Science, repeating 1 failed unit, with a [GPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_Point_Average) of 4.9. It was enough to get me into a Master of Research degree. I still don't consider that a success because I failed 1 unit.
7. I completed my 2-year Master of Research degree, completing a thesis called ""Investigating the factors determining *Aspergillus fumigatus* virulence and the variations of virulence between clinical isolates"", submitting it on 3 December 2018.
8. My marks came back today (18 February 2019) and I got a mark of 82%. I no longer have any shame about being alive. 

Now that I am no longer a failure, I don't have to suppress my vile personality anymore. So how can I stay humble?:

* The reason I need to stay humble is because I enjoy being praised by others, and the only praise I ever received between 2014-2018 was for my humility or levelheadedness. 
   * Do remember that I only tried to become a medical doctor because I knew that medical doctors were respectable and gain praise from society. In fact, the best sort of praise to me is to get so much praise that I can afford to dismiss some of it.
   * The only reason people think I'm level-headed is because I have what some may call ""no spine"". Why am I spineless? Because I understand my high odds of being wrong, therefore, I refuse to be pushy with my points.
* In my family, those who are particularly successful can become very egotistical - it's like we all share this same innate personality where we develop success-related arrogance.
* Some of my relatives (such as my mother) use their devout Catholic faith to keep themselves humble. But I back when I forced myself to go to church, I just ended up constantly pissed-off and exhausted from all the mental gymnastics needed to justify religious faith.
* Should I just move the goalposts and stop regarding my Master of Research as a success, in order to keep myself humble?",18Feb2019,1

She lives a little less than half a day's drive away, but I wish I could be with her to help her. But for now I'm trying to help her through the internet.  
She told me she's cut herself before but she recently started to stop, but just tonight she told me she had just cut herself. I've been trying to help her but I have no clue how and all of the websites I'm visiting don't really help too much and I'm so confused. So far I've just tried to convince her that she deserves to tell me her problems(she apologized for telling me she cut herself, despite saying I helped just by listening, and said she doesn't have the right to tell me), tried to find alternatives, told her she should be proud of herself for telling me(she said she felt selfish for telling me), but I don't feel like I'm doing enough and I feel so useless for not being able to help her.  
She went offline while I was typing a message, and hasn't come back online, although I'm not too worried about that because it was actually an hour later than the time she normally falls asleep.

231,"Earlier today I was with some buddies at my old school, where we were going to smoke. As soon as we pulled in (also I was driving my moms car, which I‚Äôm a second driver for, if it matters) a cruiser followed right behind and high beamed us, along with another car right beside him (which I‚Äôm assuming was an undercover car). 
I‚Äôm in Canada, so weed is legal. This was only my second police encounter (first ever involving a vehicle, or me being an adult) so I was SHOOK. I basically explained everything exactly how it was and that we didn‚Äôt do anything (which we hadn‚Äôt) and that I would leave immediately and I was very sorry, and if he felt the need we could take a breathalyzer so I could prove myself innocent.

He asked me to step out of the car, and had me stand by the window of his cruiser as he asked me a bunch of questions about the car, my family, school, the guys with me, etc..

He handed me back my I.D and told me I could leave, so I did.

What I would like to know; (I really didn‚Äôt want to stay around and ask just in case) how does this affect me now? Am I in a ‚Äúsystem‚Äù because he ran my ID? Could something happen with the car/insurance? Could they notify my family? (I‚Äôm 20)

I‚Äôm probably overthinking it a little but I don‚Äôt want to ruin everything I‚Äôve worked for over something as fucking stupid as that. this was definitely an eye opener for me, considering I had the car on for the radio, and we were JUST about to smoke, literally 2 minutes later and I could‚Äôve been booked for a DUI.

237,"Warning: long story, TL;DR at the end if you don‚Äôt want to read the whole thing.

Anyway, pretty much exactly what the title says, I feel like I don‚Äôt relate to anyone in my environment. A little backstory 

Age: 0 - 5

I had a pretty fucked up childhood. I guess most people do but it‚Äôs the type where dad ends up in jail for life and mom gets a couple felonies landing you in foster care at 5 as an only child for the foreseeable future.

Age 5 - 8

Got placed in foster care in a border town in southern arizona and raised by a Hispanic family. They were kind but spoke very little English so long story short I didn‚Äôt speak much from the ages of 5 - 8. 

Around my 8th birthday my grandparents decided to file for legal custody. They were pretty old around 65 - 70 but it was clear my foster parents wanted to adopt me and my mother begged them to file for custody so she didn‚Äôt lose me forever (we still had supervised visits twice a week). 

Age 8 - 12

So I move from Nogales to Washington DC (grandpa works in nuclear energy relations with Turkey) so essentially from complete poverty to very well off. Get bullied a lot for not having parents and for having bad skin (puberty hit early and not kindly at first) but end up falling in with a group of rich girls as I started to develop. I despised them. But you know how middle school goes. 

Fast forward to eighth grade. My grandmother is one of the worst human beings I‚Äôve met. She spent years making smug backhanded comments that chipped further and further away at my self esteem, poured trash in my bed if I forgot to empty one of the trash cans, only let me hang out with friends 30 minutes a week. I understand now that being 65 and having to take care of your child‚Äôs child is undesirable but the level or maliciousness she lowered herself to when speaking to an 8 year old child baffles me. My grandfather sees this and tell mom it‚Äôs time for me to live with her. She agrees and we hide it from CPS from the ages of 12 - 18. 

Age: 12 - 18

She‚Äôs still in Arizona slightly north of the border with a man about 20 years older than her who has a passion to control women. He reeks of pedophilia. Never did anything too damning but it‚Äôs one of those things you feel as a 13 year old girl. This becomes apparent when I stay home sick one day (freshman year of high school) and he crawls into bed and puts his arm around me. I get up and leave with my backpack and it‚Äôs never spoken of again but from them on there‚Äôs constant tension. 

I start smoking weed and drinking around 14. Any excuse to be out of the house, fall in with a group of people in the same boat. Around 16 start using cocaine occasionally. Start missing a lot of school but always pick up my work from class to make sure my grades don‚Äôt fall. Tensions rise at home, I tell my mom she‚Äôs married to a pedophile but she doesn‚Äôt believe me. I‚Äôve always told her everything I do from trying week to trying alcohol. Stepdad searches my underwear drawer and finds a bottle of Smirnoff and my mom says she‚Äôs ‚Äúappalled and was unaware of this behavior.‚Äù It shatters me. I never had anyone. No brothers or sisters, no real friends. The only person I ever knew was my mother. And on top of ignoring all the statements I made about the inappropriate advances from my stepdad she threw me under the bus for this pedophile. That‚Äôs when I started to feel nothing.

Maybe this was good. I stopped smoking weed, it started to give me anxiety attacks which was a real shame as it was the one thing that relieved my anxiety prior. Despite my partying habits I graduated with a 3.7 GPA. Started applying for colleges as I knew I had to get out as soon as I could. 

Went off to the University of Arizona.

Age: 18 - 22

Fall in with an older guy around age 19 who, SURPRISE, ends up being a piece of shit. Don‚Äôt want to go into detail but a lot of abuse and manipulation. End up getting evicted as he starts refusing to work, develops a drug habit, and starts threatening me for drugs. So around 20 with my life in shambles I crawl back to my mother for support, while she‚Äôs never had much of a backbone, she‚Äôs always been there for me. 

1 year goes by living at home

Fast forward to now 22 years old, steady job and research work, graduating in one (or two) semester(s) with a degree in psychology (and possible neuroscience if I want to double major) from the University of Arizona. Wonderful, supportive boyfriend with a good job and and a good head on his shoulders. 

But the thing is, I feel numb. I don‚Äôt relate to my colleagues. The only people I relate to are those who‚Äôve turned to drugs or alcohol to nullify pain. I have no issue getting along with my peers but it‚Äôs all an act, I have no real friends and the only prospective friends I‚Äôve found are people who will drag me down.

TL;DR:

I had a fucked up past and don‚Äôt relate to people I associate with because they‚Äôve almost all been straight edge and had a stable upbringing to make it this far. Will it be this way forever? Will I always feel isolated and alone? Or does it get better? ",18Feb2019,3
238,"The title basically sums up my problems here. Im M20 and shes F19. So, I met this girl about 8 months ago and we hit it off immediately. We love playing video games together and our car rides are just naturally fun. I knew from the start that I found a bestfriend. There is always something to talk about. We decided about a month of knowing each other that we wanted to take things further and get into a relationship. Our relationship lasted 6 months and we ended up breaking up due to her mental health and her needing to ""work on herself so that she can bring forth more to the relationship"". TBH I was the one pushing harder in the relationship and was the main support system of the whole thing. She told me that she is still in love with me and wants me in her life and that we are guaranteed to get back together once she has sorting things out personally, but now is not the time. So we continued to be the best of friends and it's like nothing changed at all. And here comes the sad part. She met a girl a while back that she was just friends with and they started talking a lot more recently (this started about a month after we broke up). She tells me that she isnt her girlfriend and probably wont be due to her not wanting a commitment as of right now for the same reasons she broke up with me. However, they flirt all the time and I took her to the girls house twice and they ended up making out and hooking up. All she told me when I asked her to explain was ""none of this was supposed to happen"". We spent valentines day together and my birthday two days later (this is after she hooked up with this girl). Idk what to do anymore. I'm hurt and I want to continue to be her friend and eventually her boyfriend again but this is a lot to handle. ",18Feb2019,1
239,"Sorry if this seems like a silly thing to ask for advice about. It's more about honesty between friends than Dungeons and Dragons.

&amp;#x200B;

My friend who I will call DM is the Dungeon Master of a campaign that they're putting a lot of effort into. My acquaintance, A, is one of the players. We meet weekly to play. DM and A are good friends. I'm a good friend of DM; I don't spend much time with A.

&amp;#x200B;

After a few months of playing together, A tells the other players and some friends they don't want to play anymore because they think DM's plot is boring. They don't want to tell DM because they're afraid DM will be hurt or try to change things in order to convince A to keep playing. A has missed the past few sessions with the excuse that they were too busy. I guess they just intend to keep doing this instead of ever telling DM how they feel.

&amp;#x200B;

I know DM pretty well and I think that they'll end up being more upset that A didn't just say outright that they didn't want to participate anymore, but they may also be gently hurt by the fact that A no longer wants to play. A has made it pretty clear they don't want us to tell DM that they're bored, but I think it's rude to not be up front about that sort of thing. If I told DM that A didn't want to play anymore and DM confronted A about it, A would probably figure out that I was the one who spilled the beans. I don't really care if A gets upset with me, but A is close to some of my good friends and I don't want those friends to think badly of me for going against A's wishes. But I also don't want to be a bystander while A is dishonest with DM and dragging things out instead of just saying they're done with the game.

243,"I have gotten into a arguement with my friends and SO over a few habits I have and I want to work torwards improving myself. I dont believe I can use them as a way to seek advice because I think that most of the people I think I could turn to would also spread the word to those I wish to mend relations with and create a negative impact of talking about private issues behind their back losing some of the trust I may still have. I want to list a few of the problems and hope that people can give advice on how to approach them. I'm providing backstory and examples in Hope's that it may help people recognize and attack the issues. I also want advice on how to prove that I have improved other than just saying ""I have changed"" so I can prove to them I'm taking their advice to work on myself. I know that to mend relations with some of them I have to prove there Is change rather than just promise them itll be fine next time.

I understand that this list more than likely will make me sound like a horrible person. I'm trying to be extremely critical of myself and seek a way to improve while mending relationships with those I may have hurt. I'm using the biggest mistakes I've made in Hope's those might close up any of the smaller issues. To skip story's go to the TLDR.

The current goal list and the issues I currently have partaining to each one:

I overexplain things!
 I do this to others to the point I can come off demeaning. I dont do this intentionally and as a result dont know just how often I do it or how it can come to be. If anyone can give me a way to recognize and target this I will be trying to monitor myself to catch it.

Somtimes I talk poorly of others even when I go in not wanting to. I think to myself ""dont bring up xxx"" but after opening up to someone else about a issue I end up getting a little emotional and can end up going from a simple conversation about a issue to venting and talking poorly of someone who may be a common friend. The issue is that all of my friends know one another and I pretty much mean ALL so theres really nobody else to open up to but them.

I lie too much for even my own taste. 
They are rarely big but obviously a lie Is a lie and they can add up. I usually tell a lie to avoid confrontation or to do what I believe will make someone else happier. But somtimes I can screw up and hurt someone doing what I believe will make them happier. For instance I ended up very upset after learning I was betrayed by a close friend. I then discussed it with another who is not exactly known for keeping secrets but happened to be someone I met within a hour of learning what happened and just had to get it off my chest to calm me down.(bad choice) I then lied to the person who betrayed me after we cleared things up(worse choice) and said I hadn't told anyone about it because I didn't want them to think others would know because I thought maybe I could keep it from becoming a huge event. I told the person I vented to that things had been cleared up and to please keep it a secret. Well it leaked out and has lead to serious conflict between us. &lt;- (this is what I consider a big lie)
As a result I want to know how to prove I'm not lying to them anymore and wont make the same mistake twice. I still have contact with them and just hope I can one day fix things. I have apologized but a apology isnt enough and without proving I used it to improve myself I doubt I can ever have the same relationship with them.

I can be manipulative to my SO. This has got us to a break and unless I improve I know things will not work. I get anxious when we get in arguements or they get mad. I have used white lies to calm a situation in the past and I can recognize and stop that in the future. I have also said romantic stuff to calm them and let them understand I love them as hope it will calm them which I'm certain must make it feel insincere when even though i mean every word. 
I understand and can stop this. But to no longer be on a break I have to prove I have changed this to them. I just dont understand how to prove this to them without still dating them and having very frequent communication so it feels like a ultimatum I can never acheive.

I really appreciate the help. I apologize for any bad formatting this has as I am currently on mobile and if I fix things I will be sure to give a update and hopefully a happy story! (Not sure where I would post it though)

TLDR: 
I have screwed up. With a few people. These are the big subjects. Explanations and backstory are above incase they help. I really want to improve myself and I really want to patch relations.
ISSUES:
LIE
MANIPULATE
SPEAK DOWN TO OTHERS
TALK BAD ABOUT OTHERS BECAUSE I GET CAUGHT UP IN MYSELF. 

Its late at night so I will have to reply to questions in the morning, Sorry! I wrote out a approach to each problem on paper and the reasons I believe I have each problem as a first step to recognizing my issues. I hope I can fix things. This is a new account that I'm hoping to use to get help without my friends recognizing my name on reddit and talking about it &gt;.&lt; .

244,"Hi all.

I'm 28 years old, a female, and married with two children. I have a long history of not being able to make up my mind as to what I want to do as a career, but I finally decided to be a nurse back in around 2013. I got my LPN diploma, worked as an LPN for a few years before getting my ASN. I've now been working as an RN in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for a little over a year now.

I am not happy with my job. I am a self-diagnosed introvert, socially awkward, with a history of mad depression and anxiety. I AM getting help for that. After trying several different meds and TMS therapy, I've now found myself a great cognitive behavioral therapist who I have been working with for a while now. 

I work with babies which is great, but there are two problems: the fact that I work night shift...and the parents. Working nights has been killing me. I have to flip my schedule on my time off to be a mother to my children and my body is all out of wack. I can't do nights anymore, no doubt about it. My job has me on a seniority-based list for day shift and I'm a ways off from getting a position. Working with the babies parents, doing teaching, and so on, simply gives me major social anxiety.

But honestly, that's besides the point right now. I always thought nursing was what I wanted to do (I even wanted to go on to become a neonatal nurse practitioner) but I'm severely burnt out and doubting it all. I've just really come to terms with the fact that bedside nursing may not be for me.

This stress and burn-out has caused me to apply for 12 weeks of FMLA last week, so I've given myself this 12 weeks to get my shit together. My husband prefers I work, but is able to support us through this time on his salary. He's a really supportive guy and I know that he would be willing to go along with whatever I decide for myself. 

I love computers, have grown up around them, and my husband mentioned a week or so ago about how he thinks I would love to be a software developer. I know it's kind of rash, but I've applied for FlatIron's software development bootcamp course tonight. I'm going to see how that goes.

Reddit.. am I too old for a career change? Or should I stick with being miserable for 36+ hours a week on night shift in a job I'm not really sure I want to do anymore? I have interests but I can't even begin to imagine where to go from here.

TLDR: Unhappy with career choice post-college, looking for a change",18Feb2019,1
245,"Me and my boyfriend have been in a LDR for about 4 years now. We have seen each other multiple times and had holidays together and participated to events ..

We are moving in together next year.

So, I never had any one else before my boyfriend. Ever. Never kissed anyone else, never had sex with anyone else. He has been my first for everything. 
Yet, I am extremely extremely curious on ‚Äútrying‚Äù to have sex with other people.
[Mind, I view sex and love as two separate entities]. We discussed it, and he said a clear ‚Äúno‚Äù. I accepted it, and moved on.
I still like to flirt with people as a sport (please don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs just casual flirting where both parties know that it‚Äôs going to end in nowhere). My boyfriend knows it and is cool with it, as long no one touches me sexually.

Last year I met this guy at a parade and gave I gave him my number. I made it clear after a day of texting that I am in a relationship. 
This guy was also in a LDR, but cheated constantly on her saying ‚Äúthat if she doesn‚Äôt know, it won‚Äôt hurt her and it benefits me. I still love her, I just need sex‚Äù. I kinda understood his view because I shared it (not the part of not letting the gf know, I‚Äôm against that).
Anyway, we were flirting and one day I went to his place to just hang. I was falling asleep and he started cuddling into me. [I never touched him, ever. I never initiated anything, ever.]. From that day I never saw him again and stopped talking to him. I feel extremely guilty and have been remorseful since then. I think I have talked about it with my boyfriend when it happened, and we got over it, but I don‚Äôt remember and I don‚Äôt want to take the topic out again because I don‚Äôt want him to suffer or argue.

248," 

I wanted to get this off my chest for so long that today we just got into a big fight that got my parents involved also which will be told later on. But if you guys read all of it, I really appreciate it and please help me and give me any advice you have for me as it will really help me. Thank you.

I'm 18 (turning 19 in 2 months) who's in College, and my little bro is 15 in high school (gr. 10). I really, really hate him so much that I wish he never existed or I hope he dies before me! We hate each other since the beginning. Yes, I have done shitty things to make him mad when we were young but since I am 18 and in the adult stage, I try to be a good older brother. But not anymore. Why? Because 1st, he can never change; a 15 year old boy is still acting like a fuckin 5 year old where he is still being/fighting for ""Momma's boy"" or who's the better son. What I mean by that is when I'm around, he always goes up to my mom and massage her and say I love you, when I mostly do all the majority shit in the house like cleaning the house, washing the dishes, doing the laundry, etc. While he just fuckin does nothing most of the time and tries to win over my mom when I actually don't give a fuck?! Not only that, he'll say all these negative shit about me to my mom out loud for me to hear just to try and piss me off when again I don't actually give a fuck! But the only thing that pisses me off is that my mom is mostly on his side which heads into my 2nd hatred towards my lil bro.

I'm Asian and ever since when I was young, I was always being slapped by my mom which is a typical Asian parent to do back then to disciplined your kid. But here I am, an adult who learns from his mistakes, control his emotions and can be smart enough to think. On the other hand, my mom didn't do the same to my lil bro when he was young and since he's a teenager and you know how teenagers are including myself; they're greedy, selfish, and get's mad easily. But for my lil bro, oh boy, he's 2x all of that that he needs to be taken into an asylum.

I'm just gonna say that he has some mental issues because if you make him mad, he'll fuckin yell, stomp the floor, throw/slam/hit something, and eventually when he grows up he's gonna murder a person one day. Like today for example, it was my mom's birthday (and I feel so bad for her) and my brother was piss off that day, well the past few days cause he was pissed off that I (mistakenly) deleted his school attendance message when he wasn't home. Oh before I continue, another thing about him is that this guy has like fuckin stress anxiety, like if you piss him off or do something that bugs him like the deleted message for example, he'll stress about it and won't get over it for a long time.

Anyways back to the story, so yeah basically my mom for some reason wished for me and my lil bro to not get piss with each other and to talk it out with each other. And I was laughing while walking away to my room and said that there's no point of talking cause my lil bro's never gonna change. Then he all of a sudden went berserk that he was literally almost was gonna kill me when I was walking away and yelled ""WHY YOU DELETE MY MESSAGE HUH? YOU FUCKIN B1TCH! WHY?"" HE LITERALLY YELLED THE F-BOMB AND B1TCH IN FRONT OF MY PARENTS! My mom cried and tried to calm him down and talk it out with him. But did she ignore the fact that he yelled the F-bomb? Like literally she gotta be pissed off at him but NOOO, she talked it out with him and she said to him that ""I know you love me and do all the things for me to make me happy, just ignore your brother as he is a bad person, if you see he does something that is not right just tell me....""

ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?! DID SHE NOT SEE HIM GO BERSERK AND THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO MURDER SOMEONE?!? LIKE HE CAN'T EVEN CONTROL HIMSELF! AND THE FACT THAT SHE TOLD HIM THAT I'M A BAD PERSON, THAT FUCKIN TRIGGERED ME!

My mom didn't even disciplined him properly when he was young which she made him into this mental dumb ass piece of shit BUT SHE STILL LOVES HIM AND ON HIS SIDE?! Oh going back it's because this kid is winning for ""Mommy's boy"". This kid has fuckin mental issues who can't control himself, can't do things fast enough or be smart enough, and tries so hard to piss me off, while for me, I can control myself, I do things faster and I am smart enough to learn what is right and wrong and how to fix it, and I've done mostly everything to help my parents.

I keep telling my mom about my lil bro many times, years ago, she always says that she knows and that she loves both of us. Really? She told him I was a bad person and she said she loves us both? Pft, one day when years past by, my lil bro is gonna murder someone and my mom will come back to me and regret everything she said to me and will say sorry. Well, it's too late for that and it's on her for not teaching her 2nd child properly.",18Feb2019,1

250,"Okay so a little backstory. 
When we were very young he was my favorite cousin. Constantly going way out of his way to make me and sisters laugh. He was my favorite out of all of my cousins. 
As we got older, he started wanting to play a game called ‚ÄúHide and seek in the dark‚Äù where me and my sister and her friend would go hide in the basement with all of the lights off and he‚Äôd have to come find us. I don‚Äôt know if he only did it to me, i‚Äôm assuming not due to the darkness, it seems like he would purposely ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù feel me up. Either by accidentally touching my boobs or butt but it was never for long. I always brushed it off as i was really young and so was he. After i started middle school, we were still close and would hangout anytime we had holiday get together at my grandmas house. 
When i was in eighth grade i went through a very dark time, Cutting myself, drinking alarming amounts of cough syrup, mixing pills i found in my grandmas and my parents medicine cabinets. My depression was very well known in my family. I attempted suicide many times but luckily was never sent to a hospital. One night I decided to stay the night at my grandmas, I was only 13, and after he found out i was, he decided to also. After my grandma fell asleep, he told me (i can‚Äôt remember very clearly) that he had somehow got ahold of some pills that were supposed to make you hallucinate or some shit, and we could take them in the basement. I don‚Äôt remember much. All i remember is my grandma coming down stairs and catching us, I vaguely remember either his or my underwear were down. After this we grew apart and i stopped talking to him, other than casual hello and goodbye at holidays. 

Fast forward a year later, It‚Äôs thanksgiving and me and my sister go back in the guest room at my grandmas house to chat. We sit on the couch in the room and we talk casually. He eventually follows and plops himself on the bed in front of us and plays a game in his phone without putting any input into me and my sisters conversation. I get a text from my sister as i‚Äôm gazing at my phone and she says to look at my cousin. I do, and he‚Äôs staring straight between my legs, (i‚Äôm wearing a skirt.) I close my legs immediately and get up to go to the living room. 

A year later my family moved two hours away and we stop talking completely, to the point we rarely acknowledge eachother even at family get togethers. 


If you don‚Äôt want to read the backstory, Start here:


Last week my grandma broke her ankle and is unable to do anything herself. As i still live two hours away, I decided i‚Äôd get my shift for work transferred so i can come out and take care of her while my sister is unable to, who lives a lot closer than i do. I arrive and notice he‚Äôs here, again i don‚Äôt acknowledge him as it‚Äôs become a tradition to ignore eachother. I sit and talk to my grandma for about three hours while he sits on his phone. I do the dishes for her, Cook her a good meal and make her some coffee. Around 5 pm she needs help to the bathroom, which i do, and after she‚Äôs done she says she just wants to lay down. It being so early i go back into the living room and turn on a disney movie and start cleaning up, which is when my cousin pipes up and asks if grandma went to bed. I said yeah and that‚Äôs when he decides to come to kitchen and sit at the island and start talking really inappropriately about how many girls he goes through, about how many girls he‚Äôs ‚Äúfucked‚Äù within the past month. I don‚Äôt respond much other than making a comment here and there about my boyfriend and i, But not once anything sexual as i was sure my grandma could probably hear us because she had her door taken off so she can get through easily with her wheel chair. He tells me he‚Äôs been doing cocaine and asks if i‚Äôve ever done hard drugs. I told him due to my childhood i would never even consider it.After this i start hinting towards being tired hoping he‚Äôd get the hint and leave, as he has no point in being here when he isn‚Äôt contributing to helping out my grandma. I go to sit on the couch and watch the rest of Pok√©mon 2000 and pull out my handy dandy DS and start playing pok√©mon as well. He asks if he can watch and gets a little too close for comfort. I feel uneasy and my mind goes blank and i forget what i‚Äôm doing on the game. Eventually i close it and say i‚Äôm going to bed soon hoping he‚Äôd leave. He asks which room i‚Äôm sleeping in which is an odd question to me, and i say i‚Äôm sleeping in my grandmas room with her to make sure she‚Äôs okay throughout the night. He says ‚ÄúOh okay, I‚Äôm going to sleep in the basement.‚Äù I say okay and get up to leave when he asks if i wanted to watch one more movie and he‚Äôd run up to RedBox and get one. We agree on a PG movie and he asks if i want to come with him and i say no. He leaves and comes back with a different movie than we agreed on and he puts it in. It extremely raunchy to the point i feel uncomfortable and tell him i‚Äôm heading to bed. 
Not really sure how to handle this situation, and i‚Äôve never told anyone about the incident that i vaguely remember happening in the basement and neither has he or my grandma (i assume as it‚Äôs never been brought up) I always felt like my grandma believed i somehow seduced him into doing whatever happened and me and my grandma also somewhat grow apart after this.

I‚Äôve also had this happen at home for all of my life. Every time I pass a room in the hallway I feel like someone is standing in the rooms staring at me, especially when it‚Äôs dark and my anxiety is higher.

Another example is that I was at a friend‚Äôs home where I was heading upstairs, but I saw a figure standing behind me for a moment, staring at me. A second one appeared on the second flight of stairs but I reassured myself they were fake as I went upstairs to stop myself from being so scared.


My last example is from work again. I saw my coworker go around the corner, but I looked over and she was standing elsewhere. She never went around the corner. It was only the two of us there at the time.


Almost every time it is out of the corner of my sight, but I can feel their presence very heavily.

256,"I am a 20M, and  just 2 days before 2019 was fully prepared to kill myself.  


Needless to say I'm still here! I've had dark thoughts for as long as I can remember, but nothing like this. I have been feeling increasingly more and more numb and hopeless about my situation the past few years (despite efforts to improve). I eat reasonably healthy, I excercise, I do all of that stuff. I have a good friend circle who I know cares about me and would do anything for me blah blah blah. But as of late, again things have become heavy. Food has lost taste, music (which is part of my degree) has become flat. I feel like the passions in my life are being rung out like a rag. However I still have a desire to see the world. And my family has invested too much into me to put that to shame. I want to better my situtation even if it seems futile. Since my close run in, I have just been afraid of an other moment of passion which could turn dire. Perhaps when I am put in every day dangerous situation such as driving or admiring the skylines or heaven forbin cutting veggies!   


 What pushed me to make this post is I came home for reading week and silently broke down in front of my mom and couldn't bring myself to tell her what has been going on or what happened at the end of last year. (She knows I've been ""sad"" just not to the degree she thinks). She suggested the family doctor this Tuesday. I agreed to go and talk. His never been a presser for over-medicing and such. I just don't know what to do if anti-depressions are suggested? How do I ever go about talking to my doctor about this if I couldn't even tell my mom? How do I mend this general void? I'm just at a lose and any words or advice would be gratefully appericated.  
I'm open to any questions.

257,"It's late December 2017 and im texting my current girlfriend on snapchat. we've been talking since late 2016 but became friends with benefits in october of 2017 i think, i can't remember honestly. we were on 3rd base all the time in secret but haven't gotten on 4th yet. we would do everything together though. my free time would be spent around her, so much so that her parents knew we would be together and we're trying to push us together. i really liked her. i would've done anything for her. how naive i was. anyways, one day she asks me if i want to hang out with her past her curfew and of course i say yes immediately. i told her that i'll pick her up. she asks ""you know how to drive?"". ""of course i do"" i told her. i didn't. i wanted to impress her and i knew if i showed up at her place driving, it'd only be a matter of time before she's all over me and only me. i forgot to mention, at the time she was talking to 3 other dude as well as me but i was top priority to her since we we're doing things the rest weren't so i wasn't even worried about the other guys. it did irritate me though how she would let the guys give her hickeys on her tits and how she didnt want to tell them we were friends with benefits but again, i wasn't worried. back to the story, she said ""ok come by at 10:30"". as soon as i read that, i started sweating. i had to figure out what to where, what cologne to put on, and how i would get one of my dads cars for the night in the first place. but my luck was on another level that day because i found the perfect nonchalant outfit and used up the last bit of the cologne i remember she said she liked. as for the car, my dad and my cousin, who was staying with us at the time, went out to drink. i knew where my dad kept his spare key for the other car so i figured id have the car for the rest of the night. i took the car at 10:30 (also forgot to mention me and my girlfriend were 17 at the time) and started heading to her place. this was maybe my 5th time driving and i was terrified something would happen and i'd be fucked but i wanted to see her. When i got to her place, i texted her saying ‚Äúim here‚Äù. She said ‚Äúok give me a minute‚Äù. I wait 20 minutes for her to sneak out her window and her side gate. Once i saw her, i froze. Almost like i blacked out or something. She got in my car and i swear i still feel the awkwardness to this day. I started driving and we started talking. I didn‚Äôt even know where we were going but i didn't care. I was enjoying her presence. All of a sudden i had the urge to just stop the car, get in the backseat with her, and fucking her brains out. At the time we were both virgins but we were horny as hell. I didn't want to throw the idea out there though just in case she wasn't in the mood. And looking back at my backseat, we wouldn't be able to move. She then says ‚Äúlets hang at a park‚Äù. I say ‚Äúalright‚Äù. I saw this as a chance. Maybe if we find a park, we could get to 4th base. I google parks and to no surprise they're all closed. I then remember elementary schools have playgrounds that stay open. I google elementary schools and started driving. We went to maybe 4 different parks before we found one. When i parked and got out, i remembered the weather. Of all days in the area i live, which is always hot, it's 64 degrees. That killed any opportunity for us to do anything sexually but we still hung at the park talking and playing. She actually made a video of us that day that she still has. all that fun lasted for all of 20 minutes. Remember how i told the car? Well my dad was back home wondering where me and his car was. He called and called but i ignored the calls just to spend a little more time with her. I then started getting calls from my whole family and realized i had to leave. So did she. I answered my dad heard him yell for a bit then said i'm coming. It was quite the drive to take her more but i could just leave her there. Once we got to her place, things got even more awkward. We couldn't park in front her house so we parked down the street. I wanted to kiss her goodbye and she could tell but wanted to see how i would do it. I come up with the great idea and said ‚Äúyou got something on your face‚Äù then leaned in. she couldn't hold back her laugh. Neither could i. Once we finished laughing, she leaned in and so did i. That kiss was passionate. I still feel it to this day. She got out and snuck back in. i knew as soon as i got home, i'd be fucked. Scolded till the end of time but i didn't care. That night to me at the time was the best night of my life. I went home with a big ass smile.

2 days later she loses her virginity to this kid shes know for a long time. Her reason for doing this? ‚ÄúI knew him for a long time and i told him he'd be my first and after him id fuck other guys‚Äù. I couldn't believe it. I was so mad. I wanted to stop talking to her but obviously i didn't. I was so confused and just put in a bad space. I felt betrayed. We started going out a month after. She took my virginity 2 months later. I can never forget nor forgive her for what she did. Our relationship isn't even healthy. We've broken up 4 times but somehow always come back to each other. She's making me stop talking to one of my closest female friend just because a year ago she didn't invite my girlfriend to her birthday party. She beats up on me when i piss her off which is not hard to do since she has short temper and gets mad when i block one of her slaps. You know i think her and the dude she fucked were meant for eachother since both got the mind and body of a child. The dude was literally 2 years younger than her.I've been told a thousand times to dump her and move on but i just can't for some reason. I somehow see a future with her and her the same with me. The way i see it, no ones perfect and we all make mistakes but the mistake she made a year ago will always get to me. Also if i were to leave her, id have to make sure i have a back up hoe or something but i'm too loyal to do that or cheat. I want her to know how i feel but it's just not possible and im not to sure if i could live with myself if i made someone feel the way i do. I don't want to break up with her again while were in high school because then it'll be awkward seeing her around the school. Were about to hit our 1 year and 2 month anniversary but i don't know how much longer we'll be together if things don't change. 

Well that's the end of my story, if you actually read all this, congratulations! And thanks. Please let me know if you got any comments or advice. If the way i feel can go away, i'd like to know how. I honestly hate telling this story as it only makes me hate her more and more. She tells me she loves me alot and i say it back every time but i'm not too sure i mean it. I just might be saying it so she thinks nothings wrong‚Ä¶

266,"Brief background: I was born to a single, homeless, junky mother and basically buried my head in textbooks until getting a degree and a good paying job. I‚Äôm now 30 and stable, but I have no clue what a typical lifestyle actually looks like. I feel completely aimless now that I‚Äôve secured a decent job; I‚Äôm in a sort of existential funk, I suppose. To combat this, I decided to define my values and start building goals around them. 

After tremendous amounts of self reflection I have devised the following list of values in the hope of bringing more clarity and purpose to my life. 

I must still develop goals around these values, but I wanted to check in and ask if I‚Äôm approaching life correctly here, or if perhaps I‚Äôm way off track. I don‚Äôt have anyone in my life, and so I‚Äôm lacking frame of reference. 

My values:
Liberty - To choose how I live and behave, and help others do likewise. 

Respect - To be respectful towards myself and others; to be polite, considerate, and show positive regard. 

Curiosity - To be curious, open-minded and interested, to explore, discover, and collaborate. 
‚ÄúAsk good questions.‚Äù

Community - To be part of a system, to cooperate, collaborate, and build a sense of connectedness and support. ‚ÄúIt takes a village.‚Äù

Order - To be organized, let all thing have their places; let each part of your business have its time. 

Prosperity - To thrive and flourish in health, happiness, relationships, and work, and to help others do the same. ‚ÄúA rising tide lifts all boats.‚Äù",18Feb2019,1

268,"Hello!
I need some advice.

My partner and I have been saving up to move into our first apartment together.
I‚Äôm 26, she‚Äôs 22.
I *really* need to move out. I‚Äôve lived at home for far too long and it‚Äôs way past the time to be an actual adult.
Plus, my girl and I (and our pup, Meatloaf!) need our own space.

Pros of moving out :
Adulting 
Having our own space
More time together

I have serious anxiety issues, so I had a bit of a mental breakdown the other night. During this breakdown, I had this idea to quit my job and take a one to two month vacation with my girl to figure out wtf I want to do in life. I‚Äôve been so unhappy and stressed out that I really just want a break.
My girlfriend was obviously okay with it. She‚Äôs quite a bit younger than me (four years), so her timeline is a little different and even though she wants to move out too, she‚Äôs not as eager.
My reasoning for vacationing was mostly because-
We are having some issues. Not so much relationship ones, but life ones.
I‚Äôm a manager at a coffee shop, and she‚Äôs a supervisor, We‚Äôve both been working there for three years. Our lives are like clockwork.
Wake up, walk the dog, go to work, come home, go to the gym, sleep.
We hardly even have ‚Äúalone time‚Äù with each other. Neither of us are happy with our jobs or our lives, and we have no idea what we want to do.
I‚Äôm scared if we move out it‚Äôll be the exact same thing, except we‚Äôll have even less money. 

I really think a mental break and a fresh start is what we both need, but I‚Äôm scared it‚Äôll just push me back another year and then I‚Äôll be 27 still living at home! 

But I‚Äôm also thinking, like, I‚Äôm still young and who knows if I‚Äôll even be alive next year? I should travel while I‚Äôm young.

It might help to note that I have a progressive incurable disease that may flare up in about 20 years, so sometimes I think I just want to live my life to the fullest so I can feel like my life as worth it, and how will I live my life if I‚Äôm eating pb&amp;js in a studio apartment?

Like what the fuck?? So I explained to her that I was upset about something completely different and I wasn‚Äôt upset with my boyfriend if that‚Äôs what she thought. She acted all normal and was like oh alright, whatever.
But I‚Äôm still really upset, me and boyfriend have been together a year. 
I know for a fact he is my soulmate, I love him more than anything, and he loves me. He completes me In every way, he supports me, he looks at me like the only girl on the face of this earth, i love him with everything in me, he truly saved me from myself, I was In a bad place when we met, and I can truly say I‚Äôve become more of the person I want to be when I‚Äôm with him, he makes me feel fearless and like I can take on the world when he‚Äôs with me. He makes me feel so damn beautiful. I just love him so much guys, he‚Äôs everything to me, and I won‚Äôt let anyone hurt him, or take him from me. It would shatter my baby‚Äôs heart if he knew that they felt like this, But I love my parents too and I need to deal with this shit. 
Please tell me, how should I go about this? I don‚Äôt want them to hate him, and i don‚Äôt want him go get hurt..",18Feb2019,3

The thing is that it‚Äôs 1200 miles away from where I‚Äôm at and my entire family lives here in my home state and I‚Äôm a little nervous about making the move by myself. I‚Äôm so close with my immediate family so on one hand...I‚Äôm not sure if I could fully adjust to not being able to see them as often as I do now. On the other...I am so sick of where I live. Seasonal depression hits me so hard and our winter/cold weather here lasts seemingly forever and I hate it. 
I also worry about making the move and what if I don‚Äôt make any friends? And then I‚Äôm totally alone and secluded in an unfamiliar city. Would I end up resenting the experience and feeling like I‚Äôve in some ways wasted my time? 

10 years from now when I look back at this time in my life I just wonder in the end which I would end up regretting more...
-staying where I‚Äôm at in a city/climate I dislike and not moving elsewhere to discover new things/meet new people/the growth that comes with the challenges of new experiences
or
-moving away by myself and losing time with my family who I am very close with

278,"This story has a lot of levels, so bare with me. I met this girl at work and we became best friends almost immediately, but I had a girlfriend at the time so nothing happened. The day me and my girlfriend broke up, we slept together, and it was an instant connection. We fell in love, hard. We started seeing each other everyday, and trying to figure out how to make this work while also working together. So fast forward (leaving some details out that I don‚Äôt feel are necessary but you‚Äôre more than welcome to ask if this is too all over the place) we start talking about this girl from my hometown and she obviously does not appreciate the way this girl treats me as a friend so I tell her I‚Äôm going to cut things off with her, because she was extremely toxic person in my life. So this story is easier to understand let‚Äôs call girl I fell in love with Christina, and girl from hometown Julia. So I planned to cut Julia out of my life, but Christina and I got into a big fight and I wanted to get Julia‚Äôs advice on it so I‚Äôm able to have a female perspective on it. The next night I go over to Christina‚Äôs and she sees my phone and sees that I lied about cutting Julia out of my life, and I lied again to her because I was scared of loosing her (obviously this was the wrong decision and I know I‚Äôm completely in the wrong for this) so all trust is lost. Due to the amount of love we had for each other we kept trying to work things out but it just wouldn‚Äôt work. I tried everything to turning my location on, texting her 24/7 and always telling her where I‚Äôm at, but obviously none of it was helping. I love this girl, and made a mistake but now she has decided to take a break from us, and not talk to me until she feels comfortable.

279,"tltr: How do you expand your social horizons?

I‚Äôve always experienced social anxiety and just being awkward around people. I have my same set of friends from highschool and below, but I‚Äôve retreated into my little bubble since then. How do you expand your circle and ease social anxiety?

I don‚Äôt know what it is and why I don‚Äôt want to go out with friends, even the ones I‚Äôve known for years. I used to be able to go out and have fun effortlessly, I was even excited and looked forward to the outings (with people I know).

How do you push yourself to be more social and courageous?

Speaking of friends, I‚Äôve had the same friends since high school and they‚Äôve all grown into fine young adults and have moved on with their lives. Now I‚Äôm stuck on the same schedule, work, school, sleep.

I‚Äôve always had trust issues in relationships as well. Not to ‚Äúpull the victim card‚Äù here but normally I sense when things are off, and I‚Äôm normally right unfortunately. 

From the beginning I questioned this when it started, and I was told ‚ÄúNot to worry because it was the past‚Äù. I believed this for a bit, and everything went back to feeling alright. 

Fast forwarding to current day, I started to feel weird again like something was off. So I made an account and messaged my S/O to test her and she what she would say.

I had a full conversation about meeting up behind my back, she gave out my work schedule so they could ‚Äúwork out days‚Äù, she‚Äôs sent pictures, the whole nine yards.

283,"My little brother can't take any criticism at all. He sees everything you say to him about his behavior as a personal attack on him. For example, we have a rule in our house that you close the door behind you, as it creates a chilly draft if you leave it open. If I ask my brother 'would you please close the door' he rolls his eyes, does a long sigh and nearly smashes the door out of its hinges. He then gets mad if my parents (M58, F53) say something about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Another example. Last week my little brother totally panicked because he got the flu and wasn't able to go to school to take a test for his German classes. For the test, he had to learn a list of words in our own language (Dutch) and the German translation  This was on Tuesday evening, and he had the test on Wednesday.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom kept him home for the week with the promise that he would study and that he would know all words on first page. It turns out he didn't study at all and there was no progress between Tuesday and last night. My mom (understandably) got very mad at him, saying he didn't do jack shit. 

&amp;#x200B;

My brother just shrugged and said: 'yeah, so what?'. This made my mom even madder at him and started a full on shouting match between her and my brother. Another phrase my brother uses is: 'well if YOU see it that way then it must be true' which shows no respect to my mothers opinion at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

Doors were slammed and my mother started crying. After she left my brother looked at me and our dad and said: 'well that was exaggerated.'

&amp;#x200B;

He just doesn't see what the effects of his behavior are, and I have no idea what we can do about it. The mood at home has worsened quite a bit over the last few years, as this behavior has been going on for quite some time.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no idea what might cause this. It could be just your average teenager stuff, but I think there's more to it. I must note that I have high functioning Asperger's, and that it tends to run in families. I do not think my little brother has it too, or he must be extremely good at masking it, which means someone with Asperger's acts like a 'normal' person, but it drains a lot of energy, both emotionally and physically, which in turn causes more extreme behavior in the person who is masking. 

&amp;#x200B;

My moms throws it on the 'he's a difficult teenager because I was one too' pile and doesn't want to get him tested. She is someone who is very quickly to close off a topic. If you don't act on it almost immediately it's closed off forever with the phrase 'well now you don't need to anymore'.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know it anymore. On one side it's my parents role to raise my brother, on the other side we all are feeling the effect of my brothers behavior.

284,"There's this guy who sat next to me in classes last semester. He's a valedictorian from his high school with a 4.0 gpa, research in his undergrad, and took all the classes Im taking now in high school. I'm a sophomore who flunked last semester for slacking off, so now I put as much effort as I can into all of my classes, practically working myself to tears for Bs in my coursework. 

This guy used to be someone I called a friend. We would talk a lot, and the only thing he enjoyed discussing was just how smart he was for not paying attention in class and receiving A's for it. At the time, I figured I was just as smart as he was. For whatever reason, he became more and more critical of me as time moved on. He started saying ""you spend too much time studying"" or ""you have no free time"". A few months later, and he tells me that it's sad that someone like me trys so hard, and that I should consider other majors more suited to my intelligence. It's been 5 months now, and today he flat out tells me that I'll never amount to anything, and that suicide is a decent option for morons like me. 

I want to avoid him, but he sits next to me in a small class every 3 days of the week, and he's friends with all my friends at uni. I want to fight back, but I know he can refute everything I say.

I expected him to man up and find a fucking job, which he tried but nothing was good enough so he quit every single job he started, in the span of 2 days. 
Now it has passed more than a month, he promised he would pay me back and get his life together, which didn't happen, what a surprise...
For me this amount of money I borrowed him is a shit ton of money and I need it back fast because I have some utilities to pay and I have nowhere to pay it from because of him.
Now that everyone backed out of his life and nobody wants to help him anymore (since he probably lied 100 times to them as well) he is pretty fucked up, again on the verge of being homeless and he owes me tons.
I'm fucking desperate because I need the money and basically what happened is he told me that he is gonna try the last thing he can today, and if it doesn't work, he will kill himself. In his words, he's ashamed of himself, he was never in this situation and what bothers him the most is that he betrayed him.
So this fucker will not only not pay me back, he will serve me a delightful trauma of killing himself which I'll never be able to forget or forgive myself.

303,"How the tables can turn - from amazing sex to now feeling like there‚Äôs no trust.

Brief outline - my girlfriend of almost 4 years studies at a different university. It‚Äôs her second year which means she‚Äôs flatting with 5 other girls (I only like 1 of them, the other 4 are terrible influences with bad drugs and alcohol habits). Tonight they‚Äôre currently having a flat party. She wouldn‚Äôt tell me how many people were going but I‚Äôd assume 50+ and obviously people crashing.

She had assured me that she‚Äôd update me on the night every now and then (obviously I‚Äôm not expecting her to text every 5 minutes because that‚Äôs not right). Maybe the odd text on how it‚Äôs going, if they‚Äôre going out anywhere or if anything‚Äôs happened.

Now if I ever go out (which is incredibly rare) I make sure she‚Äôs updated, whether it‚Äôs I‚Äôm going to a location I hadn‚Äôt stated earlier on, or I‚Äôm leaving to go home or whatever the case may be.

The party starts at 7pm and I know this because she just stops snap chatting me. I get my first Snapchat about 1.5 hours later (which is fine). But then nothing since. I could see on snap maps she had been active after I had replied (Snapchat doesn‚Äôt just ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù make you active, you physically have to open the app). 

Anyway, time rolls on, I start to get a little upset cause usually I will start to send several annoying messages like ‚Äúhello?‚Äù ‚Äú???‚Äù ‚ÄúHELLOOOOOO?‚Äù But I‚Äôve resisted. I used to do that and make her feel guilty, but have made sure I didn‚Äôt do that. Instead I‚Äôve just allowed her to do her thing in trust and hope I get updates.

Now a little backstory; she has had a habit of saying she will update and communicate but never does. It‚Äôs happened twice over the last fortnight and it‚Äôs happened again, at a massive party a few hundred km‚Äôs away with a bunch of ransoms. The last time she didn‚Äôt update me all I got was a message from her one friend ‚Äúmilly can‚Äôt speak right now‚Äù and I found out 2 days later she had been throwing up all night and had essentially coma‚Äôd (the term for blacking out).

Almost 4.5 hours later, the first update I get is a text message ‚Äúhi I‚Äôm safe‚Äù. Like what does this even mean? Am I her friend? Does she not care about how I feel at all? Does she not care about communication?

Do I have every right to feel upset? Question what‚Äôs really going on? 

I‚Äôm not going to reply to that. I‚Äôm just leaving it in hopes she will send me a proper one at the end of the night. But it‚Äôs pretty shit, knowing she‚Äôs also been on Snapchat several times but ignored my one from earlier in the evening. 

TL;DR - My girlfriend sends me a text ‚Äúhi I‚Äôm okay‚Äù as the only update after almost 4.5 hours being at a party with fandoms.",18Feb2019,1

309,"So I have these 2 friends let's call em Ron and Kate and they recently started seeing each other and it's been a sort of disaster. Within 5 days of getting together they had a fight and then broke up. Soon after they were back together. Ron was a decent man he always told his parents if he was going out with someone be it with a girl or a guy and his parents were pretty cool with that but since he started seeing her he has been lying to his parents about seeing her. They found out he was with because she gave him love bites and stuff. Ron's mom has clearly told him she doesn't accept Kate (which I am presuming is because of all the lies) Ron used to be a fairly smart dude when it came to studies and stuff but since he started seeing his grades have dropped as low as 50% all the way from 80% in basically all subjects. Ron also ended telling one of his best friends to her face that he trusts Kate more than her. (Which obviously hurt that friend and prompted her to end her friendship with him). Now comes the incessant kissing they are making out in theater she is sitting on his lap in the train. There's a shower of kisses on the forehead and cheeks. Which makes their friends around him uncomfortable. When Ron is with Kate he only speaks to her while others disappear in the background. His other friends have started to notice that too. After the college gets over they board the train and he gets of at her station (he lives at the next station) and spends a solid hour with her before heading home. While his parents think he is at college. His skips class like there's no tommorow. Now let's get to Kate she has been doing the same thing. She too lies to her mum and it's not like her mum is against her dating. She cuts herself (this has been going on for a long time before they started seeing each other) she also has acquired the taste of lying to everyone around not just her mum. She also doesn't have much time left to live because of her medical conditions (4-5 months topd) but they are ""happy"" together (which I highly doubt hence the quotation marks) now the real question is should I intervene and stop this shenanigans should I let them be and let them do what they want to do without saying anything and letting them continue on a path of self destruction or am I just overthinking",18Feb2019,1

311,"Before y'all ask, this is a actual thing that happened just an hour ago. It's not fake to whoever thinks Parents or Family members won't be able to act like this.

Disclaimer : I'm not good at writing whatsoever so bare with me and my habit of abruptly ending anything and repeating my points.

I have a really close friend (A) who has one hell of a family which literally doesn't trust her and accuses her of anything. Her sister (1) constantly accuses her of stealing her money because she was told where it was, her Mother (M) kept saying the entire family was disappointed in her outcome and her Dad (D) was basically the same as her mum but just outright fierce af and completely biased. Her brother (B) and 2nd sister (2) are rarely there and lives in area not close to our district.

Some Background Story : A went through depression just last year and managed to recover after I and some other friends helped her out and convinced her to find a Counsellor which worked. She nearly suicided several times and her family wasn't helping at all so she depended on me alot to listen to her troubles or talk her out of suicide (was hard but I got lucky). 
Her Depression nearly came back twice when her Ex (NH) had sex with her or literally forced herself on a girl smaller than him and caused a Pregnancy Scare for the 2nd half of the year. The 2nd time was just last month when her 'beloved' M went batshit crazy and decided A should get back with the same Ex without even thinking about what A has to say. The worse part is her family even encourage M's decision and had a actual meeting about A and her Ex.

A has told me so many times she felt like her family doesn't care about her and disregarded her opinions on issues involving her. Often talking about her openly in the living room. 1 also has been forcing A to take care of her kids despite A having her own studies to do and our education system is demanding as fuck. (The excuse was because 1 is busy.) Her family has also discussed about whether A should drop her match she has worked so hard for in order to take care of 1's kid when M was virtually available the entire day and 'couldn't take care of kids' for 2 hours... The treatment A has received from her family was crazy to the point she disappeared from her house until about 2 am several times. She has felt unloved 24/7, never felt safe in her own damn house in a country where we are considerably safer than the rest, she has been told she was a mistake from birth, a disappointed and some of them wished she was never born at all. Her family accused her of theft, forced her to sacrifice her own work to take care of 1's Kid, not respecting them because she prefers the people who LOVES HER LIKE FAMILY over her actual family. They have said alot of things and my memory has been getting bad considering the amount of shit she really went through within 1 and a half years. 
And right now, 1 accused A of stealing her $550 of $1000 from her purse that she left in A's room and M went on to accuse A also and was dead serious in thinking A took the money to the point of thinking about bringing A to the police and currently I don't know what to do so I have to ask you guys for advices or even help right now.

They are a couple with two young children and they basically have the exact opposite lifestyle to a typical university student. I'm now realising that my parents may have jumped for me to stay here because they want to control me better than when I was doing my undergrad. 

The family are very nice and welcoming, so the only thing I could say is an issue is the fact that I can't really go out partying or anything and come home late without disrupting their home life. It would seem disrespectful. And also they are very religious, and my entire family is under the impression that I am too - I don't really believe in a higher power.

I was shocked and in denial at first, but when I thought about it I realized that there had been some resistance that I guess I chose to ignore. She asked to stop in the middle and I did but I started back up again without asking her first. Many of my friends have cut me off after this (the victim and I have lots of mutuals), and I am dealing with serious guilt and suicidal thoughts. I have stopped going to places where the victim and my friends might go, and am trying to keep to myself and maintain a respectful distance from everyone.

I can't kill myself because that would be irresponsible and would just hurt people even more. I need to be accountable for what I have done, and that means staying alive for now. I'm going to a therapist and I still have a few friends that I hang out with and talk to because I need the social connection to help myself stay stable enough to try and make things right. What else can I do? I know that there is no shortcut or quick fix, I need to thing long term. I have noticed that there is a pattern of behavior where I have violated consent in one way or another which I had to apologize for later on. I am working on these issues, but what else can I do?

My brother is the closest thing to me, but when I'm in this state, I feel nothing for him. Every one is like mist.

324,"Hello, I don‚Äôt know which subreddit to post this in so I‚Äôll leave it here. If you know a better place - please redirect me there.

For my whole life I‚Äôve been obsessed with trying new things. I mean, when new flavour of crisps comes out - I will feel anxious unless I try it. When my country announced new banknotes, I was shaking every single day until I was first in line to bank the day they released them. If an app updates - I‚Äôm updating it the same second it comes out. I participate in every beta test I can. 

The problem is : I‚Äôm never satisfied with any of these things once I reach them. I‚Äôd call it ‚Äúemotion prefire‚Äù. I feel good THINKING about doing something for the first time but once I did it - I don‚Äôt need it anymore. And this search for new things is not healthy. I don‚Äôt hesitate trying any new drug. I don‚Äôt hesitate when offered something new no matter how dangerous it is. And what‚Äôs more disturbing for me is that I feel very depressed and anxious unless I have a new spark in my heart, a new goal to try something new. I can spend a week doing nothing, laying in my bed without any will to live but then I hear about new game that I like - I will spend 12 hours swapping buses but I will get it - and basically forget about it the moment I do and lay for another week without any will to do anything.

I wanted to try different drugs because I heard so much about them in media, from friends etc. But once I tried them - I never took them again. I always wanted to try more. Alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, cocaine, LSD, no matter what - after I tried it for the first time - I felt VERY disappointed because it was nowhere near what I expected it to be and never took it again. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm keeping my curiosity low in this sphere and don‚Äôt feel that obsessed with trying new drugs - at least for now.

And it happens with everything.

I dreamed my whole teenager life to have sex but once I had it - I don‚Äôt like it since then and do it only for my girlfriend‚Äôs satisfaction.

I always felt desperate to find a GF but now I‚Äôm dating my first for 2 years. This relationship is incredible, we love each other so much. But if it somehow ends one day - I‚Äôm almost sure I won‚Äôt seek for another because no matter how cool and harmonic it is now - relationship is still 10000 times not as cool as I expected.

I‚Äôve tried any cuisine I can think of, I‚Äôve been to every country I could possibly afford. But once I get there - I don‚Äôt want to be there anymore.
I‚Äôve never admired any piece of architectural art - I expect something mind blowing but instead all I get is gray buildings with ‚Äúso what?‚Äù drawings. There never has been a single piece of art in any museum I‚Äôve ever visited that caught my interest even for a moment.

I always thought ‚Äúwoah earning money must be cool‚Äù but once I got my first job - I never felt like a want to work anymore.

I dreamt about getting to university - I lost any desire to study after a month.

I tried drawing, singing, playing musical instruments, writing books, poems, I tried EVERY common hobby out there - but gave it up after very short time.

It‚Äôs not like I haven‚Äôt found MY thing yet - it‚Äôs just because I don‚Äôt like ANYTHING. 

I don‚Äôt have high demands - I always felt thankful for what I have. But I have never ever enjoyed it.

For the last couple of years I‚Äôve been depressed and very desperate to find a will to live. I will spend a week thinking about suicide until I finally find new little thing to live for - until I get it.

The problem is, it‚Äôs getting harder and harder to find these things and I spend more and more time thinking about suicide. There hasn‚Äôt been a single day for at least a year now when I didn‚Äôt think: ‚ÄúSomething is wrong with me as a human, I don‚Äôt want to live like that anymore.‚Äù I make up a lot of absurd theories about what‚Äôs exactly wrong with my mindset but the conclusion is always ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to live like that‚Äù. And objectively speaking - I feel very bad about my future. I‚Äôm only turning 20 soon but I think I won‚Äôt live 20 more. 

Worst thing is that I never had anyone to talk about it with. I have my parents alive but I never had a FAMILY. I never shared any emotions or feelings with them. I hide 90% of my thoughts and feeling from my GF too. I just feel like I won‚Äôt be understood - and the moment it will happen - I will have zero reasons to live. I‚Äôve wanted to ask random people on internet for help for at least a year now - this is my first scream for help.

What can I do?

TL:DR I never feel happy or satisfied with ANYTHING I do and this mindset causes me to think more and more about not living at all.

325,"There isn't really much to say with this one.

She's been my best friend since I got to college, but since last week or two, she has just refused to acknowledge me. Aside from the occasional one word response to a text, she is completely ignoring me. She even refuses to talk to me when I see her on campus, again only giving short responses and then saying she has to go, or just leaving as soon as she sees me. She even told me she doesn't want me to send her streaks anymore (daily messages on snapchat).

The kicker to all this? Nothing happened!

We were doing completely fine before all this. There was zero conflict between us. The closest thing to an argument leading up to this was when I tried to annoy her by purposefully mispronouncing people's names (which I apologized for after). And those one or two word responses she gives? She only gives them when I ask if there is something wrong. Her response being a simple ""No."". 

My best guess as to why she is doing this is because she recently started hanging out with a new group of people, who are quite the opposite of me. They are the more ""party every weekend"", popular kid kinda crowd. Which I have nothing against, but just isn't the thing I'm into. I think she thinks being friends with me will hurt her reputation in the group, since I'm kinda known as a ""weird kid"" on campus (not in the bad way). But that's just my anxiety ridden theory as to what is going on. It is also possible (and far more likely) that she just doesn't like me anymore, and wants to move on.

I'm posting this here because I'd like any advice on how to handle this situation. Currently I think the best option is to just cut my losses and move on, which would suck since I'm not as close a friend with anyone as I am with her. And that is really my biggest fear. Losing my only close friend on campus. Sure I know a lot of people, and a lot of those people would consider me a friend. But out of everyone here, I'd rather hang out with her the most.

327,"Hello r/Advice,

(tl;dr at the bottom)

I [24M] used to know this girl who was part of my high school friend group and for a little while after that. Unfortunately everyone treated her badly to varying degrees. She was the butt of every joke, the subject of ""mild"" sexual harassment (obviously any sexual harassment is wrong), and she her feeling didn't matter to anyone. She was just a verbal punching bag. Whenever she tried to stick up for herself, everyone would just make fun of her more for being ""dramatic"". I have no idea why she stuck around with us for that long. Personally, I never sexually harassed her or verbally abused her, but I did fail to stick up for her even when I knew her feelings were hurt really bad. I always felt bad for her... And I didn't do the right thing. Not doing the right thing is just as bad as doing the wrong thing. I might as well said and did the things everyone else did. 

The reason I thing this up now is because she slowly drifted away from our group that extended into our adult years. Eventually she just disappeared. The other day she randomly showed up on my Instagram feed, so I did some social media digging and found that she has really bad anxiety and depression. She lives in another part of the metropolitan area we live in and has a few close friends who seem to be treating her, you know, like a human being. I can't help but feel her anxiety and depression is directly related to how badly she was treated. 

I want to make things right and let her know her worth. While I was never into her romantically, but she always had a special place in my heart and still does. How would I even go about it appropriately? I want her to know I'm sorry, but I also don't want her to get triggered or anything like that from bringing up old bad memories. I'm just really ashamed about everything, the people I called friends, the way she was treated, how I didn't stick up for her...

Thanks for reading.

I used to draw actively, now I'm not having fun with it and get frustrated and trash what I try to draw very quickly; playing games (video games, board games, yugioh, etc) just gets me feeling down since I always lose in everything I try playing, or just generally fuck up so much I don't want to continue playing stuff for weeks at a time, even games I played frequently and know like the back of my hand are irritating me to no end; all I do at work on my breaks (and admittedly even when working)  is either sleep or try to read something, which even then I give up about halfway through break and go to sleep;at home all I do is sleep or get distracted trying to think of something to do for hours at a time.

When I confronted the person last night about them not being who they said they were and again asked who they were, they laughed and hung up! My skin is crawwwwling.

So do you think it‚Äôs some random pervert who called random numbers until he found a gullible woman, is that even something people do? Should I change my number (that I‚Äôve had for a decade) immediately or wait and see if I get more unwanted calls? Should I actually hope the person calls again so that I can question them, and if so what should I say? I‚Äôm pretty stumped and creeped out here.",18Feb2019,3

339,"I am currently living with my dad who has recently been let go due to his previous employer's financial troubles. He has been looking for work since the beginning of February but no luck has arisen yet. I am a foreign student who is also working, and we have enough savings to last for 6 months of rent, food and bills (if we budget appropriately, that is). 

He got hired from an agency to do work in a factory and it was going quite well. The money was good for the position, despite the long shifts, and we had some security. However, for his first week, they didn't pay him for 4 of his days. When he asked why, they told him it was because he didn't clock out so he tried to speak to the manager who said that it would be resolved the following week. When he got his next payslip, the money wasn't there so my dad got highly aggressive with the manager, telling him that he wouldn't work for them anymore if the issue wasn't resolved. The following week, after speaking with the receptionists, he got his money but the agency stopped sending him Text messages for the factory. 

Afterwards, he decided to send CVs online for tech positions. This lasted for a couple of weeks until he decided that it wouldn't happen this way. Then he went to an employment agency where they offered him work 15 miles away from home. He refused it because the job was too far away (even though he has a car). Then he went to another employment agency where he passed the induction last Thursday but he didn't get a call on the next day and doesn't know when his rota will be sent to him. Normally, I would have advised him to wait but just this morning he decided to ring the employment agency and said ""Am I going to start this week or should I go look for another job?"". Based on his words, they told him that he just has keep his phone by his side and wait for either a call or a text message.

I don't know whether he told them off or if he's actually going to wait for this text message, but I feel like my dad is becoming way too impatient, and in turn, is making his job search longer than it needs to be.  This has me very worried because apart from having to worry about University and work, I also have to think of a way to help my dad find a job and give him some advice. 

How can I help my dad to get through this difficult period? I am trying to help him as much as I can, but I can't help but feel the situation is becoming more and more hopeless.",18Feb2019,10

341,"We were both raised in very different environments. They were raised with strict traditions and are very religious. They had arranged marriage.

I was raised in a more western setting that was a bit more accepting and relaxing. A lot of my friends have also been raised this way. I go to an international school so there are loads of people from all around the world, who have many faiths and beliefs etc. I like to listen to music and watch movies. TV series. 

For 'religious reasons' they don't really do normal things like watching movies/ listening to music. They don't really allow me out that much, unless I'm going out with only boys who they know.

I'm not religious at all. I only pray so that they don't ask questions/get suspicious. I am also a naturally quiet person. I don't really talk to people unless I like them or I'm close with them.

344,"As a bit of backstory, I‚Äôve been raised in a pretty religious environment. I went to private Christian schools K-12, so I‚Äôve basically only associated with strongly religious circles and people. However, I am gay, and have known since middle school. Since then, I‚Äôve struggled a lot with shame and loneliness, since there was no one else I knew who was going through the same thing. I continued to reassure myself that once I got to college, things would get better, because I would be able to meet more people like me. 

Unfortunately, that did not pan out well. Now that I am in college, I find myself once again wound tightly in religious circles. I know from the way I convey it, I might seem as though I dislike being in these circles, but I don‚Äôt, and that‚Äôs the confusing part. Not only do I find them comfortable, but it does genuinely feel like a part of me identifies with it. However, another part of me clearly identifies with my sexuality; I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible for me to repress it.

I don‚Äôt dislike the people I hang out with at church and such, but I feel as though I can‚Äôt be genuine when I‚Äôm around them. I feel pressured to cut out a part of my identity to feel accepted, so I show a fake and shallow version of myself. 

I want to find other gay friends so that I would feel less isolated, but at the same time, that other part of me thinks that would be wrong because it would weaken my faith even more. Regardless, I‚Äôm not sure whether this would be beneficial or if it would add to the tension.

And I don‚Äôt know whether or not this is a true dichotomy, but I‚Äôve tried for years to find a way to legitimately live with both sides of my identity and I‚Äôve never felt at peace.


Feel free to ask me to clarify anything. I don‚Äôt really know what I need at this point, but I appreciate any solutions (or encouragement) you have to offer. Thx &lt;3

Hey, my name is Molly, and I am a student in the UK.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of days ago, my friend George, who is visually impaired, asked me how I deal with procrastination. For him, it is a big problem as it takes much longer for him to complete his assignments. Myself, I had never really thought about this topic before, but now, I‚Äôm really interested to learn more.

&amp;#x200B;

We decided to create a project to understand why students procrastinate and what are things students do to fix their problems of procrastinating.

&amp;#x200B;

We wanted to ask real people about their experiences of procrastination, and would love to get your opinion

&amp;#x200B;

We‚Äôve created a short survey including 6 simple short questions to answer.

Here‚Äôs the link to the survey: [https://goo.gl/forms/VygIEYSSBPW0TPBZ2](https://goo.gl/forms/VygIEYSSBPW0TPBZ2)

&amp;#x200B;

With enough responses, hopefully, we will see a pattern in what the biggest problems are and what seems to be the best ways to stop procrastinating are!

&amp;#x200B;

If you are interested in seeing the results of the survey, they will be sent by email, so there will be a slot for you to enter your email in the survey.

&amp;#x200B;

Where it is possible, please could you share this link with anyone that would benefit from taking the survey and can learn from its results.

&amp;#x200B;

We really appreciate your feedback, and look forward to posting the results in the near future, thank you for your support!",18Feb2019,1

352,"My boyfriend has recently decided he would like to change job, and has started putting his CV out there on various recruitment websites. He has been contacted by a company that has found his details on one of these websites, they‚Äôve told him that they have selected him as one of ten other candidates out of a pool of thousands, believe that his experience is an excellent fit and invited him to a webinar today. This webinar was one of these ones that tells you how wonderful the company is, how great the earning potential is etc., but doesn‚Äôt say too much more in depth about the role. I‚Äôm always suspicious of companies that need to sell themselves on this scale. 

I have been approached by this company myself before, so have done a little bit of searching online and found nothing but terrible things. These webinars are also so frequent that I‚Äôm inclined to think the turnover is very high, which is validated in a lot of the search results I found. I don‚Äôt want to give the name of the group as I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm allowed to, but their reputation certainly precedes them. Online is littered with stories from people who have had bad, damn near scammy experiences; being stung financially, the job isn‚Äôt what they say it is, getting flown out to other countries to find out they have no support from the company in obtaining a Visa, amongst lots of other stuff. It isn‚Äôt hard to find pages and pages of this type of information.

He is so excited and I feel terrible as I want to support him in his job search and be excited with him, but I don‚Äôt think this is a genuine opportunity or what he thinks it is. Before the webinar I tried to cautiously warn him to be on his guard for if they seem like they are trying to sell the company to the potential candidate. I also suggested to him to just do a bit of research online to try and lead him to this conclusion himself, he says he has done, thinks it‚Äôs all fine. I‚Äôm a bit worried he has been brainwashed into thinking this is a life changing, money making opportunity by the webinar, particularly if he is happy to ignore all of the stuff online.

I don‚Äôt want him to make a terrible mistake and be miserable. How do I gently tell him this without coming across like I‚Äôm being bitter or trying to dampen his excitement for what he thinks this role and this company is? ",18Feb2019,9
353,"I had my first appointment with a psychiatrist today. My mom took me to see him after I had my first panic attack and she finally decided that I do have problems with anxiety.

I told him my symptoms, when I had my panic attack and we talked about how I just moved to the city etc. 

He told me that he thinks the cause of my anxiety is because I'm not close to my new classmates and I just left all my friends behind in my old city. My mom backed him up and told him about how I never leave the house anymore or go and hangout with people. Thing is, I chat with all my old friends through social media everyday so I'm disconnected from them and I play video games in my room because I have an online friend group to play games with. 

Anyway, he told me I shouldn't just hang out with my classmates during the day, I should go out and party with them in the evenings. 

I don't approve of underage drinking and smoking (which is what my classmates do and what's common in this area) but he told me it doesn't matter what my preferences are, I should still go and hang out with them- I don't even need to drink alcohol, I can just drink Coca Cola or whatever I prefer. I don't like being around people who drink, especially underage and to add on to that, my classmates are complete assholes.

I told him I probably wasn't going to do that and he said I should be more open minded and less tense because that'll help my anxiety. 

Is it just me who is making up reasons to dislike going to a psychiatrist or is does this guy seem off? 

I told my mom I didn't like his advice and she thinks he's right and that even though I dislike drinking, being around drinkers and that my classmates are assholes, I should put in more effort to hang out with them. This is what doesn't make sense to me- am I supposed to go against what I like to do just so I can fit in? I thought I'm supposed to do what makes me comfortable no matter what?

359,"Hi all, I need some advice, not really need it I guess, just need someone to talk to.

I've worked somewhere for quite a while, about 2 years. I started as the base worker and became a leader at the beginning of last year for my shift. Many of my friends were in the base work class too.

Ever since I got the promotion, I worked continuously almost day/night to improve my leadership ability and become more friendly to my shift. I want to make everyone feel valued in the work place. I have a pretty calm demeanor, so if someone has a question they don't panic asking me or not want to bring it up in the first place.

One of my base work friends through the years started getting snappy on me for not showing enough emotion. She consistently approaches me, talking to me about working on showing emotion more or at least once a month telling me that I'm not worth being friends with because of it.

I feel like I've been improving though. I thought when I took leadership I was doing much better and was able to reach out to the floor better, I genuinely feel way happier as I am now.

I should note, I did have a suicide attempt once quite a few years ago, and I think it has had lasting effects on my emotions. However, I don't think it is so bad that I'm not friendly. The leader who promoted me told me she did because I was so friendly.

I just don't know who to believe. I'm so used to this type of talk to me that I don't know. I really feel like I'm a good person, but how do I get that across to this person? It seems like no one else is having this issue with me but her. I could obviously be targetting her though as a defense mechanism. I sometimes make stuff up, not on purpose, it is another defense mechanism I use and trying to remove.

I really would appreciate advice. I hate this so much. I'm to the point where I almost want to stop caring how others view me, but I don't even know how to do that.

360,"TL:DR - I slept with a guy a couple of times six years ago. He wound up to be extremely pushy, and life circumstances also put us on opposite ends of the country. Twice a year he emails me (once texted me with a number I never gave him) asking me to come visit, and I've always ignored it. Is it time to nip it in the bud?

I'd like to preface by saying I was 22 and he was 35 when this started. I had a lot of issues when I started sleeping with this guy, including about 1,000 unhealthy views on sex and difficulty standing up for myself. I did go to therapy last year to deal with and unlearn these views, and I'm doing so much better now. I'm now 27 and he would probably be ~41.

When I was an intern, I slept with a coworker a few times. Things were mostly fine, but over texting, he was extremely pushy. He would blow up my phone asking me to come over when I couldn't, beg for photos non-stop, and try to tell me when I was going to see him next. I did keep talking to him because we had other conversations outside of sex that I did like, and he was an interesting person to talk to.

Later that year, he moved 2 hours south of me and still hounded me to come visit him sometimes (though less frequently). I would just always decline. One year later, I moved across the country and he would still email me asking me to come visit him... even though he knew I was living on the opposite side of the coast. But we still spoke occassionally about normal stuff.

When I was 23, I just decided to stop responding to his emails, thinking he would take the hint and go away. What has ended up happening though is he emails me roughly every 6 months and asks how I am and when I want to come over (still living on the opposite coast, by the way).

When I was 26, he reached out to me by text. But the thing is, at that point, I had changed my number to a local number. My old number from my previous living situation was gone. That means he had to have found my new number somehow. I have no idea to this day how, considering we didn't share any mutual friends and my number isn't posted online anywhere (as far as I know). I did respond, but told him he had the wrong number. 

Now I'm 27, and he just emailed me again. 

This is my first time dealing with him since having gone to therapy, so I'm not really sure the best way to nip this. Should I respond and tell him to stop contacting me? Or do I just keep ignoring his emails?",18Feb2019,9

‚Ä¢ He constantly buys me stuff (comics, patches, miscellaneous music things, concert tickets)
‚Ä¢ He wants to know everything about my friends (he acts like he knows everything about my best friend whom hes only met once and seen on occasion visit me at work)
‚Ä¢ When friends or my boyfriend come to visit he doesnt leave me to speak to them alone, he stands there and interjects everything.

366,"There is so much more to this story but I'm going to try to just keep to the facts that are directly relevant to the situation. I've worked for a doctor for almost 5 years. It is a very small office. I worked closely with 2 other women, and we have (I thought) gotten along very well together, supporting eachother whenever needed, etc. We all work part time and have flexible hours so we're not always there at the same time.  We often communicate via text, and we all have a separate ""business"" cell phone that we use. The environment has been getting increasingly toxic mostly because of the way the doctor runs his business (or doesn't run his business to be more accurate). I found a new job, and gave him 3 weeks notice--which I thought was generous, and he appreciated. I tried to help him find a replacement, but he decided to hire a friend of a friend who has no direct experience in the job. I tried my best to ""train"" her before I left, with the little time I had. Meanwhile, things are getting toxic between the 2 other women, and between the doctor and one of the women. I stay completely out of the drama. Anyway, my last day came along, and not one person came in to the office to say goodbye. The employees of the other office that we share space with were however, wishing me well and saying goodbye. My boss said he was going to ""wander in"" at some point but did not. He instead texted me to ask if I could do a particular task before I left. As the day wore on, and I was trying to wrap things up as best I could, get things in order for the new person, print out procedures, etc, and I was becoming increasingly upset realizing no one was coming. Finally, I decided to get out of there as fast as I could. I had told my boss what time I would be leaving, and then texted him 15 minutes before that time to just let him know where I was leaving things, what I had done to get things in order, and that I was leaving the business cell  phone on the desk. I left without waiting for a reply, knowing that if he wanted to contact me, he has my personal cell #, and home #. When I got home, I texted my coworkers to let them know how I left things, and that they could call or text me anytime if they needed anything. They replied saying goodbye, they would miss me, and wanted me to pick a date to plan to get together. So I did, they agreed to get together for dinner on an upcoming date. The date came, and they cancelled due to weather, saying we'll make it ""another time."" 

I am now feeling really hurt, frankly. It's not about getting gift or anything from anyone, but I feel like they could have atleast given me a card? Came by the office on my last day to say goodbye?

367,"Hi reddit,

My problem is quite simple...I have a great job opportunity in another company that I want to accept.

The problem is, I know my bosses really love me and it will upset them a lot. I know they want me to stay and are counting on me. But I don't see a bright future in my company and the offer that came to me is amazing for my career and definitely a step forward in my life.

But it's really hard to know how to talk to them about this and how to address possible reactions.

Any advice?

370,"I am a freshman in computer science at a private christian college in western Pennsylvania (although not truly that religious, the college has great academics and they have a highly rated computer science department). The academics here are very rigorous and since high school I have never truly practiced good study habits and devoting time to school work. As a computer science major, I am required to take numerous math courses, (at this college with the required math courses, I am one class short of a minor in math after all the required courses) numerous science courses, HUMA's, and then the beloved computer science courses. The computer science courses are my favorite and what I excel at, but the other courses are of some difficulty for me, well, an immense amount of difficulty for me. I need advice from fellow college students or those who are past their college days and went through the same struggle as me and can give me some helpful advice.

&amp;#x200B;

I have much difficulty devoting time to school work. As a college student, this is my first step into adulthood and having all the freedom I want. Thus, I have trouble sitting down and doing school work and focusing my time on everything I should be doing, but rather spend my time watching youtube, browsing reddit, playing video games, or being with friends. Luckily, I am not one to need to sleep much and never waste my time napping, which I find to be a good thing considering most my friends here nap 3-4 times a day. 

&amp;#x200B;

Growing up through high school, I sought-after help from guidance counselors, school psychologists, etc., looking for help with study habits. I felt that I had test anxiety because it felt that no matter how much work I did or how much I studied I never truly understood the material. To this day, I feel as though I really just never had good study habits and time management for what was important. At college, I find myself struggling with the same things, as well as just doing my work and being ahead. I consistently do my work and get it done, but it is rather crammed and I know that I should not be doing that. When I sit down to ""study"" I sit down and read my notes and other study materials for maybe 2 hours truly after I tell myself I am going to do it all day, but rather get sidetracked watching youtube or twitch.

&amp;#x200B;

I need help, I need helpful friendly advice to help boost me in the right direction. I cannot be going to this college and not putting into it what I am paying. I need a good education out of this, but for start, I need help being pushed in the right direction and being motivated to do the right thing.

373,"Hey reddit! Not sure if maybe I‚Äôm just a little arrogant, or if there‚Äôs a real issue here. (TL;DR at the bottom)

Me and my brothers (21 and 23) have always payed for everything we own, including clothes, phonebills, technology etc. My parents paid for basically nothing but toothpaste and toilet paper (and other things obvs but you get my point). This gave use fantastic budgeting skills and work ethics. My sister has been held to the same rules, paying for her own things that aren‚Äôt essentials.

However, she spends 100% of her non-school time in her room, watching Netflix or Stan (which I pay for), on her school-issued laptop. She refuses to get a job, despite being offered one at my workplace with no application or interview. She won‚Äôt help around the house with simple chores like washing the dishes. She is rude and disrespectful to my parents (to clarify, she‚Äôs not aggressive or sweary, it‚Äôs more like they‚Äôll ask her to do something and she‚Äôll ignore them or give them attitude). 

Similarly, she is completely averse to doing school work or studying. Everyone hates school, I know, but my and my brothers did well enough to pass with average to above-average grades. Even with daily special attention from my parents trying to basically spoonfeed her homework answers, my sister refuses to anything. I know that school might not be for her, and that‚Äôs fine, but at 15 you kinda have to just suck it up until you can branch out into other things (not that she would anyway).

She won‚Äôt see the big picture. I tell her that if she works for my workplace, she can buy that iPhone she keeps talking about. I tell her if she does her homework, next year she can choose subjects she likes and start having fun and working out what she wants to do. She always says ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just be a homeless stripper hahah‚Äù and won‚Äôt ever consider that actually like that‚Äôs gonna happen to you.

I understand at 15 there‚Äôs a lot going on, and school and work don‚Äôt seem important, and she‚Äôs so young we shouldn‚Äôt force things on her. I know that. But it‚Äôs the laziness and ignorance that I don‚Äôt think is going to change, and I‚Äôm really concerned for her. Sorry this was so long x

375,"I want to know what people generally think of me.

I'm 22 (F). In sixth grade, I graduated first honor and in high school, I graduated salutatorian. In college, I studied in 4 different universities (bc confused about what course I want) but still graduated with a high GPA (1.40) from an online college with an AB Psychology degree. I really didn't want to be a psychologist. I don't want the hassle of taking board exams and pursuing master's degree. I discovered a short course (Pre-Licensing Private Detective) and thought it was really interesting because I've always wanted to become a detective/spy when I was a kid. I took it up and finished it and got my own Private Detective License when I turned 21. Now I'm a freelance private detective for 1 year and in between I've worked for 6 months in a private detective company and a fraud analyst for 3 months in another company and a mystery shopper in another company. Now I'm applying as a fraud analyst again for another company because I was excellent at that last job I had and I liked it more than being out on the field.

As for my hobbies, I own an airsoft pistol, a sparring katana, a skateboard and boxing gloves. But most of the time, I play video games. I love punk rock music. I love anime and cartoons. I love action, spy, mystery and psychological movies. I extremely love my pets (2 cats and 6 dogs). I'm a minimalist. Most importantly, I love watching detective shows, especially the murder mysteries. I've watched SO MUCH of them that it almost makes me feel embarrassed and I've been thinking about writing a mystery novel one day but don't know how to start.

I have a boyfriend and we've been together for 7 years and we have the exact same story. We don't really have a clear future planned. I think the only dream we have is to be the best parents to a son and to have the happiest family and to work together in the same job.

I knew I didn‚Äôt say anything malicious or rude, so I was confused. I stood up for myself, but I made it clear I never said anything but apologized anyway.

I hadn‚Äôt heard from Roommate #2 (who told #1 I was talking about her, and wasn‚Äôt) so I reached out to her via text and apologized but made it clear that I didn‚Äôt know why she was upset with me.

I still have not heard from either of them.

I don‚Äôt like to feel like a burden in my own home, but I also don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs worth reaching out again because I already tried once.

380,"Right now, I run a small YouTube channel with about 150 subs. I've had it for about year and a half now, and we upload mostly funny skits that pretty much make no sense. Lately, our videos have gone bland and I'm never satisfied with any script I write myself. Our most popular videos were script-less and improved. We've tried to go back to that, but the content still seems to be boring, predictable, and unfunny. 

We were just getting ready to launch a very small line of merchandise, new logo, and some other stuff when I pointed this out to the rest of the time, who haven't really commented on the situation. My ideology is that I simply refuse to put out anything that our viewers would pay for (merchandise, etc.), until I firmly believe we're pushing out quality content. Which we haven't lately. 

My team isn't very productive and I essentially do everything except for act. I also pay for everything we do and need as a small studio. Most of the team is awful at communicating and it can often take days for them to reply. We all do this voluntarily and none of us get paid a penny. I really can't just get rid of all them and find other people, as they're the actors, and pretty much the face of the studio.

My options right now are...

1. Continue quantity &gt; quality videos
2. Hire/commission a part time writer
3. Hold off on videos for a few months, and write them all myself

395,"Long story short, I dated a coworker for about 2 months (bad idea, I know. I‚Äôve learned now) until things ended on a bad note (it wasn‚Äôt that bad, but we did have a heated discussion. I sincerely apologized for getting angry afterwards, he decided to ignore me, and I decided to let it be). 

He‚Äôs now doing everything to avoid crossing paths with me even though I wanted to keep things civil, but it seems like he really hates me if he goes this far not to see my face. He even avoids having lunch with our team (who are also his friends) and has basically changed his usual schedule so as not to see me.

This causes me great anxiety because I have always avoided confrontation, I do not like leaving discussions unresolved and I get REALLY anxious when I feel like someone hates me / is holding some kind of grudge against me. 

This discussion happened 10 days ago and I thought my anxiety would get better, but it‚Äôs still the same / maybe worse. Everything about work now makes me anxious, because the sole thought of crossing paths with him and encountering his hatred makes me want to curl up in a ball and cry.

We work in different departments so I feel relatively safe at my desk, but commuting to work, taking breaks outside, going to lunch and leaving the workplace all make me feel anxious, nauseous, I get dizzy and the mere thought of accidentally seeing him makes me want to throw up. Not because I hate him, but because I do not want to see his animosity. It wasn‚Äôt even that awful of a discussion so I really do not understand why he‚Äôs ignoring me so harshly. It hurts, I feel like crying everyday I‚Äôm here and I just don‚Äôt feel comfortable at work anymore. It sucks because I really liked being here but now I even hope to get sick or something so I have an excuse not to come and stay home. 

I even started seeing a therapist, but our sessions are one every two weeks and I feel like I need to solve this with more urgency. I‚Äôve even been thinking about quitting but this job is very financially safe for me, so I really don‚Äôt want to go through with that.  

Talking to him is not an option either, because after our discussion I did try hard to get him to have one final conversation for closure, since we are coworkers and I wanted to keep things civil, but he ignored my offer. 

I feel like I‚Äôm at my wit‚Äôs end. I genuinely don‚Äôt know what to do and it‚Äôs taking a huge emotional toll on me. My stomach, my appetite, my body and my mental stare are all suffering the consequences and I need to do something to find some relief.

I‚Äôm thinking about taking some time off work, but my boss is very annoying in that sense and he‚Äôs always very reticent to give us holidays / days off, which also causes me anxiety.

I can't stop thinking about people flirting with me.

 Whenever someone makes alot of eyecontact and smiles at me or gives me compliments i think about it for days and ""fall"" in love with that person and i can't get it out of my head until the next person flirts with me and then i think about that for days and the last person is forgotten. I make up all those crazy scenarios if those people had a bit more courage and asked me for my number or stuff and how nice that would be. And at the end of the day i'm so disappointed that very rarely anyone does so and how sad it is that someone likes me but isn't with me. Then i just wish no one would flirt with me at all so i'm not forced to think about that. Also i'm annoyed that people flirt without making any steps further than that.

One time for example i was in a room and there was this stranger person who starred at me alot and when i had to leave the room that person said ""bye"" to me. And i thought about that for soo long and it destroyed my mood for days thinking about how i'll never see anyone again even though that was just some stranger person.
Or even little stupid things like when i walk down the library and i see someone watching me i think about that for days. Those stupid little things.....

I'm sick of being so desperate and focussing so much on this stuff. How can i stop it from coming into my mind?  I have alot other stuff to do like studying and it distracts me so much. Also i used to be not like that but recently it's just different. That sounds very silly but it really annoys me. Hope anyone has some tips or maybe knows why i'm like this suddenly.

Now, I said ok but this was off putting. Ive known someone to cut before and the person seemed like the sweetest calmest thing around. But she had a dark side and you wouldnt know she cut unless you saw her stomach. 

Now am I jumping to conclusions because of my past trauma or what? Also, I'm going to ask her again later on today. If she says yes, how do I politely end the relationship? Ive dealt with cutters before and Im not sure if I can do it again. Thank you. ",18Feb2019,0
402,"I will try to keep this brief.

I am considering ending a life long friendship due to his possible interference in my personal life, especially that with my ex-girlfriend.

I split with her two years ago but during the years that we were together she was always friends with someone I considered my best friend.  We were at his wedding when we were together so she knew him and his wife during our whole relationship.  My friend has always told me that since we split up, that he has never spoken, messaged or heard from her since and to me that's important as I told him some pretty personal feelings about how I felt over the break up.

Before we broke up, there was an incident at my place where they were just getting on a little too well all weekend.  He was visiting on his own.  I believe had I not stayed in the room that something would have happened.  My gf was always trying to get me to go to bed but I resisted.

Then at another wedding that we all attended, there was some talk of my friend and my gf flirting, I have to admit that I did notice it but i wasn't worried as his wife was present.

Now, recently I spoke with my ex.  After some chat she mentioned something that only my friend would have known, something that I told him and no-one else.  She let slip that she had been talking to my friend, she directly mentioned him in a text.

I have him now trapped in a lie.  I called my friend and I asked him directly if he was in contact, he denied it.

People stay friends all the time after partners break up but what I am angry about is that my friend has possibly used the troubles between me and my then gf to interfere and directly lied that he was still talking to her.  I am also certain his wife does not know.  The breakup came suddenly and it always bothered me that someone may have been interfering.

I am thinking of shutting him out of my life but should I confront him about this directly before I do?",18Feb2019,1

404,"I thought about posting this to r/jobs, but I'm looking for something a bit broader than just ""how to find a new job fast.""

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I hate my job and want to quit to get my life together/catch up on things I should have done/learned by now. I'm in a position where I can do that. What's the best way I can go about doing this?

&amp;#x200B;

Context: I (26F) went to college out-of-state in WI and lived there after graduating. I recently moved to GA before the end of the year to be with my fiancee (M25). We're currently staying with his parents. I don't drive (never got to learn) and planned on relying on my bike to get around, but I've learned the area we live in (and plan to stay near) is not ideal for bicyclists. I also previously lost my SSID -- I have my number on my taxes, but I need to get a new one as I'll also need a passport for a wedding the family wants us to go to in England sometime in the summer.

&amp;#x200B;

I have the same job I had when I lived in WI -- Massive chain, customer service, OK benefits. I transferred from one location to another since I thought it'd be easier than having nothing.  I used to like my job, then be indifferent....but ever since I've moved here I've absolutely HATED it. Some notes:

* The pay is worse. I make a little under $10/hr, but my hours have been slashed compared to the store I used to work. I'm supposed to be saving with my fiancee, yet it feels like I can hardly build anything meaningful w/ my student loan debt on the side.
* I'm more exhausted. I'm working less, and it's not a ""hard"" job, but the emotional labor PLUS actually getting there on my bike leaves me more drained than ever. My hours are also inconsistent, so some days I might have to get up at the crack of dawn while others I'm going in at noon.
* Management is a joke. I used to feel like I was part of a team. Now I feel like the only things that matter are A) how fast we are, and B) making the customer happy vs looking after coworkers following policy.

Basically, I feel like I'm wasting my time and energy, and I need to get out. I know a lot of people recommend waiting to have something else lined up before quitting their current job, but I feel like I can't even dedicate myself to a job hunt at my current energy level.

&amp;#x200B;

I need a fresh start. I just don't know how to proceed once I do.

&amp;#x200B;

My fiancee's family is willing to help me find a job and procure transportation for me (they may even help me get a car, though I'd like to do that on my own if I can help it). My fiancee did something similar himself, where he quit his previous job and started working construction with his father's company. I also have enough savings built up to keep my loans at bay for a few months, so if I did quit now I should be safe for a while. I also have a BFA and could do illustration commissions on the side if I need to.

&amp;#x200B;

My current plan looks a little like this:

* First Week: Relax, re-energize, fluff up my resume
* Second Week: Job search &amp; work on updating/transitioning all my information to reflect my residency in GA (ID, SSID, bank accounts, etc)
* Third Week Onward: Keep working on job hunt and also work on driving

Ideally within a month I'll be refreshed, have a new job, have all my info updated, and will be making progress towards actually getting a license and a car.

I love art and even though I am not the greatest at it, I think I would like to pursue it as a passion and a career, but I just can't figure out if that is smart or not. I don't need much money to be happy, so it's not the money. The shakiness of the career field worries me to be honest, though.

410,"So this is my first post in a section like this so this might be interesting. Also sorry for bad grammar - not native.

&amp;#x200B;

First off I'm M/21. I'll try to start very back in time to give context. When I was around 6 y/o I lived with my mom and dad and went to kindergarden. I've had a few friends, but only 1 particular friend I was really close with. I can't really recall why I only had one close friend back then, I've been too young. 

Fast Forward one year my dad is an alcoholic and my mom decides to go to Hungary with me (To our family on her side, which lives there). I got sent to school there with my there living cousins and I eventually make a few friends of which one is a close friend to me aswell. At this point since I'm only 7 y/o I had lost all contact to my old friends in germany.

Fast Forward another year. My mom eventually meets somebody from Germany through her work on the phone and they get to know each other. At one point he's coming to hungary visiting us. About half a year later my mom decides to move back to germany and move in with my now step dad. (Which I love to this day and had been a more of a father to me than my real dad at every point in my life). But again I've lost any contact to my friends I made in Hungary since even whilst 8 y/o (back in 2005) I had no way to keep communication with them.

Back in Germany I get into primary school and make a few friends. Of which again only one is a really close friend to me. 

FF one year and eventually that close friend moves away to like the other side of germany, and I'm still too young to keep contact. Around 2 years later I get out of primary school and get into a school about nobody of my friends are going to. 

I eventually find some new friends in ""High School"" (German Gymnasium) and have a handful of people I consider close friends for about 7 years.

Fast Forwarded those 7 years I leave school to start working, whilst they finish school. It was my own decision to leave because I didn't feel any motivation to continue at all. I was bored and hated it. I had reached a certain degree and was able to start an apprenticeship. 

I've tried to stay in contact with those handful of people after not seeing them every day of the week anymore but the intention of keeping in contact seemed to be one sided. At some point I stopped trying to keep the contact and it faded. 

Fast Forward 3 more years. I have finished my Apprenticeship, am working full time now, and I don't meet new people. I have a few friends I am close with now which I've met over the internet from gaming. I actually do visit them occasionally, but they are \~300KM away.

At this point I am here with no close friends left around me. When I have a hard time - I have it alone. When I need somebody to talk - Only in text or voip. I am not a person who's going out into clubs partying especially not alone. I struggle to find new people around me I can make friends with. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I still can't understand how friends of 7 years can lose interest in being friends with me so easily. I'd still die for them and I know they wouldn't because they won't even answer my texts.

&amp;#x200B;

Some info:   
I work in a small company with only 1 co worker my age which is leaving next month. 

I drive to work by car which takes 2 hours in total (1hr/1hr). 

I don't enjoy partying. 

I don't enjoy talking to strangers because I haven't had a real non-work-related conversation in real life since almost 4 years.  


How do I make friends?

&amp;#x200B;

I've lost close friends over and over again from young age on. I've stopped trying to keep in contact with friends of 7 years when I felt that I don't mean anything to them anymore. I don't know how to make friends anymore.",18Feb2019,1

413,"Been in a relationship with my girlfriend for 4 years, it's probably been the most healthy relationship I've ever had. Before me she'd only been with two other guys and the rest were lesbian relationships, we started talking about her sexuality, we've been talking about marriage. And we really wanted to be confident that she could be locked into a monogamous heterosexual relationship as a preference rather than a settlement. So we made a tinder account, I told her that I'd be fine if she had sex with a woman so long as I was present and could participate, every straight guy's fantasy right ? It was for the most part.


We met a girl who was super lay back, invited her over for drinks and coffee and really dug her. First few times we met up we just hung out, once we were confident she was clean we had a few encounters that were great, she was also bisexual so it was an amazing experience, felt a lot like friends having fun in a very real, meaningful way. 


But now i notice my girlfriend texts her more than me, when we all hang out she dotes on her the way she used to with me. I suggested we keep it friendly between the three of us for a while but my girlfriend asked me last night if they could have a session on their own if I didn't want to participate.

414,"Ok, so here's the whole background:

I study in a relatively expensive college here in my country. Around 4 years ago we sold our house and most of the money went to my education (I did my part and got a scholarship). I have one year left of school, but 7 months ago I started an internship in the company I'm currently working at. Since it was summer of 2018, we had to pay the inscription fee (summer school is treated as any other semester but is more intense, it only lasts 1 month). That set my dad back on what he usually saves for Fall's semester, due on August. That's why we agreed I'd work for a year and then return to school on Fall of 2019, after having saved enough money between him and I. Right now I earn around 600 USD a month working as an IT storage administrator. The job usually requires me to sacrifice weekends and I don't get paid for extra hours (I'm under an outsourcing scheme). I won't start working 'directly' under the company after 6 more months of being fired and hired again. I don't dislike the job but from what I heard the possibility of ascending through the ranks or getting a raise is pretty much close to zero. Working environment is good, but usually the working schedule is not respected. The job is not really related to what I'm majoring in (Systems Engineering) and I don't really mean to make a working career here. I'm usually scheduling meetings, editing docx, xlsx and learning about storage administration. The only relation would be automation of some repetitive tasks. What I really want is work from home in some personal projects I've been wanting to develop. I know I can capitalize on this but it is not something sure and stable as the current job I have. I convinced my dad I'd quit at the end of January but then I got cold feet (that and that some things changed for good that made me change my mind). Right now what prevents me from quitting is that I haven't saved as much as I'd want, as we need a substantial amount of money (my dad is the one who saves most of it). In essence, I don't hate the job but I don't like it either.

416,"I'm (30's/m) looking for advice on how to deal with my toxic sister (50's/f) who is taking care of my mom. Here are some details of the situation that's causing me great anxiety and anger. She's my half-sister from my father's side and he passed away in the early 2000's. That's when she vowed on his deathbed to take care of my mom, so not her biological mom. My mom had a stroke that's rendered her mostly speechless and without the use of her right side.  I typically come over when I can as they live far away to assist with my mom's Asian groceries that my sister isn't willing to pick up and do whatever else my mom might need. 

&amp;#x200B;

The relationship I have with my sister isn't great, she's always disliked me. She's extremely manipulative, lies constantly, and has amassed 8 husbands in her lifetime. She's estranged from 2 of her 4 children so that's a good indicator of people cutting ties to her. I'm in an unfortunate situation where I must keep contact with her because she's taking care of my mom, her finances, and well being. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, it's all come to a boiling point as I couldn't see my mother this past weekend due to a cold. Her immune system is compromised so I wouldn't dare get her sick. Meanwhile, my sister is somewhere in Mexico with her new husband on vacation. She saw a post on social media that I went out to a bakery with my wife for V-day and got upset that I didn't go over to do my mom's laundry for her and help pack up things as they're moving. I call her out on being irrational as I did the responsible thing and will be there next weekend when I'm better. Now I have received texts from her husband also berating me. I'm afraid that as a result they're going to bar me from seeing my mom as they're moving soon even further away. She currently has POA for my mom. I suspect she has mishandled my mom's money for the past 15 years and gets super defensive when I inquire about my mom's finances. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at a loss as to how to handle my relationship with my sister as I'd like to cut ties from her toxicity but she's the one taking care of my mom so I have to contact her before coming over and such. Unfortunately, I don't have the financial means or space to take my mom in myself. Otherwise, I would've done that long ago. It's a rather specific situation but any advice is welcome as all my interactions with her have been stressful and I don't even want to go over there as a result.

Hi, this is gonna be really condensed.. trying to summarise everything so I hope it makes sense.

3 years ago I moved away for college. In that time, I met someone and we've been together ever since.. but now, I'm really missing home and kinda want to move back (I say kinda because I'm unsure, but my family split up so I don't really have a place to stay with them). Thing is, my boyfriend (26) has his life settled here and doesn't want to move away. So if I go, it means splitting up. 

I still speak to my family every day, but not long after I moved away my parents split. I miss the area I live in, as everything was very local and I grew up there so there's an attachment. At the time I didn't have much going for me there though, I drifted away from all my friends I grew up with, and there was an opportunity to study somewhere else so I took it. 

My boyfriend and I are great together, but he's kind of the only thing keeping me here at the minute. And I'd be genuinely devastated if we had to split up. But as I mentioned, he's got everything going for him here, a great job that is almost equal to a career for him as there's a potential he'll be there for life.

426,"I always thought my penis was normal, until 3 years ago I think. Right now I'm 20. I have phimosis meaning my foreskin is too tight to be able to be pulled back. My penis itself is flat shaped and bent in a really weird manner. When erect, the stem is mostly straight but from just before the glans it starts to bend *downwards*. It  literally looks like a straight finger but with only the fingertip bent inwards.

This is the most accurate representation I was able to make using ascii text (I don't want to shock you with pictures):

8¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞\\

Instead of

8==========&gt;

(And yeah it's not so big, but that's not my concern).

Also, like I said stem is flat, so when looking down it's pretty wide, but from the side it's really slim. If that makes sense.

Anyway, while it's not my biggest concern (also partly because my girlfriend absolutely loves it because it fits her like a glove, due to my penis being bent so weird), I do want to know what my first step should be, because I don't really feel much during sex.

Why is my penis flat shaped and bent like that? What should I do about the phimosis thing, is it fixable? I hope anyone knows.",18Feb2019,3
428,"Hey there reddit, I really didn't think I would be one of those people asking the internet for advice but after another drunken outing ending my relationship here I am again alone on a holiday waking up thankfully not too hungover waiting for my ex to come pick up her stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's a long read but if you have the time I'd appreciate it!

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the details and as much as ""You need to stop drinking"" is the right advice, I'm hoping people might be able to give a little more, thanks.

&amp;#x200B;

**Last Night**

Hanging out with the SO trying to make plans for the holiday. I work in retail so I rarely get two days off in a row. We go out for a decent dinner at a brew pub and escape room (which we beat) then go to the bar downstairs. She's tired and probably wants to go home but I'm buzzed and want more alcohol and the NBA allstar game is on so that's a good excuse. I get way to drunk, admit to her I think about suicide sometimes and blame her for god knows what. She ubers home alone as do I eventually and I don't say anything particularly nasty other than I want to break up, mostly because I'm embarrassed about my behaviour. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Work**

Life is alright in general. I'm slowly digging my way out of debt, got a promotion at work (huge wholesale membership based retailer). Came with a big raise and even bigger in 10 months or so when I finish my training and officially get my own department.  I'm a smart guy but lazy when it comes to school. I want to be a doctor and very well could but I can't get my shit together enough to study at least without losing motivation halfway through (like most things in life). Sometimes I make silly mistakes at work because I'm on autopilot that could cost me my promotion if I don't get my shit together. I'm fairly resentful about working in a grocery store still at 25 even though I get paid phenomenally well, love the people I work with and the company treats me super well.

&amp;#x200B;

**Drinking**

I picked up most of my heavy drinking habits in the navy. In university I often get blackout drunk and am either rude to people or tell lies I can't take back in the morning because I'm insecure about how little I am doing with my life or I want people to like me more. The funny part is they already do. People think I'm a smart, successful, wonderful guy. I guess that's not entirely a lie, I am smart, I make good money (if you count that as a measure of success) and I genuinely care about the people around me and would do anything for anyone to make their lives better (as long as I'm sober). Drinking 10-15 beers in a night, sometimes alone in my room, sometimes out with people who I then immediately cut out of my life out of embarrassment is par for the course with most of my interpersonal relationships. Drinking that much feels like my equivalent of restarting a laggy computer. Sure it still lags when it comes back on and you haven't really dealt with the underlying issue but at least it can do its job again. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Other**

I've spoken to a psychologist before but eventually lose interest. I actually really looked forward to the sessions but once a week isn't enough to keep me going or committed to doing them. I have two childhood friends who know most of this but don't live nearby and very few other real personal relationships in the new city I moved to. 

&amp;#x200B;

In reality I'm not sure why I typed this all out, but it was kind of cathartic to get it off my chest, now I see why people suggest writing to clarify your thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

Please feel free to share ideas / suggestions / similar experiences, especially if you've felt similar and manage to turn it around.

Thanks",18Feb2019,1

My doctor advised me to skip the placebo pills each month so I don‚Äôt bleed at all, so I have been doing that for the past 6 months or so. So I haven‚Äôt had my period in six months. 

I take my pills at the same time every day and am very good about it. I may take it an hour late at most but I‚Äôm pretty on top of it so I‚Äôve never been worried about it not working.

I didn‚Äôt know this until yesterday because my friend is now on the same antibiotic and was told by her doctor that it would make her birth control ineffective. 

I looked it up to verify that it had the same effect on my birth control and it does. This all happened about a month ago and now i‚Äôm nervous I may be pregnant. I haven‚Äôt gotten my period since then, but that‚Äôs normal. What are the chances I could be pregnant? Also, would a pregnancy test be accurate at this point?

444,"Background:I work for a multinational IT company as a financial analyst..basically I take care of invoicing the clients and following up for dues.. This is first job.. It's been almost 2years since I started working..


My company recently(5/6years) acquired another company from a different country..all the employees of acquired company were rebadged as employees of the acquiring company.. And now it has started laying off a lot of people who were rebadged.. Even people who had 35years of experience in the acquired company...


Now there is this lady who has been doing invoicing in the acquired company which now should be done by me...i don't know why it took 5yrs for my top management people to decide that invoicing should be done someone originally from the acquired company... Now she has been giving me KT fully knowing that she might lose her job if I start doing it independently.. She is very smart and professional..and most of all she is so sweet... But I am going through anticipatory guilt that she might get fired cos of me


I don't want to do that to her... I kinda connected with her professionally and personally.. She is almost my mom's age.. But she is a lot open minded and fun.. She even calls me her favorite student(apparently she was a teacher in some school before she joined company) 


I am planning on texting her on whatsapp asking sorry if she ever gets fired. 


I mean the person who had 35yrs of experience would have literally grew up with the company.. It must feel really shitty to get laid off after you put in 35yrs of your life in a company's growth... 


I want to know if that lady feels bad that I am picking up on the invoicing process faster than she thought..

452,"hopefully I can string some sentences together here, I'm having a pretty hard time talking about anything. I‚Äôm going to call my friend ‚Äújake‚Äù for privacy. This story is pretty specific and a lot of our friends are on reddit.

So he and I met in college in 2010. I was in the middle of a bad break up and had basically no friends at the time, was very lonely and depressed. we met at a party, he made a quip about stopping by my apartment to surprise me and keep me company, then he started doing just that pretty much every day for a year. Jake was everything I was not. He was tall, boisterous, and gay as hell. He didn't just bring me out of my shell, he forced me out with Madonna and Brittany spears and lady gaga and locked me in the club and threw away the key. He was the physical embodiment of a good time.

We moved in together around 2011-2012 (cant really remember) with a bunch of our friends in a big house on campus. We had so much fun. Just a big house full of our friends. We fought a little, but nothing serious. I had a big falling out with a group of mutual friends but never lost him.

About a year into living together, he started to get seizures. he said he had epilepsy as a child but hadn't had a seizure since middle school. First they came every other month, then every month, then every week. He lost his ability to drive but kept working. I took care of him all the while. I held him while he seized, I stayed with him and checked in on him constantly. He dropped out of college, I graduated around 2014.

I moved back to my home city and knew I wanted to keep living with him. I couldn't just leave him behind. Our other mutual friend and I looked for an apartment he could afford in the city (he could still work part time at this point) and found a great but slightly rickety old three bedroom. We lived together there for about 3 years, life was a dream even with the seizures. They started to come twice a week, then daily. Grand mal seizures, like in the movies. On my 24th (I think) birthday he had one so badly he crashed through the toilet and broke the porcelain. I came into the bathroom and found this 6ft tall man writing on the floor in a pile of broken ceramic, water gushing everywhere. We still lived together for one or two years after that, but it was hard. He didn't work, couldn't. I was going into debt (and am still in debt) paying for his rent and expenses. At the time I resented him, but now I don't regret a thing. 

About two years ago (I hope i'm not totally fucking up this timeline, dates are fuzzy as you can tell) he moved out. I couldn't take care of him by myself anymore. The seizures had taken a toll on his body and mind. He was depressed and grouchy, couldn't remember anything anymore. That hurt, because he lost good memories of us. Worse yet, his internal organs were badly damaged from the years of seizures. Doctors explained to us that during a seizure all the muscles in a person's body tighten at the same time, causing massive damage over time. I understood. But Jake needed special care now, so he moved back to the small town and into the small trailer he grew up in, with his mom and grandmother.

I worried. jake was big, loud and gay. I have an entire collection of wigs and drag make up I would have to hide from his mother when she came over for visits. But he told me he was doing great! I was so happy! He would tell me he and his mom were best friends, she had gotten over her insecurities and learned to accept her son for the big gay treasure he really is. He told me the doctors were getting the right combination of medicine and the seizures were subsiding, he might even be able to drive again! Such wonderful news! A miracle! 

Then on February first he went into the hospital. He was sick, some gallbladder thing. I told his mom not to worry, my mom had her gallbladder removed, it happens. She told me no something is really wrong. He stayed in the hospital, in and out of treatments and biopsies. I tried to update his massive friend circle on FB as best I could. I tried to visit as best I could but my car decided to die the same week.

Then on February first, his mom messages me, ""We need to talk about Jake, and I need you to sit down."" Cancer. Liver and pancreatic. Only a few months to live, maybe weeks. They can only keep him comfortable now.

How does this happen? We made jokes about Lindsey lohan and sailor moon in October around Halloween. We wished each other merry Christmas. The morning he went into the hospital, I sent him a message with a recipe attached, promising to make it for him when he got out. He said, ""Looks good, I cant wait, I miss you."" That was the last thing he said to me. 

His mom has asked that I don't tell any of our mutual friends about the cancer yet which is killing me because I have nobody to talk to. He was a very, very popular person. Our friendship is very well known, this is going to be devastating news and we all know it, Jake included. I am beset with grief. I cant sleep at all, when I do sleep I have terrible dreams. I cant focus on any task longer than a few minutes or even seconds. I sob, I get angry at the drop of a pin. People I have talked to keep saying the fucking stupidest shit about how its ""gods plan"". For a 26 yr old to die of cancer? Fucking shit plan there god. My mom is trying her best but she said maybe the dumbest thing yet to me this morning, ""As you get older people die, its part of lie."" Um pardon me but I AM TWENTY SEVEN NOT SEVENTY its not a ""normal"" part of life for the person you spent the entirety of your twenties with to die of fucking cancer. This is not a part of life, its a fucking tragedy straight from a cheesy teen novel. Nobody understands, I feel like my grief will rip the universe in half.

TLDR: my best friend is dying and I need advice, I think. I don't even know what questions to ask. How do I make this time count, especially when hes so sick he can barely comprehend whats going on around him? How do I begin to grieve properly? What do I do now that my best friend is dying?

455,"We aren't quite a rich family. My dad made a saving account on my name when i was like 12 or so on which he would regularly put money that i got for christmas, birthdays etc. As i turned 18 over a year ago, i got my own bank account which i needed to get payments for my first job. Also for my 18th birthday i was gifted enoguh cash, almost as much as i had made during that job. But out of all that money i wasted about 80% of it so far for various things, but i dont feel like it was overexcessive spending, but rather regular everyday stuff (and some nice clothes for once). The only thing i regret is wasting 200 USD on Steam, Deezer and stuff, but that isnt *way too large* of an amount compared to what i had (but its still kinda impactful). But my parents still called me irresponsible (they dont know about the online payments).

Back to the savings account, all of the savings have been transfered to my new accounts since i turned 18 (the money is almost 3 times of what i used to have in total). My dad told me that he wants me to transfer all of the savings money to him. At first i wanted to do it instantly, but as 3 months have passed since he had said it first time, i feel like i kinda need the money. If he strips me of all of the money i will have to ask of him for cash anyways (because i dont have time for a job). I also thought he was quite in a big debt, but he recently asked me for something on the matter of his accounts and i saw that he aint that low on money as i saw last time (and he used to be *waaay* under 0, while now he has almost 2x as much money above 0 as he had under it). 

Should i just listen to him and get this over with?

456,"Just going to give a warning this story is going to get NSFW in some places. So if that type of thing makes you uncomfortable, then please don't continue. 

I'm going my ex(now boyfriend) Zach for this. 

I broke up with my ex over a year ago, it was in November. The reason for breaking up isn't super relevant but I wasn't in a good place and things just weren't working. However we remained super close throughout that time and still had sex frequently. For a while we kind of accepted that we would never be together again and that we were stuck in this really weird place but something happened and we both developed feelings for each other again. The kind that make you want to be together. 

I was pretty vocal about wanting to get back together but he wasn't so sure. I kind of accepted that it wouldn't happen. So, I met this guy on Valentines day that was cute and was flirting with me. I gave him my number and didn't really think anything about it. Well Friday he asked me to come over (this is where I fucked up) I agreed to come over at like 6:30pm. So it wasn't super late or anything, just after he got off work. 

Well I go over to this guys house and I felt uncomfortable but I was like it's fine I'm just nervous. Well he starts kissing me and I wasn't really that into it but I didn't do anything. I had on a dress and he pushed me onto the bed and pushed it up and you can guess what happened next. No lube. No anything. It hurt so bad. I didn't even know it could hurt that bad. I just kinda cried and closed my eyes until it was over. I tried to focus on the sound of the TV. 

I left immediately after he finished. I got up, straightened my dress and left. I called a friend after because I felt so terrible. I cried and he asked me what happened. So I told him. He told me that I needed to file a police report but I didn't feel like I should because I went to the guys house and I didn't say no. So he hasn't spoken to me since I told him. Which sucks because I was pretty close with the friend that I told. 

The next day after this happened Zach asked me to be his girlfriend. I wanted this for months but it felt so wrong after what happened but I said yes. I said yes because I love him and want to move on. I truly love this guy and can't imagine life without him. He has been by my side for so much. 

The problem is I haven't . I think about what happened every single night. I have dreams about it. I haven't wanted to have sex with him because I just literally can't feel sexual attraction(I'm normally super into sex) He is super sweet and hasn't questioned it or pressured me because Zach has always been like that. I'm always the one who initiates sex. I think though that if it never happens he will probably ask what is going on. Then what will I say?

457,"  I'm in my second year of college at an extremely non-traditional private school (you can major in yoga, there's meditation in most classes, etc).

I chose my current college because it is one of the few in the states that offer a degree in Art therapy, which I had been set on since my freshman year of high school. Because of this, I never put in the work to really learn much core curriculum such as math, science, social studies, since my college doesn't require much if any of those.

  I'm two years in and this is the second semester of me feeling absolutely miserable in my classes and at school. I switched my major because the program I was in wasn't what I wanted or needed. I don't feel like I am learning or being challenged. It's known throughout the school that basically everyone gets an A or B no matter the difference in work. I feel myself trying really hard in all of my classes and hoping to be challenged but just being met with meditation and reflection papers. 

 I have been looking into transferring to the state school in the same town, but am worried that because I have so many strange credits on my transcript and no real core classes that I will be at least a year behind. This school has a highly accredited art program which is my main interest, and I know that the other classes will challenge me and give me better material. Also, the programs will be much harder which worries me as I don't want to fail, but also really want to learn what most people do in college.

 I am feeling very stuck and unsure of what to do next. My options are to stay where I am and feel as though I am wasting time and money to not learn anything, or transfer with a risk of falling behind and having to stay in school for an extra year. 

TL:DR; I don't know whether to transfer to a harder school with better programs or stay at the one that isn't challenging me or giving me the skills or knowledge I need.",18Feb2019,1

I  really want to get into doing art on youtube as a hobby, as well as ranting about my day while I draw.

I just want to do it as a hobby and keep up with any progress in my art, also, I'd like it to be sort of a diary where I can just bitch about my day, ( I'm in college, and I've got loads of things that I could just go on about, like my ancient professor that, side story: I have an ancient stats professor that shouldnt really be teaching, but last week a fire alarm went off in class, and as every one was leaving, he said ""I guess you guys are done for today"" and proceeded to go back to his office as the alarm blarred.

474,"TL;DR at the bottom 

I'll try and keep this as brief as possible. So my college started classes on the 12th of Feb. My first morning started with a long wait in traffic causing me to be 90 minutes late for my first lecture which, as it turns out, was the one in which they explain to the first years how to access the college's website to find assignments, marks, module info, etc. In addition to that I was one of the only people in the class to arrive without textbooks or a student card containing my student number which I needed to access the school network and computers. The next day I arrived around 30 minutes late as well and missed more important info about one of my modules. Also, we were assigned some practice exercises to do over the weekend which I didn't do (no excuse for this really). However, these exercises involved doing actual programming which WE HADN'T DONE IN THE CLASS AT ALL up to this point. This combined with the fact that I didn't have a textbook made me feel pretty screwed. Despite this, everyone else in the class seemed to have done it the following Monday. Today in class I couldn't follow the lecturer properly or catch up the work I missed because I was still waiting for my textbooks to be delivered. All the other students are learning how to code already and I basically haven't started. To make matters worse, I planned to catch up this afternoon but ended up stuck at a place with no internet for the ENTIRE DAY. Now I am going to have to go to class tommorow and fall even further behind the class. I feel like I'm drowning and I'm only one week into college. I don't know where to start. I don't have any friends in the class that I can get to help me. Any and all suggestions for what I can do to begin to work this all out would be greatly appreciated.

475,"*(I posted this as a comment to a question I posed on* r/introvert *about an issue regarding a friend not understanding my need for alone time. However, I'm now in an argument with my roommate, so I have slightly modified my comment for this thread. Thanks!)* 

I just want to thank all of you for replying in advance! Your input means a lot to me. In all honesty, I have been struggling with my friendships lately, as I think I've been going through some social burnout. After resolving a prior issue with my friend, I got into an argument with my roommate (whom I've known for many years) about requesting that she send her boyfriend home, instead of letting him sleep over (as I usually allow) just because I have been so exhausted lately. I was as polite as possible, and even showed my friends my text, all of them saying that it was friendly / benevolent. However, after she initially said yes, and I replied with a genuine ""thank youuu"" she texted me again, bitching at me, arguing that us having separate rooms (despite being crammed into what couldn't be more than a 250 sq ft space) should justify her having her boyfriend over as she pleases, and disregarding the fact that he uses our kitchenette and bathroom as he wants (even taking it upon himself to use one of our NEW toothbrushes for himself, and using our shower) and is over frequently (usually 3-4 times a week, not always sleeping over, but there for hours). I have discussed with her many times about how I'd like her to ask me to have him sleep over (because I'll usually say yes anyway, *her* happiness matters to me too) however, I'd like the option to say ""no"" once in awhile. I've told her that my personal space and alone time is crucial for me, especially after work and social events (like things for my co-ed frat, etc). **Anyways,** after replying ""alright"" to her passive-aggressive, bitchy, text, I requested that my friends let me walk home from their apartment complex. I needed time to cool off and think - I was upset, irrational, and Needed To Be *Alone.* My phone died, but I wasn't worried about it. I just needed to calm down - it was probably better that it died anyway. However, one of my friends who had dropped me off contacted my roommate, and they came looking for me. They followed me to the apartment complex when I was about to leave, and she hopped out of the car and began yelling at me, telling me to get in the car. Instead of acknowledging the things that **she** had done to **me**, she began gas-lighting the scenario, yelling at me about my mental health and family situation - when all I had asked of her was to 1) send her boyfriend home for one night and 2) let me walk the 15-20 minute walk home. Anyways, my point is this - do any of you have any advice on how I can address this issue with her? I scheduled a meeting with my RA to view our roommate agreement to see what can be done - but I haven't spoken to her since we fought Saturday night. I don't feel the need to apologize, and honestly wouldn't be mad about not speaking to her in depth again, however I do need to be able to neutralize the situation, and be able to discuss things like groceries, etc. My dad and I have talked about seeing if I can get assigned to a different room, but I really don't want to give her the satisfaction of having the dorm to herself haha.

**TL;DR: Now I'm in the midst of a fight with my roommate, about how I requested she send her boyfriend home for once (this is the first time I've requested she do this since at lease before winter break) and she argued that he should be allowed to stay because we have separate rooms (despite the 250 sq ft size of our dorm). She then yelled at me, saying that the reason I'm upset with her is due to my mental health, and not the fact that she blatantly disrespected me after having had several discussions about personal space, boundaries, and use of the dorm.**

**What is your advice? I don't feel the need to apologize - but we aren't exactly on speaking terms. Do you think I should apologize? Should I just try to move out? What if I don't want her to have the satisfaction of having the dorm to herself? Am I overreacting? Being too petty?**

The academics here are very rigorous and since high school I have never truly practiced good study habits and devoting time to school work. As a computer science major, I am required to take numerous math courses, (at this college with the required math courses, I am one class short of a minor in math after all the required courses) numerous science courses, HUMA's, and then the beloved computer science courses. The computer science courses are my favorite and what I excel at, but the other courses are of some difficulty for me, well, an immense amount of difficulty for me.

I have much difficulty devoting time to school work. As a college student, this is my first step into adulthood and having all the freedom I want. Thus, I have trouble sitting down and doing school work and focusing my time on everything I should be doing, but rather spend my time watching youtube, browsing reddit, playing video games, or being with friends. Luckily, I am not one to need to sleep much and never waste my time napping, which I find to be a good thing considering most my friends here nap 3-4 times a day.

&amp;#x200B;

Growing up through high school, I sought-after help from guidance counselors, school psychologists, etc., looking for help with study habits. I felt that I had test anxiety because it felt that no matter how much work I did or how much I studied I never truly understood the material. To this day, I feel as though I really just never had good study habits and time management for what was important. At college, I find myself struggling with the same things, as well as just doing my work and being ahead. I consistently do my work and get it done, but it is rather crammed and I know that I should not be doing that. When I sit down to ""study"" I sit down and read my notes and other study materials for maybe 2 hours truly after I tell myself I am going to do it all day, but rather get sidetracked watching youtube or twitch.

&amp;#x200B;

I need help, I need helpful friendly advice to help boost me in the right direction. I cannot be going to this college and not putting into it what I am paying.

496,"One of my best friends lately has been kind of off. I didn‚Äôt notice anything till two days ago when she didn‚Äôt respond to anything I sent her, for over 24 hours. She said she just didn‚Äôt feel like talking to anyone. Then it hit me that she said a day before that that she was tired and stressed and all that. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it because that‚Äôs how I feel 24/7 lmao.


I told her if she needed anything she could tell me and she said ‚Äúthank u‚Äù. That‚Äôs not normally how she types, she‚Äôs very articulate. She sent me a snap that day that made me even more worried so I asked her if she was okay and she just left it on read.

She did the same thing and didn‚Äôt open anything I sent again, till this morning when I texted her saying ‚Äúwhat the fuck‚Äù.

She texted back an hour or two later asking me to leave her be. She said she‚Äôs not trying to be mean, she just needs space right now. She typed rn which isn‚Äôt usually how she types.

You ever send a text and immediacy regret it? I have.

I texted her back with ‚Äúspace from me or in general? Did I do something? What‚Äôs this all about?‚Äù

I then asked her if she was okay.

Still no response


What the hell do I do? She‚Äôs one of my best friends and I don‚Äôt want to loose her. I don‚Äôt really think she‚Äôs trying to cut me out of her life. But she‚Äôs done this before but never this drastic, and it was after a traumatic experience.

I want to be there for her because she is genially worrying me. Not only for our friendship but she‚Äôs acting completely out of character and that‚Äôs scary. I know that could mean she‚Äôs depressed and thinking about ending her life. Which made me think about all the subtle depressing shit she‚Äôs said lately that I‚Äôve brushed off. Instagram tells you what people your following posts they like and it‚Äôs just stuff that‚Äôs sad and depressing.

How do I deal with this? I want her to have the space she requested but I‚Äôm also really worried about her? Should I text her later and ask her if she‚Äôs okay? I‚Äôve never had someone close to me do this ",18Feb2019,1
498,"So I've been living in an apartment in NYC for a year and a half now. Everything has been mostly fine up until a couple months ago. A guy I was very skeptical about has moved in to the room downstairs (which is technically a basement). The reason I'm suspicious is he doesn't seem to have a real job. He told me he buys broken phones off of the internet and repairs them and then sells them. He also was apparently hired as the super for my building. However, I frequently see him in his car with it running with other people in my neighborhood, and I noticed today that his car has fake license plate numbers over his actual plates.

I've since put a deposit down to move into a new place for March as he had been smoking in the apartment. I made complaint to our landlord and since then he has stopped smoking, but I started noticing other smells in our building starting last week. The first thing I noticed was that when I was doing my laundry, our laundry room and hallway smelled like some kind of gas or a bbq. The smell was pretty disgusting and stuck to my clothes after I pulled them out of the dryer.

Now a couple nights ago over the weekend on saturday night I noticed something that smelled like burning plastic in our apartment and I'm pretty sure my roommate's bathroom fan downstairs was running all night. I also saw that his light was on all night. I noticed the smell returned again last night after he came home, and this morning I heard what sounded like a blow dryer and there was a smell similar to window cleaners that reeked throughout our apartment. I should also mention that on saturday night he wanted me to help him set up a motion activated IP camera that sends notifications to his phone when it sees something.

 I left to go to work as soon as I could. I'm very scared about what is going on down there and I want to move out as soon as possible. Am I overreacting or do I have good reason to be suspicious? I have been diagnosed with anxiety so sometimes it is hard for me to judge a situation properly. I am afraid to call the police as I live in the same apartment as him and the possibility that he may be affiliated with some gangs.

Unfortunately I am not from the area so I don't really have any friends or family I know I can stay with, and I have a job. Right now I feel like my only options are stay in the current apartment until I can move into the one I put a deposit down on, which would probably be another 2 weeks at least, or just take a bus back upstate tomorrow to move back home and quit my job, and pick up my stuff later.

If I went with the second option, would all of my stuff be contaminated with whatever chemicals he's potentially dealing with? I have a lot of expensive stuff including my computer and my guitars.",18Feb2019,5

500,"Hi? Right now I feel desperate and I don't know what to do, so... I guess I pretty much need some advice.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR : My partner has been abused by people who used to be friends of ours, who treated him like shit and called him an abuser, while they were calling me a genius and saying I was better than him in every thing he ever loved. Now he feels bad everytime we do the same thing and knows it's not my fault, and he doesn't know what to do anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what happened in detail...

&amp;#x200B;

My partner in crime and I have known each other for more than ten years now. We met on a Pok√©mon website when we were just children, and for some months now, I've been living by his side. Our apartments are very close and we see each other (almost) everyday. We're going to the same university, we often get out to do stuff...

We had already seen each other IRL several times, before I moved in the same city than him. But he used to be so much closer to me and so much happier in life... When I was 14, my parents divorced and I was really sad about this, and he always done the best he could to cheer me up and make me smile. When he had problems too, I was here for him and we've already been through really harsh times together. Still, here we are. But during all of these years, I've never seen him feeling so bad...

&amp;#x200B;

First, he's been abused all his life by his family. His parents are pretty violent persons, and he still has contact with them. When I've known him years ago, this was already the case, and he was already very anxious and depressed because of this. But still, sharing times together would make him forget about this and he was feeling confident about himself.

But something made things really worse... We're both art lovers and we're both fond of writing and drawing/painting. When we where just teens, we made friends on an online art community... We had lots of mutual friends, and one day, my partner introduced me to two persons he really liked, and... Things started to get pretty bad between us.

These two persons would compliment my art, make a lot of gift art to me and call me a genius... While totally ignoring my partner, and treat him like shit. But they would always pretend to be nice, and make him think he was the abusive person...

We were both teens and both had our own problems at the time. I started pretending to be ok when talking to him, to post vent art at the same time and that made him feel so heartbroken I was too afraid to tell him when I wasn't ok. These two persons I was talking about were encouraging me to make more and more vent art. They also started to suggest my partner was a toxic abuser to me, and were often telling me ""be sure you know your REAL FRIENDS, we love you...""

&amp;#x200B;

My partner, at some moment, became very suicidal. His family was still super abusive. And these two persons, who were really popular, would tell everyone, me included, he was an abuser, for absolutely no reason despite the fact he would not comment their own art anymore, and I was deeply concerned for him at the time... I've never felt so scared for him.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually, I started to realize these two persons were kinda manipulating me, covering me with gifts, letters, and nice words, but they were trying to separate me from the person I would have died for... I slowly tried to cut ties with them, and when I told them I didn't want to be their friend anymore, they became assholes to me and told our mutuals friends I was an abusive dick. It was my turn now. But I didn't care much about them and anyone on that art community anymore, I wanted to be with my partner and be able to help him.

&amp;#x200B;

But I guess this was already too late... I have stopped talking to them for a year, now, but my partner has been sick every day of his life since... Whenever he would make and post art, these people would remind him I was a better artist than he ever was, and that made him so sick... He lives for his art, I've never seen someone so invested in their work... We used to create together and be super happy, now he feels absolutely insecure whenever I talk about art to him... And I'm an art student, now. Art is a very important part of our lives nowadays, and this is so hard to live. It also happens, even with silly things. For exemple, if I tell him I really like that book, or that writer, he will start to think ""shit, this is her thing now, I can't like it anymore"" and he can't see that thing or think about it without panicking.

He often tells me about it and apologizes for ""being such an abusive person"", fearing I won't do anything anymore because of me being afraid to hurt him. He also told me whenever he sees me, he feels really bad and sick, and that it's not even my fault, I did nothing wrong... Then he starts apologizing again, calling himself a narcissistic pervert and reducing himself.

&amp;#x200B;

Now we're really open about our feelings, we tell each other what we really think and feel, and don't hide anything or lie anymore. And he really means it. He knows I've always been here for him, that I love him, and that I'd do anything for him, and that I'd never, ever want to disrespect him and his passions. But he says he just doesn't know what to do when that happens... He refuses to see a psychiatrist, meds never helped him in any way and every time he tried to see one, they eventually called his family and he had problems, he's traumatized by that and he feels really hurt whenever someone asks him to do so. Recently, he's been trying to share his work again on the Internet and feels a bit more confident about it than he was a few months ago.

We both love each other a lot... We consider each other as a soulmate and both of us can't considerate a future without the other. He would never hurt me, and I'd never do the same neither. 

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone here lived something similar? Is there a way to make his brain stop associating me automatically with bad feelings? Even if it takes time, that's not a problem. I just want this hell to stop, for him, and for me...

501,"I wasn't thinking about it much, but everyone around me are laughing or are degrading me after I told them that I'm studying Survey Engineering Topography &amp; GIS, mostly because of ""Topography"".

I'm a freshman, now second semester started, everything is fine, found some cool guys there, the library is pretty rich and the whole ""bachelor feel"" is fine. However, I'm not sure if I want to continue studying that. I love Geology, Astronomy, I love everything about computers (mostly programming) and my favourite subject in college right now is Cartography. But when I got asked what am I studying everyone is asking me ""why"" and say things like ""the only work you will find is to measure the ground to build a home for a very small amount of 700‚Ç¨"". My family is poor and I'm the only one who got into college so I thought that I will work after the degree for at least 1000‚Ç¨ to support my family.

But the worst part is, all my friends are studying ""better"" things: Chemistry, Physics, Plane Engineering, Civil Engineering, Biology, Architecture and Computer Science; and they're literally degrading me by how easy are my subjects compared to them. I never thought it as a competition, neither I wanted to show everyone off that I got into college, I choose it because I am interested mostly in GIS. Sounds stupid, but I DO CARE about what others thinks about me after comparing me to my friends several times or when a stranger changes his expression to a ""disgusted"" on face and stopping asking me about my studying when they hear that title, while they can listen to my friend's studies for hours with delightness. Also my mother's friends do the same and now she also is comparing me to her friends' children who are working at decent job after finishing High School.

All this makes me have a little anxiety. Sometimes I'm thinking to give up and find a job (before college I was fixing computers for living) to support my family but also to finally buy proper things and clothes. Or to apply to different college by giving again exams. Anything to just stop feeling as a loser from my cycle.",18Feb2019,1
502,"I'll start off by saying we are both in long term relationships, I've been with my boyfriend for 5 years and he(I will call him Dave) has been with his girlfriend for 4 years. We are all in the same group of friends but me and Dave are very close, we hang out together atleast twice a week and we are always texting. It has never been anything romantic, although we do occasionally cuddle or hold hands when we are drunk but this has always been with our partners and again nothing romantic, only ever friendly, we are just best friends and have alot in common so it is very easy to chill with him. 

About 2 weeks ago, Dave and I went for a drive and we got some ice cream. The whole day he was off with me, not really engaging in much conversation. But I stupidly dropped my spoon and a bit of ice cream went on the seat, I cleaned it up but he didn't speak to me again after it, even after I apologised. I went home and I didn't hear from him at all, I spoke to his girlfriend and she said he was pissed about it and if it had left a mark then he said he would have went crazy, but it didn't.

On Thursday I was with my friends and we went to drop something off to him at band practice and sometimes we hang out for a while but when he saw me in the car, his face just dropped. I ended up just heading home.

Last night I called his girlfriend and we were organising a day to have a chill day and she said Saturday since Dave was off too and we could all hang out, line went silent for a couple seconds and then she said we could do it at my house with just me and her. I said yeah that's cool but it's playing with my head now. I don't see why he is being like this with me, and my anxiety has been crazy because of it and I feel like I want to isolate myself from my friends.

505,"I've written and deleted this post several times. I hate drama and am terrified that my sibling will find this and freak out. But I've also spent the past 3 days calling hotlines, rehab centers, and therapists, and still don't know what to do. I would love to speak to a drug and alcohol addiction counselor, but with the weekend and the holiday I can't seem to find anyone who is immediately available. I need someone immediately because I leave town in a few days. 

I live in a different country from the rest of my family, and have come back to see them for a different sibling's funeral. We're all very sad about this death, but we also knew it was coming for some time. My surviving brother has been an alcoholic for the past 20+ years, in addition to having a gambling problem and ""casually"" using hard drugs. When he's sober is a genuinely funny, thoughtful, caring person. But he's rarely sober lately. He's failed rehab before, and has zero desire to try again. He thinks he can pass for sober when he wants to (he cannot), and that anyone who doesn't like his using or shitty behavior can fuck off. I'm usually pretty tolerant of his BS especially since I live far far away, but this visit I'm feeling done. I found out he stole some of our sibling's pain meds the morning they died... this fact has really messed with me. When I found out he had the meds I secretly confiscated them (he was too fucked up to notice at the time), and since then he's pressured a much younger relative to try to get them back from me (the meds are gone already, I disposed of them anonymously at the police station). The fact that he would ask a younger member of the family to help him get these stolen pills back makes me furious. He also hasn't come by to help clean out our dead sibling's stuff, and this sibling was a hoarder so it's a whole hell of a lot of stuff. Frankly, after writing this I almost don't care if he finds this post. I know he's lonely, depressed, and bitter. I would love to see him be sober and happy. But I'm angry right now. The best, most positive thing I can think to do is offer to help him get to rehab before I leave in a few days. I'd happily drive him across the state to go, and I could even pay for his rent while he's there so he doesn't have to lose his place. But I also know this suggestion will piss him off tremendously. The folks at various hotlines I've called warned me against involving the police because that will only alienate him further and could destroy the little bit of normalcy he currently has, so that's really not an option. I don't want to ruin him. I want to help him not be a piece of shit. Is it even worth bringing any of this up to him?

It'll be probable that she'll like the gesture of being handed them, and I think my mother would be proud that I would give up something so few in quantity but with such sentimental value just to see her smile.  


Lately she's been having a tough time with her personal life, so I've been being nice to her, giving her hugs and what have you.

510,"This is a repost of something I made on r/depression a few hours ago, and I wanted to post it here incase someone has advice. I hope that's okay, and sorry that this post is so long. I'm terrible at keeping what I say concise, and I want to give as many details as possible in case they're important.

Anyways, some context; I'm a male highschooler who's only had one relationship when I was younger. I look like a hippie (long hair, lanky body, always wearing a beanie, baggy sweaters and jeans, all stars), and I sound like one too due to my constant stuttering and long pauses (despite jokes about it, I've never done any drugs). I've also had multiple periods in my life where I went through very difficult times (for example, my dad berated me a few months before my first relationship about quitting football, saying that I was just going to kill myself with a shotgun after doing nothing in life). Ever since the beginning of January though, things have gone downhill quick.

First, my dad had to go to the hospital because of a 1.5 in. stone in his neck (for reference, the doctor who treated him said that it was the biggest one he'd seen). If he had waited about 36 hours after he made it to the ER, his doctor estimated, he probably would've suffocated from the tumor applying pressure on his windpipe.

Second, the day after he came home for recovery (luckily it wasn't cancerous), he found out that my mom had been cheating on him for at least 3 months. This caused them to get divorced (which they said they were going to do 2 times before, the first time being last January and the second being four months ago). All of this happened the week before finals (our school had major renovations done to fix structural problems, so we had to do finals after winter break). It's important to note that, due to immense pressure from my father, I had to get straight A's (which I did throughout middle school for the same reason), and two of my classes were relying on me to ace their finals in order to get an -A, yet I had been procrastinating on studying (due to an apathetic feeling that'd been lingering inside me since I finished 7th grade).

During finals, I started to get an immense feeling of apathy to practically everything in life. Over the past year, I'd waned from drawing (to compare, before then I'd draw for nearly 3 hours every day). I also began fearing that my small group of kinda-friends (I never hung out with them outside of school, and haven't spent much time with anyone since elementary) hated me, since I'm pretty annoying. My friends also constantly poke fun at me, which I don't mind really. For example, when I brought up my ex and talked about how I got asked out by an alcoholic drug-abuser a month earlier, one of them replied, ""That's... surprising. Not trying to be an asshole, but you aren't someone that I'd have pictured as being in a relationship."" This passive-aggressive attitude from them seemed to flare up during and after finals though, which was probably influenced by one of our major friends in the group being homeschooled after her parents found out that she was dating someone way older than her, and that he'd done some unspecified, terrible thing.

The week after finals was somehow worse though. On my mom's side, my grandpa had to be rushed to the ER because his lungs couldn't take in any oxygen (he worked as a grease monkey for \~35 years before he retired, and his lungs had suffered greatly from it). A day later, my grandma became so sick that she couldn't talk and didn't leave the house for 2 weeks. On my dad's side, my grandma's back was only getting worse, and her hips were in immense pain constantly. I also overheard that my dad may have genetic diabetes from my grandma, which very likely could've been passed down to me (for context, I lost \~45 pounds since late middle school to avoid any health problems, so this hurt a lot).

This week, my mom has moved out, and my parents are trying as hard as possible to make it easy on me by being as calm as possible on the subject. I'm currently going between their homes on a weekly basis.

This is where my apathy has hit hardest though. Ever since January, I've found it incredibly hard to care about anything. Whenever I draw, I can't come up with any ideas, and I don't get any joy out of it. Hell, I don't even have the drive to do anything. Whenever I play games, I never feel any sense of reward. Whenever I do homework, I feel nothing. At best, I think to myself, ""cool, that's something crossed off the to-do list."" I can't even imagine loving anyone, and I'm scared of commitment. I sometimes question whether I even love my own parents anymore (they're great parents and good people, but I just don't feel much for them for some reason). I've become distant to all of my online friends, to the point where I talk to them *maybe* every two weeks. I feel like a fuck-up whenever I fall asleep sometimes, like I've wasted too much of my life to care anymore. I fantasize about packing the bare essentials and freight hopping across the US until I die homeless.

Sorry if this comes off as rambly and really tmi, I've never really talked to anyone about this (besides 1 or 2 online friends and slightly mentioning it once to my mom, who has completely forgotten about it). Mostly because I'm scared that I'm just making it up (which my dad insists that I always do whenever I talk about anything, mental health-related or otherwise) and that I'm too well off to complain about it. I also feel really bad for making my friends listen to me whine about my life, so I never talk about personal things with them. I've even gotten into a habit of forcing my emotions down to come off as nonchalant and carefree (have been for a little over a year now) and to also avoid worrying about things, since I would cry often about being a terrible person in middle school.

I'm pretty sure that this isn't normal, but I don't know what to do. I'm scared of saying that I'm depressed, because I don't want to seem like I'm making a big deal out of nothing, and I don't want to pester anyone about myself. I don't want to make my parents pay for any treatment either, because my mom has a terrible job, and my dad still has to pay his medical bills (which are extreme, to say the least). I also don't have any money either, since I only work summers to focus on homework and volunteering during the school year (which has left me with about 1.5k, but I've heard that a single therapy session is \~400$ locally, and medication is far worse). I also don't want to risk wasting money if it turns out that nothing is wrong with me.

So, what should I do? Should I just go get treatment, despite my worries? Is there even anything to get treated? Am I making this whole thing up? Should I just stop complaining and deal with it? Is it normal to feel like this, given the circumstances? How can I deal with these issues at home?

PS - I really want to emphasize that I don't want to come off as someone who's faking this to get attention. That worry has been making me hold a lot of this in for a long time, and it's still there. I also don't want to come off as pessimistic or edgy or something. IRL, I'm pretty optimistic, although I act as such just to please everyone around me (which is also why I still try to get high marks). Thanks in advance for any help you guys may have, by the way.

TL;DR - A lot of bad things have been happening recently and have been for a while now. I'm afraid that I can't feel anything because of it, including interpersonal connections. What do I do?",18Feb2019,1

Fast forward to now, my gf of 6 months had a relapse depression phase a month ago and its bothering me a lot. She used to be happy,cheerful and motivated but now she seems lost and has a lot of self hate now. When I first heard that she had cut herself I have to muster up some forced emotions just so I can feel really bad for her because I dont know how to react or say. When she cries to me about her problems , I was sad but annoyed at it but I did stay with her and accompany her because I know she needs it and how much it meant to her. Dont get me wrong, I do get sad but its just more of a passive thing and I dont cry for her almost all the time. Whats worse is that when she says something irritating I rebuttal her back not considering her feelings that she can say the wrong things when she has her depression even though she mentions it more than a few times already.

Would also like to mention that when my step sister told me she wanted to kill herself I dont really feel any urgency at all and just completely ignored her feelings. Even when I told my parents this (by my sisters command) in my mind I emotionally couldnt be bothered. Present day I know its fucked up and I dont want her to be like this again.

I want to ask, how do I feel more empathy and have more emotions towards her to show that I truly care and that I really want her to get better? 

I love her a whole lot and she makes my day brighter and also stayed with me to fought my depression every day before(she is very emphathic unlike me). I feel like I havent done enough yet to support her through her darkest moments and I want to change that.

514,"I'm applying for a job position at uni and neither of the ancient references I have on my CV are relevant to the position. I did however work on a project last year with a guy who has a big name and a lot of citations within this specific field. He respected my work and said I should send him an email if I ever wanted to get into research.

Last November I sent him an email asking if he wanted to meet but he said his mother was dying and it'd be difficult for him to find the time so I said he doesn't need to bother etc. and that I hope he gets plenty of time to spend time with his mother
I gave up on talking to him again because I never knew when it'd be appropriate

Now I'm 3 days away from the application deadline and am considering emailing him to ask if he can be my referee because my family keeps encouraging me to do so. Is it possible? I don't know how to phrase the email because if I don't ask him how things are going it'll seem insensitive and if I do ask then it'll sound forced.I don't know. His mother might be dead and I want him to tell some people I'm qualified for the position",18Feb2019,0
515,"Hi guys, I‚Äôm beginning to lose my mind. I‚Äôm (21f) a senior in college and also taking graduate classes through an accelerated master‚Äôs program. I have no idea how I‚Äôm surviving because I get about 4 hours of sleep every night and wake up sad/discouraged because going through each day is too much to handle. 

I‚Äôm also the president of a small honor society that no one respects or cares about, and the professors who manage the group aren‚Äôt involved and wouldn‚Äôt care if it never lived to see another day. I‚Äôm so passionate about the group and I work tirelessly to fix it/keep it alive. No one at the school will cooperate with me, meaning the organization will die after this semester if I can‚Äôt do something. 

I get emails/texts every single day at all hours about academic things, I don‚Äôt have any friends and live off campus, and I have no outlet for my stress. Even if I had an outlet, I wouldn‚Äôt have the time. I have assignments due every single day except Thursdays, which I reserve for grocery shopping/meal prep/cleaning. 

I‚Äôve been telling myself ‚Äújust do it and it‚Äôll get done‚Äù but I struggle to get out of bed and do even the simplest of tasks because I feel like I can‚Äôt breathe. I think my stress is prohibiting me  from doing my work, so I‚Äôm stuck in a counterproductive loop. 

Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt think I can afford counseling because I don‚Äôt work right now and my college doesn‚Äôt offer individual counseling. I was considering asking my doctor about anxiety mediation but I feel like I should try other methods too. 

I know once this semester ends I‚Äôll be able to calm down, but it‚Äôs so difficult to see the light at the end of the tunnel through my anxiety. 

Does anyone know of a better way to approach my stress? Maybe through reframing the way I see my work, physical activities, or even medication. I‚Äôve never felt this awful in my life, even at my worst. Please let me know what worked for you when you experienced overwhelming stress. Thank you so much in advance!

Tldr; I‚Äôm an overwhelmed college student with no ideas on how to reduce this stress effectively, any ideas?",18Feb2019,3
516,"18M here. Since becoming an adult I did a semester of college where I experimented with weed a lot and got very depressed from the stress of parents wanting me to take all the opportunities of college, not knowing why i was there, all the money that went into it, having no real friends and feeling extremely lonely and empty most days, and childhood trauma. When I was 17 I had some times where I was taking college level classes and got so depressed from it I forgot to show up to a midterm and didn't care. No learning problems, I can binge learn real easily, but I didn't like being there or doing the work so I died and would lose interest in everything and feel a seething emptiness.

Anyways, after some shit happened at home with my sisters, I had a break down where I had trouble breathing and cried hysterically and had to go for a walk. Smoked weed that night and woke up the next day super care free and only did things I liked. Before that I'd have similar days but would randomly feel really sad and unmotivated on most and productive on others. After the breakdown though, I was feeling amazingly free and great. Then some online friends noticed in comparison I was really down and lost the next week. I felt like I'd really enjoy being killed by a large metal scaffold from a nearby construction site. I didn't like anything in life and was tired of trying, but just dragged on. And it keeps going on.

I've been home trying to find work and have these swings still. I remember like a month ago I got hyper and shaved my head bald because I thought it'd be cool to try. I then stayed up till 6am working on creative projects and blasting motivational music in my ear. I felt like I was going to make it eventually after I put in the work and that I'm a creative genius. Not long after I got really depressed and agitated. Around a week ago I got really depressed and drank a bunch of monsters and ate junk food and didn't eat during the day much at all. I felt a stress or something so I'd hit my arms against things to feel the pain and would go on 4chan for the purpose of making people bully me. Then I meditated for 10 minutes and felt great again. Last night i didn't sleep. Drank 2 monsters, a cup of coffee, worked on creative projects, ranted to friends about how i'll make it and I found the right project after getting ideas and feeling motivated from beating a game. I got a lot done and it simmered down, but now I'm tired.

But yeah, I did some therapy and a pre-therapy counceling session and talked about it. They said how I'm not bipolar (which i know), but I still feel something's not right. They just said everyone has good and bad days so I assumed everyone felt the same. I don't do anything too crazy, but I go from feeling like shit and wanting to abuse drugs and alcohol for the rest of my life one day, to feeling like I can do it all and productive another day. And it can change within the day suddenly. Maybe it's just brooding or something? Thanks for reading",18Feb2019,1
517,"I have no idea if this is the right sub for this so I'm sorry if this isn't meant to be here.

I have always been weak in so many ways. One way that I am weak is when dealing with even slight confrontation or standing up for myself. I always break down in tears and hyperventilate so I can't even explain why I'm crying. Literally 15 minutes ago, I had a slight confrontation with my dad. I'm not even sure I'd call it that. Basically, I suggested an idea for something, his reaction was completely unnecessary. He reacted with anger. I reacted back with more anger. I've never been able to do that until recently. 

I want to be able to hold it together and to be able to explain my point properly. I don't want to have to walk away from anything because I have to cry. I'm sick of crying.",18Feb2019,3
518,"**The Backstory:**

I'll start from the beginning. I am a 25 year old male with CP, currently living with my cousin, his wife and 1 year old child. I‚Äôve had depression for as long as I can remember, I've never been diagnosed but I‚Äôm certain that‚Äôs what it is. When I was 19 I had to move back home from college because I made very poor decisions and was very irresponsible. Now, I hated living in that house growing up, I wont go into details, because that's all that matters. Shortly after I moved back home my cousin, K, gave me an opportunity to come live with him and his dad to get me out of the situation I hated so much. So naturally, I took him up on his offer and came to live with him. Now, K has always been a very proactive person, always looking for ways to move forward and complete his goals. I, am the polar opposite I only will do something when the mood strikes me, and I've always been that way. So, it shouldn‚Äôt surprise you when I say we fight a lot. I would sit at home all day, while he would go to work and school and be productive. Obviously, he wasn‚Äôt very happy about that. I lived with him for 6 months before I decided I wanted to move back home and not deal with the stress of living with him. And I was fine with that for a little while. I would stay inside for months at a time and not do anything. Needless to say, my depression got worse and I did basically nothing for 2 years. After a while I got sick of living at home again and K decides to give me another chance. I‚Äôve lived with him for almost a year now. In that time he‚Äôs given me a job with his business, I‚Äôve cleaned up a lot, started talking to women, and trying to go on dates. Sounds great, right? 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Problem:**

Well here's the problem, I am still very depressed. My life has gotten a lot better over the past couple of years thanks to K. I won't give him all the credit, I've made some good decisions and have worked towards improving my life, but I have mostly K to thank. Without him, I would be a lot worse off; there's no doubt about that. Still, I am not very happy with my life right now and I feel like I should be. Why not? Things are starting to go my way. Well K has started to notice that I'm still not very happy despite the improvements we've made in my life and I can feel some resentment brewing. He's told me before very recently that everything he's done for me has felt like wasted effort. Of course, this makes me very upset to hear. I'm beginning to feel some resentment towards him as well now. I feel like he's starting to turn his back on me. Ultimately, I don't think he will, but I don't think I'm wrong about him resenting me, at least a little. Now all I want to do is push him away. I don't really want to hang out with him anymore. I'm always super stressed out whenever he comes around me now. All I want to do now is sit in my room and not be bothered. And I know that it's only straining our relationship. I need to go see a therapist for sure now because I can't help but feel it's all my fault. My fault for not being happy with what I have and where I'm at now. This will only get worse if I don't do something.",18Feb2019,1

523,"Hello reddit. So, I was very close to my roommates until an incident a few days ago when one of them began to scream in my face, shoved my fianc√©, threw chairs and threatened to assault me. His partner made him leave the apartment and stay in a hotel for the last few days until he felt that it would be safe for him to come back. 

Well, he's coming back tonight and we don't feel safe at all. We're still in the middle of getting our names added to the lease and the utilities getting switched over in our name, so if he does try something, I'm afraid of calling the police in fear of losing our home. They're already moving out next month, but I don't know how I'm supposed to feel safe until then. Our bedroom doesn't have a locking door, and I can't barricade it at night because I have a medical condition that causes frequent urination, so I need to be able to get to the bathroom. (I hate having to mention that bit bc it's so embarrassing, but I feel like it's relevant info here.) 

I don't have anyone that I could stay with for awhile (no family or friends live in the area) so that sadly isn't an option. 

Does anyone have any advice? Possibly ways that I can secure the door that can quickly be undone and redone so that I can leave the room? Precautions I can take?

Gonna be homeless soon. Would like to know what options + resources are available for me.

526,"My dads from Jamaica and I‚Äôm from Ny, but my mom moved myself and my siblings to Tx when we were younger and ever since I was about 12 I‚Äôve had difficulty keeping in contact with him. 

He can‚Äôt write or read really, but managed to build a 6 figure business long ago when he came here from hard work and dedication. My mom and other factors, but mainly mom, lack of support, and not being a permanent resident led to him losing it all, which was extremely difficult because my dads the sweetest most hard working person I know and he‚Äôs already over 73. He had to move back to Jamaica a year before because he couldn‚Äôt afford the NY cost anymore and flies back every 6 months to handle court stuff. 

Anyways 2 years ago he told me they were threatening to deport him &amp; I instantly bought a ticket to speak on his behalf in NY (regarding charges my mom had against him).

When leaving I didn‚Äôt get to see him a final time because I was staying in jersey and he was staying in NY and I got really sick the last few days, but after arriving back in Texas we kept in contact for a few months. 

Since then I‚Äôve had horrible financial hardship and could barely keep a phone to keep in contact with anyone, let alone call outside of the US. Several reasons including mental health, job &amp; car losses, hurricane &amp; flooding of my home etc. 

I have an address for an aunt in New York and was thinking of sending her a letter or something in hopes of getting back in touch with my father, but I‚Äôm terrified about how he‚Äôll feel, what she‚Äôll say, etc. I don‚Äôt even know what to say. I was friends on Facebook with my sister (on dads side) who I never met, (born out of country) but it seems we are no longer friended on Facebook. 


The last time we were out of contact for maybe 2 months he said he felt like I had given up on him, so he gave up too, but I couldn‚Äôt afford to call out the country at the time. He told me that because I‚Äôve lost touch with him ranging from weeks to years throughout my life, BUT I always try my hardest and eventually find him again.

This was a very difficult time in his life and mines too. while I regret not being there for him, especially because of his age, I was 18 and had too much on my plate and became overwhelmed. Add on the international calling fees and I could barely pay my phone bill, I just kind of faded away and let life consume me.

So I guess I‚Äôm asking for advice on how I should make contact, do you guys think it‚Äôs been too long, and how to explain everything without seeming like I just didn‚Äôt care. I love my dad with all my heart but have extreme anxiety over this. Any thoughts would be appreciated.

At school we hang out, talk, normal stuff..but besides school i am always the one who asks them to hang out, and the turn me down most of the time. Basically that is just 2 people. One of them is like a brother to me, but i think he thinks of me much less, i feel like i am the kind of guy that he hangs out with when nobody else has wants to hang out with him. When we go out, we laugh at everything, do crazy shit and so on..but as i said i dont feel like he takes me as a good friend because he doesnt invite me anywhere or anything. The second guy is basically the same, we have the same mindset but whenever i call him to go out he has better stuff to do. I had a third friend that i knew for 9 years and he recently started acting like an asshole to me for no reason. So I, naturally, cut him off. Needless to say i have no female friends. The lack of friends is because i spent a few yoears addicted to minecraft. Also, i know a lot of people that are out of my age or social group (meaning older or the kind of people i met on a school trip and that was it) So what i need advice on is:

1. Am i just overthinking it and my 2 friends arent as ""fake"" as i think they are?
2. How do i make more friends? Im not the kind of guy who would just come up to random people (in a bar, outside in my village, etc. Also, i do not do any group sports because its just not for me.
3. Should i try and call the people i know but am not ""friends"" with out sometimes? I always think its not worth because they dont even know me that well and have their own lives.

Also need to say that im not in any way weird or awkward or offensive or anything. So there is no reason to hate/dislike me. I have two more friends and my brother which i hang out with a lot and they are cool dudes but they are 4 years older so we cant really talk. Pls help

538,"I'm afraid I may have an addiction problem, but have been denying it because I do not want to give up everything forever. 

Generally, I don't fit the characteristics of an addict. I'm not even really sure I am one. I don't drink daily and I don't use drugs daily, or even weekly. The problem comes from what happens when I do use drugs/alcohol. When I do drink, I binge drink. When I use most drugs, I binge use them too. If I get to a point where I am tipsy, I will not stop. To be honest, I'm not sure there is a single night in which I drank to the point of being tipsy and remember the whole night. Drinking is often times accompanied with stimulants. Even though I wake up regretting it, I have denied any problem because so many of my friends do it and never seem to think anything of it. 

Recently, one of my friends who just got clean, told me I need to get treatment, go to NA meetings, and stay clean. I went to one meeting, but didn't really feel like I was supposed to be there. I stopped going out, which allowed me to stay away from drugs, but I never committed to giving up alcohol. Over the weekend, I went out with my friends for a concert. I told myself ahead of time that I wasn't going to do what I normally do. Next thing I know, its 5am and I'm at an after party doing everything I told myself I wouldn't. I just don't understand why I keep doing this to myself, when I know it isn't helping. I feel trapped in my own head, but I am unwilling to give up these things altogether, because some of my happiest moments happened while on some sort of substance, and the thought of never being able to have the kind of fun again, makes me cringe. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just need some advice on what to do about these thoughts. Are they logical thoughts? How can I stop reliving the same thing over and over again without giving up 100%?

539,"My partner proposed last year.   To date there has been no plans made for a wedding.   I'm cool with this.  I would prefer somewhat of a long engagement.  It's just there's so much other stuff going on right now.   For example: 
My parents divorce and a big mess with my father in debt and a housing matter with the family home.  
My job is not great and I would like to make a change and seek something else. 
A sister with mental health problems and creating pure havoc and drama in the family.  

My partner is talking now about getting a move on with wedding planning.  He's interested in the year 2020 for a wedding.  Me, not so much.  I would prefer 2021.  I think the extra year would be more beneficial.  I'm not on a great income and I worry about money and saving.   His wage is probably similar to mine.  

We attended a wedding fair and I was impressed I must admit.    However the thought of a big wedding day fills me with dread.   I get butterflies and sickness to the pits of my stomach.  We did a rough calculation of numbers and we are probably looking at a guest list of in and around 120 people.   

Everything about a big day fills me with dread.  Like church, sit down meal, music and dant, decorations, photographer, flowers, dress.   Absolutely everything.   We got a rough estimate for a sit down meal in a hotel for 10,000 euro.   That doesn't include - music, decorations, photographer.   

I hate the very idea of a big wedding day.   I cracked up jokes about going abroad on a holiday and getting married on holiday, just the two of us, to gauge his reaction and he's not keen on the eloping.  I really, really want to elope.

540,"So I (m15) started messaging this girl i‚Äôm into (15) making it clear from the start that i‚Äôm into her. About two weeks in she sends me a message saying she‚Äôs not into me and feels bad for leading me on, but wants to stay friends. I was kinda hurt because we got on pretty well but I agree to stay friends.

We carry on messaging each other and if anything we get on even BETTER because there‚Äôs no added pressure of flirting and we‚Äôre each others number 1 best friend on snapchat (we go to different schools so we don‚Äôt get to see each other that often).

ANYWAYS so Valentine‚Äôs Day rolls around and I‚Äôm feeling extra lonely so I message a couple girls that added me after one of my friends shouted me out in an attempt to distract myself from my crush. All it is is some lighthearted flirting so I don‚Äôt think much of it. Plus my crush keeps talking about this crush that she has which lowkey hurts but I wanted to be a good friend so I just gave her some advice and continue messaging these girls. 

Turns out my crush was actually having second thoughts and was starting to be kinda into me which I was totally oblivious to, but as soon as she finds out I‚Äôm messaging other girls she confronts me and says how hurt she is. I immediately start apologising because I had no idea and the last thing I wanted to do was hurt her. I was acting like a fuckboy, honestly, and I can‚Äôt imagine how hurt she must feel.

I want to give her space but at the same time I want to message her saying how she‚Äôs just always on my mind and i‚Äôm so sorry about hurting her. 

I‚Äôve messaged all the other girls saying I‚Äôm sorry but I‚Äôm into someone else and they were very kind and understanding about it. Not to mention that I don‚Äôt get a lot of girls, per se, so this was a complete switch of character for me to do this in the first place.

It‚Äôs like meeting new people socially is completely out of my comfort zone. I will usually avoid things like this and not meet anyone new. Funnily enough going to interviews or appointments I feel completely comfortable with. I guess I worry about their perception of me. What if I became really quiet? I also have a weird twitch that happens once in a blue moon which i don‚Äôt know if it is anxiety related but if it happened I would be so embarrassed. I‚Äôm not sure how to feel.

542,"Backstory: last week I was in a 3 car accident in which the last car rear ended the middle car which then rear ended me and the force caused the driver to then side swipe my drivers side from back to bumper. The middle car driver requested ambulance for hip and back pain. The original driver got a citation for reckless driving and not wearing a seat belt. He was going to the vet for his sick dog, who was in the back of his car. He left the dog in the car in the sun (we live in the US in a place with a moderately warm winter) for the hour and a half it took to process the accident. I walked away with neck pain and a wicked 3 day headache. 

MORE backstory: I totaled my car in an accident that was my fault last year and broke a vertabrae in my back in the process. That messed me up mentally and emotionally for months. 

CURRENTLY I am waiting for the man who caused the accident to make his statement to insurance so they‚Äôll take the blame and I can have them pay for repairs. As it has been a week and the man who caused it won‚Äôt talk to insurance, I‚Äôm waiting on the police report to be filed so I can send it to the insurance. 

I have felt sick to my stomach for almost a week, anxious and sad to the point where it makes me feel like I‚Äôm coming down with the flu. Every ache in my back and neck makes me panic that I messed something up. As I am driving my car without a bumper, every time someone comes near me driving it makes me panic to the point of hyperventilation. I can‚Äôt relax and shake all the time. I‚Äôm losing sleep and having nightmares about it. I feel this overwhelming sense of guilt about it all even after repeatedly being told it wasn‚Äôt my fault. I‚Äôm terrified the man who caused the accident will come after me, as he has my address on the insurance exchange form. I haven‚Äôt told anyone how much I‚Äôm suffering because they all had to deal with my anxiety in the original car accident where I totaled my car. I feel much more anxious this time around and I don‚Äôt know why. I‚Äôm too afraid to bug anyone by telling them how I feel. How do I help myself relax and realize it will be okay?",18Feb2019,1

I have to ask him to call every time the kids miss him. I have tried asking him to call on a schedule (he made the schedule, only two times a week to call, and he didn't call when he said he would). He is very manipulative and I know this is just another way he jerks me around and I would love to never contact him and let him call on his own, but then the kids miss him and ask me to call him and I feel like I am always in this position of begging him to talk to his kids.

545,"Hi! I'm writing this, because i feel like something is not okay and i'm scared i might do something i don't want to. 

My problem is, that i have problems with controlling my emotions. One minute i'm happy and can forgive even Hitler for his wrong doings, but in the next second, just like if someone presses a button, i become the saddest man on earth and wanna kill myself. This happens in just 1 second without anything actually having an effect on me. This is bad, because in the last 2 months i started having problems with my parents and they clearly don't care about this. I tried telling them about my problems and asked them for advice, but they don't give a crap about this. My parents also ignore this and make as much fun of me, as possible, which also destroys all my peace and happiness i have home.

Now, i'm a kinda introvert guy or whatever they call it. I like spending my time alone, doing stuff i like. One of my favourite things is lying in my bed and just listening to music. I can do this for basically forever. When i'm in school, i sometimes get nervous for no reason and start to have anxiety (if this is the good word for that). My chest starts to feel weird and it can even get to the point, where it's painful and i start having problems with breathing. Thankfully, the last one only happened 3-4 weeks ago. The guys at my school are nice to me and i even have a friend here, but it just comes from nowhere and i don't know what to do about it....

Oh, btw, my hand is shaking 24/7. Not much, but just enough, that i need to concentrate really hard to draw a straight line. I take magnesium to that every morning and it really did help when i first started it! :D
Though, i can't tell if it does anything now. It maybe calms me a bit down.

So yeah, i wanted to visit the school psychologist, but she wasn't in the school when i checked and i don't know if i should go there with just these problems. I wanna ask what anyone thinks and if somebody had/has these problems too and really, just what should i do?

548,"Hi Reddit, so I‚Äôm a 17F and I‚Äôve been trying to find my true identity these past few years. As of right now, I believe I‚Äôm bisexual but I don‚Äôt want to decide right away since I‚Äôm still young. Anyways, this is a lot ass story so strap yourself in and grab a snack.

I recently just moved to a new town to live my with grandparents, my grandfather is a teacher as a small, private secondary school (it‚Äôs still ghetto for a private school though). When I say this school is small, it‚Äôs VERY small. There are 4 freshman, 8 sophomores, 5 juniors (me included), and no seniors. Everyone in this school is pretty cool with each other, some people may bicker and argue but overall we‚Äôre a close family. 

This girl I like (we‚Äôll call her üçí) is absolutely gorgeous, like the girl of my dreams gorgeous, but she was waaaaay out of my league. She was one of those skater, hippie chicks that smokes weed and likes Sublime. On my first day of school here, she and this other girl I befriended before her (we‚Äôll call her üóø), we all walked together during our break around the school and üóø made an effort to try and get to know me and get me out of my shell, üçí was just being awkward but still talked. At first, I didn‚Äôt know üçí was a lesbian so I just assumed she was straight, so of course when üóø talked about boys, I started mentioning my exes and what not. Turns out, that was a bad move on my part. 
 
Fast forward about 2-3ish weeks, I started to fall for üçí and it was obvious. I was doing one of those normie-ass question story things on Instagram where you sent in a number and I had to respond to a question correlating to that number. Someone sent me a number with the question ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs your crush?‚Äù And ofc I wasn‚Äôt about to give that away since üçí followed me and she probs didn‚Äôt like me back. I just said ‚ÄúI have one, but I‚Äôm not revealing it.‚Äù Like the pussy I am. A few minutes later I get a message from üçí, begging me to reveal my crush to her. There was no way in hell I was going to, so ofc I told her no and she kept begging and begging. This went on for about a day and eventually I told her I liked her, but my crushes are very quick and I get over them easily (ofc I lied about this). Turns out, she had a crush on me whenever I first moved here and my granddad showed their class my pictures!! I was shocked as hell, so ofc I got to talking. Within that night, she asked me to be FWB. 

Unfortunately, within 2 days of being ‚ÄòFWB‚Äô (or whatever the hell it was), we broke it off. Nothing happened, just a few awkward glances to each other whenever we‚Äôd be alone and an awkward attempt at a sext conversation. She broke it off saying that she missed her ex and she was trying to stay loyal to them (apparently they‚Äôre going to try and get married in 4 years?? idk). Ofc I was upset (I may or may not have cried bc my ass is sensitive). 

Fast forward a week, I cannot get this girl off my mind. All I‚Äôve been thinking about is cuddling her, having sex, hell, even just having imaginary conversations in my head with her about dumb shit! Nobody knew about our little thing except üóø and üêº (a very sweet girl who helped me through my sad times). I would still hang around üóø, üçí, üêº and a couple other friends as normal and we went on as if nothing happened, but my mind would still race. After what happened, we got closer as friends and never discussed it verbally (EVER). Her friends would joke about üçí and her ex all the time and how they‚Äôre perfect and I was just getting jealous, it got so bad to the point I had to put on my earbuds whenever we all hung out because I didn‚Äôt even want to think about üçí and her ex. This crush thing started to evolve into something and as much as I like her, it‚Äôs starting to suck balls and slowly it‚Äôs taking over my life. 

Anyways, a week later, I feel so guilty about my list and crush for her, I come clean to üçí and I just openly tell her everything and asked if she wanted to try and be FWB again since we were closer. She politely declined and said she misses her ex too much and that she could never mess with anyone like me (since I was the teachers granddaughter), but appreciated me being honest. After that, I felt better about my situation since it was off my chest. 

Fast forward about 1-2 weeks, she starts posting.. ‚Äòcontent‚Äô on her snap (such as booty short pics, pictures of her wearing a shirt without a bra, etc.) with captions like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm loyal asf, if you‚Äôre going to screw me over, fuck you. you‚Äôre missing out on a good person.‚Äù etcetc. I‚Äôm not sure if she was mentioning her ex in any of these, but I‚Äôm p sure she was lowkey @ing them because who else would she be talking about? She knows about my little crush on her and added me to her private story to see all the photos and messages, but I just don‚Äôt know. She‚Äôll flirt with me here and there, she‚Äôll touch me and call me out on something and say ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù, but I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs just friendly stuff since she does it with üóø and üêº. 

I just don‚Äôt know anymore y‚Äôall, please help me out. Should I take this as her trying to hint at me or should I just forget about this crush thing entirely? Even just advice on what the hell this girl is trying to convey. Any comment will do.. girls are confusing. ",18Feb2019,2

559,"So, hence the title, I think my brother might have Asperger‚Äôs syndrome or some other mental delay. 

We are 9 years apart so while we haven‚Äôt always gotten along (mostly when we were younger) I love him regardless and a diagnosis wouldn‚Äôt change anything as he is my baby brother. He is turning 15 in a couple of days and he is mostly functional. He can take care of himself (although it‚Äôs always a battle to get him to shower and take care of his hygiene) he can have a conversation just fine with family, and he has no physical delays or disabilities of any kind. In fact he used to play hockey and was really good at it! 

But he has several things that are off about him, he can‚Äôt hold a conversation with strangers, he doesn‚Äôt like to look people in the eye, he‚Äôs extremely awkward and he has no friends and never has. My mom has even tried to set up play dates for him before but they never stick because he just can‚Äôt form relationships for some reason. And he has this tick, any time someone is talking to him about every 4 seconds both eyes will look off to the right, all the time for as long as I can remember. He blinks excessively as well. Those are probably the biggest signs to me but there are many other things just not right. He prefers to be alone all the time and has extreme undiagnosed anxiety. He has been diagnosed with ADHD as a young child but he isn‚Äôt hyper at all, he just isn‚Äôt interested in school so I think this is a misdiagnosis. I worry about him a lot because I don‚Äôt know how he is going to do in the real world once he graduates high school and even later on in life when my mom isn‚Äôt around to take care of him. He isn‚Äôt great at school either but he also doesn‚Äôt have any interest so it could just be lack of effort. When we were kids he would get extremely angry at my sister and threaten to kill us and even chased us around the house with a knife once (this was when he was like 5). He has since curbed his anger a lot and mostly keeps everything bottled up inside which is almost worse because it worries me that he could explode on someone one day. 

I have tip toed around this with my mom a few times before but she is completely in denial and won‚Äôt even talk about it with me. He really needs counseling because as much as it pains me to say he just isn‚Äôt normal, I‚Äôm not sure exactly what it is but he doesn‚Äôt fit in and isn‚Äôt the same mentally.

My friend, let's call her Susan, has suffered with mental health for as long as I've known her.

Last year her best friend in another country took his own life and she has been on a downwards spiral ever since. She is such a bright, caring individual but when her depression gets the better of her, she is so mean, distant and just wants to repel people as far away from her as possible.

I don't suffer with mental health issues (everyday recently I've become increasingly grateful for that) so part of me feels like a terrible person to talk to. I've never tried to tell her that I could help with suicidal tendencies but that she is to call me, wake me, find me in the event that she needs to. 

She came home after therapy last night in a total mess and told me that she almost went through with taking her life this past Friday while all of her friends were at a gig together.

I'm so scared. She's going to a psychiatrist but says that she's experiencing hallucinations and all kinds of horrible things.

563,"My emotions are far too strong. It's so easy for me to tear up watching something sad. I feel too much sympathy even for people who don't deserve it. My strong emotions have made it easy to manipulate me using guilt. I tend to naively forgive anyone who apologizes even if I know they're just going to do it again. If I try to complain about something and get negative feedback about how bad of a person I am, I immediately retract it and just carry on in suffering.

My mom died of cancer, but when she was alive, she was always telling me how I was so spoiled and did everything wrong. I would do anything for her to love me and get brushed off. My dad made it obvious he wanted nothing to do with me after she died.

I lived with my grandmother who hated me. I lived with my sister who was a drug abuser and died driving under the influence.

569,"To keep my identity a secret, I'm gonna blur out some details and you're free to DM me if you really wanna help.

To start things off, I'm a university student in a mildly confined country, I have siblings but currently I live alone with my parents, they're both old (dad is 65 mom is 57), and we're from the middle class.

It started off when I was a kid, I wasn't allowed to do anything, and I mean absolutely anything, computer? No, soccer practice? No, staying over at a friend's house? No, I used to think I'm like any other kid, as I was growing older I started to realize how awful my living situation is, my dad was mentally abusive, and an occasional physical abuser as well, my mom was an awful bitch, always trying to be in full control of my life, where my future was headed, what people I go out with (that's assuming I'm ever allowed to go out), and what choices do I make.

One story that really stands out is when I wanted to experience with extracurricular activities, when I was 15, I was heavily intrigued by intercultural studies, and wanted to take a course in a foreign language, my dad beat the living shit out of me when I mustered the guts to confront him about it. I've always lived in fear, they pay for my education and food, and that makes them think that they have all the right to do all of that.

I don't know what to do, it's getting really suffocating, I'm 20, I have no experience in anything, I have no hobbies and no extracurricular activities, studying a major I don't like and didn't choose, living in a country I despise, with abusive parents and an awful living situation. 

I want to change this, but I have no idea where to start, wanted to study abroad for a year as a change, couldn't get any cash aid from my father, and no consent either, let alone that he beat me when I objected, I have approximately 2000$ in the bank right now, my parents don't know about this money and where I got it from, I need a new life but I have no idea where to start, and wether I should stay to finish up my degree or just leave halfway through. 

Recently I've been diagnosed with ASPD (I went to a psychiatrist without my parents knowing), and my mental health is deteriorating, I really need a breather.

About three years ago I came to college (I'm beginning my fourth year now). Before coming here I lived with my grandparents, I was happy. Ever since I started college I just can't seem to be as happy as I was before.   


I've been through some major changes in my life: moving, being away from my family, different schedule (college classes don't always happen at a fixed time of the day, meaning that some days I have classes at night, and others I do at morning, etc.) so it's hard to keep a well-regulated routine, had some shitty relationships (one of which lasted for about 2 years).  


Bottom line, I went from a great student in school to a really crappy one in college. I don't think that the area I chose (computer science) is the problem, although it might as well be. I miss more than anything that feeling of doing a good job and enjoying it. I want my life back, I liked the life I had so much, and for the past three years I've just been lost.

**1 -** How to find out (or at least have some hints about) what I really like to work with/do  
**2 -** How to realize if I'm in a bad psychological situation (if I'm tricking myself into thinking I'm fine)

I'm reaching out cause I am at a point where I am feeling paralyzed by what decisions to make when it comes to a career.

I'm not looking for pity, and I know I screwed up, just looking for any advice would be great.

I just turned 30, went to college out of high school, couldn't finish for mostly mental health reasons, later got my associates.

Right as that ended I had a kid, then moved and got married.

I've been going from job to job the past few years trying to find the right industry/fit/income to support us. 

My wife and I are both working to pay bills (especially student loans), struggling to stay afloat. 

Every job I've had seems to be some combination of not a long term fit, was misled about opportunities, unrealistic or soul crushing.

I'm passionate about music and sound production, but can't get anyones attention in that field. I want to do that, but I'd take any line of work that was meaningful, stable and provides enough at this point.

I know I'm not stupid or lazy, yet I can't seem to get out of my own way and figure this out.

584,"I‚Äôm a sophomore in college and I‚Äôve never had a meaningful relationship with the people I have sex with. Every time I‚Äôve had sex it‚Äôs always been a fwb or one night stand type thing and  I realized how trashy and pointless it was (i‚Äôd get attached to them and they would ghost me) to do that so I stopped. 

Then about 3 months ago when the new semester started I met this girl in one of my classes. I really liked her and I decided that I would try and take things a lot slower than I did in the past like a real relationship does.

Eventually, she became my girlfriend and we started holding hands and making out with each other but I would never let it escalate to more and I told her I wanted to wait until I got to know her better which she agreed without any objection. About a month goes by and she tried to have sex with me again and I rejected which she got really upset about. She asked if I was cheating on her and when I said no she started arguing with me about why I didn‚Äôt want to have sex with her.

I told her that I wanted to wait and she stared crying because to her it seems like I don‚Äôt find her attractive. Apparently she feels this way because one of her friends is someone who I‚Äôve slept with before and she told my girlfriend recently that I was easy to have sex with and we did it the first day we met (so it seems like I‚Äôm putting out for random girls and not her).

589,"TL;DR: Fortnite-addicted discord friend has become annoying in recent months and easily discards her other close friends. The catch is that she is depressed and I'm her only close friend so I fear what will happen to her if I leave her.

&amp;#x200B;

Using a throwaway because the person in question isn't supposed to see this.

&amp;#x200B;

So from the TL;DR I will give context on the 4 main people of this story and how we became friends. The person this is about I will nickname as ""N"" \[F14\]. N originally met one of my other close friends, S \[M17\], back in August 2017 on discord. For months, they were close friends and they could relate to their anxiety issues. S told me that their relationship back then was ""brotherly"", and he told me that N saw him as ""her from the future.""

&amp;#x200B;

Now S is still relevant, but I'll talk about me and another friend, C \[M17\]. She met me and C back around January 2017 and we initially disliked each other but we later made up. Throughout 2017 and early 2018, we had a discord server, ""The Coast"" where we became closer. For months she told us how she looked up to us, but later we found out that she never looked up to S.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, during April of 2018, she asked us to ban her from the coast. This wasn't anything new since she's left during panic attacks before but weeks and months passed and she refused to rejoin. She blamed C for causing some of her personal issues and said that she would see if things improved.

&amp;#x200B;

Later, we still connected through group direct messages and one day she said S was annoying and blocked him. S was devastated by this and clinged on to me for awhile. The final thing N ever said to her, was a month later where she called him a racial slur.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, S dmed her a message explaining that she was emotionally abusing him and that was it for awhile. N just responded with ""k"". Other important things to note was that N's dialogue became more terse and memelike. She used to go in depth and have deep conversations but she started just whining and talking about the newest fortnite post or meme.

&amp;#x200B;

For months I've tried to explain to her what she was doing but she dodged the questions and never gave an exact answer to why she blocked S. This was it for awhile, and S even started feeling bad for her after awhile but the way she talked continued to deteriorate for months.

&amp;#x200B;

Last month, January 2019 she asked C how to show her how to do an image thing on discord and he didn't tell her. So when she figured out how to do it herself she suddenly decided that she hated him and blocked him. And that's where we are today. I am afraid that one day I will anger her and she will block me, so I feel like the friendship isn't worth it. But she also clearly suffers from depression and suicidal thoughts so blocking her randomly would be cruel.

&amp;#x200B;

I was thinking of leaving her with a goodbye letter but I'm not sure, so that's why today I am asking you guys. Thanks for the help.

As our kids are now 6 and 8 years old, we  enjoy the new found quality of life and can make some progress in our career. The first few years after birth have been hell for us. Our financial situation is also constant reason for arguments. We have done some counselling and we will continue to do so. But the success of that was rather limited so far. It is not unlikely that we will break up within the next months or years to come.

Anyhow, occasionally we still share a few good moments and in the most recent one, our condom failed on us. Long story short, she is pregnant and we are completely lost and looking for advice on what to do. We are considering an abortion and time is of the essence.

We both feel like we are in a different phase of our lives now and that we are too old to go through all the craziness of having a baby in the family again. We usually manage to give our two kids the love and attention they need, but I am not sure if we have enough capacity to keep this up with three kids in the house. As a breakup may be on the horizon, we are scared to have another kid. 

Any advice on how to approach our situation...? Please no fundamental discussion on abortion!

601,"We broke up about three weeks ago. I dumped her because the relationship was very one sided and I felt like she wasn't putting in as much effort into it as I was. I felt like I was neglected in the relationship. I also caught her on Tinder, but she said she was using it to talk to people which I believe. I know she didn't cheat on me, or she was at least on her way to. She said she wanted to be single for a while and work on herself and focus on school and her grades and get life back on track and that she didn't want to date anybody for a while. I am 22 and she is 20. 

I got on Tinder and began talking to other women and I even heard from my other ex from a few years ago and we got coffee and caught up. It's funny cause I actually matched with this girl that I just broke up with and we flirted a little bit on Tinder, but she told me she deleted it because she was tired of tinder. Whenever I would hang out with another woman she would somehow figure it out and would call me and say she wanted to talk. We would meet up and she was an emotional wreck and crying, but we were all over each other and kissing each other. Once a week since we broke up she would come over to my place and we would have amazing sex. It was like nothing had changed at all in our relationship and she was being herself. She confided in me that she was having a rough week and having trouble making friends at school and she was having suicidal thoughts again. I comforted her and it felt like everything was normal, like we were dating again minus the label.

I am very confused about this whole situation and I want her back. We called each other our pet names and cuddled after sex and I dropped her off and she told me to text her when I got home (something that we've always done). One thing she asked before I dropped her off was: ""Would your sister hate me if we got back together?"" My sister got really upset with her when I told her that I found her on Tinder and my sister isn't the biggest fan of her right now, but I reassured her that my family will love her no matter what happens. 

For valentine's day, we hung out with my coworker and her boyfriend and my ex had way too much to drink and I ended up taking care of her for the night and we went back to my house. We had sex  and in the morning she told me loves me and she doesn't know why she never told me that while we were dating. I told her that I love her too (we dated for 8 months I think we were both waiting for the other person to say it first). We then had round two after that. I asked her if we would get back together in the future and she said ""maybe, yeah"" I asked about taking it slow and she said no to that. She texts me super late at night when she's feeling lonely or tells me about her problems but I don't want to give her any boyfriend benefits if we aren't being exclusive to each other. How can I get her back? It seems like the breakup has had a net positive effect on her attraction towards me.  

TL;DR - Ex is coming over once a week and we have amazing sex. It feels like we are dating again minus the label. I want her back but I don't want to smother her or force anything.",18Feb2019,2

615,"I am a 15 year old living boy with my mother and stepfather. I will refer to my stepfather as my dad/father as he has taken that role in my life. This is one of those things I believe, as a child, that I need help from an adult. Unfortunately I can‚Äôt talk to my parents about this because it involves them.

It started a few months ago when I saw a text on my mothers phone from someone who we will call ‚ÄúJ.‚Äù J messaged my mom something along the lines of: ‚ÄúI saw your Facebook post, I cannot wait to get some of that next time I see u‚Äù my head immediately went to the worst but then I decided to think it through and forget about it. It could‚Äôve been someone playing a joke or just some creep or something stupid.

A few weeks later I saw another text from J and I forget what it said but something made me suspicious again. A few nights later, being the dumb teenager I am, snuck onto my moms phone and read the texts from J. At that point I was almost sure about what was happening but I didn‚Äôt want to believe it, I kept trying to find some logical explanation but I couldn‚Äôt. 

A few weeks after, my older sister came into town and while on the phone with our aunt on my bio dads side (who is basically our second mother) started talking about J. This was after my sister and mother had gotten into an argument. After they had got off the phone, I asked my sister and she confirmed everything for me. My mother was with someone else. My sister told me that our mother did know that she knew.

Although I have known for a few months, the past week have been very rough on me. I just got into my first relationship and am worried that I will do something bad like my own mother has done. I‚Äôve always had a bad relationship with my mom, one of the reasons being because she never gave any respect. Lately I have lost all respect for her and will only talk to her if necessary. I wish to tell my father but that means betraying by own mother and losing any chance I have of having a relationship with her as well as possibly losing my father.

I‚Äôm not entirely sure what kind of advice I want, I just need to hear others peoples thoughts on this. Occasionally I‚Äôll see my mom texting J and instead of rage or sadness, I feel scared. My mom made me a liar to my own father whom I love dearly. I have only told two people besides my sister, although they have tried their best to help, I think I need someone wiser than someone of my age. Thank you.",18Feb2019,3

628,"I live with my female best friend and a guy friend in a town home. Her and I have the bottom floor and split $1800 a month (guy gets top floor and pays 1300). We were originally going to divide our share by room dimensions and would originally be $150 difference in monthly rent. She has the larger room of our two. It also has a ledge along on wall perimeter to put
Pots or items and I believe a slightly larger closet. 

I wanted the smaller room because I have college loans and pay all of my bills. But we decided to just make it $100 difference and I pay an extra $50 a month so it wasn‚Äôt so drastic (for 300 sf) 

Except we are renewing our lease there and I want to go back to the division per room sf solely because I have a crap ton of bills to pay and soon will need to replace my car that is coming to wits end. 

Her parents paid for college, her car, her insurance phone bills etc. she basically pays rent and utilities (as far as bills go). She‚Äôs not frugal with her money and spends it pretty rapidly while I save. 

Im just curious how I should go about this because I originally agreed to tighten the rent gap to only $100 but I could be saving that extra $50 and putting that towards my $60k loans and honestly for $100 more I‚Äôd rather have the bigger room because i had a 9x9 in college ... ",18Feb2019,0

631,"Hi everyone, this is my first time posting on reddit so here we go. A lot of you may disagree with my actions and such, but I ask for your honest opinions.

(May include some crude language and such)

So basically I‚Äôm [17M] an only child who has some issues. In my freshman year of high school, I suspect my girlfriend at the time cheated on me. Ever since then I haven‚Äôt had the highest regard for women I am interested in, even going as far as to cheating on my next girlfriend. 

I know what I did was wrong, but there‚Äôs nothing I can do to change it. There are many variables that contributed to my decision, as I do regret it, but it led to my longest relationship with a girl 1 year older than me.  

I should also mention I‚Äôm the captain of the football team, who is also very manipulative. This leads to toxic relationships as I am also a control freak. 

When my girlfriend at the time went to university, we grew apart due to the lack of time together. I don‚Äôt do well with lying (the irony), and upon learning my girlfriend lied to me about partying on a Wednesday instead of studying for her midterm the next day, I broke up with her.

Yes, I am aware I am not a great person. I also know that my actions would not be favourable in the eyes of anyone of reason. 

It is now 2019, and I am trying to change my ways and become a better person. Kind of.

In 2019, my friends and I have come to the conclusion that it should be Year of The Second Move, or YOTSM. 

To educate you, YOTSM is a movement for all males to make the second move when interacting with females. The chivalrous norm is for the male to make the first move, but we say no more. 2019 is the YOTSM, and we stand by it.

YOTSM includes many benefits such as the male not ever facing rejection, which can be embarrassing and confidence killing. When you make the Second Move, you stay secure and safe. (My friends and I plan on making a subreddit for YOTSM if you want to learn more or share your stories).

Anyways, I have started talking to an amazing girl. She is a very nice and genuine person and in my opinion, the cutest girl at my school. We are basically dating but without the title. Not many people know about us, except for our friends.

I want to go to Prom with this girl, but as it is YOTSM, I want to wait as long as possible.

I have also received news that another guy in my grade has a huge crush on her and plans to ask her to prom. 

I have despised this guy since my freshman year. He‚Äôs the type of guy who thinks he is better than everyone else, and has an enormous ego. Think Regina George from Mean Girls in the body of an older Greg Heffley if he worked out.

As it is YOTSM, I want to see how this whole thing will play out. I want to go to prom with this girl, and eventually start dating, but I would absolutely love to see this guy get rejected by her.

I know there is the possibility that she says yes to him, as she may be too nice of a person and would be unable to say no, but I am willing to take that chance. I do care about this girl, but if she cares about me, she will reject this Walmart version of Shawn Mendes. 

I know I sound like a complete control freak as it appears I am trying to play God in this situation, but I need advice on what I should do. Do I swallow my pride and ask her to prom ASAP? Or do I stick to YOTSM, and continue what I am doing? 

Any suggestions, comments, or questions are helpful. Criticism is welcome, constructive or not. I encourage you to speak your mind, as this will all help me. 

Thank you",18Feb2019,2

645,"It's about a month into this semester and my friend decided to take 19 credit hours. (4 classes plus 3 labs). We often do our hw at the same time in the same place so I'm pretty updated about how they're handling stuff academically. There were had three tests this week, all in pretty tough stem courses, a Math course I've taken, a Physics course, and a Chemistry, and got Fs on all of them. 

To my understanding they need a specifc GPA to maintain a scholarship they have, and they rely on this scholarship to stay in school. They don't want that to happen, but have expressed a huge lack of motivation to work hard in the courses. 

What I can do as a friend to maybe push this person in the right place? Academically, I can probably insist they go to tutoring and help them fit it into their schedule, but I also want some way to comfort them since they aren't going through an easy time.

646,"My younger sister just turned 15 and she's in 9th grade. She's very outgoing, she's average in school, she's athletic and super popular in school. But she's become a problem child for my parents (divorced) and is completely enthralled drinking, smoking, sneaking out of the house and having sex with her secret boyfriend when nobody is home.  She's very moody, sassy, and can be really rude/mean when she gets in trouble or doesn't get what she wants. She got grounded a few months ago for sneaking out to a party, getting drunk/high, and got caught. She's been grounded ever since, but my parents have become more lenient with her. She's allowed to be home alone occasionally again and she has her phone back. 

Yesterday, I got into an argument with her over text (since I no longer live there) because my mother, my sister, my boyfriend, and I all had plans to have dinner together that night. Background: My mom is currently enrolled in school full time while also attempting to be a mother who tries not to leave my sister home alone often while also working full time. My mom originally wanted to meet up somewhere to eat, but later went back on it because she was so caught up with school work, so she wanted to just order food and have my boyfriend and I come over. But my sister wanted to go out to dinner, and argued/cried about it. So I told my sister she needed to stop being an entitled and selfish POS, and to think about why my mother needed to do that. She was very short with me saying things like ""Lol okay its not that deep. lmao yeah ok I get it sure. I'm just gonna starve then if we don't go out to eat"" and it made me upset because I was trying to express to her a different way to think about things yet she just brushed it off completely. We ended up cancelling dinner plans completely because she threw a fit and cried. 

I sent her multiple apology texts afterwards saying I was sorry for what I said and that I didn't mean to come off across as rude or mean but that I just didn't think she was understanding my issue I was bringing up but that I was upset by her. She ignored them all. 

Today, she posted pictures of her and her secret boyfriend around both of my parents' houses. In her bedroom and in the bathroom. Some photos clothed and some half naked. So I sent them to my parents, because she's not allowed to have people, let alone a boy, in the house, so she was sneaking him in. My mom spoke to her about it but my dad has been at work. My mom said she cried and threatened to kill herself. 

She's currently at my dad's house now with his girlfriend, and he's on his way home. She just sent a text to my mom saying ""tonight's the night"" with two emojis, one was a devil smiling, and the other a gun pointing at its head. 

I offered my dad that I could stay the night and keep an eye on her so she doesn't so anything, because I can easily stay up throughout the night since I have sleeping problems. I don't know what to do. I don't know if she's being serious or just threatening that in order to get her way and not get in as much trouble. She went to therapy when she was younger because she had threatened to kill herself when my parents first got divorced, but that was four years ago. she hasn't shown any signs of depression/anxiety/suicidal thoughts since and she's always been the extroverted, popular, pretty etc sister while I ended up being the one in the family with the hardcore mental health issues and introvertedness. 

As things continue to transpire I'll keep updating this post with more info but I just really don't know how to handle this situation and need advice.

TLDR: 15 year old sister is problem child (drinking, smoking, sex etc).

She got in trouble for posting pictures of her sneaking in her boyfriend to the house. Now threatening to kill herself. ",18Feb2019,1
648,"Unfortunately its true, I'm a modern day slave. I couldnt get through college even though I tried for years as I had to support myself and mother, who is pretty much insane. She stole all my money from me and harassed until I gave it to her. I developed my own psychological issues during this period. Eventually we lost our home and out of desperation, I began to drive for Uber.

&amp;#x200B;

Im now 25, no degree, 40k in debt due to the car mostly. Id like to go back to school, but the only way for me to accomplish this is to either take out gigantic loans to cover the car, housing, etc and graduate when I am 29 or sol with around 100k in debt. The other option is to drive for 16 hours every single day through the end of the year. If i am lucky, I may come out with 30k savings. Thats all depending on how busy Uber is and if I can actually sustain that much driving for that long a period. Now that Ive crunched the numbers including business expenses, the car debt and taxes, I see this is the only way.

653,"4 years ago I moved out of my parents house and into my first apartment with my best friend at the time. I had more money saved so I paid the deposit and first month‚Äôs rent ($825 total). Fast forward 9 months. My roommates partner essentially moved in, but did not contribute rent. The apartment was very small, way too small for a couple and a third wheel. I lived with my roommate at her partner for about 6 months before I decided to move back in with my parents. Like I said, my roommate was my best friend and I felt she had essentially ditched me for her partner. I was also dealing with the worst depression of my life and I knew things would be better if I removed myself from the situation. It wasn‚Äôt a big deal that I moved out because my roommate had recently got a job with the bmv and her financial situation had become much better than it was when we had initially moved in together. Plus we hadn‚Äôt renewed the lease and we were on a month-to-month sort in thing.

655,"Before I start, pardon me on my english.

A couple of years ago I have inherited about 150.000‚Ç¨ worth of money. I have always been afraid of what people think of me and I do not know what to do.
Let me explain.
Since my parents died they left me the money as stated above. I am quite impulsive as a person and do try to behave myself but I keep telling myself that I deserve to buy the things that I want to because I have been through so much.
I will not go in depth about the things that I‚Äôve been through but lets say that I have lost both my parents in a terrible way, with that I had to deal with a sister who had a bipolar (look it up) disorder which was very difficult to deal with, even until this day. I have got a grandmother (the mother of my mother) who is depressed and at the end of her life, I want to give her the best time that she has left for as much as ist worth...
The backstory aside
I do not know what to do with the money. I have want to buy certain things but I am too afraid to buy it because of the fact that I am afraid of what people think of me. I live in a small community and I have a girlfriend who has not known money and has not grown up in a wealthy family. My girlfriend does not approve but understands that its ‚Äúmy‚Äù money and I am to do with it as I please. I do gain enough from work but yet I‚Äôm afraid of what other people think of me.

Naturally, I don't need him to mow my lawn anymore, and let him know.  
     Months have passed, with no contact, and then he pops by to see if he can do anything for a quick buck.  My partner says ""Sure, you can rake up some leaves and pull the trash out of the bushes.""  Which the kid does, gets his 5 bucks and goes his merry way.

658,"Let me preface by saying that I am prepared for all of the ‚Äúyou need help‚Äù answers to my question. I‚Äôm here to get a wide range of advice from different people. I will be honest, so please take everything I say as the truth. I have nothing to lose, and everything to gain. Also, please refrain from being judgmental.

I legitimately suffer from mild depression and generalized anxiety disorder. I‚Äôve been this way since adolescence. Certain situations or rough spots in life exacerbate my existing depression and anxiety.

I am currently in one of those rough spots. There is not one facet of my life, save my romantic relationship, that is not a source of stress or is not in question at the moment.

I have found myself drinking too much for my own comfort. I am honest when I say that I do not get obliterated, shitfaced, black out drunk, whatever you want to call it. But I do drink on a daily basis, usually just enough to catch a buzz, help me relax, and ease my stress.

I also overuse anxiety medication and pain relievers to help tame my stress levels. Without these coping mechanisms, I‚Äôd be on the verge of a panic attack literally 24/7.  With them, I am not drastically impaired, I am not making poor decisions or slurring my words or behaving like a drunken idiot, they just help me maintain a normal level of function.

I do understand that using substances to maintain a normal level of function is, in and of itself, a problem. I want to not be this way anymore. Some of the situations that are causing the excess stress in my life will be resolving shortly, others will not.

I will be losing my health insurance once my divorce is final, and I am a full-time student working toward a successful career, who does not have any health insurance in the meantime. How do I go about finding the help I need? I‚Äôd like to avoid giving up alcohol totally, I have enjoyed using it recreationally and moderately in the past in social situations, and I‚Äôd like to rediscover a healthy relationship with it.

I have asked here because I expect a wide variety of opinions and some knowledgeable insight, please be gentle.

Sincerely, someone who needs help. ",18Feb2019,1
659,"A little background as to why I feel like this. 

My great grandmother passed away last April. It was sudden, but it was also.... not sudden. She had been sick for YEARS, and I just thought maybe she would just be sick until she passed away. I didn‚Äôt think the day would come, but you guessed it, it did. 

When she died I posted the obituary online to inform some family friends/distant relatives of what had happened. 

The first comment was from a girl, who I don‚Äôt actually have on Facebook anymore because of a side issue (I could always tell anybody THAT story if you would like to know. It was a rollercoaster.) Her words? ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù Mind you, shes never met my great grandma in her life, so why she cared, I‚Äôm not sure. 

Now, I know some of you will say ‚Äúwell maybe they were just genuinely curious‚Äù. I get that, but privately messaging somebody or asking them in person might be better than just going ‚Äúwhat happened‚Äù on a post. It‚Äôs also scary when somebody‚Äôs child passes from suicide or an accident and people comment that, especially people that don‚Äôt know the person. ",18Feb2019,1
660,"I'm the leader of a sports club at my college and it's an open club for beginners and experts of the sport. Because we welcome beginners, we also have coaches to teach the sport. I am one of those coaches. This turns into us teaching our peers and helping them learn the sport.

This past week, one of my ""students"" were making super beginner mistakes, and they've been playing this sport for a year+. I was referring and trying to tell them what they were doing wrong, and it may have been a bit over board, but I never yelled. At the end of practice, I asked them if they understood why I called something a certain way and they said ""I honestly don't understand what any of the term mean."" and my brain short circuit. The person she was competing against who is also in club said ""there are only three terms you need to know"" and then she was just like yeah whatever.

So afterwords I noticed they kind of disappeared so I went to the bathroom and heard them sniffling and taking off their gear, and I was like okay I can't handle this right now (they didn't see/hear me) so I left. I went back to where we practiced, and their partner, who is also in the club, was fuming. They told me I was ruining my relationship with the other person because I was so harsh on them in club (and I can recall bringing up some things they were doing wrong but no more than any other members). They started cursing at me and left before I could defend myself.

I apologized to the person I upset and their response was ""I just do this for fun"". While I understand that, and I'm also there for fun, I would like everyone to understand the rules. They appreciated but didn't accept my apology. So that's where I'm at, and I don't know how to move forward. I'm still upset with their partner for being so inflammatory and cursing at me when I feel like I didn't deserve it especially when I never dealt anything like that out.

671,"I haven‚Äôt left my house in a month. My friends try their best to include me in their social plans and my family members constantly invite me to lunch, dinner and shopping just to get me to leave the house. However, I just can‚Äôt bring myself to do it.

I have this debilitating fear the moment my foots steps out of the door. As narcissistic as it seems, I feel that the whole world suddenly has its eyes on me, scrutinising my every move, trying to find fault with me. I can‚Äôt remember ever feeling comfortable in a public setting alone. My eyes are always darting around and I over-complicate scenarios that involve accidental eye-contacts. The only time I feel comfortable in a social public setting is when I‚Äôm with someone I trust. To provide some context, the last time I left my house (which was a month ago), it was for an event that was of extreme importance and compulsory. It was an event that would decide the path of my future and I had to have numerous people convince me to leave the house and attend it. In the end, with much difficulty, I managed to attend the event, but not without a close friend with me and a shaking anxiety that just would not calm down until I reached home 3 hours later. (P/S Before attending this event, I didn‚Äôt leave the house for 2 months) And I‚Äôm beyond embarrassed about myself. I‚Äôm almost an adult and yet I can‚Äôt do normal things like buying food for myself (i.e talking directly to the food vendor), walking into a shop and buying something or simply talk to a stranger by my own accord. I‚Äôm worried about how I‚Äôll cope in the future with such a lack of social skills and interaction. 

In addition, I believe that leaving the house would disrupt my routine. I must sleep within a certain time frame. I must wake up within a certain time frame. I must eat within a certain time frame. Even I must eat a certain type of food. And going out will disrupt this routine I‚Äôve abided by. I won‚Äôt be waking up at my usual timing. I won‚Äôt be eating at the usual time. I won‚Äôt be eating my usual food. This affects me to a considerable degree. I keep overthinking and I feel that something bad will happen if I break out of that routine. I remember being unable to concentrate on a social activity because I wasn‚Äôt eating at the usual time I would usually eat. I feel a need to do it at that very moment.

Last but not least, I have a fear of the things that exist outside my home. You can say that I‚Äôve been watching too much television from being a homebody for so long but I just can‚Äôt shake off the thought of the millions of germs and bacteria squirming outside. I know that there are bacteria in my home but I feel so much safer in my home. I can‚Äôt catch an contagious disease in my own home, right? I‚Äôm scared of foods that are potential carriers of parasites and diseases. I‚Äôve limited myself a certain food group that I determine is safe and it sucks. I want to eat meat but I‚Äôm afraid it has parasites like tapeworm and I‚Äôm not confident that I won‚Äôt undercook it. 

When my family members ask me why I don‚Äôt leave the house, I always brush it off by saying ‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs nothing. I‚Äôm just lazy.‚Äù I‚Äôve never told them about how I feel because I think they‚Äôll just brush it off as something that‚Äôs in my head or that I‚Äôm overthinking. But I‚Äôm scared. So scared. About how my future will be so detrimentally affected because I can‚Äôt bring myself to leave my home like a normal person without fearing interactions. I want to stop thinking that people are constantly scrutinising me. I want to stop this narcissistic way of thinking. I want to not feel fear.

It will be held this Saturday. He is being cremated so I have printed some pictures from the hospital and I bought some decorations and a guest book for the ceremony. There is so much more I‚Äôve done, I‚Äôm just super overwhelmed. Last and only thing left for me to do is make the CD with music to play during the ceremony. 

My question to you all, is how can I be there for my sister even more? She is SUPER depressed and really down. Any time I talk about pretty much anything it begins and ends in tears. I feel terrible, but I need answers. I don‚Äôt want to do anything to rub her the wrong way, or upset her on the final day she will be saying goodbye to her son. I‚Äôve offered to talk whenever she needs, I‚Äôve offered to help her get with a therapist whenever she is ready, I have tried to make this as painless as possible for her, but I still feel like I am not doing enough. Even though I am so overwhelmed myself with everything, I could not imagine what she is feeling/going through inside. 

My family and I have never been through anything like this, so I also want to be there for my parents who are hurting too. Does anyone have any advice on what I can do to help her even more? ",18Feb2019,1

674,"So, Idk if this is the right subreddit to ask this but lets see, also I need to vent alittle.

I'm a gym rat and recently a personal trainer, I have been working out 3-5 day a week  since i was 16 (I'm 28 now) and doing everything from yoga to power lifting. 

Last week i woke up in the night with sharp pain my belly button that came and went through out the week. Saw  my MD this morning who told me I had a diastasis recti or an abdominal split, which is like pre-hernia injury where you abdominal muscles split. She told me to take it easy in the gym for few weeks, that this isn't necessarily an injury that goes away, and that I am probably going to have to stop doing exercises like squats and dead lifting. 

But Idk know if accept if that, I'm thinking about seeing a sports medicine doctor or something like that.

I've heard of people getting surgeries (which I'm more then willing to have done) and stuff for these kinda of things. I'm freaking out because i really Don't want to stop doing those exercises. I really feel like part of me has been ripped out and The idea of having such a minor feeling injury never going away and affecting my life is kinda of freaking me out.

677,"Hi! My question is pretty technical and I must admit that I have almost 0 idea of what I am doing. Talk about feeling EXTREMELY humbled with overwhelm! So, I figured I would come to my redditors for help!

I want to upload tutorial videos for an online course I am developing (about 25GB in total) and I want to use a video streaming platform that can provide the needed security on those videos so that people won't steal them (I hope that makes sense). I looked around with Vimeo but noticed they have quite a big price tag ($7-$50/month), which is a bit high for me. Plus, I wanted to see my other options. Youtube privacy isn't really that great and Wistia is even more expensive.

And, I then thought about using my hosting provider (Bluehost) and uploading my videos to FTP folder and then, linking to the video in that folder for my audience to view. 

I tested this by making a new FTP account and managed to point my teaching platform to the video in the FTP account. Is this a wise thing to do? Will this cause problems with viewing? I am also concerned that if more than 1 person wants to watch the video on the teaching platform, that there will be a significant lag. What obstacles should I be prepared to face if I decide to go through FTP?

I appreciate any help or guidance on this, and hope to gain some knowledge on this whole thing! Toodles!",18Feb2019,1

679,"Hello,

A bit of history, I was a very conservative child and grew up hating smoking and believing drugs were the devil.
In my teens I rebelled by drinking a lot and self harm. but the idea of drugs seemed dirty and wrong.

cut to my early 20s, I was in a relationship with a man for 5 years who smoked a lot of weed, therefore i smoked a lot of weed. I told myself i would never be so stupid to do anything thats not natural. so shrooms and weed were okay. had my first shroom experience with him was wonderful.

cut to 2018, i'm 23,never tried coke or anything man made. 
I get offered a line of cat when i go out with friends and think ""eh, why not"" ... 
that was horrible and would not want to do that again. 
BUT.  
I wanted to see the difference between cat and coke so i tried coke with a friend and it was awesome, we had a fun night and i was happy i had the experience. 
october 2018 - I broke off my 5 year relationships for reasons not beneficiary to describe.
I meet a nice guy a few weeks after the breakup who is also quite new to drugs and we get invited to a hike to smoke DMT, we thought hell yes, that sounds fun, and it was!!!!

but then I went out to a bar with my friends and I asked if anyone wants to do anything tonight. if they say yes then we would buy a bag of coke and have fun.

two weeks after the break up, I find out I am pregnant. 
7 weeks in, my ex was depressed about the breakup and still trying to win me back so I don't tell him and freak out on my own. 
However, the wonderful man I am with at the moment gives me two choices, either we keep the baby and raise it as ours or we terminate it before it gets too late.
I chose termination. I regret it.

After that I became quite depressed, partied a lot with coke and MdMa , never did anything stupid and it was always with my friends who i trust and my boyfriend who watches me carefully. 

new years comes, we decide to take E, coke and MDMD and go out to a club, this was one of the best nights of my life and I do not regret it! 
We were safe and we were happy.

cut to January 30. My ex hung himself. 
This is pretty much where I am now, his parents outwardly blame me and his friends hate me and refuse to talk to me. 
Doctors have prescribed me multiple medications to stop the panic attacks and insomnia. Including stilnox, a sleeping pill. and ativans and some other benzo. 

This is all normal for trauma like this since I was the one who found the body and had to read his letter as it was addressed to me. 

My heart is broken and i'm torn into pieces, luckily I have my guardian angel by my side, my current boyfriend who has been nothing but kind and understanding, he has been helping me remember all the good memories and telling me to write them down so i don't forget. He knows how much my ex meant to me and that we were trying to make things work as friends after the breakup.

So we go out last weekend and someone is buying cocaine, so we buy a bag with him. We didn't finish it so i left it in my wallet.

go to work on Monday and realize i still have the coke... I go to the bathroom and do a line.. I did this for 3 days till there was nothing left... I think this is the straw...

I have also been recreationally using these sleeping pills, I force myself to stay awake on them just to feel the high. 

I also took acid recently which was quite the experience when it comes to looking at your inner self and it made me question what i am doing, i dont want to give up recreational drugs, personally i see no problem with that, i am just concerned that i am starting to rely on them to enjoy myself. 

I am a perfectly functional part of society, I am a pre school teacher studying developmental psychology, i get compliments from the parents at the school all the time and i love my job. I haven't changed my mannerisms and if i cant afford something i wont bother getting it.

but I feel quite dead inside, since before the drug use.
Is it okay to cover that guilt i have for his suicide with drugs? even if they are prescription.

I dont want any  ""DRUGS ARE BAD"" people or any you need to see a doctor shit. I know. 
i just want people to tell me what the line is between recreational drug use and being dependent on them so i can make the decisions on my own.

Almost every time I take a shower, I smell like corn chips after, for a couple hours.  I have tried changing soaps, and tried not using soap/shampoo, the smell is there.  I put in a request to my apartment to fix the water heater, but they ""drained"" it the first time, then sent a guy who said he can't smell anything and there isn't much he can do the second time I complained.

682,"Hey everyone. I'm looking for advice on how to forgive, specifically forgive my family.

&amp;#x200B;

I have never had a relationship with my family. My parents were emotionally, verbally and physically abusive and it caused me great internal turmoil. My whole life, all I wanted was to get away from them and cut them off forever because they made me hate myself and everything, really. Life had always been a struggle for me and I knew getting away from them would be the best thing I could do for my safety and mental health. I thought that getting away from them would solve all of my problems but now I'm stuck unlearning the abuse and learning to be ""normal"". My hatred for everything has left me without friends because I (wrongly) assumed everyone felt about me the way my parents did.  I don't want to be like this. I'm 25 years old and I feel now is the time to figure things out.

Now that I have been moved out of my parent's home for a few years and working on improving myself, I have gotten to the point where I consider forgiving them. They provided for me and my sisters financially, we always had food on the table, and I feel grateful for that. But my upbringing makes me not want anything to do with them. I cant tell my mom how I feel because she breaks down any time I am honest with her. She can dish out the most cruel words but won't accept the slightest feedback and I don't want to hurt her. I can't tell my dad how I feel because he is the physically abusive one. When I first moved out, I would invite my parents over so they wouldn't feel I was cutting all ties with them, but they refuse. Four years of me being away and they have never step foot in my apartment, my Dad blocked my number, and my mom makes no attempt to see me. I'm getting married in August and I don't want to invite them, but feel I should, and I know they will just make an excuse to not show like they have for everything else.

My question is how can I move on from this? It's eating me alive. Some days I tell myself ""I forgive them, they did the best they could have done with what they had"" and other days I feel I could never excuse such awful behavior and parenting. Please, any advice would be taken and considered.",18Feb2019,5
683,"Tldr:
Parents won‚Äôt let me by my own pc despite good grades, time management and clearly displaying to them that I can manage myself independently.


Okay let‚Äôs start it off like this. My parents spend lots of money where we live in order for me and my brother to get a good education. My (younger) brother has always been the favorite up until about 6 months ago when he started being the biggest bitch ever. He often times gets more than me for Christmas, birthdays etc. he also goes on expensive trips such as skiing every weekend, and my parents pay for it. He is entitled, and buys things off the internet without permission (AirPods, speakers, etc.) He has an Xbox with significantly more games and gadgets and I have a ps4 with the bear minimum. I‚Äôll also just throw in there that he is verbally abusive to me and my dad and physically abusive to my mother. 

Our basement also flooded 4 years ago and our house was already extremely out of date, all the tile cracking, showers leaking, bathroom floors peeling up and our house is just overall ugly. They have been putting off the basement remodel for 4 years, despite every few months reassuring me that they will fix it. At this point it is just a concrete floor with external walls. 

I recently proposed to my parents that I would like a pc for my upcoming birthday. Now I knew that they would say no, so I also said I would pay for it and was just asking for permission. I bring up tons of extremely valid points to them, such as: 1. I have good grades 2. I am driven, and I get all my tasks done outside of school and in school 3. Even if I were to get a computer, I would prioritize everything before games or entertainment, which is what I have always done 4. It would provide me with my own private device to work with, so I don‚Äôt disrupt others and they don‚Äôt disrupt me (my brother is always extremely loud and also inconsiderate, never respects others). 5. It‚Äôs my money, I should be able to do what I want with it. I only have ever bought 1 thing expensive; my PlayStation. I am not eager to spend any money I get, like my brother. I am also starting a job soon, with fairly decent pay. I play 2 high school sports and have no problems managing my time 6. Lots of my friends or even peers have PCs, multiple consoles or entertainment devices, expensive tech, etc.

All they can ever say to me after these is that ‚Äúthey are the parent, not me‚Äù and it‚Äôs not my choice to make.

Is it too much for me to ask to get this pc? I know that it may seem ridiculous, but I am obviously at an age where I should be able to do independent things like manage my money and time. Please let me know if you think I should keep pushing to get the pc or just let my parents win again.",18Feb2019,1

685,"So to sum it all up, my General Manager (Tina) at my store is having an affair with a supervisor (Ray) at my store. 

I am currently an Assistant General Manager (my focus on training/hiring) and when I got hired on in October 2018, I thought that something was going on with them two because they were always flirting and joking around, calling each other ‚Äúcute names‚Äù, and they are literally acting like school children that have a crush. I kind of brushed off the idea, but around Christmas time, Ray left to go out of state to visit his family, and then when the New Year rolled around, he informed us that he would not be coming back to work and that he was staying in his home state. Tina was devastated, and physically upset about this news. 

Well, come to find out, he was somehow able to ‚Äúchange his mind and apologize‚Äù and come back to work a week and a half ago - even though he was gone for over a month and a half... 

Since he‚Äôs been back, Tina has been riding my ass about things I‚Äôm doing wrong, how she doesn‚Äôt feel that I have a strong enough leadership potential, that she‚Äôs unsure as to whether or not I can handle the position... but ONLY since Ray has been back. Before then, she didn‚Äôt have ANY issues with me whatsoever. She praised me about how great of a hire I was and that she‚Äôs so lucky to have someone like me as her #2.

Tina also makes the schedules, and she has to send them to her boss (Charlie) to get it approved. Once it‚Äôs approved, she IMMEDIATELY goes back and changes it so her and Ray‚Äôs schedule match up PERFECTLY (same time of day, same days off, etc.). 

So two days ago, Ray left his personal email up on the store computer, and so when I went to login to our store email, his was up and I saw some interesting things...so I kept scrolling...and come to find out, I found:

-Conversations between them about how he thought she was pretty
-Conversations about them meeting up and her picking him up
-Proof that she sent him money multiple times
-Proof she bought him a flight from his home state to back here during the time he ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt coming back to work‚Äù
-Proof that she bought them tickets to go see a comedy show together
-Proof that she bought them a hotel together when she flew him down in mid-January 

Tina is also trying to push Ray to become the inventory manager (which would be my next step for promotion), so he‚Äôs basically jumping right over me and becoming her #2 and I‚Äôd be bumped down to her #3 in the building (we don‚Äôt have an inventory manager right now).

I checked and my company doesn‚Äôt have an ‚Äúanonymous tip line‚Äù, so I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt want my name dragged through the mud if this comes to light, or even have my name slipped up somehow and her find out and make my life at work a living hell.

So the reason my mother uses the threat of sending me to a psyche ward as, well, a threat, is because in october, 2018, i was sent there for a week because i had had a bad morning and broke a railing off my bed (this was a mid-high spas out). Ever since the incident ive been very sensitive and have a sort of ptsd to it (i dont mean to make light of ptsd, its just the only word that matches how i feel)

I have a long standing friend who's had a really poor track record of judging bad relationships / situations in the past. In the last few months with her current boyfriend:

* She explained that her current boyfriend has tried to prevent her from talking to her other friends.
* She has mentioned he has difficulty controlling his anger.
* She says he will try to come into her house even after she has told him several times not to, and once inside, will not leave if she tells him to.
* She described being the victim of a textbook sexual assault but failed to see it as such.

After I convinced her to breakup with this guy, she got back with him recently and hasn't had a similar experience yet. Now her father (who she lives with) is moving away from the city she goes to high school in. She wants to move in to an apartment with this guy and his two friends to finish her senior year. I want her to move in with her family member who also goes to the same school.

I have tried to convince her that moving in with this guy is a terrible idea because I'm concerned about her safety and the possibility of her being abused again, but she thinks that I'm too concerned and she is perfectly safe. She says he feels terrible about assaulting her and that it wont happen again. She says he really cares about her and that's why he's offering to let her move in with him. She also says that she wouldn't allow herself to get into a situation that leads to abuse, and that his two friends will prevent him from trying something. She claims that her family member lives too far away (35 minutes) and is ""crazy"" (but wouldn't give further explanation).

Am I the asshole for over stepping my bounds by trying to control her life?

Please let me know if you have any questions about the situation that could provide clarification. I'll answer them as objectively as possible.",18Feb2019,1
699,"Let me preface by saying that I am prepared for all of the ‚Äúyou need help‚Äù answers to my question. I‚Äôm here to get a wide range of advice from different people. I will be honest, so please take everything I say as the truth. I have nothing to lose, and everything to gain. Also, please refrain from being judgmental.

I legitimately suffer from mild depression and generalized anxiety disorder. I‚Äôve been this way since adolescence. Certain situations or rough spots in life exacerbate my existing depression and anxiety.

I am currently in one of those rough spots. There is not one facet of my life, save my romantic relationship, that is not a source of stress or is not in question at the moment.

I have found myself drinking too much for my own comfort. I am honest when I say that I do not get obliterated, shitfaced, black out drunk, whatever you want to call it. But I do drink on a daily basis, usually just enough to catch a buzz, help me relax, and ease my stress.

I also overuse anxiety medication and pain relievers to help tame my stress levels. Without these coping mechanisms, I‚Äôd be on the verge of a panic attack literally 24/7.  With them, I am not drastically impaired, I am not making poor decisions or slurring my words or behaving like a drunken idiot, they just help me maintain a normal level of function.

I do understand that using substances to maintain a normal level of function is, in and of itself, a problem. I want to not be this way anymore. Some of the situations that are causing the excess stress in my life will be resolving shortly, others will not.

I will be losing my health insurance once my divorce is final, and I am a full-time student working toward a successful career, who does not have any health insurance in the meantime. How do I go about finding the help I need? I‚Äôd like to avoid giving up alcohol totally, I have enjoyed using it recreationally and moderately in the past in social situations, and I‚Äôd like to rediscover a healthy relationship with it.

I have asked here because I expect a wide variety of opinions and some knowledgeable insight, please be gentle.

Sincerely, someone who needs help. 

TL:DR 
I‚Äôm overusing alcohol and medication to help with my depression and anxiety, how do I help myself back onto a better path? ",18Feb2019,2
700," I seek to warn the House of Lords, Ladies, nobles and those of historic and religious understanding and faith, of continuing deception and cause for further concern in not only the peace of this land and it‚Äôs people and neighbours but furthermore problems inherent in the very rationale and procedures being adopted right now in order to combat the very problems that are now coming to the surface.

Despite many attempts to seek aid and draw light on the issues I am facing I can only beseech you to understand the depth of the problem we all face and our mutual enemy. This is no longer about myself and the violation of my own rights and freedoms or any conceived personal gain. My case should sound alarms to anyone who can hear.

I am a second generation British born 37 year old Bengali woman. I am affectively being tortured like many targeted individuals across the globe but I am hoping that my particular and peculiar case may have already been noted. Investigations in my case have been initiated but I fear that corruption will find a way to silence any progress. 

Like many targeted individuals my diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia affectively silences my complaints but the factual evidence I have bears witness to truth.

The company Apple can attest that my iPhone has been for some time been under a type of sophisticated surveillance and hacking that they have told me had not been seen before. Real time surveillance monitoring, that has now been under continuous investigation by Apple since I reported the problem in late November by their senior tech engineers. They also seek to resolve this problem and I can provide all case number details if necessary.

Foreign governments and corporate and private entities have been subjecting many people across the globe to military grade torture weapons and programs.

More concerning is the guise of technology and perceived mental health problems hiding a very real religious and spiritual war. And the systematic covering up of past and present abuses.

I would like to stand witness not against anyone in particular in a criminal or civil capacity but in order to fight against the erosion of the natural god given rights and freedoms we all have and speak up against growing tyranny and deception in whatever capacity I am able. 

The factors in my case are extensive, I will try to be as brief as possible. I can provide all documentations and reference numbers if necessary.

I am certain that throughout my life after being used in a data study named AESOP concerning atiomolgy and ethnicity study of first episode psychosis in the south east maudsley group and perhaps even earlier I was placed on some sort of research group as a data subject. I was not told of this neither do I remember giving any consent. I further believe other members of my family are also unwitting data subjects.  

The veterans association in Texas is currently processing my request for all my records who has told me as my request refers to claim file within their records management centre it is being handled according to the privacy act. 

I believe that I have been used in many covert longitudinal data harvesting research that has been physically, mentally and emotionally violating and worsening over the years. 

Another twist in my case is that I again unwittingly attracted the attention of other types of groups following my vocal protestations in 2014 on Facebook against Israel‚Äôs treatment of Palestinians. Facebook I believe and have some evidence for is an organisation that is a real concern regarding certain foreign espionage practices.

I and my family was subjected to an onslaught of what is a widely reported problem of direct energy weapons and subversive torture accumulating to my losing the care of my two children and home and relationship. Being forced into a mental health supported accommodation and further more entered in to more rigorous experimental covert practices which involved exposure to varying purities of crack cocaine sometimes mixed with dubious substances and economic testing and being approached by what was clearly undercover or blackmailed drug dealing gangs with a mind to promote prostitution. Two separate groups confided to me they had been approached by a Russian or Eastern European lady to give me certain drugs.

After trying to report some sort of embezzlement by entities within my local council of Redbridge and mental health and nhs foundation trust nelft in regards to receiving funds and grants for services that they did not provide and charging for duplicate services and council tax at mental health exempt accomadations, and links to research data harvesting groups in the US I was attacked severely with a direct energy weapon just before Christmas which as shown by X-ray has resulted in a sediment forming around the bones of my feet. 

There is evidence from my severely hacked laptop and phone that I have been subject to surveillance from other foreign entities including one with a Far Eastern script. All my communications have been hacked and I am being further isolated and silenced. Paperwork and documents stolen from my flat. My birth certificate has signs of being doctored. Many other worrying factors con

I believe much resources and time was also used to fashion me Manchurian candidate style into what I can only describe as some sort of seer used by various occult and spiritual groups. 

Only by the grace of god have I been able to discern the experiences in the light of my own belief and faith in God and have hallelujah alhamdullillah become quite a dissenting voice to some of the deceiving narratives that tries to distort these spiritual experiences. 

I have come to accept my position but refuse to support deception in any form for personal gain and the alluring promises of illumination. After little choice at a normal life at late my chief concern is a duty to speak of what I have learnt only through the grace of god. A reminder of what came before, glad tidings to those that believe and warning of gods punishment to those that pervert gods word and laws. 

God gave me reason as well as free will as hard as they have tried to corrupt and fashion it. There are things I feel is my duty to relay. There is much perversion in the law and violation of people‚Äôs rights and freedoms and I would like to stand and do my duty as anyone in my position would like to do and explain what I believe has been revealed to me and many before me. What ever becomes of me, is in the one lords hands. I can fear no one but god himself. I am a non violent individual and have already been subjected to detention in hospital after making complaints until it became clear that my illness is seperate to the facts of the matter. I would just like to make known my experience and share and make transparent to any one who may be concerned",18Feb2019,1
701,"Hi! I really need to start providing some income to my house as I turned 18 recently and my mom will no longer get child support. Theres a lot of places around me that hire kids my age from my school part time so I‚Äôm not too worried about it being hard to find one. My concern is that at the end of march for 5 days I‚Äôm going to visit my dad and brother. Then again in the first full week of June I will be going to visit them again. There isn‚Äôt a possibility of me being able to cancel the trips. 

Should I wait for the first trip to be over then try to apply and mention the one week in June? Or can I just apply now? ",18Feb2019,3
