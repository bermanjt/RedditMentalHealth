I just dont know how to show her that I love her. I've tried everything i can think of, cooking for her, playing her favorite games wit her, and blatantly telling her that i love her. But she still feels this way and i hate it. Sure, I havent been the best sister to her. I've been rude to her and lashed out on her. I just want her to be happy.

2,"My grandmother has been struggling for the past year or so. She retired a while ago and used to be very active in her social circle (attending events, going to religious services, etc), but her health has made her essentially unable to leave the house. My grandfather isn't very talkative, so she mostly interacts with her brother (who visits every day), my mother (who calls every day), me (I call every week), and any members of our extended family who randomly drop by. We live pretty far away, so we only get to see my grandparents once or twice a year.

I have tried getting her things she might like (games, coloring books,  CDs, etc), but she hasn't shown much interest in many of them. She really enjoys playing chess (and I got her a new chessboard when I visited last year), but nobody around her is interested enough to play her. I have tried asking her brother to play her, but he has trouble with the game and doesn't like it, so I don't want to push that. I play when I visit, but then again, that's not exactly a regular thing. She  also started reading the first ""Harry Potter"" and she says she likes it (Dumbledore is her favorite), but she doesn't really keep at it. She  reads if I remind her or if she finds it when looking for something  else, but it's not something she thinks of by herself.

We spoke last week and I was trying to just keep the conversation going/distract her by asking her frivolous questions. I asked her what superpower she would want to have, and she literally said ""death"". So, I'm worried. I know she's unhappy and I don't know what we can do to help. She really likes it when people visit, but she's not in a condition to go out and visit people herself. My parents and I can only visit every so often and she's not getting enough social interaction.

I guess I'm asking if you think there's something I can do to make her happier. What would you suggest for keeping her more engaged and possibly increasing her social interaction? I've tried everything I can  think of, but I'm hoping that I missed something that will make her feel  better.

I appreciate any suggestions.",30Sep2019,1
3,"Background info:  I'm 22, from Ireland, did a bachelors degree in Pharmaceutical science.

I've just finished my 4th year of college and have 2 exams deferred for January then I'm completely finished.  My current results stand at around 45 percent.  I have 3 months to do well in these 2 exams and possibly get myself a 2.2, but just incase I need to know what I could be in for if worst comes to worst.

If my average grade works out at under 50 percent and I end up with a pass degree, is it even worth using? I'm incredibly disappointed in myself for doing so poorly but I was mentally occupied by having a child, finding a place to live for me and my son and being a dad, along with not doing so well mentally.  It's been a tough year and as everyone has been saying, they dont know how I stayed the entire year.  I did what I could.

I study Pharmaceuticals and chemistry.  The degree would allow me to work in a lab setting.  In future, when I'm mentally capable, I want to do a masters or postgrad in something related such as Toxicology.  Is that option no longer available if I get the pass degree? 

Also, should I expect to be turned down by employers more often? I think this one is obvious, but just to know how bad it actually is.


Please please please if you have a question ask me.  I need the help for the sake of my family.  There is noone to talk to in my area about these issues.",30Sep2019,1
4," Can I continue to work with someone I have romantic feelings for?

I have only told my sister and their wife, that I have romantic feelings for my Store Manager (SM). They think it’s a problem, I don’t. Now I am turning to the internet for advice or confirmation that I am smart enough to not mess this up.

So… Context Time! 

I am nearly 30, single for almost a year. I am a self-confessed workaholic, and I am currently an assistant manager in a retail environment. I stepped down from being a Store Manager for another company about a year and a half ago during a rough patch in my life; I joined a company that showed a lot of promise. While I have transferred around that company a few times now, I really love my current location, and I strongly feel I am going places in this company. 

However, I am also faced with a new situation. Before my recent transfer I meet my now SM, at the time I considered him, quiet, a little shy, cute and professional. He is mid-30s, and also a workaholic. I considered before really knowing him he would be an ideal person to learn the ropes from and quickly.

On the other hand, when we started to work together every day, I discovered more to him; he is professional, cute, a shy. But he is also childish, humorous, delightful, kind and has complex emotions. We talk about, families, bad relationships, hobbies, comic books, and collectibles and how much we want annual leave around our birthdays to avoid people. He cracks jokes so often I think everyone is sick of my snorting laugh. I go sleep thinking about him, and wake up wondering if he is going to beat me to work today.

My sister, points out that this could be a distraction, this could be used against me. (And NO I haven’t told anyone else about these feelings.) My sister states that these feelings aren’t real, it’s based off having a “good male role model” I call bull sh\*t because I have a great relationship with my Dad who is an AMAZING role model. 

The biggest thing my sister points out is now much I work, they said that now I am working to get praise from my SM. I don’t think this is true; I work just as hard as I did before. When I go above and beyond, all I normally get is a “Thanks” and that’s all I am entitled too, because this is my job to support my SM, to make sure everything runs smoothly as possible. My sister also points out I worked for nearly 15 years and I have never fallen for someone at work before, and it’s solely because they are single. But, I did like my SM and consider them attractive before I knew they were single, and knowing might have reinforced my feelings, I will not disagree with that.

To conclude, I am not acting on these feelings; I am not unhappy with the way I feel, I am just not risking my career. 

My sister thinks I should look to transfer again before it “blows up in my face”

I disagree, because I enjoy my current location, my current team and I can with my current SM. I might not have such a good work environment if I transferred. I think I can be an adult about this just enjoy the playful banter, the childishness and the inside jokes, and not expect anything more, and with time my mind and heart will simply move on.

Who agrees with my sibling that I should cut and run? And who thinks having feelings at work with someone you see almost all the time is fine, as long as you’re respectful and professional? 

And, got any advice?",30Sep2019,4

9,"So, I'm in a relationship with this girl. I see no reason to say her real name, so I'll just be saying her or she as I go. 

Anyways, we've been dating for about 4 months, known each other for 6. Its a fairly new relationship. Everything is going well so far, we're loving the time we spend together, we talk on the phone often, send text messages every day. I've never been happier. But it's not all perfect. She has separation anxiety from me. Now, this isn't my first relationship so I have some experience in relationships, however, my past relationships have been really rough, from cheating, lying, stealing, to even death threats (not saying this for pity, I just feel its important for you to know). I think she is aware she has separation anxiety, but at times it seems like she isn't aware. But anyway, we're like any other couple, go on dates, loves being around each other, but also argues and we have our problems. Because in a relationship if there aren't problems it's not perfect. I know separation anxiety isn't healthy, she's letting herself rely on me for her happiness. She hasn't had a great life, from friends betraying her to even family-related issues. But when she met me, she told me I changed her life. In the beginning, I found that so heartwarming knowing that I was impacting somebody's life in a positive way. But as time went forward, I realized that she had separation anxiety. She lives roughly 30 minutes from me, she can't drive yet and I can. And its a lot of gas to go there, pick her up, go back to my house, then later that night, drop her off at home, then drive home. So on the days that I don't want to drive, or days that I want to myself to just have my alone time, maybe be on my computer, or just spend time with family, she gets depressed. She gets mad. Anytime we aren't together, she's in her room alone. Either babysitting her baby brother or crying because she misses me. And don't get me wrong, I miss her too, like crazy. I love her and she loves me. But it's like even after an hour of not being together, she's crying.

Obviously, any good boyfriend wants to help her girlfriend. I don't like knowing that she's in her room just crying. It kills me inside knowing I can't help. I know that I could stop her from crying if I drove to see her and spent another half tank of gas that day, but I can't always do that. So this is what I need advice on. I'm not sure how to help her. I've tried asking her if we can talk about the separation anxiety that she has and she just says no. She just denies that she has it, but other times she still says she has it. I just don't know what to do. It's like if I'm not with her, she's not happy and its as simple as that. So please give me some advice. Don't be rude, if you're just going to be a dick, then go reply to someone else.",30Sep2019,1

12,"I read an article about how a crush only lasts about 4 months, and if you still have feelings after that then you are in love. I'm just kind of confused on what counts as ""feelings"".

For the longest time, I've always thought that she was cute,  smart, funny and pretty and I look forward to seeing her every week. But, does this mean I'm in love?

13,"
Me 23f and my bf 23 m have been together for 3 years and have had the most amazing relationship . Since the moment we met it’s been different and we have love and respect for one another . We talk about being together for the rest of our lives and we truly love one another . We never had any problems until 2 years into the relationship (except for regular disagreements etc) 
my bf invited me to a friends birthday party and I was unable to go since I was recovering from a stomach thing that I ended up in the hospital with . A few months after the party I noticed his text messages were deleted with one of his close female friends Anna. I thought it was weird but never asked about it . I decided to talk to him about being jealous of their relationship , they’ve been friends since grade school , and she is so beautiful . They tried things once in first year uni, kissed and then they decided it wasn’t for them . 

I talked to him about how I was uncomfortable when she would reach out to him to talk about her and her bfs problems (she didn’t understand why he wasn’t being intimate with her and thought he might have cheated etc) I mentioned that i feel like she has emotional affairs with other men when things aren’t going well in her relationship - my boyfriend is very loyal and loving and I know he would never participate in something like that , it’s that she purposely seeks attention outside her relationship to spite her boyfriend if things aren’t going well and we both know that . He told me how they have been friends for a long time and it’s extremely platonic , things with them didn’t work out for a reason, and she’s rooting for us and he doesn’t need me to trust her but I need to trust him etc . 

After this talk a few weeks passed and she sent him a message asking for advice , I noticed the conversations up until that point has been deleted and I flipped a switch . He said he deleted them because he wanted a fresh start, every time I saw her or her name came up or she posted a photo I would become agitated and start asking him questions, he said he cleaned out other messages from him phone too but I only noticed hers because I was looking for it (fair enough). I brought up the deleted conversations from the party and he said he didn’t remember and he didn’t think he deleted them . I became very insecure and fell into an OCD spiral (I’m diagnosed) and began obsessing about what if something happened between them. I have PTSD from an abusive relationship I had in high school and it’s almost like I went back and this triggered me. I kept on asking him what if something happened would he tell me etc and all the reasons why he wouldn’t and how badly I would want to know and it was not good we talked about it for MONTHS. He eventually admitted that he deleted the conversations the first time because he told her I was in the hospital and he didn’t want me to get upset because I asked him not to say anything to anyone (I was embarrassed). He lied to me about how he remembered, I was so obsessed with the deleted texts he tried to get them back . I asked them if he saw them when he did the back up and he said yes - but he actually didn’t . He tried to get them back after that since he said he saw them and spent hours on the phone with Apple and downloaded and bought softwares to get them back . I think he lied about some small details - or rather stretched the truth . 

tl;dr So here we are . Obviously my behavior has been extremely inappropriate , having OCD is like an obsession you can’t control and you can’t stop asking questions it’s like a compulsion. So I started therapy and medication and was clinically diagnosed after this incident. I feel awful for what I put him through for months , but at the same time I’m really disappointed he lied to me . But then I feel like is it warranted considering ? 

We’ve been trying to work through it for months , we really truly had an incredibly loving strong and trusting relationship before this . I became obsessed and lost my sanity (I’ve also convinced myself I had hepatitis and other things in OCD spirals). 

I will also mention that in his first relationship and first intimate partner , he saved himself for the right person so I feel like there is a lot of things he hadn’t previously experienced and he wasn’t to sure how to handle . 

I will also mention that he doesn’t believe you cheat on someone you love and he takes the word love very seriously . I just don’t understand why he wasn’t honest about all the details ? I guess i have a large portion to blame ? I’m still lost ..",30Sep2019,1

I [M]  had a friend [F] at work who was moving away. She’s always been a great friend to me and I wanted to at least treat her to some fast food as a thank you and goodbye. I got permission from my girlfriend at the time and just dinner was okay. Well it started raining really bad and she lived kinda far as I lived across the street. She was worried so she asked if I can let her come by to my apt (her car wasn’t in the best of shape and she didn’t trust it in the weather) (I had roommates and friends over at the time). I just wanted to be friendly and understanding so I said okay, you can come over for a bit. We said hi to everyone and they were playing a game we had no interest in. So we went to my room and I left my door open to ensure I wasn’t being sketchy to my roommates as they knew who my girlfriend was. We were just watching YouTube as I decided to get a Smirnoff and offered her one. We both ended up having 3 each. She got tired and fell asleep suddenly on my bed. I was getting a little tired but I just sat at the foot of my bed because I didn’t feel comfortable laying next to her so I stay up as long as I could. I wanted to let her get enough rest and trying to let the weather calm down so she’s not buzzed driving in crazy rain weather. The rain never stopped really as I was getting fairly tired. I layed on the bed but as MUCH to the edge as I could possibly be. Leaving about 2 feet space between me and her (basically almost falling off the bed) I ended up napping for about two hours before I woke up and realized the weather finally calmed down as it was morning. I woke her up and walked her out and said bye. I was honest to my girlfriend about what happened but she insists I cheated on her as I don’t believe I did. Although now I reasonably understand in the future to not sleep anywhere close to another woman like that again, to at least sleep on the floor but I knew what I wanted and trusted myself and that my girlfriend would trust me. My girlfriend insisted I should have kicked her out when she fell asleep or slept in the other room (had friends sleeping over, no space to sleep besides on the floor) In my understanding, I don’t think that’s considered cheating but at least a FU right? This happened years ago but it recently started kinda driving me crazy as to what the reality of the situation is. Any help?

21,"Since a year ago I started to develop a personality and discovering myself, before that I used to do what life told me to do and to follow the structure of life.

So while discovering myself I noticed I enjoy being alone, dividing my time as half to be with people and half to be alone. And I started having problems at my house since I dont like to being waken up for breakfast, or be called to eat, or being interrumped when Im extremely focus on smething. I used to think that this being my house is the place where i can be myself more, but I cant stand all the people interrumping me and telling me what to do. Now reading all this while I write makes me look like a rebel teen as is my parent house their rules and bla bla bla. So is that right? My parents house i should live like they wanted me to? whatever. 

I lived a year alone in other city and I felt like what is to live alone, and I didnt like it at all, once my brother -with whom I rarely had a good interact while I was back in house- came to visit me and I was the happiest man in the world, once he left, I really missed him perhaps I wouldnt if I lived at my parents house. Then I realized I need to be surrounded by people as mental health - I think thats normal isnt it?-

So the reason Im staying is because my father is one of the best programming engineers of the city and I want to be teached by him (I am being teached by him) so I can work as that, and if I leave then he wouldnt teach me anymore.

Second I dont want to live alone all by myself as I did because is unhealthy, I think. Third I dont earn that much money to start living by myself. fourth I think i kinda like my family when they are not that intrusives.

Finally I think Im just using them to stay surrounded by people instead of being with them because i loved them, am I using them? does that makes me egoistic? WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME

27,"First off, when we started talking, his profile on POF were all of the same young man, who matched the description and age of the profile. He said his wife passed away, and didn't want sexual pictures or anything else, he just wanted a companion to text after work is all. Usually I don't mind being friends with people, it's easy and I enjoy helping others. I also do not send nudes or do sexual activities with anyone but my partner if I have one. Anyways, he's very nice, and I haven't accepted money at all, I have not requested it, and he has not offered me anything yet. Which is fine as I'm not interested in the money. But his profile indicated that we had similar hobbies, and it's fun to talk with someone of similar interests. Nothing wrong with that. After texting from a fake phone number on the app TextNow for a while, he seemed genuine and psychology indicated he was true to his word. I go back to the original profile, as he mentioned to me today he had an 8 year old daughter, and now there's a completely different person, but the younger man is in one of the pics (maybe a nephew or cousin or something) and I'm someone who trusts my gut, so idk why but I just have a ton of bad feelings about the situation. I don't think he's the kind of person to try to find me in real life (we have never met, and I tracked his number, it's across the country) so therefore I theorize he wouldn't travel that far to harm me or anything of the sort. I have only talked to him about hobbies and similar things, so nobody has gotten hurt in any way, but he said today he was so glad to talk to someone nice like me, and I felt guilty instantly.

I’m constantly getting texts from my mother, play-by-plays on their fights. Dad doesn’t text, but he will trap me into his venting anytime I stop by to visit, or I have them over to my home. 

I feel indebted to them, my previous marriage was awful, they helped me out financially during my marriage because my ex-husband has a hard time keeping a job, and then of course when he finally left, they supported me for 3 months before I was able to get back on my feet, so I could keep my house. I am paying them back, but it’s slow. So, I feel guilty anytime I try to tell them to leave me out of it.

I understand them both, I understand my dad is tired and he’s still working, I understand my mother’s health issues and ailments... I try my best to listen, but I feel like it’s just not my place. I’m an adult, but still their child. 

If it were a once in awhile occurrence, I’d be happy to listen, but it’s everyday with my mom.  Neither are seeking help for themselves. Dad self medicates, and my mom constantly bitches to me about it all.

I have a lot of conflicting emotions over this. I love my parents, I want them to be happy. But I feel I cannot help them, and the negativity sometimes affects my own life.

Can anyone help me sort this out? I’m confused, annoyed, and feeling guilty.",30Sep2019,3
31,"I always had this idea shoved down my throat as a kid that you should try to gain as much as possible while putting in as little effort as possible, and that is what sucess is. 

I am trying to unlearn this awful concept but it still gets to me.

I self sabotage. If I don't see a quick way for me to benefit from something, then I lose motivation and interest very quickly. 

I really want to go back and try to understand math. It would be fun and I could possibly use it in the future. I would love to take algebra at the college level so that I could go for an MS in buisness after I finish my major but I can barely do elementary level math. 

I downloaded an online at-your-own-pace math course. 

But I know myself. I know I am going to feel as if I'm waisting my time. I don't know if I'm ever going for my MS and my bachelors doesnt require any more math
 (Note: watching hours of Dr.Phil will not FEEL like a waist of time even though I logically know it is, but learning any new skills do for some reason) 

Even if I do well I am going to feel stupid. There is going to be a self destructive voice telling me I am waisting time. I am afraid of learning that I really am incapable of basic math. I am also afraid of finding out that I was never as stupid as I thought, and that I could have done better in highschool. I am just afraid in general and I know that's unreasonable. 

What short term ways can learning basic math skills benefit me? Even if I don't actually take any more college level courses in the future? How can the act of learning in and of itself help me? 

Just things that I can look back at to fight the self destructive voice when it pops up. 

Thank you! Any contribution at all would mean a lot to me!

35,"So there’s a guy I’ve built a strong crush on this school year. He was one of those people I recognized because I passed him in the halls enough last year but never said anything, just knew him by his face. So when he was placed in one of my classes I instantly recognized him and I think he recognized me as well. We just glanced at each other during class for a while until a couple weeks back he introduced himself to me and I finally knew something about him. A bit after that I managed to get his number with the excuse I’m never in class so I need someone to update me. But a few days ago I invited him to a work event that’s basically a glorified party. There’s food, karaoke, a smash bros tournament, and more. But everyone who works there can invite one guest so I asked him to go, he responded with a yes unless something comes up for him. So my question is, what now? If he does go, what do I do exactly? I know it all sounds a little stupid but all my relationships previously were online so I don’t have much experience in this case. I just really like this guy and want to build up as much confidence as I can before I dive into it. Any advice will help, thank you!

38,"Hi, I'm am a 21yo girl from New Zealand, I applied to the NZ army when I was 19/20 and was accepted. I was discharged pretty much immediately due to an oversight on my medical, and told I was never able to reapply.

I grew up in a very religious household, so sex was a no no and I was too much of a goodie goodie to rebel. Finally last week I said screw it. I texted my best friend, we’ll call her Sarah. I asked her if she’d be down to “teach me” and help me. We both agree we’re very close friends and can tell each other anything. We trust each other and neither one of us will judge one another. We both agreed this was strictly platonic and she said “no kissing” which I totally understand.

43,"Hello, first I want to apologise if my English is bad. 

A bit of background.. Just four days ago I turned 18. My plan was to now move with another family member, since my house where I live right now is pretty chaotic, my mother outright abusive, and I have absolutely zero freedom, I'm not even allowed to go outside very often.

I'm in a long distance relationship that my mother does not know of (even being a person of color herself, she is racist and she also does not want me dating anyone), and since last year we were planning on seeing each other soon after I moved. We already looked for places, have an idea of how much everything would cost, his job contract ended around my birthday and everything (he's from another country not far away, but it'll be expensive for him to come).

A few months ago my mother told me that in November she wants to visit the US, where she is from. I said, before she invites me, that I'm not going, but she didn't take me seriously. I kept telling her all these months, that I don't want to go. Travelling with her is a nightmare, she lashes out even when everything is fine, I'm left alone and not allowed to do anything most of the time (I have brothers, but she respects their decision of not wanting to go, she believes because they are male they know better), and I just don't want to go. Not for now, I don't mind going on my own in the future, when things are better.

&amp;#x200B;

Lo and behold, she tells my grandma that I am indeed going. And my grandma just sent me an audio message saying how excited she is to see me, that she misses me, how many things she wants to buy me, and that stuff.

Now, I don't have the option to say no. I'll get the ""you don't care about your grandma"", which is not true. I talk to her often, I've already visited her before, and of course I'd like to again, just not now, and not with my mother. 

I am unable to move, because she knows where those family members live, and if I bring it up now, she'll most likely go mad and start physically attacking me or breaking my things. And then not just her, but my family will accuse me of not caring/being selfish. I don't know what to do. It's not just because of being unable to see my boyfriend, which I already had to delay the once. He is sleeping right now, but I feel terrible just thinking about telling him it has to be delayed again).

46,"Hey all,

I was bullied pretty severely in high school. I am pretty successful now and so is the guy who bullied me. It doesn't bother me that he's successful, but I constantly worry about running into this guy again in my day to day life.

I know these fears are completely irrational. We don't live in the same city, I haven't spoken to him or interacted with him in years, and I'm not even sure I would recognize him if I did run into him. Still, I am terrified that he'll remember my existence and decide to ruin my life. I always felt very powerless around him. For example, he was very well-liked by all the teachers, so he would do things like argue against me and taunt me during oral presentations so that I would get a lower grade because he could get away with it. I could never tell on him for physical stuff either because he was so well-liked that no one would believe me. I also didn't want to tell on anyone.

I'm wondering if any of you guys have dealt with this sort of residual fear from bullying? All the advice I get on the topic is reassurance that it will bite him in the ass later on down the road. I don't really care about that though. I don't get any comfort in his misfortune; I just don't want him to come into my life.",30Sep2019,3

66,"This is going to be long, complicated and somewhat rambling so things are inadvertently going to get left out or confusing. I'm just trying to process all of this and look for what my next steps should be. Also on mobile so I have no idea what the formatting will be like.  TL;DR at the bottom.

I'm a 17m and a junior (3rd year) in high school and lately my entire life has just been bad news on top of bad news. For some background, my parents got divorced just about as soon as I was born and decided to split time between them 50/50. Although I don't really feel any animosity towards them, this has made my childhood much more difficult because my parents don't communicate and always think it's the other's turn when anything need to get done. I'm the youngest of 3 kids and both of my siblings have already moved out and are at least mostly independent. 

Seeing how I'm the last one and next year is going to be my last year in highschool, my parents have decided that now is the right time to completely change everything in their lives without consulting each other. To my surprise my dad just announced that he is going to marry his long time partner which is awesome but he also wants to leave next summer and travel cross-country for awhile on his way to MOVE TO FLORIDA (we currently live California). He explained his reasons which are completely justified and reasonable but it really complicates things. This means that I'll no longer spend 50/50 time between my parents and it'll leave me with my mom who is much less well off. My mom is extremely narcissistic and although I love her we have some major personality differences. 

On my mom's part she's decided that it's time for her to get her degree in psychology (which, again, is great) but this means she will probably have to leave her job to get her practice hours. Besides me not wanting to live with her full time, this will also likely mean that she couldn't comfortably support both of us for the next year or two.

On top of all of this I switched schools at the beginning of high school and although I'm still close by it's caused me to drift apart from most of my friends. At my new school I've failed to really integrate so I'm not very close with anybody there. This has left me with 3 close friends which I only see once or twice a month. We'll call these friends Jake, Chris, and Blaine. Of them, Jake and Chris are friends with each other but not Blaine so I hang out with them separately. Jake and I have been growing apart for quite some time and at this point we have very little in common so the only reason we really hang out is because of Chris and our history together. This group is where the majority of my social life is as they'll often invite their other friends along. But Chris just told me that he is going to be moving across the country in 6 months so I'll basically be losing two of my closest friends. Blaine, however, is a totally different problem. I've been friends with him most of my life and until recently we've had very similar goals in life and been very close. He is extremely academic and ambitious and so am I but in a different way. 

I've always been smart and I love to learn but I've always hated school. Despite this college has always been the automatic next step for me until recently. For the past year I've been weighing the pros and cons of college for me and it hasn't been an appealing option. Instead, I would like to join the Air Force out of high school as it will allow me to save a good amount of money while learning a practical career skill. This doesn't mean I've given up on college but I'd probably go after I get out so I can take advantage of the benefits and not end up in debt. The only problem is that if I announce my intentions then my family and my last remaining friend will basically give up on me. Of course my family will still love me but I'd rather tell them after I graduate because they have always had high expectations for me and college has been a given. Blaine will probably still be my friend but we'd lose half of our shared interest which will undoubtedly damage our friendship. These issues have delayed me telling everyone but as junior year winds up I'll have to choose. 

TL;DR: My dad is moving away and my mom most likely won't be able to support me. One of my only friends is leaving which means I'll most likely lose another of my friends. I have to decide between the Air Force and college which might alienate me from my family and my only remaining friend. Basically, I'm on the verge of losing half my family and all my friends.",30Sep2019,1
67,"My mind is currently in circles trying to make a decision.

I (M19) recently found a ticket to Rome for $250 - a complete steal (it costs upwards of $1000 normally where I live) for this January. I plan to stay for two weeks, and visit Hamburg and Amsterdam (and London if I can fit it in) to see my penpal(s) and Discord friends for the first time. 

A part of my heart wants to go out and see this girl (F16) I previously dated online. We were in an online relationship for 8 months before breaking it off because I felt like it wasn't really plausible long term. She lives in Argentina, and we still have feelings for each other. Her family has invited me to come visit them in their beach house recently. Ticket is around $1000. Food, accommodations, etc would be covered for at least a week, and from what I can tell my money will go further in Argentina. If it helps, her family is awfully wealthy.

I want to go to both, but can only afford one. As much as I love this girl, I'm afraid it will make me more attached to her than I should be. After all, she lives an entire continent away from me, and if she ever comes to the US it'll be in at least 2 years. At the same time, Rome for $250? Insane. Plus my friends have offered to either split accommodations or offer to let me stay at their place. I also have a thing going on with my friend in Amsterdam along with a girl I know in Italy.

I'm leaning more towards Europe because of how cheap I got the ticket for, but feel like I would regret if I didn't go to Argentina, etc. Same for if I went to Argentina and not went to Europe. What I thought I can do is go to Europe in January and possible Argentina sometime in Feb-April for a week, but that would not only be quite expensive but may require me to go into credit card debt. 

It's a really difficult decision for me to make. Where should I go?",30Sep2019,1
68,"I’m a film major. I joined production club and heard they were taking scripts, submitted one the day before it was due and I am pretty sure it was the worst things I’ve ever written and I can barely write an essay. There’s another meeting tomorrow, should I stay in the club? I’m easily embarrassed and think everyone is thinking rudely of me when they’re not. The biggest thing here is that I’m embarrassed I turned in a horrible script but it was my first time doing anything like that as I don’t put myself out there. Any advice is appreciated.",30Sep2019,1

To start off, sometimes I lack social skills and I struggle with panic attacks. From the beginning of the year, my college roommate and I would talk a little bit and stuff, but as the 1st semester went on, she was really quiet. I will say she was out of the room more than me (she had a job), but when she was in the room, she never talked to me first. I would sometimes try to be friendly like offering her cookies. She would say, ""No, I'm good."" She was coughing one day and I offered her some cough drops. She was like, ""Oh, I'm good. I just have lots of phlegm sometimes."" I responded, ""You know, they have medicine for that."" She didn't say anything after. I just got bad vibes from her. She didn't smile enough, and when she did, it looked fake. She was really guarded. I noticed when she did her makeup in the room, she would turn her back to me if I walked by her side of the room. She did the same at night. I would walk by her side of the room and she would turn her chair while she was wiping off her makeup...At night, she would purposely not face me if she hung something in her closet. She kept her back to me as she walked back to her desk.

We each had lofted beds with desks and drawers underneath. We both decided to change our clothes at our desks so we wouldn't see each other. A few times I've heard her changing her clothes, and one time I heard wrappers tearing....then I heard her wad something up and throw it away. Afterward, she went into the bathroom to wash her hands (We share a half-bathroom with suitemates) I'm assuming she washed her hands because she changed her pad in our dorm room? Idk what else it would be. I checked the trash when she was gone, and I could tell there were menstrual pads in there. (They were wrapped at least). I will say that we didn't have a trashcan in our bathroom. Only the bedroom. I thought it was weird that she did this, but I never said anything until we got bed bugs. She seemed really irritable and would slam the door sometimes, so I never mentioned the pad thing to her, as well as a few other things regarding the room. I was pretty mad, because I'm pretty sure bed bugs are attracted to blood. I looked it up online, and realized my roommate was probably the reason our bed bugs were so bad. (Because she changed pads in the room)

Pest control treated our room, but I wanted to make sure the room was cleaner from then on. I was scared of my roommate because she was an upperclassman and in my experience, door slamming leads to violence. I was panicking, so I told the RA the stuff my roommate did and that I couldn't talk to my roommate about this because I didn't feel safe, and it was an unfriendly environment.

We had a meeting with the RA to make a new roommate agreement. My roommate was super angry (I'm assuming because I brought in the RA to talk to her first.) She basically said it was ridiculous that I ""felt unsafe"" and that ""mature adults communicate to the roommate first.""

My roommate (passive aggressively): ""Roommates should talk to each other first instead of going to the RA because that's what mature adults do."" \*She looks at me, then looks away\*

My roommate: ""I have a right to be upset. Why did you say I made you feel unsafe?????""

Me: ""Because you glare at me, and stomp around and slam the door! Wouldn't you be scared??""

Roommate: ""I don't believe you're scared of me.""

Me: ""That's because I told my parents about this and they told me not to act scared so I don't give you power."" 

\*I made sure I looked at my roommate straight in the eyes, so she knew I wasn't a pushover.\*

Her: ""I was stressed??!""

Me \*slowly\*: ""So is every other college student.""

My RA to my roommate: ""I mean, she has a point. It's her room, too, and door slamming is probably not the best way to deal with stress. We do have counseling sessions at school for stress.""

Me: ""Oh, yes. I go to those a lot, and they really help!""

\*Later in the meeting\*

Me: ""Desklights should be off from 12am-6am because the lights are SO bright. Also, phones should be off during that time because that's when people are trying to sleep. Also, no going under each other's desks because that is private property.""

RA to my roommate: ""Is that okay with you?"" 

\*My roommate didn't say anything. She'd just nod.\*

Me: ""Also, family should be able to visit because that's important to me.""

RA: ""Is that okay with you?"" 

My roommate would just nod and not contribute anything to the new roommate agreement. She'd just sit silently and sometimes roll her eyes.

 Later in the agreement I said, ""sanitary napkins should be changed in the bathroom, because I looked this up and body fluids spread disease and pests and that ALSO makes me feel UNSAFE."" I looked at my roommate dead in the face when I said that, and my roommate seemed a bit taken back. I wanted to show that I wasn't scared of my roommate. 

I mentioned it a few seconds later and looked at my roommate again.

Me: ""Sanitary napkins---"" 

Roommate: \*She interrupts me\* ""I KNOW. YOU ALREADY SAID THAT!""

Me: ""Just making sure you heard me.""

When the meeting was over, my roommate burst out of the lounge in tears. I felt that it was probably fake, and that I stood my ground pretty well.

2nd semester, she apologized for making me feel uncomfortable and brought me oreos. Then everything was friendly. However, my guy friend started talking to her even after I told him the weird stuff she did. One day he invited her to go to the mall with us when it was just supposed to be us 2. She hesitated and he was like, ""Maybe another time?"" She said, ""yeah..."" I just didn't say anything and left with him. When we were gone, I asked why he invited her. He was like, ""Come on, she's your roommate."" In general, I didn't want him to be friends with her because I thought she'd talk about me behind my back to him. He said she was ""pretty cool"" and I'm like, ""no...she's weird."" One time she suggested we meet once a week for dinner so we communicate and don't let things pile up. I agreed and we set up a time. On the day we planned, she asked what time I usually eat dinner. I said, ""It depends"" (I was busy working on an assignment) She just dropped it and never mentioned it to me again. 

Eventually, my college roommate sent me this long text at the end of the year, confronting me for everything I said to her. She basically said I had a condescending attitude, that I was judgmental, and didn't belong in the psychology field.

For example, one time (in person) she said, ""I'm not trying to avoid the room or anything, I'm just not here most of the time because I've been working a lot.""

 I said, ""Oh, I don't have a job because my parents have good jobs, and I got lots of scholarships because I'm smart, or at least that's what people say.""

She also was talking casually about how she hoped her skin didn't look too oily.

 I was like, ""let me see."" 

She says, ""uhh no...."" 

I was like, don't worry I won't judge."" I got up in her face and looked at her skin and said, ""Oh, you just have large pores. I have small ones.""

There was a time when she asked if the school internet was working for me. I said, ""Yes, I have unlimited data on my phone.""

During the beginning of the year, I let her perform her monologues in front of me for an audition. After the audition, I asked how it went. She said, ""I was really nervous, but glad I got it over with!"" 

Me: ""I mean, you're not an A class actor, but for what you're trying to do, it was pretty good. You didn't need to worry.""

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, there was a time she showed me her theatre headshots because she wanted her top 10 chosen for the photographer to edit. She's like, ""Do you want to see them?"" I said, ""You want me to see?"" She's like, ""Yeah!"" She shows me a headshot and says, ""I really like this one."" I stared at it for a few seconds.

I said, ""To edit this, I would take out the red part on your forehead, and then sculpt your cheekbones, but idk what the acting industry likes"". She also said she was aware I talked behind her back to my guy friend. Those were just a few things she confronted me about in her text. Did I really sound that bad......?",30Sep2019,1

I felt betrayed because I thought we were having a good relationship for 3 months. Our relationship is broken in pieces. I tried to be friends with her but it is very hard for me and it bothered me. I stopped talking her before summer. It is my fault because I am the one who told her that I had feelings her and we started dating back then.

77,"I don't know when this started or when I ""became"" like this, but somewhere down the line, I realized telling friends, best friends, etc is just pointless. Especially of the things I am sad about. They don't respond or console me in the ways I hope they do, they don't make the pain easier or act like they somewhat understand what I'm going through. They don't even tell me things I hope to look for, hope. Thats unfair, I know. They can only be there for me, can't make it better for me. They can listen to me but not help me. Its just unfair for me also, no? I feel like, I know usually what to say for others, how to make them feel better, how to make their hearts a bit lighter. I know how to support them, be there for them, and try my best to understand their pain. I do not think this myself, its literally what most of my friends tell me. ""you know what to always say"",  ""you always make me feel better"", etc. 

Why can't I find a person who is that for me. Why do I have this enormous patience. Why am I always listening, why am I afraid to talk about myself. I don't even tell people of the good things that happen in my life, the happiness isn't really shared with anyone other than my family. It really Is just me. 

My biggest problem is, I am beyond lonely. I am patience of the one person, the one girl  to come into my life, the one who can listen to me, and they don't even have to know the answers or what to say. It just has to feel comfortable to talk to them. It has to feel right, that I don't feel like it will come back to me in a form of regret. A person who I can tell my happiness to, who I can call, who I can text, who I can tell my sadness too, who I can ask favors from, who I can feel the most comfortable in. I try my best to do everything myself, it just doesn't feel right to even ask for the littlest things. I am not exactly depressed but if there was a term for like In between sadness and depression, that would be It.

Basically my gf used to live with with her sister (entitled sister), her sisters boyfriend (dickhead) and her dad. 
Everyone was living like this fine for years until around she got out of high school. 
My girlfriend was trying to get her life together with a decent job. 
DH, ES and my gf all worked at a shipping company and still do. 
She got a new phone under DH's name since there was a pretty good deal. 
She was paying it off over time however while all this was going on ES and DH were absolute counts. 
They all carpooled to work together and DH would constantly use it to manipulate them. 
I put alot of mental strain on my gf. 
It wasn't just the ride he was a dickhead to EVEYONE on the house. 
I'll spare the details on what happened but basically me and my gf's dad kicked them out. 
All the while they were packing they were screaming and even put a hole in the door. 
Now it's just my gf's dad and her living there. 
I visit on weekends when I can as I'm still in school and have work.
She got a ride from a friend to work for the past few weeks so she could switch her phone onto her own plan and then get a car. 
But when she went to AT&amp;T today DICKHEAD HAS REPORTED THE PHONE STOLLEN
Now she has to get a new phone and DH gets to keep all the money she gave him. 
Unfortunately there are no bank records as she gave him cash. 
Idk what to do about this, DH just got a brand new car and I'm ready to F it up or him whatever I see first. 
Or do something to get pro revenge or nuclear revenge idk.

That I could have killed someone while driving (by the way he lost his license for going 180 in a 100 zone, the hypocrisy) they also said I was drink driving, I took about 3 sips of alcohol and put it down, ate 2 plates of food and drank a tonne of water and didn’t leave till hours later! now my family is worried and I don’t know how to address the situation because I have to see these people wether I like it or not!

85,"Just  brief information about my family. We are from Iraq and we escaped the  country and moved to The United States back in 2007 - when the war in  Iraq was at its worst. Me (22 years old), my mom Anisa (46 years old)  and dad all came here, I was 10 years old then and I am the only child  in the family. We first lived with relatives who came to the US before  us, until we were given a house of our own.

We  are generally a messy household, dad always comes home and argues with  mom, he is an alcoholic, he is usually out with his friends until really  late at night and then comes home unclear in his head and becomes  easily irritated. I'm used to seeing mum and dad quarreling, it's been  like this since I was a little kid, both in Iraq and here in the US. In  my opinion, the factors are not just that dad drinks, but also that he  is twenty years older than mom. They got married in the summer of 94 -  When mum was 21 and he was 41 years old. When mom usually cries after  they have quarreled, I go and comfort her, then she says it was not like  this all the time. It was really good during their first period as a  couple, it got better when they got me in 1997 - but since 2002 when dad  started drinking their relationship with each other changed.

Last  year after one of their quarrels with each other became physical, I had  to keep dad away from mom and calm him down, I talked to him and said  that it's starting to be extremely difficult with all the fighting. He  then said that it was because he was afraid of losing mom, I asked what  he meant and he explained that mom is significantly younger than him,  she is incredibly beautiful and a good woman, while he does not see  himself as anything special, so I silenced him and said that mom loves  you, otherwise she would never have married you. In 2011 Dad had a lack  of vitamin D, which led to osteoporosis which made him shorter by a few  centimeters. He and mom were both 5ft11 before, but then he became 5ft9,  which I personally think also affects him. In Iraq and that region you  hardly see a woman taller than a man, so dad sees this as a humiliation,  in addition to the age difference.

I  have an American friend, Liam, who I have known since we were both 18,  we went to the same class and are really close. I usually tell him  what's going on at home between dad and mom because I trust him and he  is my friend, he also tells secrets to me. Anyway, Liam came to our  house, it was September 7th on a Saturday this year, I had invited him  to breakfast and then we would go for a walk. When things went crazy  between mom and dad all of a sudden. Liam and I ran to their room and we  saw Dad had Mum against the wall and screamed at her. I grabbed Dad and  took him away, I asked Liam to take care of Mom and calm her down as  well. It took a good while before things got quiet, I spent half an hour  with dad and Liam with mom, then Liam and I went for a walk, he talked  the whole trip about why dad treats mom badly and that he didn't think  it was okay, I asked him not to care, that it is between them and they  will solve it.

On the twelfth of  September it was a really big fight between mom and dad, dad slapped mom  on the face and pushed her down, I got pissed and screamed at him, said  he should be ashamed and that he had gone crazy. Mom got up on her  feets and said that this had gone too long and that dad had crossed the  line, she went to her room, packed a big bag and walked to the door, I  tried to stop her but to no avail. She told Dad that she would sleep  over at her cousins house for a couple of days until dad becomes normal  again. He scream at her and told her to get the hell out of his house,  that he didn't want to see her in a couple of days either. I was very  disappointed with what dad had done but thought it might be better if  they separated from each other for a couple of days.

A  whole week went by and mom had not called back or returned home. Mom  didn't answer the phone so I called her cousin and she answered. I asked  if I could talk to Mom, but Mom's cousin said Mom was not with them, I  asked if she had come over in the past week, but they answered no. Then I  just hung up and thought to myself, where did my mother go then. The  very next day I drove to get Liam from his house, when I was there I saw  mom inside his house, he said nothing and just entered the car, I  called to mom but she just looked at me briefly and closed the door  again, I wanted to leave the car to talk to her but Liam held my arm and  said we would talk about it in the car. I was upset and screamed at him  why he didn't say anything, then I asked what she was doing in his  house. Liam said that mom has lived in his house since she left our  house, he said she came to his house and that his sister had taken her  in and after mom told them what had happened to her, and then Liam and  his older sister decided to let mom stay with them until she is ready to  go home again.

She has lived in  their house for eight days, so I said I couldn't allow mom to stay with  them anymore and that it didn't feel right, then Liam said that mom has  her own bedroom, that they are buying the food for her and that she  don't pay anything, and it wasn't a big deal, she would just be there  until she was ready to go home. I had a hard time accepting but  something made me accept in the end. I told him that mom must be back  home within a few days. I kept this a secret and told nothing to dad  because he was going to be furious, so after a few more days dad finally  asked where mom was and when she would come back home, I lied and said  she will be home within a few days. He then said that he was sorry for  his mistakes and wanted to ask for forgiveness from mom, I smiled and  thanked the lord, I thought finally he knew he was wrong and would now  try to be better.

Around two days  ago I called Liam to tell him that mom had to come home, but he didn't  answer the phone. I drove to his house and approached the door to knock,  but then his sister Abigail came out the door and wondered what I was  doing here. I said I was going to pick up mom, but she refused and said  that I should leave mom alone and that she wasn't ready to go home yet,  so I replied that I needed to talk to her, but Abigal refused and didn't  let me in to the House. I noticed that she really didn't want me to go  in, so I asked when could I come over, then she said within a couple of  days and that I needed to call before, I said ok and started driving  slowly. I drove behind a large bush and stopped the car there, I decided  that I had to talk to mom, I watched Abigail as she was standing  outside the house on the porch, after a while she took her car and drove  away, I thought this is my chance. I went to the house and tried to get  in but the door was locked, so I checked the side door and it was open.  When I came in, I heard loud rock music from upstairs. Their house was  quite large so it was difficult to know where the sound came from  exactly, but I searched and finally found the room, I slowly opened the  door and there I saw Liam between my mother's legs and doing it with  her. I was so shocked that I was fainting, I heard someone coming  downstairs, it was Abigal, so I hid and got out of the house as fast as  possible and drove off. I was devastated, I thought that dad was finally  ready to start all over again and that our family would be good again,  but then I found my mom in bed with my best friend, I felt betrayed, mom  betrayed me and dad.

I  don't know what to do in such a messy situation, I'm angry at my mom  for being unfaithful to my dad and lying to me, and even more angry at  Liam for having sexual intercourse with my mom, lying to me and shit on  our friendship. Mom has now been at Liam's and his sister's house for  more than three weeks, I've been lying to dad all the time and told him  that mom is with her cousins ​​and that she had gone on a little trip  with them and would soon come back home. I do not know how long I can  hide the truth, how to look at Liam again and how Abigail along with  Liam tricked me and took advantage of mom when she was in her most  sensitive and weakest state. How can my mom accept what she does and  sleep with her son's best friend? Did mom have the right to sleep with  her son's friend when she is a married woman, because her husband was  mean to her? Why did Liam and his sister Abigail trick me like that and  take advantage of my mom when she was weak and sensitive? What can a  person in my position do in such a messy situation? This is just too much to take in and handle. I need your help.",30Sep2019,3
86,"Growing up, I used to always have high grades and loved learning but, you know, life then messes you up now you have 0 motivation to do trash.

My dad works at a University coming home late every night and my mom lives in a separate country, meaning I practically live alone and can get away with anything. Both don't check on what on earth I do, they just care about the end products: my grades. 

The problem is that I go to those hella expensive so-called 'state-of-the-art' schools and I kind of don't want to waste my parents' money. I had enough with that 'I could send all those poor people who are more deserving then you to school' yeah because, I get that, in fact, I would love that, why not give it to them then if you care so much?

 I also have 0 friends who care because I always hop from one school to another, and I don't get the opportunity to develop friendships. 

So what can you learn from this? I'm lonely, a loser and really need to fix myself.

90,"Hey,

I don't know what to do.

By that, I mean that I'm in CEGEP, which is like quebecois college, and I'm in a program I hate.

To go into more detail, I'm in Pure and Applied Sciences. The more I go into my school year, the more that I realise I really hate my program--it's too science focused. My brain hurts. I feel stupid. 

On top of my disinterest, I don't think I've got the aptitude to successfully pass my program. And not only that, but I'm completely unmotivated. I look at what I should be studying, and I fall into stupors because of my disinterest. 

My whole life my parents have told me that a career in the STEM field is the way to go, and that anything less than 6 figures is unacceptable. But what happens when I can't tread that path? When I'm not smart enough? 

I'm thinking of switching program, something that isn't STEM. What jobs do you guys do? Is there anything I could aim for in college that would eventually lead to a 6 fig job?",30Sep2019,2
91,"Hi all... 5 years ago my best friend from highschool and I went separate ways. She wasn't very nice to me after wards and we unfollowed eachother. 3 years ago, she sent me a message apologizing, and I accepted the apology. She also asked to meet for drinks, but I said no. We didn't follow eachother at this point. Last year, I accidentally followed her and unclicked it asap, but then she tried to follow me, and I panicked and declined it. Now, we recently had to be in the same room and it was totally fine. We have tons of mutual friends, and I want to 'end the tension' and be able to follow eachother (yes I know, 21st century problems). I am nervous that this will open the door again to invites and rekindling a friendship, when I really just want to be cordial and make it less awkward for our mutual friends. Opinions? follow or no",30Sep2019,2
93,"So I just turned 18 a few months back and I'm now a freshman in a community college. Normally(?) I should be very excited to finally take an initiative and start doing what I want to, but now I feel very confused about what I'm doing now and what I will be doing in the future, and I severely lack motivation to really *do* anything productive.

For a little background: again, I'm 18 (give or take 4 months and a few days) and I just started in higher education. I was diagnosed with Asperger's at a young age which puts me quite a bit behind socially. I'm just now getting the hang of driving (I finally started over the summer) and I have yet to actually get a job. As of right now I'm currently living in my Dad's house but I want to change that.

First off: I'm not sure how I'm handling college. I am taking good(?) notes in my classes but I haven't felt motivated to actually go back and study them. The classes I'm taking right now have very little with the degree I'm pursuing (Computer Science) because the ones I did want to take were either full or there was some sort of hitch causing the credit I had in high school to not immediately transfer over to college. Even before that, I procrastinated HARD on actually getting into college by not applying for scholarships (until it was too late), applying for one university without even thinking about what I was giving them, and not even trying to sign up for classes until it was too late. I'm not even sure if I'll even be able to afford classes next semester.

Secondly, I feel like I don't really have a grip on interpersonal (and intrapersonal) skills. Frequently I'll say something completely stupid and irrelevant at the wrong times, not even noticing what I did until about a second after I did it. I don't even know how to start conversations or make friends—skills that I should definitely know by now (and would definitely benefit from). I'll frequently look off into the distance when I am holding a conversation, and I often leave out important details whenever I bring something up. I think I may be putting myself down too much, but at this point I don't really care. Because I don't really have anyone to talk to (I live in a single-parent household where my dad works a LOT and my brother likes to be in his own world most of the time), I can't even really practice my social skills which leads to a catch-22 where my (close to nonexistent) abilities to make friends and to actually behave like a normal person socially are codependent on each other.

Lastly, I feel that I can't actually live independently. It's basically a mutual agreement that I have to move out at some point between my dad (he wants to have raised me well) and I (I just want to live normally, and I disagree with Dad on a few of his decisions). Since I don't *exactly* have my license yet, I can't go anywhere without my dad in the car. I don't even know a few basic life skills, like cooking food (I only know how to follow the directions on the box), paying bills, leaving tips, and cleaning things up. Every time I do want to try something new, I'm afraid that I'll screw it up so I always ask for advice from someone else (always my dad in my current situation) before I even try. I don't even have a job yet because I don't really know how to find any (or apply correctly).

So in conclusion, I feel like I need a better grip on this whole ""real world"" thing and I'm not sure how. I feel grossly unmotivated to actually do anything, and I'm at odds with myself when it comes to the most minute details. With all that said, I just want to ask **how do I pull my life together already?** I know for a fact that I just can't keep upholding the status quo, and I'm not really aware of what's out there that I can take advantage of.

Please tell me what you know and what I can do to get myself on the right track. Any advice is welcome, even if it's completely useless to me.",30Sep2019,1
94,"I am a 15 year old sophomore in high school. I recently got my learners permit on July 29th. I started my sophomore year on August 14th. The grading period ends on October 11th, and I’m on track to getting a really shitty grade in one of my classes (D). All the others are A’s &amp; B’s with some C’s Going on B’s. I’m expecting a really good report card besides this one class.

In this specific class I have been having a lot of trouble keeping track of bellwork and homework, which is probably going to lead to an  F or D. This sucks but I have been slowly improving in the class but I know some of my ungraded and undone assignments plus a shitty notebook check grade will plunge my grade.

Today I expressed some of my concerns to my mom, and now because of that class I am not allowed to go on our vacation Friday, and I can’t drive for about a month.

I’m not as angry about the trip or the driving, it’s that I was just looking for help and trying to vent and she told me to “get the fuck out of her room.”

My grades sucked last year and I have really improved since then I think, but I’m still struggling all the time, and I have no idea how to convey that to my parents at all. Since I was little I was in gifted classes and always got A’s and B’s in school. I thing my parents still see me as this Wunderkind Savant who isn’t using their full potential. I am trying hard, but I always forget homework and shit. I’m really struggling with that. I have tried writing it down too, but that never helps. 

I don’t think I’m stupid, but I struggle in all my core classes, especially homework based ones. I always know the content, I just have trouble doing the work.

I have had attention issues since I was little and was taking meds for ADD, but I stopped after a while.

98,"hi, so i still have feelings for my first love, we’ll call him paul for now. around my first years of entering middle school, i had a really ‘idk’ phase where i wasn’t having it. i met him because he was really nice and wanted to sit next to me. i always had this sketchbook i carried and every time he would sit next to me during english, we would always doodle and we slowly got closer and closer. he was always there for me and kept on sending me dorky videos and hearts, as well as always keeping my spirits up. that’s when i knew i’ve fallen for paul. time skip to last year, when i got over him somewhat. we had gotten distant but we became close again during last november. we would always facetime and talk 24/7, and like a dumbass i was, fell for him the second time. and then suddenly he cut off all contact with me during january. during those time where we got close, i still had feelings for him and missed out friendship. and then a few months in and i realized i love(d) paul, and it wasn’t a crush phase. i somewhat had gotten over him during summer, however that didn’t even last when the first day of school arrived. now, everything is repeating, but only for the worse. i will admit that he has changed over the past few years, and he’s not the boy i loved anymore. paul has become more toxic in a way, putting people down and more jerk like. i’m not going to lie that many people have a crush on him, including me. he’s still nice and all but he has gotten more arrogant than before. most of my non close friends have a crush on paul, and one of my best friends too. none of my friends know except really close ones who i consider trustworthy, so i guess my feelings for him are kept downlow. moving on, the reason why i came here is because me trying to get over him. he recently got a girlfriend that’s known to be a cheater and a heartbreaker in our school. it didn’t really phase me until now, that he has a girlfriend and he is taken. because of this, i’m simping and crying my heart out because i miss paul a lot, and i don’t really know what to do or how to get over him. i want to get close with him again as friends, because i miss our friendship that we had, but at the same time i know i’ll just fall for him over and over again. trust me, i’ve tried many times to get over him, but my mind and heart always goes to him and i hate it so much. any advice on how to get over him?

100,"I just purchased a home and I’ve run into an issue with my Samsung dryer. The dryer itself was manufactured in May 2015 so it isn’t too old. It turns on and spins but no longer heats. I’ve tried cleaning out the vent and flipping the breaker switch for the dryer but this didn’t work. It seems so be the heating element that isn’t functioning properly(from my research online of common issues with Samsung). I’m concerned that with the dryer being this new and the vent not being the problem, that this will happen again even if I get it fixed. 

Is it worth it to pay a repair man to come and try to fix the dryer?

I am in desperate need of any kind of advice to help get me out of my situation. My mother is trying to make me dependent and bound to her. During my childhood/adolescenthood she took me out of school and ""homeschooled"" me I ended up becoming a drop out because when I turned 16 she mysteriously had a ""mix up"" and taught me the wrong lessons having me fail the grade. She ended up convincing me to just drop out because it would be easier to get my GED later on. I never did get my GED even though I studied so hard for the dang thing she'd make excuse after excuse why I couldn't get it. She would also not allow me to leave the house without her literally right next to me. It was very annoying not having much independence but it slowly became worse. She would flat out not let me leave the house at all unless it was either an absolute emergency or I had a doctor's appointment. At this point the only friends I had were online because I wasn't allowed to see the ones I had in person. She was always monitoring me she'd constantly burst into my room unannounced to check up on me and put cameras in the backyard so she could tell of I tried to escape she made me fear the outside world claiming the moment I leave I'll be raped and murdered and she's only protecting me. She would force me to read news stories of shootings and bombings and murders I became so terrified of the world. She would lock me in a room for days for no social contact whatsoever.

104,"My bf and I met four years ago during college. We always liked each other but were dating other people at the time. I moved to Europe for two years to do grad school, and we kept in touch, talking almost every day, but were also dating other people. During this time, he met a girl who he took on one date but then they decided they were better off as just friends (nothing happened, they didn't even kiss). Later he introduced us and tried to get us to all be friends, but we never got along because it was obvious we both liked him.

A year later, I finished grad school and moved to NYC. He, that girl, and another guy all moved to Cali and became roommates. After another year of talking and testing out long distance, he and i decided to officially start dating. Our relationship is great in almost every area, except when it comes to his roommate.

I’ve never gotten a good vibe from her. She is needy and seeks attention from my bf. She will come into his room sobbing, explaining her life problems, boy problems, etc and expects him to console her. She's gotten drunk and called/texted him multiple times, and asks him to do everything with her from going to get groceries together to going out with her every weekend, all under the title of ""best friends."" He ignores some of it but still hangs out with her some too.

I've told him I have a gut feeling that she still likes him in a romantic way and that's why I don't feel comfortable with her. My bf has agreed with me that she probably still has feelings for him even though nothing ever happened except the initial date, but assures me that he's not the slightest bit interested and will never see her as more than a friend. I trust him, but I do feel threatened by her and annoyed that she so obviously likes him. When I'm visiting him, she and I are friendly, but it's clear we don't get along. He basically completely ignores her when I'm town and gives me full attention, which I appreciate, but I know when I'm back in NYC they're hanging out constantly because they live together and she seeks out his attention.

Next year, she has decided to move to Europe to do grad school (anyone else think this is a weird coincidence?) and he told me he wants to go visit her on a two week trip and for me to come along. Am I being unreasonable by not wanting to go on a Europe vacation with him and a girl that is clearly obsessed with him? Should I try to see his side more? He said he really wants me to come on the trip, what should I do?",30Sep2019,1
105,"This is going to sound a little weird so bear with me. 24M. Last year, I was terribly unhappy with my career, and miserable in a turbulent relationship. I thought there was no way out. 

I decided to throw everything out the window and began on a drinking binge. 

I quit my job, and was destined to enjoy some time off and start reshaping my life from the bottom up, starting with a new career. I began drinking daily and devised a plan, which I thought was remarkably spontaneous at the time to see just how far I could take it. It was like Joaquin Phoenix in I’m Still Here. I told absolutely no one about this. 

Over a few weeks, I managed to stir up enough drama to get my girlfriend, who I had living with me, to finally move out. I had broken up with her dozens of times in the year before but she was not having it. After this happened, I thought it would be hilarious to act as though I was terribly upset over it to my friends and family (not to her though).  It was a joke, a joke only I was in on. 

I played it off well enough that absolutely everyone believed me. I took the drinking very, very, very far. They started to see I had a drinking problem. I played it off so well that at times I could hardly distinguish the act from myself. 

Looking back, this ‘part’ relieved me of my depression at times, because I no longer had to ‘be’ myself. It also gave me an excuse to drink. Now, friends and family have become thoroughly convinced that I’m a heartbroken alcoholic. I haven’t had a drink in 2 months, yet my family is begging me to seek treatment.

117,"These next couple paragraphs are examples of unfair things she does (and gets away with because she’s *the favourite*)

She’ll do things such as tidying the kitchen (and more) just so she can get something out of it. When doing chores she’ll make sure to do more than me but always pick the easiest, leaving me to do less but do the worst things (such as cleaning up the area where our dog shits). She also does so and then goes on and on about how I do nothing while she does *so* much (and everyone agrees with her). She complains when she doesn’t get anything out of it (I dunno what she expects, I mean she lives in the house might as well clean up). 

She claims things such as food, simply because she might have suggested to my parents the particular item when grocery shopping. She takes videos and pictures of me, sends them to her/our friends thinking it’s funny but if I were to even point my phone camera at her (even just having a picture of her sitting in my phone) it’s the end of the world. If I even touch her hair I’m doomed yet she’ll do things like lick her finger and then rub the spit on me. 
She comes in my room and annoys me, expecting me to not drag her out when she doesn’t listen to me telling her to. If I go in her room though I’ll get screamed at and punched right away. 
She works out all the time, so she’s fit. She’s really pretty. She really likes to rub it in my face. For example, if I happen to be looking in her direction, she’ll take her shirt and pull it back so I can see her flat stomach and average chest. She might flex her legs to show the muscle or something. She even pulls up her shirt just to show her belly (etc). Then she’ll poke mine or (when she’s in my room, as immature as it is, I’ll sit on top of her until she promises to get out) exaggerate about how heavy I am (I’m literally lighter than her) etc. Sometimes when I’m eating she’ll make looks or comment on how much there is on my plate or whatever. Sometimes I joke “oh I feel so fat right now” as in like “I’m so full and likely bloated” and she’ll say “Yeah you are, fatty.” She also boasts about how strong she is and makes fun of me for lifting 5 pound weights instead of 8 or 10 like her. 

She also goes on and on about how I’m such an asshole. Yeah, with my family I’m not the kindest person ever. I know I’m mean. I hate myself for it. I beat myself up for it constantly and I’m trying to change my ways. I’m mean, but I’m not mean because I’m generally a mean person, I’m just horrible at communicating. I’m not filled with hatred, I don’t think of myself as better than anyone, I know I’m not always right, I know I have many imperfections. They think I’m the opposite. My family is not the brightest bunch, I can’t be passive with them like I do everyone else. I *have* to be mean, otherwise I’m not heard at all. There are lots of reasons I am the way I am. I’m not mean like my sister though. I’m sarcastic, that is how I’m mean. I’m also honest with them. For some reason sarcasm and honesty is the end of the world. Every word that comes out of my mouth, my sister will look at me with absolute disgust and tell me how much of a bitch I am. 
Especially if I have a point to make. A lot of the time everyone will agree with her. She is the favourite after all. 
Sometimes she’ll make the same jokes as me. Nothing is wrong then, but I can’t?

It’s not just me she’s unfair with, my older sister as well. Their ways are similar though. 

The reason I type this now is because of what she just did. I politely asked her multiple times if I could have four of her like 10 five dollar bills in exchange for a 20 so that I could donate for my school’s Terry Fox fundraiser. She refused because I had already donated before so to her there was no reason I should donate again. She keeps/kept demanding I not donate again because it’s “so pointless” “so stupid” etc. I don’t understand why. She won’t give a reason. Basically she thinks she should have a say over how I use my money (my anything really). At first I thought she was just like, kidding or something because she didn’t seem too serious so I asked her were her fives were and opened up the drawer where she kept them, took four and went to her door to get the 20 to replace them. She immediately freaked out and started hitting and kicking me. I went for the door and she closed it on my head. The door hit the spot where my ear attaches to my head (the top of it) and put a lot of pressure there. It really hurt and I felt dizzy for a few seconds. Long story short I took the fives, she started screaming at me, called my mom and said “she barged into my room and stole 20 dollars from me” and other things just twisting the story. I lost my cool at this point and yelled at her. There’s a bit more to that but I’ve already typed a novel to I won’t say anymore. 

I would like to confront her, without being the asshole that I am. I tried to before but she doesn’t care about what I say because she and my entire family will only ever look down upon me. The idea of what I want to say is “I’m no angel, but me and my sister aren’t that far apart on the asshole meter”. Thank you for reading.",30Sep2019,1

My friend John (25M) and myself (21F) met earlier in the year. I really like him as he is very chill and we get along great. A few months ago he tells me that he wants a friend's with benefits relationship with me and I agreed since I do like him and the seems interested. 

Friday, we met up again after months of not seeing each other. He immediately asks for a hug (John has never done that before). We end up having some edibles after that. I have never had weed before and he's been high a few times so he's explaining what I'll be feeling and possible side effects to me. After all of that, we start hanging out like normal, and he's feeling the effects of the edibles at this point. 

For some reason, he puts his arm around me. John has never done this before and it confused me since he's told me what he wants multiple times over. I asked him why and he explained that he just wanted to hold me, which was also very strange. At some point he starts complimenting me and is just being affectionate. 


I'm so confused about all of this, and I have no clue if that's just how he is with his female friends or he's doing this because of the FWB label. Or if he was just high and acting on the weed.",30Sep2019,1

In a year I’ll be 18 and allowed to move out without my parents consent. I want to live on my own or with a roommate, and I’d like to get my own car. I’m planning on going to school as well, but it won’t be very expensive as my dad has a disabled veteran discount that will get me into any state school tuition free. 

I have a good paying job that gives me raises frequently, I work about 10-15 hours a week but way more in the summertime, and an interest paying savings account that I deposit money into frequently. 

What do I focus on first? They’re all important goals to me. Two years from now as a freshman at college I won’t be able to keep a car, so I’m guessing that’ll come later. But if I were to move out next year, I’d need a car and I’d need to pay for insurance to get to school and work. I’d also need to pay rent and everything else.

136,"Ok so basically in July of this year I started working at a store that my best friend's family owns. Originally, I was thinking about quitting once school started. I am in college and am an engineering student, plus I participate in an engineering club at my school, am a martial arts student, and am in my school's orchestra, so my schedule is pretty busy, which was my reason for wanting to quit working once school started. My friend seemed pretty disappointed when I mentioned that I was thinking about not working during the school year. Because of this, I decided that I would work once a week. With my schedule, I cannot work more than this. I have responsibilities related to school, extracurriculars, and family responsibilities, as I am a commuter student that lives at home. The store has a relatively small staff, which means that she is scheduled to work almost every day of the week. Even now, during the school year, she is always working (sometimes more than 35 hours/ week). Every time I see her, whether it is at school in between classes, or at work, she is always complaining about how I am ""choosing"" not to work during the week, and how ""whatever I'm doing"" outside of school is ""unimportant"". Obviously, I care about her as we've been best friends since middle school. I care that she has an education to worry about, but it is not my responsibility to work more than I can so she can work less. I am not going to compromise my education and my future career for working at a temporary part time job. I am not going to quit my extracurriculars because according to her, they are not important. I am not sure how to deal with this situation, because I care about her, and I do not want to get involved in any drama.

137,"I (19m) work at a store and have been here for about a month now.  I didn't enjoy the work at first, but now I find myself despising it. 

About 2 and a half weeks in, my manager sat me down and told me i needed to perform better or else they wouldn't keep me. This was the first i heard of this because nobody had bothered to pull me aside and explain that i needed to do things differently until i had already been screwing up unknowingly for 2 and a half weeks.

I immediately cleaned up my performance and started working my ass off, still getting pulled aside  because i wasn't doing things properly ( days after they noticed), despite nobody informing me of a correct way. 

Then finally today, being only one of two people working my position, i became quickly slammed with work as tasks dropped in like crazy. The second person not  helping me in the slightest.  
    
I spoke with another manager about this, asking for help, to which he responded basically  saying i still have to get it all done alone.  So i thought that since they didnt show me a proper protocol for this particular task, there must not have been one. Wrong. What i was doing was far more efficient  and much less time consuming than the real protocol (the protocol  they informed me of after doing it wrong for 6 hours). So the big boss tried reaming me a new asshole and after i calmly explained the situation  and my reasoning, got even angrier.  

So i did it her way, and lo and behold, her way was so ineffecient that i missed multiple goal times after not missing a single one my way. Can you guess it? Yep. She got even angrier at me and said that if she has to speak to me again, im fired.

I have groups of “friends” but there’s multiple groups of them that I don’t feel like I really have any friends, no one I’m really constantly with through ups and downs. I feel as if I’m just that one guy that’s there, you like him but not to the point as if you’d do anything for them but not dislike them to totally ignore him.

139,"Hi Reddit, I'm a 19 [F] living in Canada. Let's get right into it:

I have a Sun-Fri job, 40 hrs a week, and I go to school 4 times a week, twice from 1-5ish, and twice from 1-8ish. I'm trying really hard to get into college to study computer science, and eventually go into neuroscience research.

I'm struggling really hard with exhaustion. Because of how early I start (4am) and where my classes are, I end up driving a total of 1hr a day, which is hard on me, and as a new driver and someone who lives in a snowy climate, I'm terrified that my exhaustion will cause me to get into an accident. I also have a lot of driving anxiety from being in accidents before. 

I have some testing with the armed forces for a position related to what I want to go to school for in about 3 weeks. I've been studying on and off, but even if I test well, it apparently may be a while before I get the job, but my parents are very understanding.

There are rooms upstairs that I'll be forced into. But I don't want to be forced out because my sister demands my space. I don't think that's fair. I have genuine issues with personal space and people invading it let alone getting kicked out of my own area for my sister and her kids.

145,"This is more sort of a cross between /r/careerguidance and /r/personalfinance but neither fit right.

Currently located in Asia, with a strong background in non-tech, while holdnig a CS degree from a respectable university.

Wife has 10 years of industry experience (employed for 10 years) as an engineer, and is being severely underpaid. Both explicitly for being a female, as well as just society's vibe here.

Rough estimates while looking on Glassdoor and speaking with people who hold her same position and do similar operations, lead me to believe she's making roughly 20% of what she could be making stateside, when salaries are adjusted for each respective economy. Money is important in this stage of our lives; mid-to-late 20's.

She's stayed at the same company, as it is considered ""the best"" and the ring of the name outweighs any other on a resume locally; we've been leaning towards moving stateside for better life opportunity, however.

I've got 2 years of industry experience in a tech position, which mostly held non-tech responsibilities/tasks locally. No experience stateside; moved after graduation. My passion lies in non-tech, and I'm confident with the right luck, I could secure a position stateside and work my way up from there. Currently unemployed, working on side projects that are tech-oriented to bolster my portfolio up more, and doing some freelance work here and there to fill in the gaps.

I am a US-born dual citizen, wife is a native of the country I'm in. She's clearly upset with the way her job's been going lately, and is sick of being paid a fraction of what she should be.

Is it worth putting in effort to get things in motion to move back stateside as soon as possible? 

Should I secure a position here temporarily, and *then* put in the effort to get things in motion to move stateside? I guess the reason I'm asking this advice in the first place is that it'd take some time to get things going if we really moved to the states. 

Looking to go to one of the coasts; potentially moving to NYC or the Bay Area or some tech-driven area, given wife's job. Not really wanting to move back if it's going to be some random town with no opportunity.

147,"This is a little long to explain, but I’ll try to make it as simple as possible. It’s a moral/integrity/being a good friend conflict that I’ve been struggling with. 

A colleague and I both have the same job. We are required to take a fitness test semiannually. In order to keep our jobs, we are required to maintain a very specific level of fitness that is higher than the average and must pass each various test. 

On our last fitness test, I was the counter for a colleague (I’ll call them A), and A was my counter. During a certain portion of the test, A failed to meet the requirements. I was unable to lie for A due to another colleague (B) challenging me when I was about to give my answer. (Essentially, without saying anything, B gave me look that either dared me to lie and help A out, or be truthful. I did not know what B wanted, and as much as I wanted to lie, I just didn’t feel right doing it and told the truth). 

This caused A to fail the test. I felt awful and apologized. A said they understood why I didn’t lie. 

A retook the test. I was not present. The counter for A lied and was immediately outed for it by B. Both A and the counter failed the test and the counter faced consequences. Not too serious, but it definitely hurt the counter’s reputation. I was glad I didn’t lie the first time as to seeing what happened. Fellow colleagues said I was in the wrong for not lying. 

A retook the test a third time. A failed, but the numbers were smudged so that A would pass as A would lose their career if they didn’t pass. 

A has had six months to work on the fitness portion that caused them to fail the first time. 

During a practice test, A failed the same portion again. A expects me to count for them again when we take the test in 3 weeks. A sees it as no big deal and always says it is my time to redeem myself. I expected A to be able to pass with flying colors seeing as they had six months to work on it. Seeing as how bad A did on the practice test, I am worried A will fail again. 

I am not comfortable lying for A. Or lying in general. I do not think it is fair that many other people work hard to pass these tests as our job and it’s nature requires us to be more fit. However, this job is very tight-knit and everyone looks out for each other. 

I want to look out for A and lie so that they will be able to keep their job. I also don’t want to lie. If I don’t lie, this community will view me as someone who doesn’t look out for colleagues. If I lie and get caught, I will appear to have no integrity. A expects me to count. I don’t know how to tell A that I do not want to count for them, and have very little leeway in taking the test without A. 

Do I count and face the possibility of lying? Do I count and be honest even if A fails? If I tell A I am not comfortable with counting, A will be upset with me and I feel like A won’t understand my moral reasons and I feel like I owe A since I didn’t lie the first time. It seems so trivial but both A and my career and reputation is on the line for this. 

TL;DR
I did not lie for a colleague (A) on a fitness test we take semiannually in which we have very specific requirements we are to meet. A expects me to count for them again in 3 weeks. In a practice test, A failed even though A had 6 months to work on their fitness. I am worried A will not pass and I am faced with lying for A or being truthful. I am not comfortable with lying, but A’s career is on the line. My reputation is also on the line for this, and possibly my career. What do I do?",30Sep2019,1

Ever since then, I’ve changed everything about myself. I’m working tirelessly to change everything about my life. I don’t go out with friends unless she agrees, I don’t get into any activities without her cooperation, and I’m basing my career and education on her responses. I do whatever she says without a question, and if I upset her I get immediately sick and I beg for her forgiveness.

And what looks like a good loving husband that takes care of his family.

Well.....

She sent me a friend request on facebook to my surprise. I accepted. Then soon after a PM. Wanting to talk and gave me her number.

Is an alcoholic.

Is getting a divorce.

Husband and her sleep in separate bedrooms.

Lost contact with her daughter.

Been to the hospital for multiple O.D.s

I told her. But this is what you wanted. 

I left you to have this life. You always wanted a family and a husband etc. 

I was wrong. I thought I wanted it. I really hate it and now it's too late.

I never married or had kids and I absolutely have no regrets. And I enjoy myself everyday. I'm actually excited to wake up every day lately. Lost almost 70lbs and about to start dating again. Life is great.

But......

Reason why I'm here is this. She's been sending me PM's on facebook. Wanting me to call her and chat.

But I don't want to. That's a part of my life I wanna let go and move on. I'm not there to save her. That's not my job. But I'm also afraid that I may be her last hope before she may do something really bad. Like suicide. She told me the only other person in life she ever loved other than her husband was me. We were each others 1st. With everything from 16 to 20. 

I'm 45 now. 

I was thinking of unfriending her on facebook and then blocking her. But I feel that would be too harsh for her. So I'm thinking of just ghosting her.

157,"I was reading on compulsive lying and it turns out lying typically stems from strict parents. I live with a single mother who is super strict. I'm guessing this is because she was raised as a Boomer. She's 72 (I was adopted-another story) and has very old-ish viewpoints, such as technology is bad, highkey Christian, doesn't like millennial-esque things, stuff like that. Most of all, she's totally strict. Whenever I have free time, she always makes me do housework or whatever. I have a gaming computer, but I haven't been on it in literal years because she hates it. I'm not allowed to have a social life outside of school and church (because apparently everyone at Church is a good person whereas school people are not) . Whenever I'm invited over to an event or a friend's house, it's always a no or no we have work to do. When I confront her on this, she always says that I lie to her so she can't trust me.

Lying has always been a problem for me. It started when I was around five. I remember lying about small things, and she not following up on them, just simply dropping it. As I got older, she got more strict and I started lying more. I lie about small things. For example, 

""Did you walk the dogs?""

""yeah.""

""No you didn't. There's sh\*t on the ground."" 

And

""Did you eat the sandwich I had in the fridge?""

""No""

""Yeah, you did. You were the only one home and I had it while you were at school.""

Then she'll go on a twenty minute rant about how much work she does to support us and how she hates liars. If I argue and say that I can't stop or something similar, I get slapped in the face or yelled at. Then she'll take my phone away, or something else. I lied about a large thing a month ago, and I haven't had my phone since. Now that my phone's gone, she has nothing to take away except for my jobs. I have 2 jobs that I absolutely love, but she says if I don't get my act together she'll force me to quit one of them, which I really don't want. Then she said that if I still continue, she will take my cat (who I absolutely love) back to the pound. And on top of that, I'm 17 1/2 and she won't let me drive because apparently she can't trust me not to take anyone home. About driving, she's a hypocrite. She won't trust me to get a ride with someone, but yet she's at least thirty minutes late to pick me up every day. Then she turns around and says she'll give anyone else a ride home if they need it. I just find that super hypocritical. She won't let me get rides home from my best friends, but yet she'll take home a random kid that just happens to need a ride. 

And then the next day she'll hug me and say how much she loves me. If I act cold because I'm still pissed, she gets pissed and says that everything's my fault and that I just need to change. I do love her, but it's hard to love someone when you replay all the mean stuff they say. My mom has said she hates me, wishes she had never adopted me, and she even says that I can commit suicide for all she cares (I got diagnosed with depression and anxiety, mostly due to her, so she knows of my suicidal tendencies and doesn't care) . So sometimes it's hard for me to love her. Yet, she's a hypocrite in this way because a long time ago I got super pissed and said ""Sometimes I really hate you."" Then she complained to everyone at church as to the fact that I said I hate her. I told her it was in a fit of anger, but she said that when people are angry, what they say is what they mean. But yet when I tell her this, she always says she didn't really mean it because she was upset.  

So Reddit, is this my fault? Mom says that I have to want to stop lying to really quit. I desperately want to stop, but it's almost like she sets me up for failure. She asks me so many questions about literally everything I do, and then I just can't help it. As soon as I open my mouth, a lie comes out. Then she digs up proof as to why I'm lying and yells at me and is pissed for the rest of the day. She tests me. She has even told me that she wants me to lie so she can prove me wrong. Then she says that I can move out when I'm 18 and make both our lives easier. 

How do I make our lives better? I guess my lying is my fault, but I just can't stop. My therapist isn't doing shit and it's hard to quit when she literally told me she wants me to lie just so she can dig up proof as to why I'm lying. I haven't told her about the strict parent stat because I'm afraid she'll go on a giant rampage as to why she's not strict, that it's my fault that I lie. I know every scenario before it even happens, so communication is a problem between us. I just want to know how to stop lying so maybe, just maybe we can develop some trust. And maybe I can get my phone back. 

Anyways- Thanks for reading this block of text. Any advice is very much appreciated. And don't be afraid to be critical of me- I know a lot of this is my fault.",30Sep2019,1
159,"So I haven't had to really ask someone on a date since before I was even 14 (I am now 20), which sparked my first long time relationship lasting til I was about to turn 18. Since then I have talked to other people, and was even consistent with one of them at least for a couple of months, but never declared anything. Even then I don't think I never was the one that had to ask first. Since then I really haven't involved myself with any dates, hookups, etc. I guess you can say I've been taking a cleanse from all of this. Truth is that last person and I... it was all toxic, mainly me to him, but I've been using all this time to improve myself in many ways, and I think I'm ready.

There has been someone who has been on my mind lately, and I would like to ask him on a date with me or something, just to get to know each other better, but I really don't know how to do it. Via message, in person? then what would I say? I really haven't had to do this in a long time.

I know I'm definitely over thinking this but I still feel like it's valid for me to talk about this. 

So this person is actually a pretty well known around our college campus, he's pretty involved, super smart, and really nice to everyone he meets and is always smiling. I feel like we know a lot of the same people. We even both see each other around campus a lot too and say hi when ever we can. It's not like we're strangers either, we have conversed every now and then.

So how should I do this? In person? I feel like they're always with someone whenever I see them. Message? (I have him on Facebook and instagram but he isn't very active on either) but I also feel like that's not the best approach. And how should I say it? What should I say? what would be a good first date idea if this does happen? I kinda just wanna ask first, then think of the details if they say yes. I really just want to do this right.

160,"I’m on mobile, all that good stuff. 

Just a bit of background - I’m a young single woman living alone for the first time. I don’t have any family around and not many close friends. 

The apartment directly next to me, well...they aren’t the best people. My building is all 1 bedroom apartments. I live alone with my dog. The people next to me have 3 adults and 2 young children (I would say the children are about 4ish) living there. Now that’s fine, I understand the financial struggle. 

But it’s pretty clear they are on some sort of drug, first of all. And maybe I’m wrong. But it’s constant foot traffic, leaving the house at weird hours, yelling and fighting, and the obvious “chemical” smell when they open their door. Maybe they aren’t on drugs, who knows. 

My issue is since the day I moved in 6 months ago, it’s been non stop loudness. Not music or anything. Them screaming and yelling at each other or the kids (inside or outside), getting in physical fights with each other (I have heard someone slam another person against a wall on 2 occasions). Their dogs are very aggressive and actually got out one day and rushed me and my 8 pound dog trying to attack us...luckily the older gentleman who lives there came down and got them inside but it was still terrifying. So now it gives me so much anxiety to even walk my own dog. It’s just constant yelling and violence. It could be 2 PM, 3 AM, 9 AM, just all hours of the day. I constantly lose sleep because of them. As a young woman with only a tiny dog, it does make me nervous to leave my apartment at night when they are fighting. I have called the apartment office once because they left their 2 dogs on the patio for 6 hours when it was 102 degrees out. Now they just only let them on the patio on Sunday’s because the office is closed (again for over 6 hours). I don’t want to be a “snitch” but this is driving me insane!

I do have a security camera inside my apartment.

Am I being paranoid? Or what should I do? I understand these things come with renting but I feel like I should be able to walk my dog or go to my car without fear of their dogs or them having a violent confrontation. Am I wrong?",30Sep2019,2

Your help would be very much appreciated as this is a significant stress.

I had personal information (phone number, name, address) removed from a website for security reasons some time ago - said website were very helpful in removing my details and I believed it was gone... until last night. The wayback machine came to mind and I had a massive ""oh shit"" moment. I quickly copy and pasted the link from the website containing my personal information into the engine and sure enough, all my information is there to be seen from captures before the deletion - which for me and my family is quite scary.

What I want is for my information to be not visible via the wayback machine.

Based on what I've read on other forums, what I should do is contact the website owner of where my info was listed and ask them to request wayback to remove all old info from their site so my details will be invisible.

Would this be the right course of action and do you have any wisdom/experience to impart that may help?

Downtown is the main one which has the worst problem. I enjoy working at my job sometimes,  but this is a serious issue that the store supervisor (ss) or operations manager (om) seem to care about. We talked to the ss about it and they said (I kid you not) ""Every store has their own problems"". I am kind of a manager, and my co-workers (I never call them employees) are getting fed up with the bed bug issue because nothing is ever done. Volunteers that help as a community service have told me (they sleep at the downtown HQ/store), allegedly, that sometimes they wake up with bed bugs crawling on them... That is unacceptable to me. I am extremely close to anonymously contacting the Department of Health. Here is the problem. While it may be anonymous, I am paranoid that the higher ups may ask to transcripts, hear the phone conversation, or whatever to see if a rival thrift store is spreading lies, etc. I am on good terms with everyone. I just don't want to be discovered because I feel nobody would ever hire someone that called Dept. of Health. The worst part, they have a room that they put clothes in that gets hot to the point that it kills the bed bugs. The volunteers tell me, it hasn't worked for a long time.

So as a very brief backstory, I (M,28) got out of a relationship of nearly 10yrs (was engaged, she cheated before the wedding, I broke up, etc) about 6 months or so ago and I'm still living in the same house we mutually rent until the lease is up in the next couple months. I've got to really know, a somewhat recently single friend(F,32) of my closest friends, very well and have slowly developed feelings for her. Over the past few months we've hung out on and off, with the majority of time being in group settings, but she's recently told me (multiple times now) to move in with her in order to help the both of us out and that she wouldn't make such an offer to just anyone. I told her I would closer to the end of the lease but I fear with my feelings for her I'd screw things up for myself or make things awkward.

Every day all I can seem to focus on is my anger and disappointment. I go online and I see so many things that completely infuriate me, so I get off my phone and try to go do something productive like run an errand, but everyone around me just completely annoys the hell out of me, so I go home and try to unwind and be alone with my thoughts and all I can think of are the things that I’m angry about. I feel like I can’t escape it. I’ve tried therapy, I’ve tried to meditate, I’ve tried just about everything and can’t seem to make it better no matter what I do. And it’s starting to really affect my way of life. It’s lead to bad depression and anxiety problems. I tried medication and it didn’t really resolve the problem. 

It’s like I can not be happy, at all. I see the people around me who were basically handed what they want in life with no effort while I struggle and I get so angry with the unfair way life is. I harbor so much resentment towards my family and friends who have screwed me over, I sit in fear of the future and depressed about my past. I see some of my friends who are so laid back and calm and zen and I envy them so much although I don’t outwardly show it to them. 

I have a friend who is everything I wish to be with her way of thinking. Very laid back, sees all the best in people, cares so much about everyone around her, has so much compassion for everybody, hardly ever gets angry or noticeably upset, tries to find a positive in every situation. She’s very into nature and yoga and has so much self confidence. I wish so badly I could have this way to thinking.

But we just laugh and shrug it off because there's nothing we can do about his lack of self awareness. It's just a really annoying trait he has but he's our friend so we just deal with it and love him regardless and him thinking he's better than us holds no value to anyone so it doesn't even matter to us anyway.

Sorry for the long explanation but I just had to explain this type of person so that you know what I'm dealing with here.

Anyway, we went camping the other day with a group of friends (including the 'dumb' one which I will now refer to as John) and we had drinks and smoked weed. However, John didn't drink or smoke because he was the one driving us home in the morning. So I was completely drunk and stoned out of my mind but I usually don't like making it obvious just incase I irritate people so everyone thought I was completely sober. And I came up with the brilliant idea of having a fun debate with John. I asked him to think of a topic I would disagree with him on so that I could completely shut him down and let him know he's not as smart as he thinks. 

Anyway we found a topic and started debating. As stoned as I was, I still felt 100% confident and was so ready to just shut him down. As soon as he started speaking it gave me even MORE confidence to shut him down due to him making statements that perfectly set me up to dismantle everything he said. But due to me being on planet fucking mars. I lost track of everything he was saying and kept somehow changing the subject and not making any sense and sounding like an idiot. John began to dominate the conversation and I looked over to my right and my friend whispered to me ""he's kinda destroying you right now"". Which angered me so much. We argued a bit more after that and I feel like I started winning towards the end but I could be completely delusional, after all I barely remember any of it because of how stoned I was.

So it's been a day now and when I think about the argument we had. I cannot believe how stupid I was. I am constantly coming up with hundreds of things that I could've said back to him to absolutely destroy him and it's driving me CRAZY. I'm literally getting the urge to hit myself. Which I am. I'm literally hitting my head out of frustration because this extremely ignorant and cocky guy just bet me in an argument and gained even MORE arrogance and everyone was there to see it and no body knew I was literally high and drunk while arguing with him. I just don't know how to cope with this frustration.

I could easily bring it up again but would it seem like I'm just trying to have a rematch after being defeated? Like what the hell do I do to redeem myself, this is so humiliating.

183,"Background: K and I met during the first few years of undergrad and we were friends. I had a boyfriend but broke up with him at the end of my sophomore year. At this point, I thought I would be transferring to a different school for my last two years of undergrad and let the people around me know. K called me one night drunkenly and told me to come over (I couldn't because I was visiting my parents), admitting that he had always thought I was attractive but didn't want to be a ""homewrecker"" because I was dating someone. That summer, we started a sexual relationship, understanding implicitly that it was a fling because I would be transferring. For financial reasons, I ended up staying at the school I was at. A lot of the times when we hooked up we were drinking, and I know that tipsy me insinuated too hard that I wanted more from the arrangement than just sex. After summer ended, he cut things off, telling me that he ""wasn't ready for a relationship"". He proceeded to get into a relationship with another girl (we can call her B) just a few months later, which led to some hostility/bad blood between me and him, and to me doubting myself and my attractiveness, and feeling like he probably only wanted to hook up with me because he thought I would be leaving. K and B ended up breaking up because she moved to another state. 

A few years passed. K and I would sometimes run into each other at bars and make small talk. The instance I remember the most is when I ran into him and we talked about how we both had plans to go to law school. At the end of our conversation, I lightheartedly told him that I hoped he didn't hate me after everything. I then went and rejoined my friend group. He found me a little bit later and asked me if he could talk to me. We went to a corner and he told me he didn't hate me at all, and that he really didn't want me to think that. He explained that at the time he just didn't want to get into anything serious, and I asked him why he got with B then. He sighed and said that hadn't been a good idea either. After this my memories are fuzzy and don't remember much else of what was said, but my friends told me that every time he tried to get closer to me I would flinch away and look hurt. 

Fast forward to admitted students day at my law school. I went the whole day without seeing him, and finally at the end of the day, during a happy hour, I looked up and there he was. Somehow, I wasn't even surprised, as a small part of me secretly indulged in the idea that somehow we would end up at the same law school. I didn't end up saying anything to him that day, but we both knew that the other had gotten into this school and would likely attend.

School started a few weeks ago and since there are six class sections, I figured that there would be a low chance he would be in my section. He ended up being in my section and I have almost all of my classes with him. 

I've started thinking about him again and it's distracting me from everything. When members of our class go out to bars to drink and I run into him, I can feel my eyes getting all cloudy with lust when he's talking to me. In class, I worry about if he thinks the things I say are thoughtful and intelligent. When I lie in bed and close my eyes to sleep, I create different scenarios where he makes a move on me. 

It's so hard to explain everything in this one post. When we were seeing each other for that summer the chemistry was so incredible. We had the exact same sense of humor and it felt like we were great friends and not just people hooking up with each other. I feel so pathetic for clinging to something that happened three years ago now, but I see him constantly and I know that I want him even though he's just K and I shouldn't want this. He's had a poker face the whole time we've been at law school; I have no idea if he wants me or even still finds me attractive and I want to know. I just remember the hurt I feel when he ended things, how ugly and disgusting I felt, and it scares me away from doing anything. My close law school friends know he's my ex and that I'm still attracted to him, but not that it's affecting me like this.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, and I'd be happy to answer any questions if it's helpful.

My name = u/Packanack 
Girl I like = A

So I liked this girl that’s in the grade below me, I’m in eight grade, she’s in seventh and I tried to keep it low key because I was still figuring out what to do with my feelings. One day someone says
 “I know who you like, u/Packanack” and I didn’t believe them for shit so I said
 “Okay then, who?” And she responded by telling me I like a seventh grader. I was honestly shocked that somehow she knew but I never admitted to it being true. Fast forward a week or so this seventh grader goes up to me and asked me if I was u/Packanack and I said yes, what I was not expecting is what she said next,
“Do you like A?” I tried to play it off as cool as possible by implying that I have no idea who that is. The next day I notice a lot of Seventh graders staring at me and two of them even walked passed me and asked if I liked A while giggling I didn’t respond because I was already talking to my friend. So basically now everyone knows that I like this seventh grader and it’s very likely that the girl I like knows I like her and I don’t know what to do next.

188,"This is sort of a long story, so I apologize in advance. TL:DR at the bottom.

My best friend since elementary school (now both 23F) and I used to love this little unknown band. We went to two of their concerts and had a great time.  It was fangirling and getting together for these concerts  as dorky high schoolers that truly cemented our friendship. With life and becoming adults, we’ve had some rocky times since then, and have hard feelings towards one another now and again. but have remained best friends. Fast forwarding to current times, our band that we loved had broken up and reformed, and were now going to be in concert in our city again! We were both excited, but she was way more stoked than me (I really don’t care for their new music). I was still interested in seeing them again more or less for the sake of nostalgia. Friend comes up with the idea that we should get VIP meet and greet tickets and get pictures with the band. Okay, I’m a bit past the point of really caring about meeting them or having my picture taken with them, and kind of feel awkward about it. But I figure what the hell, it will be a new life experience. 
I go ahead and order the tickets on my card, snapping up good seats for us as soon as they go on sale. Regular seats without vip would have been $20... with vip we were looking at more like $140 or so each. A bit of a hit to the funds, but that’s okay, this is a one time deal, and I know my friend will pay me back for her ticket so I won’t be out $280. 
The day comes for our concert... we end up snowed in. She is stuck on the other end of the state, and we aren’t able to go. Alrighty. Time to try to get a refund. 
Refund is a no go. 
So, it sucks that we basically threw that much money into the wind, but such is life, and I tried not to get too bent out of shape about it. 
Now, this was in April.... and I haven’t heard anything from my friend about owing me money or giving me the money she owes. She is generally super honest and  pays me back for anything owed within a fairly reasonable amount of time. Time kind of went by and I forgot about it on and off, but it’s been lingering more and more in my mind lately.
Here’s the kicker to this whole deal- I make about twice as much money as her, and am in a WAY better place financially. I basically got a free ride through college from my parents, went on to my field that makes around $24,000/year (not a huge salary in the grand scheme of things, but enough that I have a good savings considering I still live at home), and was able to buy a brand new 2019 car this year for $30,000, paying it off entirely right away with savings from the past four years. I’m also adopting a puppy into my home, which will obviously be a financial responsibility. My friend knows most of this, though is under the impression that I have a loan on the car. The past several months she has been making TONS of comments about what a poor place she is in financially, as she went to college on her own dime, and then ended up not going into a field, instead working a job in a small store for less than $10/hr, in addition to a couple part time jobs. Similar to me, she also has the financial responsibility of multiple pets, and will be needing to put money into a new car soon as well.  She has also been on and off depressed for the past few years, similar to my own experience, which doesn’t help make the situation any better.

I am now struggling with what to do. A person separate from the whole thing keeps asking me if I’ve gotten the money from my friend, and making me feel like I’m being used, because $140 is a lot of money to just not pay someone back. On the other hand, I haven’t financially noticed the absence of that money, while my friend very likely would. I’m at a point where it would be super awkward to suddenly bring up that she owes me money, with it being so long ago that we planned to go the the concert, and also with her just recently seeing how much more ‘successful’ I am financially because of my buying a brand new car. I don’t really know what to do anymore. I feel sick feeling used and letting it go, and I also feel sick and like a bad friend for not letting it go.  Any advice you guys can offer would be amazing and I appreciate whatever you have to say in the matter!

TL;DR: bought expensive tickets, knowing I would be paid back. Concert was a no go, and so was a refund. Friend has not mentioned anything about paying me back, leaving me in an awkward situation because I make more money (I’m not rich in ANY sense of the word though), and she knows that because I just bought a new car.

190,"I was at an event a couple weeks ago, and there was a guy there from out of town singing and playing guitar. He was amazing, and I went and “liked” his Facebook music page later that night. The next day, he messaged me, and we started texting. He asked if he could take me on a date, and I agreed. We’ve been texting every day since, and our date is coming up.

He seems great. Good looking, funny, we have a lot in common, etc. But maybe it’s because I watch a lot of Dateline and crime shows, that I’m a little nervous about going out with someone I’ve never really met and who I have no mutual friends with.

194,"I know little about Instagram. I use it for my business and am still learning, and really only experiment with hashtags and creating a following. My son (13-yr-old) uses Instagram to chat and video chat with friends. I guess, sometimes he live streams. Either way, he was a part of a group conversion or chat (forgive me if I don't know the proper names for these features).

Either way, he was using the family computer on Instagram and was in a group conversation. He got off the computer, but he never logged out or left the group, so the other people in this group chat kept on talking. Long after my boy left. I'm a parent, and--from time-to-time--I snoop around a bit. Try to side that side of my kids they don't show me or I'm too blind to see.

I discovered the students he was talking to started talking about shooting up the school. CLEARLY JOKING. It was in poor taste, but this was not a serious conversation about seriously shooting up a school. I see a lot of ""edgy"" memes joking about school shootings, so I'm thinking this isn't a big deal. It must be a generational thing. I mean, South Park said it takes 22.3 years for something to be funny, which is actually funny, and might just be true. I don't know. I was a senior in 1999 and Columbine rocked the country pretty hard. 

That same year after the Columbine Massacre, I was involved in a situation where I chucked a water balloon down the senior hallway at a friend of mine. We were fucking off, as we were a few weeks out from graduating. One of the administrators saw me throw the balloon, and it became a big deal and I was nearly suspended. This was in the shadow of Columbine, so I learned things had changed and that point in American history along with my water balloon antics just didn't jive. It was in poor taste and just bad judgement. My bad.

Either way, my wife and I are trying to decide what to do about this. I don't know these kids. I've never had them over, so I don't know their parents. I really want to contact their parents and just let them know what their kids are joking about online. Heads up type of thing. Let's not make too much of a big deal about this type of thing. Or, I can take it for what it is, jokes. That fucking edgy humor we all love, and just take to my son about it (even though he wasn't apart of this conversation but technically was still in the room or group--whatever the fuck you call it on Instagram).

This is what is bothering me. I know these are jokes. These kids are just insensitively joking around about shooting up a school and how they won't shoot each other, and also joking about bombing the school and shit. It's really one student leading the charge with these jokes and the others are just playing along, throwing in comments and just fucking around. I get that. What bothers me is that whenever there is a school shooting or a mass shooting, we hear about all these warnings signs that went unnoticed. 

If there is a one percent chance this kid or any of these kids get involved with a shooting, I'd be the one who saw the warning sign and didn't say anything about it. I know it wouldn't be my fault, but it's not something I'd feel comfortable living with. Honestly, I'd feel like a fucking ass, and know I cost people's children their lives. 

Speaking of feeling like an ass, I don't want to drag these kids through the mud and create unnecessary problems for them them, their family, school administration, and even law enforcement all over some comments that really are jokes, just jokes about subject matter that shouldn't be joked about. When I grew up, I was taught never to scream ""fire"" in a crowded place or even mention ""bomb"" on an airplane. Part of me thinks this logic applies to gun violence, considering it seems like there are mass shootings happening weekly in America and around the world.

This is long enough. What should I do? Try to contact the parents and talk to them? Do nothing and just talk to my son about it? Contact the school administration? Contact law enforcement? Contact the school and the place? 

Thanks, guys.",30Sep2019,3
195,"I'm in a very complicated and frustrating situation right now after taking in my good friend to live with me after nearly becoming homeless. She was desperate and found some guy on a sugar daddy website and was about to go live with him when this happened so I took her in instead and signed a lease in a new apartment with her. Unfortunately, her extreme depression and social anxiety has prevented her from getting a job so she kept talking to this man she met online to get money for rent. At first I accepted it because you do what you have to and I couldn't afford it all but this has gone so far. This man took her on a week long trip to Colorado and after that trip they have become inseparable to the point where he doesn't even leave our apartment for work. He works remotely and they stay locked in her room day in and day out. I barely see her, I barely get messages back from her. I have no idea what happened, what he said to make her thoughts on him change so quickly. From the few times I've heard from her these past 2 weeks she talks like she's in love with this man, he's like twice her age and they've only known each other for a few months and they even met in such a desperate situation on such a terrible website.   


I am at a loss for what to do. She won't talk to me about what's going on and if I mention it she just breaks down and gets pissed or starts crying. The fact that I don't trust this man and he's in my own home for so long has been stressing me out so much that I end up going off on her when I do manage to get contact and telling her to get him out of my house, calling her an idiot, etc. I know this is the wrong approach and I try to be calm but this is getting to me. I know for a fact that he is giving her money and drugs and she gives him sex, and while they both claim it's not coerced I'm seeing no reason to believe them. I'm under the impression that despite him claiming such good intentions, just helping someone, he's still getting what he wanted out of this and he is now even forcing an emotional dependency on top of the financial one.   


I had to threaten them just to get this man to come out of the room and talk to me about what he's doing and what he's trying to get out of this. Of course he talked like he only had good intentions, saw a girl on this website and wanted to keep her away from worse guys and is staying to help with her extreme separation anxiety and other mental problems. I believed him at first but he just never left. He is still here. I'm almost ready to call the police and get them both arrested for the drugs just to get this man out of my house but I don't want her to hate me and run off to live with this guy instead. They even both know I had a crush on her for quite a while and still refuse to respect the fact that I just want them to do this shit somewhere else so I don't have to come home every day seeing the car of the man fucking her across the hall.  


This is such a miserable thing for me right now and I am not sure whether to just deal with this shit and help my friend get into a better mental state or just accept that she doesn't give a fuck about me and end this now. I worked so hard to keep her in a safe situation and put myself into a lease with her because I trusted her and  wanted to help so just giving up on this sounds so terrible. However I'm not sure how long my own mental state can deal with her damn near cutting me off for the very guy I was trying to save her from. This is not normal for her at all, she pushes people away after just a few days to be alone but they even sleep in the same bet without more than a few minutes apart for the past few weeks. I'm afraid he is guilting her into only having contact with him and using this to manipulate her into liking him, getting so incredibly attached to someone so quickly is not reasonable otherwise.  


I guess my main question is: Can I save her from this? If so, what can I do? If not, do I just give up and leave her to her own mistakes? Do I just suffer through, knowing she is going through some serious mental problems and incapable of making good decisions? Any push gets double the push back from her but the longer I wait the more this man gets his grip on her.",30Sep2019,3
196,"Warning. Really long post ahead. My friends dated for about a year, and I was close with both of them for a few years before that. Their relationship was pretty toxic, and as much as I love my friend Amy, she was absolutely horrible to her boyfriend Jake. That relationship brought out the worst in her. She’s struggling with abuse at home and mental illness, and whenever things are difficult for her, she would take it out on Jake. He’s a very sweet person, but he undervalues himself and loved her too much to do anything about the way she treated him.

To me and everyone else, Amy was a super nice and easygoing person. She treated Jake differently than any of us, and he became her emotional punching bag. As he was my friend as well, it was clear how much this affected him. Every day he would come into school looking absolutely miserable. If I talked to him outside of school or said anything about my personal life, she would become extremely jealous and it would start fights between them. Eventually she asked for my advice, and I told her the truth. She needed to change the way that she treated him or she was going to lose him.

She broke up with him this summer (publicly in front of his friends after shaming him for his weight and personality) and said she no longer loved him. I started started hanging out with Jake again because I wanted to help him through this and I no longer had to worry about making my friend jealous. This wasn’t something I tried to hide. I also hung out with Amy throughout the summer. Every time Jake and I hung out, she would call him and ask if we were dating. I learned she did this with every girl he talked to. She wouldn’t respect any boundaries he attempted to create after the breakup, and he was basically her supportive boyfriend/punching bag all over again. She tried hooking up with a few other guys and eventually made her way back to Jake a few weeks later, and they dated again. I called her and told her she shouldn’t date him until she works on herself because she’ll fall right back into the patterns she did just weeks before, and she flipped out on me. They ended up breaking up that same night because Jake’s friends gave him the exact same speech I gave Amy. She apologized for talking to me the way she did and said she would take my advice. The thing about her though is that she’ll say she’s going to listen to your advice, but never acts on it.

Now, she’s leading him on again. They’re technically broken up, but they kiss, go out on unofficial dates, he drives her around everywhere, and he is her emotional support. The other day, he brought up plans we made and she invited herself to go with us. I now feel like I have to invite her anywhere we go so she doesn’t get mad at him. Tonight I tried calling him because we haven’t seen each other in a while and she saw the call, so she texted me and  asked if I had feelings for him. She even tried saying her sister was the one who texted me, but admitted to lying about it.

I don’t know what to do. Amy’s my friend and I get that she’s going through a rough time, but Jake is my friend too. She treats him horribly. He teases me like he would a sister, and she tries to make him feel guilty or cruel for the way that he is with me. When they were together, he told me he didn’t feel comfortable talking to me like we used to because she’d feel insecure if I confided in him but not with her. I hate the person she’s becoming and she’s just pretending to be better towards him and to herself, but nothing has improved. I can’t confront her without fear that she’ll hurt herself or break down, but she’s hurting Jake and I can’t stand to sit and watch while she does it.

I haven’t responded to her text that she sent tonight. She apologized for texting me, but I don’t know what to say in response or where to go from here. What do I do?",30Sep2019,1
197,"A young relative (17, 18 in November) and his younger (still in HS) girlfriend are expecting and upon their 20 week ultrasound it was discovered that their little girl is going to be born with birth defects and possibly Down syndrome. Both of them are devastated. I know for a fact that his parents will not be able to help and support him and his little family as my grandmother has had custody of him since he was a really young child (for reasons involving drugs and neglect). My grandmother has taken care of most of us all for the same reasons, but at her advancing age (70) I don't know how much she can help if she is also caring for another one of my relatives almost daily, all day.  The girl's mother is a drunk that makes the father, my relative, drive her around on the weekends in order for him to have any contact at all with her daughter. The mother of the girl hates my relative for having a baby with her daughter and is constantly at odds with him and creating turmoil in the already newly complicated relationship. I am not sure how much support she can provide. 

I really have good intentions here, I'm not trying to say that they should not have their baby or that they are incapable of being good parents, but I do feel like it would be a lot for them to handle. My relative just graduated high school last June, his girlfriend doesn't graduate until next year. My husband and I are in a position to be able to care for and love their baby, without removing them from her life, of course. It is just something we have been tossing around for a few days to each other with growing fondness and enthusiasm. This whole situation just hits me in my heart because we have our own little baby girl and we got so lucky with her, I don't want to see me my relative and his girlfriend struggle to give their baby a good life. I think if they had to rely on anyone else that it would not be healthy for the couple and definitely not healthy for their little baby. 

Please tell me how we can tell them that our hearts and home are open to their child, if they need us. I already have a bunch of things for her when she arrives that I intend to give to them, but I would happily keep it all just the same. I want them to know they can still be mommy and daddy. I want them to know we can give her care and have insurance and the maturity and ability to give her anything she would need, but I also don't want them to feel hounded or pressured.

200,"So, when I started university this year I met a girl, we were both scared of uni and didn't have any friends in this new environment. Time went on, and we became really close friends, and it's been like 5 months since we became talking all the time, every day. We chat all day, and at night we always do video calls. She has a boyfriend who she loves, and recently they turned into a two year relationship, but lately, she's kinda fed up with him or at least that's what she tells me, because when they meet she seems completely fine and in love with him.  
Her parents are very abusive and overprotective (she's 19 but they treat her like if she was 14), and they don't let her spend time with basically no one other than his bf, and that hurts, because it feels like I'm being treated like a piece of shit and I've never done anything to deserve that.  
Anyways, we started sexting a couple months ago which then turned into ""sex video calls"" (I guess that's what they're called), which then turned into some sexual play in my car, whenever we could have time together without her parents knowing it. I guess we were ""friends with benefits"" as some people say, but the problem is that I started having feelings for her, and that turned into heavy anxiety and depression. I haven't been able to keep a healthy sleep habit because no matter how hard I try, I cant fall asleep before 5 am. This has been happening to me for well over a month now.  


Last Thursday we did some things in my car and that night she told me that basically we have to stop what we are doing because ""It was getting out of hand"" and she ""didn't want to hurt her boyfriend"". I got a little bit sad, because I really liked it and I love her, but I accepted it (or at least I thought I did), and I moved on. But boy, I was wrong, ever since Friday I can't stop thinking about her and about that thing that happened in my car, it's constantly replaying over and over again in my head and it's seriously fucking me up. I spoke with my therapist about this, and she told me that I should speak to her and tell her how I feel, but I honestly think that's not going to end up well and it's going to ruin any chances of me being with her. I don't know if I'm stupid to believe this, but I have this hope that maybe if I just hold on a little longer, she may end the relationship with her bf and maybe decide to be with me, but I don't know. I just want some advice on what I should do...  


TL, DR: I met a girl in uni, became very close friends, but we only spend little time because of her overprotective parents. She cheated on her bf with me, I fell in love with her, and I don't know what to do.",30Sep2019,3

a couple days ago i was at my friends house and we had come home from the homecoming game. it was late at night and i texted my dad asking him if i could stay over. he didn’t answer and i started to get worried to the point where i almost cried thinking he had died or something. i shouldn’t be thinking thoughts like that and idk why i do. 

it only started recently, it never used to happen. if he didn’t answer my text i’d simply brush it off and give it time, but now i can’t handle not being texted back bc i start to think things like that.

'Stan' is the last person I'd call sexist as he's been an advocate for battered women, a mediator, and the guy you go to for help. 

I called 'Amy' out on this and explained to her that 'Stan' isn't sexist. She says they were all joking and it's okay.

I was there for the entire conversation, and I didn't hear any humor, a giggle, the possible hyperbole, or the punchline. Just awkward silence and one person quietly agreeing.

207,"I am a 24 (f) mom to a 1 1/2 year old daughter. I was with my daughters father up until recently. We split up around 6 months ago and he hasn’t seen her since. We had got into an argument none other than we’ve been in before and his things was always to get up and leave every time things became overwhelming for him. So he did this, at 5am and snuck out of the house, but this time moved out and is now renting somewhere else. 

He has yet to see his daughter, in the beginning I had told him if were choosing not to be together we need to come up with a visitation schedule because I don’t want inconsistency in our daughters life. He demanded I bring the baby to him (55 minutes away) because “he works and on his days off he’s busy” oh also, before this split he got a DUI so he can’t drive.
I was receiving nothing but abusive text messages, threats to get custody of her etc. 

I told him that HE chose to leave so he can find ways to see his daughter, Uber, Lyft, Bus, Train, friends etc. he has yet to do any of these to see his daughter and still demands I take him to her, because it’s “easier for everyone” I am not keeping her from him and had made this clear, I told him that he can see her here at my house or we can meet somewhere nearby. He refuses and makes excuses not to. 

6months later, the name calling and everything has stopped and now I’m receiving text messages begging me to take his daughter to him, and telling me he loves us and his daughter and if he can please see her. He sent me some money for “gas” to get her down there, but I stood my ground. He can see her here at the house or we can meet close by. He said I was being petty and lazy, and why can’t I just let him see his daughter. 

I know he won’t be consistent in her life unless I’m the one taking her to him and I don’t want that. I’m a little conflicted because I feel bad for him, and my daughter. He has no one but he’s done this to himself. I also feel sad for my daughter future. I don’t know what to do.

221,"i posted on r/chefit as well.

there's going to be two questions in here so i'm sorry if this is kinda long.

i'm a senior in high school and super worried. Since I was around 11, I started to cook myself basic meals and it has slowly evolved to more complex and time consuming dishes. This year, I decided to take a culinary class that my school offers and I love it. I admire the chef with his stories, harsh, yet loving fatherly character, and passion for food. Even though I knew some of the basic techniques/skills before he taught it, I still loved every second of it and it is one of the only classes that I'm excited to go to every day. I procrastinate calculus homework to watch cooking videos he has on our website and just scroll through the cooking subreddits to see dishes and what it's like working in the industry.

Taking this class has made me want to quit my dream of going into medical school and take on the challenge of the restaurant industry. I know I will get low wages, terrible hours, etc but being in the kitchen makes me feel something different. I feel like my mentality is totally different when I walk in, but in a good way. I know many will say to work in a restaurant before you pursue it or even consider culinary school (PLEASE DO NOT COMMENT don't go to culinary school I have my reasons) but I currently cannot work because of my class schedule. However, I'm planning on working at a local restaurant when I'm in college to ensure my decision.

I know I will most likely get a dishwasher job from the start but I'm willing to do it. The chef gives us jobs on what to clean (i.e dishes, mopping, wiping, or sweeping) in the kitchen to give us the experience and know that cleaning is just as important as cooking. I would rather not work for a corporation since I want the money to stay local but would you advise against it? Would wages/hours be better if I worked corporate? Should I work in fine dining from the start?

also, we have to turn dishes in by the end of the class period and my anxiety levels goes higher than the amount of debt the US has. I can barely finish dishes and I never like the end product taste. Do you all have any advice on how to get it done faster? will I just learn over time? we're making grits and getting to experiment with different herbs/spices if that helps. We use milk and I heat it up before putting in the grits so it can cook faster and put it on low medium so the milk does not burn. Chef gave us a piece of paper of what we could put in it (he made it regional so we could make it ""French"", ""Japanese"", ""Indian"", etc tasting) but never the amount.

thank you if you got this far.",30Sep2019,1

I don't understand why he chose someone whose body type, race, and weight from the very beginning (4 years ago) wasn't his thing. This was the last button that was pushed on my already dwindling mental state as I was having health and work issues. Ended up in the mental hospital for about a week after the shock wore off and I cracked. I've had and still am in therapy, and most days I feel like I've accepted it all and I actually forgive him because I cannot hate for the sake of my soul and wellbeing.

And I was truly blinded sided by someone who was always supportive and complimentary of my looks. Now I hear he didn't even love me. I thought I was doing so good at healing and getting over this!

Tldr: I don't trust other people's intentions anymore. It's too much of a gamble to romantically love anyone.

I can't use my credit or PayPal bc my parents have access too it if they saw an in app payment to one of these sites they'd be suspicious af. Not to mention voice changers are not very convincing. I have a friend that would make a phony call if I asked them but I don't want to involve anyone in my endeavors. I turn 18 in may idk what to do at this point I do not want to end things with my boyfriend. I live in California with strict consent rules until you're 18.",30Sep2019,0
243,"I was watching the football game in the living room and it turned out to be a close game (lions vs chiefs GO LIONS!). It was like 1 minute left and the chiefs were marching down, I will admit I was probably more into the game then whatever she was talking to me about. She asked me if she could use the TV and I told her in a minute the game is almost over. She agreed very annoyed and then it went to commercial break with like 30 seconds left, she had enough and got the remote changing the channel, I tried to get the remote back since the game was almost over and I was getting into it a lot. We basically had a tug of war over the remote, I was able to yank it out of her hand and she called me a dickhead, once I changed the channel, and yet again the lions pulled a lions and lost on a last second play. I was pissed that she changed the channel and that we lost the game. I yelled at her and called her a bitch before storming off to my room to regather myself after the loss. About 5 minutes later my mom comes in and says I can either get grounded or apologize to my sister, I tried to tell her my side of the story but she wasn't having it. I told her just to ground me cause I wasn't apologizing. I don't feel like I need to apologize for anything unless she also apologies. She changed the channel and tho what I said was rude, she has called me a dick head so I feel like it was fair.",30Sep2019,1
244,"Hey guys, 

29 year old male. I thought I was having a heart attack or stroke last Monday but it turned out to be a panic attack. Literally came out of nowhere, I was having a good day. My sister struggles with anxiety but I’ve never experienced any weird symptoms or anything close to what happened. 

What worries me is that since Monday (now Sunday) I’ve had tight chest, shortness of breath, bodies been tingly and been feeling like I have vertigo. I took the week off of work but have honestly showed no progress. The doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin, but I don’t think it’s doing a whole lot. I was about to have another attack it felt like and I took Xanax (also prescribed this but said only use for attacks). I felt really good almost 80% my normal self after using Xanax but I know it’s short term not long term. 

I get that I have anxiety now, but I can’t lessen these symptoms for the life of me. Anyone experience anything similar that can lend some helpful tips??",30Sep2019,2
245,"I (m,22) recently had my partner (NB, 19) of a few months go from ""I love you, let's never be apart"" to ""I cant talk to you, I'm doing this for me because you bring too much stress into my life"" within the span of 2 hours. They were more than just an attachment or someone I thought I was in love with - they were a part of me. I helped pack their mother up when she moved to Detroit, leaving only me and their roommates to in this state to be their for them. And I was. I sold some of my clothes, I sold my personal mattress (I just lost my job, and didnt want to be a financial burden), just so I could take her to see a movie or buy food to eat. Nothing was never nothing when it was something with them. 

And now, i have just been released from the hospitals crisis center. 

After the split, the next day I figured I'd go visit some friends out of town, have a drink or two, just try to relax and cope with losing them and my job, on the same day. After being there for about 2 hours, having more than a few drinks, I started to panic, have suicidal thoughts and want to hurt myself. So I called them, and they didnt answer, but I left a voicemail apologizing and saying goodbye. They then called me back and accused me of being emotionally abusive, threatening that just to get back at them - which I would never do; i genuinely thought i wouldnt make it through the night. 

I'm extremely ashamed to admit this, but I then started to make the 2 hour drive home, at about 3 am, while intoxicated (i also havent eaten in about 6 days). I then called them one last time, and they seemed apathetic to me - all the tears and ""I'm so sorry, i just need to"" weren't there and they just talked to me like I was some stranger. I then told them I loved them one last time, and hung up, with full intention of hitting a median or going off a bridge. 
But I then called my friend Amy, who has been around for close to 8 years now, is one of my closest friends, at one point, I was in love with her and whatnot, but I never said anything and she didnt either, which was a weird form of understanding. And Amy essentially kept me alive, making me promise to call her when I was home (phone was almost dead) and telling me how much I meant to her (best friend wise). So I did. And I checked myself into the hospital, told them everything, and they held me for about 8 hours, then released me. 

Now, I'm about to begin therapy, but I'm having some trouble with evaluating what emotions are which. Has it really been undiagnosed depression the whole time (undiagnosed, however self harm and suicidal thoughts for years), or was it just the breakup? And how do I differentiate between the depression, should it be that, and the grieving from the breakup? How do I tell the difference between thankfulness for Amy being in my life, and the possibility of latent feelings that are near a decade old, resurfacing? And the worst part is I dont know how to deal with the fact that I know I'm heartbroken and shouldn't be looking for someone else in a romantic way, but also balancing the desire to move on and live my life for me. I guess I'm trying to ask what the balance should be between waiting for someone who I genuinely am still in love with and probably will be for a long fucking time, which will hurt and damage me, or, moving on, looking for a rebound even, or just leaving it in the past, which when I have done that, hurts like hell because I'm unable to confront my actual emotions, which just get bottled up, rotten and then break later on leaving me more damaged and possibly hurt someone else with my own unconfronted issues. 

Where is the line between grief and depression? 
Where is the line between latent feelings and thankfulness? 
Where is the line between allowing oneself to grieve, but also moving forward? 


Ps- I had a rough upbringing, my father being a preacher, and being told that the only ""God given"" emotion was happiness; the rest were from the devil - and other shit like ""depression isnt real, it's just spiritual warfare"" or ""if you aren't happy, that means you're not close enough to god"" .

So now I'm in my early 20s, asking for emotional help from strangers who (hopefully) have had a healthy grasp on the reality of their own emotions, to the point they can give advice, simply because I am so emotionally stunted I cant even differentiate what I am feeling.",30Sep2019,1
246,"Some Backstory; I had a terrible freshman year, not too get too into it but basically I was suicidal and not in an alright place...in the least. I let my grades slip, and the semester afterwards I was far more focused on getting myself to a place where I could handle anything before my grades were a priority. 

Now I'm first semester in my junior year with a 2.75 GPA. Yeah, It hurt even to write that if I'm being honest. I'm retaking one class where the F from before will be transferred into an A, and all of my other classes this semester are sitting at A's and I fully intend to keep them that way. I really want to go to college, I want to go and get a masters, become a publisher and live the rest of my life, but I think the mistakes of my freshman year are definitely catching up with me and it leaves me petrified. How do I get at the very least to a point where I could get into a state school?

248,"My cat has an immunodeficiency disease and requires more frequent medical attention than most cats. He also suffers from extreme anxiety. Whenever there is a knock at the door or someone rings the doorbell, he hides under furniture for an hour or so. It is impossible to get him into the cat carrier to go to the vet office because he never goes outside and as soon as I try to put him in the carrier he knows A) that I’m trying to take him outside or B) I’m likely trying to take him to the veterinarian.

So I’ve resorted to a vet who makes house calls for his medical care. A mobile vet charges more than your standard vet, but it is worth it in my case. The mobile vet only accepts cash, and I feel like they are providing a service above and beyond the norm. But because the bill is higher than usual, it never occurred to me to leave a tip on top of the bill amount. Normally, it wouldn’t cross my mind to tip on top of a vet bill, but am I wrong?",30Sep2019,1
249,"I should start by saying today’s day in age with all the different platforms of social media and movies/ tv shows making it seem like everybody is so f***ing perfect probably plays a major roll. I can’t help but get upset over little things about myself. I have a very loving girlfriend who helps me a great deal, but I still go through rough times where I just feel worthless. When I talk about it, I know it’s a problem with me and how I think about myself, and it just sounds stupid but I can’t help how shitty it makes me feel. 

For example, i have milia in my shoulders that I’ve been trying to get rid of for a while, i don’t know anyone else who has to deal with it (I’m sure there’s tons and tons but no one that I know personally) and it just makes me feel like an outcast, like I’m not “normal” even though I know it is. I also have 2 on my forehead that I’ve been trying to get rid of for longer than I can remember but they refuse to leave so it affects my confidence. Little things such as that example really put me in a down mood where at its worst times, I get horrible thoughts about not wanting to live over something so small like that, which worries me in the event that I end up getting an actual issue that is noticeable, I’m not sure how I’ll deal with it.

Anyways I am just looking for tips to keep my head high and keep things in retrospect. I know I’m a lot luckier than a lot of people, a few people I went to highschool with have been in fatal car crashes, some of their lives have changed forever due to being in a coma, some have gone to jail, so I know I am well off but I can’t pull myself out of these moods when I get down :(",30Sep2019,1

251,"I met my best friend at university during the orientation for exchange students in 2010. We hit it off instantly and were inseparable the entire semester.  I could tell he had a crush on me, but I was a couple of years old and felt he was still too immature, so I only saw him as a friend. We kept in touch long distance over the years and since 2014, we've been meeting up and traveling together at least once a year. In 2015, he admitted he had feelings for me. I was scared it would ruin our friendship and we live in different countries so didn't pursue it, but I was starting to get feelings for him too, as the maturity gap was closing. We used to text often, we'd have voice calls once in a while too, always platonic. Sure there were times when we'd get really busy and go weeks without contact, and we've dated other people but it never affected our friendship. He was always really thoughtful and caring. I trusted him more than I trusted anyone else. Over the years, I've grown apart from most of my other friends, but he was a friend I knew I'd have for life. And more recently, I started to think maybe it could even be more than just a friendship. We had started talking about him moving to my country to be closer to me.

The past couple of years he's been doing his CPA exams, and I was there with him every step of the way. I'd send him study questions by text, encouraging him, giving him confidence when he was worried he'd fail. We were always texting. In March, he passed his last exam. We had a chat and celebrated over the phone. Then, he stopped contacting me. Just like that, cold turkey. The first few weeks, I was in the midst of buying a new home and moving for a new job, so I was busy, no big deal. Then my dog got sick. Now I loved this dog more than anything in the world, and this guy knows that, we're often texting about our dogs, and he visited me last year and met my dog. So he knows how much my dog means to me. I text hi, he responds a few days later and says he's been busy but hopes we can catch up soon. I follow up by texting I have sad news, my dog is sick and I am putting him down tomorrow. Nothing. Doesn't even read my text until two months later. I am so depressed about my dog dying, and so upset that he just so suddenly cut me out of my life, I can't even call or text him again for another two months. 

It's now been 4 months since my dog died, I am still super depressed about it. I finally text him again and he calls me. He tells me he has a new girlfriend and didn't know how to tell me (but also says he didn't know I had feelings for him - so why would he be worried then), so he just... didn't talk to me. I am so hurt. How could my best friend of nearly 10 years, cut me out of his life, just like that? Even when I tell him my dog died. It's so cruel and mean. He says he feels awful, he's so sorry, says I'm still important to him, he even says he loves me, but... how am I supposed to forgive him? Or believe him? 

This feels like the meanest thing anyone has ever done to me. Me and this guy have never had a fight or anything. Sure it sucks that he is in a relationship with someone, but that's not the part that upsets me, though it does complicate things. In the past he's had girlfriends get super jealous of me, but he's never ever cut me out of his life. He just straight up abandoned me when he knew I was in pain and suffering. I just don't know what to do or what to feel. It's like he just threw away 9 years of friendship. Am I overreacting? This feels like I don't matter to him at all.

Tomorrow is his birthday and we have an inside joke about never forgetting each others birthdays. Should I even text or call him to wish him a happy birthday? I feel like if I don't, it's passive aggressive and pretty much is the nail in the coffin of this friendship, but if I do it's like everything is fine and I  forgave him but really, I think I'm more pissed now than ever. What do I do/say?",30Sep2019,1
254,"Sorry this is such a long post, I wasn’t really sure if I should post this here or in a subreddit for depression or family problems, but I really need some advice.

I am 24F and I have severe depression and social anxiety. I grew up being emotionally and physically abused by both my parents and also my siblings. My parents divorced when I was 5 and they had shared custody. They hated eachother and my dad took my mom to court for years trying to get sole custody just to piss her off. They were constantly telling me how much the other one hated me....my mom told me my dad wanted me aborted and he didn’t even show up to my birth, my dad said my mom would swear and yell at me as a baby when I would cry instead of trying to soothe me. Lots of other things like that. They both beat me and yelled at me all the time, I was the youngest kid and constantly beaten by them or my brother. I remember crying in the corner of my room wondering if there would ever be a day where I wouldn’t get hurt. There were lots of other bad things that happened and I had to deal with the police and social workers all the time as a kid.

On top of all this, when I was 10 my mom got a boyfriend who would yell and swear at me for no reason. Sometimes he would chase after me and threaten to punch me. I was and still am a very sensitive person and having this big scary guy threaten me when I was a 10 year old little girl had me terrified. The fact that my mom could be with someone who treated me like that just broke me. She continued to date him and is still seeing him today. When I was a kid he didn’t live with us but he was there all the time, I was terrified to leave my room because I didn’t know when he would show up. This continued for about 8 or 9 years. I’m not sure what happened but he stopped coming over even though they were still together.

I developed severe depression because of all this and started seeing a psychiatrist when I was 15. I did like the psychiatrist but I don’t feel like it really helped me at all. I told my mom her boyfriend was the main reason I was so depressed and she thought I was being ridiculous. I even had her sit in on a session with my psychiatrist who told her what I was feeling and how she shouldn’t be seeing someone who treats me that way. I don’t remember her response while in the room but after that she said she didn’t like the psychiatrist and I should find a new one. I ended up seeing dozens of therapists over the years and I did have some improvement but I never really got solid advice in regards to the situation with her bf. It was clear she wouldn’t stop seeing him so I didn’t know how to deal with it. I’m not currently in therapy and I’m not sure if seeing a new one would help at this point.

Throughout all this, I really struggled in school because I was so depressed I could barely manage to get out of bed. I missed months of school and ended up dropping out of high school and taking some online courses instead. But I never managed to get all the credits and I just got my GED instead at 18. Last year I was finally starting to get my life together, I was in university and found a subject I did well in and wanted a career in. But at the beginning of this year my moms boyfriend moved in with us because he had nowhere else to go. My mom said it would only be for a couple weeks but it ended up being a few months. I couldn’t handle it. Having him here made all these memories come back that I hadn’t thought about in years. I had mental breakdowns daily and started smoking weed 24/7 to deal with it. It made me feel better in the moment but I became dependent on it and now i feel even worse without it.

After her boyfriend moved out he started coming over all the time again and now I feel as helpIess as I did when I was 10. I dropped all my courses that semester and stayed in bed all day for several months. The one friend I had knows all about my family history but doesn’t understand any of this, and doesn’t care about trying to help me. I told him when I see her bf I get sick to my stomach and I’ve literally ran upstairs and puked a few times when he tried to talk to me. His response was that I’m a pussy and I need to just learn to be around the bf. He was always saying things like that whenever I tried to ask him for advice about this stuff (which wasn’t often because I knew he would only ever make me feel worse). I didn’t have any other friends though so I just put up with it and learned to brush it off because I knew he was wrong. But that comment just pushed me over the edge and I couldn’t speak to him after that. Now I have no friends at all and I have social anxiety so I get really panicky around people and don’t know what to say. I am also really struggling in uni now and I haven’t been to a single class all month. I’ve been completely isolated from people since January and my anxiety is at an all time high whenever I try to make it to class. I really don’t know what to do at this point. I know I have to get my shit together but I don’t know where to start.",30Sep2019,1
255,"For reference I’m (F17) and my boyfriend is (M17). We started dating six months ago. My boyfriend’s parents are divorced, so he lives with his mom half the time and his dad half the time. 
Anyways, we’re both seniors in school and he started giving me rides in the morning and after school. Now, all of a sudden his dad is telling him that he can’t give me rides to school anymore. Keep in mind, my boyfriend pays for his own gas and I only live a 3 minute drive from him. He won’t let my boyfriend leave the house until 7:20 and school starts at 7:39. He had my boyfriends stepmom follow him to school to make sure he didn’t pick me up. He also called my mom and tried to get her to confirm that he hasn’t been giving me rides to school in the morning. My mom told him that he wasn’t, yet he didn’t believe her and is still accusing my boyfriend of doing so. 
My boyfriend will ask his dad to hangout with me after school and his dad always says no because of his math grade. (He has a C and has all his work turned in) Anytime my boyfriend stays at his moms house and he calls my boyfriend, he always mentions to his dad that he’s at my house. His dad will then keep him on the phone for a few minutes and ask him what we’ve been doing and just seem very suspicious. After they’d hang up, his dad would call his mom and tell him that my boyfriend needs to go back to her house and that’s he’s in trouble. Luckily, his mom loves me and lets him stay. I just don’t know why his dad doesn’t like me. I’ve only met him twice and out of both of those times I’ve been very nice and polite.

266,"So some backstory, 
-I'm (21F) living on a property my boyfriends mom owns.
 -I've known/lived with the family for almost 3 years now. 
-Boyfriend (bf)lives at his moms (MIL) house. We go to a christian college that does not allow us to live together unmarried.
- The property I live on is in a remote, dead end neighborhood that has no trespassing signs, private property signs, cameras (that work 10% of the time). No one has any business being in the neighborhood unless they are my one neighbor down the road.
-MIL used to own a business with a family friend. Family friend died and his son (S) thinks he can lay claim to everything, and has tried stealing from the property even though everything is in MIL's name.
- Theres a lot of lawsuits going on and all I know is S is delusional, passionate, lost his job, and has nothing left to lose.**

-Three weeks ago I come home to find my gate tied shut, when I always leave it open. I call bf, MIL, his dad(DIL), no one knows who came and tied the gate. So I call the police and they show up, search the house, and nothing. We all think its S so I file a police report (against the cops recommendation(!!!). S is relatives with the chief of police and the cops have been helping him steal stuff. From what I know theres an FBI investigation against the cops on top of everything else. point is, cops arent really helpful to us in this town and we dont trust them) 
This week we found out it was a friend of DIL who didnt know I was living there and was trying to ward off S from taking more. So it was a false alarm all along

-earlier this week I wake up and get ready to go to school and theres a red truck in my yard. I start calling people, freaking out and DIL goes 'yeah hes here to help me move some stuff around sorry bf was supposed to tell you. (I genuinely think my bf should not have been a middle man, DIL has my number he can text me) second false alarm

- three days ago I check the cameras and bfs grandma's (G) truck had shown up. Shes a druggie, manipulative, cracked out of her mind no good person. I do not like her, and I dont like her coming to my place. Last night bf told me he found out from MIL it was actually G's boyfriend who came to pick up some stuff, knocked on my door, realized I wasnt there, and left. The thing is, I've never met G's boyfriend. G told him I said it was fine for him to show up (Which obviously I DID NOT) regardless, 3rd false alarm

- I've had several nightmares of someone breaking in, chasing me, trying to kill me, no one coming to help, and waking up in tears this week. When I get home from work I sit in my car for 20 minutes because I'm too scared to make that 10 yard journey to the house. I am so on edge. If I had been home when G's bf had knocked on my door, I would have shot him, no questions asked. 



**That's the thing though, everything has been a false alarm, but since S is so unpredictable I dont know if or when a real invasion is going to happen. I am willing to shoot a guy even though he meant no real harm to me because I am so freaked out about being alone in a remote neighborhood with my place being a target for someone who is unpredictable.

TL;DR theres a guy who believes in his mind where I live is his place to own, and is considered dangerous. I live alone in this remote neighborhood and have had multiple occurrences of people coming to my place and I get freaked out by it. All occurrences have been false alarms, but since no one tells me in advance someone is showing up, I've gotten so worked up I get frequent nightmares, have made a police report, and had I been home when one did come, would have shot him.

So what do I do? I'm going to have (another) talk with DIL and MIL about just simply telling me if someone is coming by so I dont get so worked up, and I've already looking for apartments to move to but I'm only staying in this state 8 more months and they all have 1 year leases.",30Sep2019,1
268,"Well alright, some backstory: When I was 14, my family found out that my dad had been molesting my sister for years. He had threatened her to keep quiet until she told a friend of hers when she was a sophomore in high school. That friend convinced her to tell the school social worker and then BOOM entire life changed out of nowhere. Family was in turmoil, eventually leading to my mom moving across the country with all my siblings. 

Now that his child support bill has dropped to a lower amount, my mom can’t afford to live where she is so I flew down to move her back home. Upon entering the house, I immediately notice that she’s turned into a hoarder. Also she has severe anxiety issues and depression. On top of that, my little brother has autism and doesn’t have the right amount of care needed for him.

My dad has started a new family and has another kid on the way. My mom is flat broke. He owns two businesses and is known around town. Luckily we gave him the courtesy of not telling everyone but I don’t see why he should be able to live a happy life while my mom has to live in poverty.

My plan is to speak to him in person and in private, tell him he has 60 days to transfer the deed to his (newly updated) house to me and leave the state or else I’ll tell his family/landlords/customers everything. 

I fully believe that I would be doing the morally right thing for my family in this situation... or should I reconsider?

Also I know this is illegal, but I don’t think he’d take this matter to the police because well, he’d be doing exactly what he’s afraid of.",30Sep2019,1

273,"So about a year ago my father left his gf of 10 years and has 2 daughters (8 and 14) at home. He has met a Filipino woman and has chatted and messaged with her consistently for about the last 9 months or so. Now this woman is coming to the US to visit, my dad's talking about marrying her and I am absolutely terrified.......
I've expressed my concerns about cultural differences I'm sure they are going to have. Ex: sending money to family, jealousy, children and his current children at home, cheating.... 
I have done a bit of research and am seeing a lot of men having to support their family back home, the wife being extremely jealous and women being expected to have children. 
She has made it known that becoming a US citizen is her biggest goal in life, she's never wanted anything more...  I've explained to him that what she says before marriage and what she does after may be two completely opposite things. His argument is that he's told her none of those things are going to be happening and if she's going to pull that kind of sh*t, she can just stay there.  🤦‍♀️
My father doesn't need more kids and is planning to have a vasectomy (FINALLY)!
He doesn't have a lot of money to send to her family, I think he just may be the first idiot she's found to fall for her shenanigans.
I cut ties with him 10 years ago and had no contact for 3 years, the following 7 years contact was at a minimum as I couldn't stand his gf at the time and since he left the gf, the last year I've been closer to him than ever. I'll add the last gf was extremely jealous of any female in his life other than their daughter together. This included my grandmother before she passed, me, and my kid sister.
My biggest concerns are 
1) jealousy: is this going to himder the relationship we've finally built back up
2) my kid sisters: how will this new Filipina mom treat them
3) my father being taken advantage of: again

Has anyone been in a similar situation or has brought their wife over from the Philippines?

274,"So recently my ex and I started speaking again. He had said he wanted to be with me and I drove down to see him. Things were great and then school started up again. Once this had happened he had told me he can’t talk everyday and that I need to call less. I had complied however so much happened this month my dog died because he got hurt, I failed my skills test, it’s my first semester in nursing school and I’m still getting used to the pace, and I had gotten into a car accident. So tonight we had been planning seeing one another for fall break (long distance) he said he was too busy to come up and see me so I told him I’d drive down and see him. Afterwards, I asked if he was going to ever date me and he had said not anytime soon, after school. Which I then told him maybe we’re better off as friends, because I don’t want to be driving four hours all the time for someone who doesn’t have time for me. He then told me that I deceived him because I was so nonchalant about us in the begging but I’ve been needy by texting him so much and asking to spend more time he doesn’t have. Which I may be, because I need some support with everything going on and I didn’t notice. So afterwards he tells me “that engineering is MUCH harder than nursing school and that he has eight weeks left and he said that I just can’t swallow that pill and to leave him alone. I’m not sure what to think. Idk what to do or I’m wrong. I need some advice please help.",30Sep2019,0

He still lives at home, (He finished a post grad and only just finished his first year of working in his field, we live in a SUPER expensive city so it makes sense that he lives at home I totally would if my parents lived in the same city as me). He comes over on mostly weekends for sleepovers, like maybe comes over friday and will sleep over both friday and saturday. Or even thursday evening (so like 2-3 nights on weekends). But when he is here we mostly stay in my room, like we don’t take up the common area more then necessary cause we try to be mindful of my roommate and we go out a lot like weekends we tend to be out of the house.

278,"Advice?

Hi! So my boyfriend (m/21) and I (f/21) have been together for almost 5 years and I know this is really stupid but we have never used protection (immature and dumb I know but at least it was a consensual decision). Anyways my period has ALWAYS been pretty regular until July. July my period was 6 days late, but eventually came. When August rolled around, my period ended up coming a whole 7 days early (August 23rd-27th). Now that we are in September I am currently 9 days late. I was suppose to get it around the 20th. I did take a test yesterday and it showed up negative. My boyfriend and I are bit confused and concerned. I’ve showed no symptoms, had no cramps etc. We are aware of the “consequences” with not using protection and we wouldn’t be unhappy if I were pregnant, but we have a lot of things to figure out either way so it’s really about being anxious of what the result is. If I’m not pregnant, I do plan on going on birth control when I go to the doctors in 2 weeks because it’ll put a lot less strain on our sex life, but until then I’m more or less concerned about if I’m pregnant and if not why is my cycle SO late?",30Sep2019,1

My teeth are no good, I need braces and have quite a few obvious cavities. And I can’t say what is up with my mental health but I know I need therapy.

280,"    I admit I have tried killing my self two times. I’ve told no one about it, except my parents which led to four months of therapy which was terrible. Even talking to new therapists I always say no when asked to talk about what led me to do such a thing. I guess you could say i’m triggered pretty easily.  I overcame suicidal tendencies but depression is still coming from time to time. 

    But my main advice is how do to I tell my friends to stop joking about it. It all started in discord, when we were listening to music. I played a mildly sad song. They made fun of it and I didn’t really care at all to be honest. Then they started joking about depression and I have it, but none of them know about it. Keep in mind these are online friends, I have not met any in person. But they see I’m getting quiet and they think i’m just laughing or something and they continue to say “oh are you going to slit your wrists,” I get extremely quiet. They keep going. One friend realizes I’m quiet and said to chill but he was the person who was laughing the most so they ignored it. They kept going til the point I haven’t talked the last five minutes, and an extra two-ish after the whole comedy session. It’s been on my mind recently and I’ve been wanting to tell them to not joke about it. It’s been bothering me a lot, but I don’t know what to say.

(We got invited through our upperclassmen friend, who was invited by the girl he was messing with.) So we get there and its the 3 of us and  2 girls instead of 3, one of them ended up staying home. So were chillin listening to music playing drunk uno before the party, whilst this is happening, the girl (lets call her candy) is eyeing me constantly and shooting smiles across the table. Im all for it as my friend hasn't made a move on her yet and I end up pulling her to the side and talking to her for a few minutes before we all headed out to the party. She seems cool but i move past it, I was ready to PARTY. We get to the party and its live, and after a while i notice candy dancing on my bestfriend. I go get a drink and move to the other side of the floor n there she is again but this time with another guy. At this point I already know the type of girl she is (im not going to speak down on anyone, but you know what i mean), so i eliminated that as an option and just went and enjoyed myself. After a few hours the group met up and left and were waiting for the uber candy had realized she lost her keys. She asked my best friend to go back to the party and look for it w her and he denied it, so i went and helped her look. At this point in the night were pretty drunk so we just start talking while looking for her keys. I was not trying to flirt with her, she was coming onto me and there was no way i can turn down a cute girl.

297,"To preface this, I am not excusing my moms inexcusable behavior but she’s not a bad person at heart. She grew up in a household where she saw her mother  abused almost daily. Not just that, but he was very jealous and kept her mom indoors. She somehow forgave her father in his old age

And because life sucks, she married into a very abusive relationship where my dad and his mom would manipulate her, talk down to her and my dad would physically abuse her constantly and terribly, which I witnessed myself. To put it into perspective, I used to pray that my dad would lose his arms so that he couldn’t abuse her anymore. We lived in an abused women’s shelter for a time, she reconciled with him, and I ended up convincing her to leave him when I got older. She got psychologically manipulated and the worst part was that she felt that couldn’t leave because she was financially dependent on my dad

Now today: I am married and she has been doing some very inexcusable things, things that I dare say are like what her mother in law did to her, something that I will never tolerate in my marriage. She started yelling at my wife behind my back. I once had my wisdom teeth pulled and insisted that I was going to get my own prescription, and after I left she snuck behind my back and came to MY house to berate my wife for not offering to pick it up for me

She also recently yelled at my wife (again behind my back) when I had to leave my moms house before we could eat dinner - she made dinner, not just for me but for my siblings, and I neither knew nor asked for dinner. I didn’t even do it to spite her, we really had to leave

She’s doing it behind my back because she knows that I completely blow up when she makes any kind of remarks in front of me

I’m beneath myself. I started telling my wife to disregard my moms comments which is something that I never thought that I would have to do, and I’ve also been at war with my mom over this where I cut communication for certain periods of time - I don’t know how to stop it",30Sep2019,4

299,"Greets from Australialand. This will be quite a long one but I feel like the context is very necessary and I would like some advice.

Over the past year a girl has come into my life. She had already been in my life as far as communicating goes but not a physical or romantic presence. Growing up I played on Habbo Hotel and had a regular group of friends on there who I chatted with for years. I met this girl when I was about 15 (am now 26), nothing romantic ever once happened the whole time we spoke on Habbo at all, in fact our communication was fairly sparse compared to other members of the friend group. When I was about 20 we all organised a proper in person meetup with as many of the group as possible, about 9 show up, including myself and her. Upon seeing her I realised she was actually quite an attractive girl. We spoke a fair bit that night but I was in a relationship with someone else at the time so I didn't even attempt to pursue her at that meetup. I did learn a lot about her though, her traumatic past (""incident"" with father) and a rather poor mental health state, living in public housing. Bit of a mess but none of it really put me off thinking she was cool, we had soooooo much in common especially with our enormous interests in history and vidya. I learn she is extremely shy and not much of a socialite, next to no meaningful sexual experience. Both live in Sydney.

Fast forward some years to November last year. Now single. Habbo is a thing of the past and we transitioned to Discord so we could do voice chats and stuff too with the group. Her and I have butted heads kind of extensively regarding political type of stuff (she's quite ardently an admitted communist, I am not). Develop a mild adversarial relationship. She messages into the Discord one afternoon that she's feeling pretty shit and feels like going somewhere, for some reason I feel sorry for her and make up bullshit story that I was already heading into the city that night and she could come hang out with me if she wants to, she agrees and we organise time/meetup spot etc. 

Met up with her at the train station (I drove) and as soon as I saw her I was really taken back by how pretty she was and had a much more womanly appearance than when we had met a few years earlier. We hug.. awkwardly and grab some gelato and have some drinks. We wander around the city all night long, so late that we miss the time for when trains stop for the night. I offered to drive her home and she accepts the offer, by the time we get to her place it's like 4:30am and I live just over an hour from her so she says I can sleep there if I want to. I slept over, nothing happened and we hung out the next day at the beach too that she lives near. Thank her for letting me stay and not drive exhausted and I'm off to home.

We hang a few more times like this between Jan and April roughly and I did realise I was falling for her. I thought she was incredibly smart, funny and attractive. I ask her out once more and I planned to tell her that night how I feel and she if she felt the same. We went to a quiet little bar and I expressed how I felt and she just kinda of shyly giggled a bit and said she felt for me too but did not believe she was in the right space with her mental health for a relationship and said I should look for a more normal girl. Talked about it a bit more and I'm a bit sad at this stage that I couldn't parley it into something more but I can take no for an answer. It's fine :(

Give her some time after that of not asking her out so she can process what we talked about. She chats to me comfortably in the group chat (who have no idea what her and I had been doing the past few months) but was ghosting me in private messages. I eventually kind of start to give up and accept that despite my feelings that maybe this isn't gonna work.

The group arranges to meet up at Supanova Sydney this year in June, she's gonna attend as well. Everyone had a fun day and we decided that afterwards we'd catch a train into the City for some drinks and stuff. We arrive in Newtown and all proceed to get fairly drunk. We were all in a cool little retro style bar near the end of the street we were on she was sitting at the table near me and I was trying to get one of the others to keep his head up cause he was so drunk he was falling asleep, decided fuck it up not my problem, turned around and the girl is staring at me. I asked if she was okay and she just explodes into this apology for ignoring me and how she was confused etc, I told her it's fine and that she feels how she feels, it can't be helped. I had grabbed her hands as we had this chat and she didn't pull away at all and she even moved much closer to me so I just put my arms around her, she put her head on my chest and we just chatted like that all night. We all decide to call it a night and I called a taxi for her but she didn't feel comfortable getting into a tax alone so I said I'd come along and just sleep on her lounge and go home the next day.

We get to her place, she doesn't go to her room she just sleeps on the lounge diagonal to one I'm on. I try to get some sleep and she just laughs a little bit for some reason, I turned around and she was like staring at me again so I asked if everything was okay and she just says ""yeah i'm just looking at you"". Dunno why but I was like okay do you want me to come lay next to you and help you get to sleep? She says she'd like that so I lay down next her and give her some head scratches and a back rub. She moves her body back into mine and starts moving around a bit, turns around and we look each other in the face and start what would have to be my most intense make out session of my life lol. We get right into foreplay afterwards and she's saying stuff like ""this is so amazing, you're going to be my first"" and some other surprisingly depraved stuff given her usually demure personality. We have sex, it was fuckin awesome and fall asleep.

Wake up the next day and she's not feeling great about the night before and isn't sure she did the right thing. I try and talk her through it saying like we're both adults, we had fun and enjoyed each other's company and that I care about her and want her to be comfortable with things too. She says she just wants some time to think about stuff so I went home and couldn't help myself, drove over there the next day as I had been feeling quite intensely for her again after that night and wanted to hash things out with her. Things don't go as I expected, we cover the ground again of her not having the emotional space for a partner right now and wants me to not pursue her. I cried a bit I won't lie, my heart was broken but again I can take no for an answer and start to create distance again. 

This was in June and we're now coming on October and my feelings for her have no subsided. I haven't in my entire life felt so strongly about a girl (have had 3 other serious relationships prior to this). I realise the obvious thing is to allow that time and space and let what happens happen but I need further advice beyond that. I really want this to be more but also need ways to help cope with it otherwise.

Her and I get along incredibly well, very similar senses of humour, both love the lore of the same games and a shared passion for history. Her personal issues and mental health present significant barriers though. I’ve never felt so comfortable around someone in my entire life and I have a tremendous amount of respect for her as a person - it’s difficult to accept the possibility of not being romantically involved with her. 

Sorry for the length, I just felt that the background context would've helped make sure the advice is more substantial.",30Sep2019,3

I went to college instead of high school as part of a dual credit program and have about 50 credits right now, I scored a 27 on my ACT, and a 12 on my ACT writing. Basically, I understand that I am qualified for college but I just can't bring myself to go into debt just to work 20 years paying it off. 

My issue right now is that while I am prepared to sign away my life for 4 years, serve the country, and get some free college while I'm there (plus a job and a roof over my head) - I am not quite prepared to leave my mother alone. She has essentially no friends asides from my father who travels a lot for work and myself, so if I leave I'll feel like the most massive dickhead in the world. Not to mention she is in a pretty difficult spot right now which I'd rather not get into.

She is the best mother I could have had, and it just doesn't feel right to leave her to be alone in her time of need. 

I guess I'm asking if I should be more focused on my future or my mother's happiness. I just don't know if it is actually heartless to abandon the latter, or simply the hard decision to make. I'd love some outside eyes to consider my plight.

301,"Disclaimer, I sometimes refuse to listen for fear of losing my innocence and individuality.  I need solid advice.

I mean, people are prone to human error.

My biggest fear for a long time was working with a shitty boss or mentor, doing hard drugs to earn respect, and being doomed to date tiffany whores.

For me, I benefited for not listening to people, because every bit of advice I've been given is often terrible advice that I knew I should ignore.  Follow your passion, sleep around until you find the right one, goto college without a plan.

Now, I'm with a girl who I love who loves me for me, I work a warehouse job with no crappy person in sight, and I plan on going back to school for web development.

And this is coming from a person with autism, schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and ADHD.

305,"Posting on Mobile so the usual apologies for formatting and length 

Hi, so...
I (M24) have been dating my gf (F24) for coming up 4 years now.

We met by dating app and started up a long distance relationship because at the time I was at boarding school and then went on to university.

I made the move to make it official because when I was at uni I just couldn't bring myself to flirt/date other women because it felt like cheating.

We moved closer and as of 2 months ago moved in together.

When we started dating I was at the start of a significant depressive down turn that culminated with me leaving uni. It's massively effected how I experience things and combine that with being an introverted person and I genuinely don't think I feel that much. And I certainly don't emote very much.

Now I'm living with her and I can't help but feel that we never had the ""honeymoon phase"" of a new relationship and that I might be with her because it fell that way and not because I love her?

I can't read my own feelings so I don't know, I just feel like I'm coasting and that aside from one conversation to be exclusive that I didn't really do much to get into the relationship.

Basically, how can I tell if I love her and I'm just being dramatic about this or if I have actually managed to get this far and not love her.",30Sep2019,3

313,"My girlfriend [F] and I [M] have been in a relationship on and off for about 3 years. Our relationship right now is a bit stale. When we try to get each other to like our different interests, it does not really work out. 

I have known and hung around her friends for about the same amount of time. I started getting attracted to one particular friend [F] (started a few months ago) because she almost seems to share more interests with me than my GF and that we get along together well whenever we hangout with her. 

My GF and I would used to hate scary movies until I tried some out with my friends and it started to grow on me. I tried to get her to watch scary movies with me and accommodate her by having watching in a lit up place and being next to her, but she wouldn't budge. Our music tastes were different as well but we have learned to like some of each other's music.

Since her friend and I would share the same interests, I'm inclined to hang out with her (With my gf's permission). Although, I am afraid that I might already have started to develop feelings for her. I started to notice how attractive she is.

I am afraid of telling my girlfriend as she suffers from mental illnesses.

Is this just a phase that I will get over and should I just wait for this to pass by? Should I tell her and risk something bad to happen?

314,"I recently moved to a new city - and as a freelancer, I’ve been finding it difficult to meet like minded people (so I’ve had minimal day to day social interactions which hasn’t been good for my overall well-being).

About a month ago, I came across a co-working space nearby that seemed really cool and trendy - and figured it could be a great way to get out of the house each day and interact with people, and potentially make friends. 

All the people in this office are your stereotypical “cool” surfer types. I’ve been making effort to get to know people, but what I’ve learnt since joining is that everyone there have been friends for years before the two owners (who are best friends) started the co-working space together a year ago. This has led me feeling like the odd one out. And quite excluded in ways.

I feel like I’m back in high school again, almost like They’re all just one big clique. No one has gone out of their way to exclude me (except one of the owners who doesn’t give me a bar). For example, I was working late on a Friday, and one of the owners came down to the girl who sat next to me and told her they were all getting tacos and drinks nearby if she wanted to join. It upset me that I wasn’t not invited and made me feel as if I’ve done something wrong (which I really haven’t). 

It’s also a lot less professional than I had anticipated. They’re constantly using the space to hold parties on the weekends. One time, I had to go into work on a Sunday morning to finish a job for my client, and the office was a MESS! Turns out the owner had a massive birthday party there the night before and no one cleaned it up. There was a big bag of weed, and small bags of coke left out on the main table. People had taken all the gum from my desk and left their glasses on it too. I had to clean it all up before my client came in. I also don’t appreciate all these parties being around my expensive computer gear. 

I’m feeling very conflicted about leaving right now as I feel as though leaving is quitting, and if I leave now without proving my worth, it’ll make me feel like I don’t have any worth. 

Does it take time to develop relationships (be it professional or not) - or does this sound like an environment I shouldn’t spend any more thought or energy on?

She leaves telling me she can't be with me (she still won't tell me exactly why and will start an argument over it when I just want to know WHY) and goes and moves to her parent's, but I feel like she's lying (I've caught her in lies before). I'm pretty sure (no hard proof as I deleted all of my social media) she is seeing or at least talking to someone else, but keeps stringing me on. I've asked her to leave me alone and let me move on and it feels like a sick game she's playing. She was manipulative while we were together to the point where I lost all my friends. *I* let her isolate me all these years to now I am completely alone. I tried reaching out to all my old friends but they're not interested. She keeps talking to me about the future still like when we were engaged, but then when I open up and be vulnerable with her, she goes radio silent. She'll get upset if I don't answer her calls/texts but I attempt to reach out to her she ignores everything and then will call me only when she steps out from wherever she's at.

320,"Long time reader, here goes nada.

I'm a recently married male (34) who has Crohns disease (my stomach is permanently f*cked.) My wife (32) is an amazing human being who works hard every single day and handles my illness the best she can.

My life since Crohns has become a repeating cycle it seems. Hospital stays, surgeries, being too tired to function for months - let alone be the person I should be to my wife. The most important thing this cycle robs me of is TIME. 

Other parts of that cycle typically land me (currently) working manual labor/delivery jobs.  These types of gigs are usually what I fall back to when I am able to work - and I have made enough acquaintances over the years who are understanding of my situation who will always take me back even after a long spell of me being useless.  I am forever grateful for these opportunities but as I get older, I'm starting to run out of gas.

I tried college, a few times actually. I was able to earn my Associates and came close to finishing my Bachelors when another cycle repeated itself. When I got better, money was (IS) more important than school so I went to work. 

Found girl. Fell in Love. Got Married.

Without sounding biased: she deserves the beautiful house, the kids, the husband who can provide and stand up straight on off days for her and his family. She deserves it in the eyes of anyone who has ever met her, not just in my own. I want to give her this world before it swallows me up.

Last 3 weeks have been a pneumonia scare, bronchitis, possible pneumo-thorax (da fuq?!)   Finally bringing in the Crohns symptom storm over the last 48 hrs. I had to take the whole last week off from work for the doctors and x-rays. I have to go in on Tuesday. I dont know if I physically can.

 So...I am currently approaching a familiar exit which I'm being forced to get off at. I dont want to put her through it again, let alone go through it myself (but that's almost the easy part now.) 

I dont know what to do. 

I dont want to stop working. I dont want to go until I run myself into the ground again (one of my specialties). I dont want to revert back to the home life while I waste time ""healing"".  I dont want to waste her life.

There is this girl who I am talking who seems to have a lot in common with me. At first we only engaged in politics related talks, but I followed the advice of a friend to be less passive and act as he said it was clears this girl was into to me , so I tried a flirt line that I thought would not work, but amazingly it did! 

Being mindblown about that, because I do not flirt ( of course I do, but not with online conversations and corny lines, although this traces back to a really strict and rigid definition of what ""corny"" is), I decided to read again the chat and see If my friend was correct about what he said.

And my fellow readers, oh he was right. It literally looked like I was one of those really really naive guys with the uncapability of ""getting it"", like a r/woosh thing. 
 
This made me look back at many things and start to wonder if, in a sense, I intentionally retracted and if some of my principles are stopping me of making new relations( not only in love but in friendship and relations in general) .

We were told that we were special and were sent on earth for a mission, which we don't know. I believed in it when I was young, but have changed my believes quite early, but did not tell our mother. My brother's condition is more severe, he has been doing this for 4 more years than me (I am 16, he is 20). He has told many lies to make our mother happy instead of telling her that he did not believe. In my opinion, he has gone extremely far with this and has told things that he should not have. Some examples of this are that he told things to my mother that she has shared with many people who also believe in this ""religion"". He also participated in many things that he and my mother has actually gotten money for, ex: exorcisms.

329,"Hi, I really would love some advice on this issue. I adopted a blue heeler cross about three months ago (2yo), and the adoption place frankly just didn't inform me of the numerous behavioural issues she has. I'm actually going to do a bullet point list of her problems since the list is quite long.


*Not house trained at all. The adoption place specifically told me she was house trained, but she isn't. Not even a bit. She doesn't tell me when she needs to go, and literally every day she will poop or wee or both in the house, especially in my roommate's room and the bathroom - or the hall or kitchen if either or both of those are shut.
*Can't be kept outside because she's not house trained because of her terrible separation anxiety. She will sit there and bark in a super bitchy, whiny way (I know this is a strange description but her barks have this weird tone inflection that make it sound that way) and scratch the fuck out of the door if I don't let her in. I know I'm rewarding this behaviour by letting her in, but I live in a rental and I can't let her fuck up the door or I won't get my bond back, plus we have close neighbours and the noise is fucking sonic and incredibly annoying
*Can't be tied up. Ever, or anywhere. I've never seen a dog have a panic attack before but this one barks and lunges and freaks out like she's being killed if you tie her up and leave her.
*Cannot be walked on a normal lead. I am not an angry person, I think the most anger I've ever felt in my life is towards this dog when trying to walk her. She will not fucking stop pulling. I used to have rope burn all over my hands every day because of how fucking hard she pulls. She lunges at everything living, the worst is cyclists who she has caused to fall off their bikes several times. She has tried to attack small children, joggers, the elderly, and EVERY SINGLE DOG she ever seen while on the lead. I have to drag her away 30 or 40 metres if she even sees another dog because she just goes ballistic, I fully believe that if I just stood there she would hang herself on the lead trying to lunge at them. She barks loudly but doesn't snarl, I can't tell if she's excited and wants to meet them or angry and wants to bite. Thank god my roommate suggested a halti lead so that I can take her for a walk without crying or having a fucking vein burst from how angry I get. She is sort of walkable now because she can't pull, but all of the other behaviours are still present.
*She jumps up at everyone. Literally everyone. She runs up to you and launches herself off you like fucking parkour, everyone in my house has scratches up and down their legs from this. 
*She hates my boyfriend. She barks at him from the time he gets to my house till the time he leaves. The only time she's sort of okay with him is when we're both laying down in bed and then he's able to pat her, but her tail is between her legs the whole time and if he so much as goes to the bathroom and comes back she'll bark at him and act like a pork chop all over again.
*Any dog I pat, she mauls. When we go to the beach I let her off the lead because she's actually pretty much okay and usually comes back when called. However, if we're meeting another dog and I pat it, she will fucking hunt this dog down and mess it up until I can catch her and drag her away.
*And finally, she bites people. Six so far. Like, breaking the skin and large, deep wounds kind of bites. Mostly men, including my roomates friends, my best friend's date, and the cleaner, but she also attacked my roommate's 11 year old sister. The way she bites is super weird because it comes out of nowhere, she'll be sitting or pacing around with her tail wagging and then all of a sudden she has her teeth in them, no warning whatsoever. I've been very lucky that everyone she's bitten has been forgiving, but it's fucking unacceptable and I don't know how to even begin to teach her not to do this. 


I hired a trainer (bark busters) pretty immediately after trying to walk her for the first time because I felt out of my depth. The trainer was good at the start, but my dog has obviously been terribly traumatised by something (though I have no information as to what) and I discovered lots of scars on her neck that I assume were caused maybe by a rope or a chain somehow. This trainer used fear and discipline to train her, and while it was initially effective at getting her to stop barking when put outside, she began biting after I had been training her like this for a while. I have since ghosted this trainer because I hate confrontation but feel like it was harming my dog. Too useless to ask for my money back.


I called the adoption agency after she bit my roommate's sister and told them about all her problems. I said I wasn't coping, that it was ruining my mental state and taking up far too much space in my head. They said I could take her back to them, but that they would most likely put her down if I did. I don't know what to do. I feel like a mother in a dramatic Lifetime movie who tells their son after a fight that they love them but they don't like them. I love this dog, when she's just with me she's gentle and sweet and cuddly, but I also fucking hate her more than I think I've ever hated anything, and my frustration and feelings of guilt about the situation are seriously contributing to my suicidal ideation.


I'm stressing posting this because I know a lot of the replies are going to be giving me advice on what to do or berating me for not doing *specific thing* and I just want to say that this has been my LIFE for the past three months. I google this every day. I have tried so many different things that it is actually mentally exhausting for me to try to list them all. I have spent so much money and time on this dog and I have literally nothing to show for it. She's actually worse than when I first got her. I think for anything to work it would have to be under the guidance of another trainer, which I can afford, but I don't know if I can handle another six months of her being like this, of me trying to work on it every day, considering how bad my mental state is. I have an eating disorder and I'm super suicidal at the moment. I could have handled a normal dog, I'm not sure if I can handle this dog.


Also I just want to admit that I've smacked her, a few times, but it made her worse so I stopped. She fucking bit a child, yeah, I smacked her on the bum and yelled at her. I came into this believing very strongly that you should never hit an animal under any circumstances but the reality of her poor behaviour is so fucking overwhelming and I feel like I have no other way to communicate ""no"" to her.

This dog or maybe more accurately my lack of skills to handle her have made me consider avenues I never would have previously. I have considered de-barking her, I bought an electric shock collar and used it once, I even thought about overfeeding her and making her fat so she couldn't parkour at us so much.

331,"Sorry if the formatting is weird! I’m typing this out on mobile.

Me and my friend Bella have been close friends since we were about 8 years old. We’ve been each other’s rocks for ages, at this point I strongly consider her family. 

Bella’s biological family unfortunately were extremely abusive. They all suffer from untreated mental illness, and/or meth addiction. Her family has never cared about her. She’s never had a single aunt or cousin that she could turn to for anything. Years ago when she was younger, she wound up homeless on the streets as a result of her mother choosing drugs over her. Myself and my father are the only healthy people/relationships that she’s ever really experienced within her life thus far.

All of the romantic relationships she has been in have been both physically and verbally abusive. This is her second serious relationship, and it’s longest she’s ever been in. I’ve honestly lost track the amount of times they’ve broken up.
From what I’m aware of, he’s (26 M) only put his hands on her once, (which I doubt, from some of the erratic behavior she has shared with me), he had choked her and slapped her across the face. Bella called me crying about it once it was morning, I drove to pick her up, and the entire car ride she was upset and told me several times how she is never going back with him, and refused to report anything. (She immediately went back to him the next day, and proceeded to act like if nothing happened). 

Recently I feel as if Bella might slowly be realizing that this isn’t what she wants. A few days ago he lost his shit on her, screamed at her and cursed her out, and then proceeded to lock her out of the apartment, (this isn’t the first time he’s done this). She moved all of her stuff in with me. I was surprised because this was the biggest step she’s ever taken regarding leaving. She told me that she doesn’t care whether she leaves or stays at this point, but that she actually thinks she’s done, and that she wanted to live with me now. 

This lasted roughly 12 hours, and Bella has been back at his place every night since, with all of her belongings still with me. I’m getting tired of attempting to help her through yet another abusive and unstable relationship. It hurts me to see her like this, she’s doing so well in other areas of her life, yet this is the one major area in her life that she has struggled to fully acknowledge. Part of me really wants to tell her to take all her stuff back and stay there if she’s not actually leaving him. I brought up the fact that she’s “living here” yet never home, and I had gently asked her if she was staying here because she was leaving him, and she had stated that she was living with me because she was changing jobs soon, as if the original situation had never occurred in the first place.

I’m the only person that Bella has currently to turn to for anything. This man doesn’t work, he doesn’t have a car or license, and he doesn’t even know which city I live in. If she ever does decide to leave, I would be her safest and best bet, so I don’t want to close that door for her.
I haven’t really asked her about details regarding her romantic relationships since her last abusive relationship, because it’s incredibly draining and stressful for me, since she’ll just turn to me as a person to rant to, and refuse to listen to for advice. The times when she does ask me for advice, she’ll ignore it because I won’t be giving her the advice and approval that she wants to hear.

I’m getting tired, I honestly don’t think there will ever be anything that would convince her to leave him. Bella told me once that she views cheating worse than physical abuse, and then got quiet and upset when I pointed out to her that he has already cheated on her at least twice. 

I don’t know if there’s a much better way that I can approach this and be supportive, so that it won’t be as draining for myself. Would it be wrong to ask her to collect her things? I’m afraid if I do that, she will no longer see me as someone that she can turn to if she ever decides to leave. I want her to be happy, but I still need to put myself first. What would be the best way for me to support her?


TLDR; Best friend trapped in abusive relationship for 3 years now, she moved all of her stuff in with me to leave him, and then proceeded to immediately go back to him the following night. What would be the best way for me to support her and not stress myself out about it?",30Sep2019,1
332,"Hello reddit,

there is this thing that has been bugging me for a while and I signed up for reddit just to get some advice. I am turning 27 soon and I never had a boyfriend. I didn't feel ready when I was younger (around 21-24), and then university got so stressful and I had to battle massive workloads at university and my job, I just didn't notice how quickly time was passing. I didn't have time to make room for a relationship but I also didn't notice how fast time was going by. I am not really a carreer woman though and long to be someone's wife.

I now graduated with a Masters degree and feel like I missed out on dating and making dating mistakes when I was younger. Quite many guys were interested in dating me, but I was so stressed and busy, and they often did not ask me out in a direct, straight-in-your-face kinda way. My main problem now is just that I never had a boyfriend and now I think I looks weird to admit that when dating.

Everyone expects a 27-year old to have dated before, and people are shocked when they hear I never had a boyfriend and I don't have one at the moment. It also doesn't really help that I am really attractive and charming with a good fashion sense - people assume I am already taken and often tell me so. I also have really good social skills and I am a good conversationalist with a variety of interests. Friendly too. I think I'm a pretty good catch, but I fear that people might see me as weird because I was never taken.

There are many engineers where I live and also at my work, so I really see myself ending up with an engineer (they also often share many of my interests). I know that many of the engineers at my company are also single, but I think they might find it weird that I never had a boyfriend at 27, so I'm reluctant to talk about it. I am also still a virgin so it is absolutely neccessary to bring it up sooner or later. I am not asexual, I am actually very curious but don't like one night stands and hooking up with random people.

Look-wise, I can pass for much younger than 27 (most people assume 18-20), so I played with the thought of just lying and claiming I was actually 23 so my inexperience doesn't seem so weird. I don't want to be seen as some sort of 'leftover lady' that nobdy wanted, or like I was not affectionate and unable to be intimate. I was just so focused on university and work that I simply dismissed my relationship needs, even though I had plenty of opportunities at relationships since high school.

I don't know what to do and how to get started with dating, I'm not into Tinder and all that but I thought of organizing a singles meet up at my company (around 600 employees, most are male, so there could definitely be someone for me). I am also more drawn to slightly older men, so the 38-50 range is more my target group.

I would be really really grateful if you guys could tell my if my age is really that much of a problem, or if I probably shouldn't stress out that much. I'm looking for serious relationships, nothing casual.

TL;DR; 27, attractive never had a relationship because of university, still a virgin, is it a red flag?",30Sep2019,2
333,"This is a call for help I have no idea where else to go, I’m sorry

335,"It was always a bit awkward for me when I tried to talk to my brother (not because of him) but maybe because I didn't really know what to say to him, but nowadays I just don't feel like talking to him at all. I'm not interested, it feels awkward for me and I just try to avoid him because of that. 

A lot of the times when he's at home, he sits downstairs or watches tv or something and I'm just thinking like 'just go f\*cking upstairs because I want to play piano with nobody around (or do other stuff)''. And most of the time I just stay upstairs, because I don't want to talk to him or feel awkward (again, not because of him).

336,"I live in a rented semi-detached house with two other housemates. Our neighbours are a family (with an older teenager). Generally things have been fine, except for some explosive arguments that we could hear, all fine though. However, about 8 months ago they got a new dog (I believe a small one like a Jack Russel - never seen it). I love dogs, and have had a dog most of my life until he passed away, so have had a lot of patience with it settling in etc.

However, the dog barks and howls incessantly - as in it will literally continue to howl/wail/bark for hours on end all day and through the night. At first I thought it was settling in etc. But it’s been 8 months, and my experience with dogs has never had that happen, especially if the family is home. They clearly get frustrated with it, and we can hear them shouting at it to “shut up and get in the cage” , and lots of angry commotion, at 2-3 am due to it continuously making sound. In the day they’ll often put it in their conservatory or garden, when they are in, and the sounds can be heard from the local shops (in a 2km radius ). 

I tried to speak to the husband, who is reasonable, but the rest of the family are quite full-on. My housemates and I cannot sleep without earplugs in, and if we work from home have to use noise cancelling headphones if we don’t want to hear the dog. 

Two months ago, having no progress after speaking to them, I reported a noise complaint where they received a letter from the council explaining their dog was making a lot of noise (no repercussions, just a notice). Things got better for about a month. 

But things have gone back to how they were. I’m considering moving early despite the fee (and that I can’t afford to move right now) I’ll incur to be able to sleep/relax. I’m used to some noise from neighbours, but constant noise throughout the night and day, except for a window 3-6:30 am, is too much.

I really didn’t want to take it further than a formal letter raising their awareness, as speaking to them did nothing. 

Is it just me, or is this level of barking unusual? I’m wondering if it’s a young dog and settling in, or if they’re neglecting it (which I think they are). What should I do?

Thanks in advance!",30Sep2019,3
337,"My boyfriend and I have lived in our apartment with another couple for about 3 months now. About a month ago, our downstairs neighbor left a note saying we were too noisy and that he has to wake up at 5 am everyday and we are disrupting his sleep, potentially endangering him at his construction job. My roommates and I were sympathetic and we started playing tv with headsets, wearing slippers, dragging our feet, etc. We also wrote back a note with all our numbers so he can contact us if we were noisy so we knew exactly what caused the noise. The issue is, all of my roommates and I are students and work full time, so we all get home at like 1-2am. So we are making dinner or studying or getting ready for bed at later hours of the night. He has messaged me a few times now complaining about me walking around at about 3 am (I’m usually making dinner and showering at this time). We already have carpet for our floors and have no speakers on the floor and have limited how often we walk. I just don’t know what else to do.

340,"Hello, as of recent I’m attending a new school, my old school said they do not accept failures so I can’t go there, I’m at a new school which is much worse. I’ve been at this school a little over a month now and I still haven’t settled in, I settled into my old school really quickly. This new school is about 5/6 miles from home and the only way I can get a lift is from my grandma who can only collect me at 8:10/8:15 am. The school starts at 8:40, the traffic is bad so I get there at 8:45 most days and the school seems to have a massive issue with it. The school is strict with uniform, you can’t even wear something as simple as vans as they’ll tell you off. It’s a sixth form and everyone wears black vans or Nike. My shoes are black too. The teachers are really stressed out for no reason I don’t understand, one gave me an hour detention for just forgetting a homework in the first week, and they literally watched me do it. I only have like one friend here but I don’t speak that much. I explained this to my mom and all she said was “oh you’ll be fine” “oh school is boring but you have to do it” sort of thing. What’s the best thing I can do? There’s not many schools that will accept me now, my grandma floated the idea of doing school from home, but if I spoke to my mom she will probably say the same old as she does.",30Sep2019,3
341,"I (F20) met a girl the other day (also 20) and wow... I really like her. When we first met we didn’t talk much because we were at a club meeting, but she added me on facebook so I messaged her and we ended up hanging out at her house with her friends. Again, I didn’t get any alone time with her but I was just sitting there listening to everything she said and hoping everyone else would stop talking so I could pay attention and try to find something to say. Lmao

I don’t know how to explain, but she’s one of the coolest people I’ve ever met. I don’t think I’ve had this big of a crush on anyone ever. She has the most beautiful smile and I all I want is to give her everything and DAMN I sound crazy but have you ever felt that way?

The thing is, she lives in a house with her ex girlfriend and they’re really cool about it and they’re really good friends so it isn’t really weird, but her ex girlfriend is the one who really invited me into their group and initiated the gathering and I feel guilty &amp; anxious because I really like this group of people and I have a hard time finding friends and I’m worried about coming off as creepy to the girl I like and jeopardizing my new friendships with everyone. I’m also just super unsure of how to proceed anyway because I have basically no experience with dating girls and I don’t want to make a wrong move and fuck it up. 

I feel like she likes me, but it could just be her personality. I’ve been wanting to talk to her all day but again, I don’t want to come on too strong. I messaged her last prior to us hanging out and that was on Saturday night and I haven’t heard anything since. I have a meeting for a different club tomorrow that we’re both in so I’m hoping I’ll see her and at least get to ask her about her day or something. 

So, basically what I want to know is whether or not I should message her, if the fact that she hasn’t tried to talk to me means anything (which I know you probably won’t be able to answer), if I should try to pursue it, and if you think it would be shitty for me to try to date her given the friendship situation

342,"Hey everyone, I work for Chipotle because I was never able to get a job after 6 months of job hunting, not even McDonald’s called me back. I don’t have an issue with Chipotle but Chipotle works your hands to the bone.

Chipotle is where your boss will be little you for every stupid thing that goes wrong and expects you to do every fricken task in the place while not holding up accountability to anyone else. They will make you work 200% normal speed and will make you shortcut every god damn thing you do. Chipotle is a very gross place that treats humans like cattle and abuses employees terribly. 

Chipotle is so evil of a company that when I worked for A notorious blue retailer known for being “evil”, they seemed like angels compared to Chipotle hell spawn.  At least when I worked for “big blue”, they were very loving bosses and was more easy going. 

Chipotle has some of the scummiest labor practices in the game and rivals even the most notorious gross employers.

About 9 months ago one of our mutual friends was kicked out of home as they were unable to hold down a job and pay board. Now, for context, this friend is in their early 30's - myself and my  partner are in our late 20's.

We offered to take him in while he sorted himself out. Now, in July we moved out of a 3 bedroom apartment to a 1  bedroom apartment for cost-saving and personal reasons separate from this situation. We're now at almost the 12 month mark which is when we agreed he'd go his separate ways, however he still has nowhere to go. 

In this time he's managed to gain a job but lost it after a month, and that's the only one he's had. He's a friendly guy, but doesn't really do much around the house aside from his own laundry. 

My partner wants him to stay longer until he gets on his feet, but I'm really struggling as I'm picking up the slack. Doing the extra dishes. Sweeping the floor from their shoes. They're mostly just watching Netflix most of the day. While I know how difficult the job market is at present, I think he's sort of given up. 

I'm really at a loss as to how to navigate this conversation. I've asked them before to help clean what they use but that didn't last long. I've tried reaching out to my job and peer network to refer him for the occasional job but I stopped after he got turned down twice. I've offered to help clean his resume up but he doesn't really open up to me. 

I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place and I don't know what to do. I feel like I don't get to relax at home. I'm just stuck.",30Sep2019,1
360,"Okay so I’ve had a crush on this guy for about three years. I know that he knows I’ve always liked him. But I think things were never reciprocated because maybe he thought I was too young for him at the time I was 18 and he was 24 now I’m 20 and he’s 26.  He left the country to pursue his dream in becoming a doctor and I needed to focus on my career which was getting my bachelors degree in nursing. After a year that he was gone I moved on and I have a boyfriend now and we’ve been dating for a year but he live in another country, and it’s hard sometimes. My question is should I still tell the other guy I use to have feeling for him? I’ve genuinely just always wanted to know if he ever knew. I don’t know what to do. Should I tell him or just remain with my boyfriend now and never know?",30Sep2019,1
362,"Hey- my(F16) parents are currently going through divorce yet due to personal/financial reasons are still living in the same house. It’s having a pretty big impact on me as they fight all the time and I’m sure it’s having an impact on my three younger siblings too- all of around ages 10-13. 

Recently, my dad tried to get me to sign something saying I’d prefer to live with him (???), didn’t end up signing it yet this is not the first time something like this has happened - multiple instances of similar “who do you like better” questions from either side which I don’t answer because I can’t help but feel like it’s going to be used later when they do eventually live apart and us kids will have to live with one or the other. 

I really don’t know what to do. I’ve asked them to stop involving me and my younger siblings, it’s unfair on me and especially my siblings as I’m not sure they understand the full scope of what’s going on. They haven’t stopped asking. My dad is even trying to “win me over” by constantly leaving me large sums of money (not too large, but $100 every few days is too much for a teen). I’ve taken none of this money and am keeping a journal on everytime it’s offered and that I’ve declined.

373,"Hey everybody,

As I get older, I'm starting to realize that both of my parents are difficult to deal with. My mom is emotionally manipulative and takes advantage of me never standing up for myself. She took it even further and almost tanked my credit by guilting me into cosigning for a car that she never pays on time. On top of that, she's been taking $300 dollars to pay for her and my brother's phone service. My mom, in sum, is an emotionally manipulative leech. 

My dad doesn't do that. He's helped me with the money issues that my mom got me into and used his connections to get me a very well paid job. However, my dad is emotionally abusive. He's emotionally abusive because he often criticizes my clothing or hairstyle if it is different. For example, if I put gel in my hair, then he says I'm gay. If I don't wear khaki, navy blue, white, or orange, then I'm wearing ""shitty colors"" and makes fun of my clothing and throws it away. It's like I can never make him happy. I work with him side by side at the job, and it's like everything I do is wrong. I try my best, and it's like it's never enough. 

My dad has a history of abusing his wives too. He's what you would call a ""nice guy."" He complains about women not liking him for being a hardworking, nice man, and he's a good person for the first few months of dating. Soon, he becomes manipulative and throws away their personal belongings and calls them lazy for not meeting his standards. He also throws a fit whenever they decide to spend time with their families, and if everyone is having a good time, then he'll find a way to bring everyone else's mood down. 

I don't know what to do. On the one hand, my dad helps me financially and got me a job that pays me very, very well. I feel like I owe him a lot for him helping me, but my mental health has has deteriorated because it's exhausting to deal with him. I work with him, and we travel everywhere together. We take the same truck, so it's not like I can leave whenever I like. Also, I have to depend on him financially because we have to pay for hotels and food. I honestly don't know what to do.",30Sep2019,1
374," Since whenever it was I started realising sex was a thing, I've thought about it but never been turned on. I'd have the usual fantasies, occasionally a random dream, maybe see/read something vaguely sexual but never respond to it other than mild curiosity. In fact, I thought I was asexual for a decent two years after having approximately 0 sexual feeling about anything. I'd tried masturbating and it felt alright but definitely too much effort for not all that much. Started reading Literotica, mild response but not really. Watched a bit of porn, absolutely no response.

I just didn't feel it.

Then I got a boyfriend around a year and a half/two years ago for the genuine feels, and suddenly I just wanted EVERYTHING. He didn't initiate anything much, I'd just look at him and say ""I \_really\_ want to suck your dick, like, right now"" and he'd smile and we'd go and do it. I'd drag him off for a random makeout session, I'd start actually thinking about things sexually and getting into it. I was with him for a few rather physical months - we'd be hooking up in some form or another pretty much every second day - and as soon as the emotions faded, it was all gone again.

Same go for boyfriend 2, and then again for boyfriend 3.

Sometimes we'd video call and end up doing ourselves for each other but I never really enjoyed touching myself. I've never been able to come, either with myself or any of them.

I don't know what it is, I've been lucky enough to have pretty good self-esteem which seems to be the turn-to on threads like these and I genuinely enjoy it when I'm with someone else.

Anyway, I turn to you now. Do you have any ideas about what I could do to fix this? Am I completely normal? Should I start trying something else?

379,"Ok, so I've been debating for a LONG time, to post this. (Cuz idk if I'll seem crazy or what) In fact, I've been debating the whole darn thing with this girl I've been talking to for the last 3 years. So I'm a 25 year old guy in LA. And this lady I've been talking to for about 3 years now, claims that she really likes me and wants to see me. She's about 35 and in the army. (Yes I know her name and rank) I've seen pictures of her in uniform,  and out, even one of her receiving an award from a commanding officer. But here's the kicker: I'm NOT sure if she really is who she says she is! In my mind I think either she could be someone who stole her identity, or maybe she just is some sort of scammer either way? Because ever since I've met her she's been fishy. She's always asked me for money and to borrow my bank account, so that she can give me money so that I can send for her to come visit me from where she's been posted. I've asked her time and again why she'd trust me with something like that, (even showing me her bank details, no I'm not mentioning them for y'all scammer/trolls) not like I'm not trust worthy but why take MY word for it!? And she's said ""Well is there a reason I CAN'T trust u?"" But this is so bizzare to me that idk if I'm paranoid, crazy, or both! She's so gorgeous that's why I haven't just blocked her. What exactly she's done to for sure make me iffy and suspicious about this person is they've asked me for $100 iTunes gift cards, twice, and both times they ""didn't get anything, so they must've been fake!""

380,"A little backstory:

I (16m) was pretty good friends with this girl (15) back in 8th grade. We were in many of the same classes, we were in the same after school club, and we talked pretty often. But after summer was over and 9th grade began, we kinda grew more distant. We didn’t really talk at all during the summer, and despite being in a class with eachother, we didn’t really speak to eachother outside of a group project we had once. 

Fast forward to 11th grade, and I begin to try and initiate conversation in one of the classes we have together. She sits by herself, so I thought that’d be a pretty decent time to try and build some type of relationship again. We’ve pretty much only been having really surface level conversations. Just talking about school, mornings, general small talk. She also never really attempted to talk to me. After maybe 3 7ish minute conversations with her on 3 separate days, I decide to try and sit with her, and it goes pretty awkwardly. We didn’t really talk much (mostly attributed to it being a test), and there was just a general feeling of awkwardness throughout the period. 

I felt like shit afterwards, and I don’t really know why. After a few hours, I asked her over text if she really enjoyed talking to me, and if she wants me to continue talking to her.  She replies that she’s been going through a bit of an anti social phase in her life atm, and she’s not really being dismissive on purpose. She then says that there’s no hard feelings between us.

But I still don’t know if I should continue talking to her. I want to try and actually have deeper conversation with her, but I also feel like the reason that she doesn’t attempt to talk to me, yet attempts to talk to other people, might be a sign that she actually might feel uncomfortable talking to me despite her willingness to talk to me when I approach her, and the lack of overt signs she’s uncomfortable when she does.

Would it be best to stop talking to her, or could her reluctance to make an effort to speak to me just because the relationship isn’t isn’t there yet. Am I projecting my insecurities onto the situation? If I should continue talking to her, how do we go deeper into conversation?

I know this might be really dumb and insignificant, and I’m probably overthinking this, but it’s just been consistently bothering me for some reason.

TL;DR: Eleventh grade me got back in touch with a friend from 8th grade that I lost touch with, but the relationship seems one sided. Should I stop attempting to talk to her? Is she just saying there’s nothing wrong just to be nice or am I just projecting personal insecurities onto the situation?",30Sep2019,1

We went to the same school a few years ago but didn't talk to each other, I was attracted to his looks and a friend of mine told me funny stories about him in break time. He didn't remember me and we matched on tinder so I thought I should message him.

The first three dates went pretty well but he texts back really slow and we only met up once in a week. Also the fourth date was a little uncomfortable.

It was the first time we went out to eat and everything was fine but he got slightly drunk after one glass and started flirting with the waitress.

In the beginning it was just innocent talk like ""Oh our bracelets are matching."" but soon he started to ask her where she was from and even called her beautiful  (he didn't call me that once) and I was left out of the conversation, until the waitress started talking to me and not him anymore and then left. 

Now I did something stupid. I didn't tell him that it made me feel uncomfortable and just changed the subject... and he paid for the food so I felt bad and kissed his cheek when we were saying goodbye.

He then took it as a signal and kissed me and the kiss was wonderful (it was my first kiss that was longer and with tongue, actually my second kiss after my first one in elementary school).

After the kiss I felt really attracted to him, I felt like everything was okay and I was very happy in that moment. (I probably catched feelings 🤡)

390,"Recently my company hired a new person to the my department in one of the 3 teams. This person doesn'thave any business background, but instead, a digital media and arts background. So they struggled to understand The job. However, they were not expected to do the full responsibilities of the job at first. Just the supply chain order moves. Basically, moving supply chain orders to the correct fulfillment center. she isn't responsible for managing an email inbox like all of the rest of us are, solving logistics issues, entering system issues, fixing system issues. She basically has 10% of our job starting out. 


Last week, the entire department was asked to help out on a special project on top of our regular workload. The special project was entering in 100 orders with the correct team that should receive and fulfill the orders. My own team personally blaze through it and we got it done quickly. The new hire, since they are only doing order moves and not anything else that's in the job description, also completed it the day after it was assigned. The manager of the team came over and asked the new hire if they would be okay with helping out the rest of her team because they were overloaded with their regular work. The new hire said that she wasn't willing to help the team out because the other members of the team rarely ever helped her, rarely ever trained her or provided her with any advice. Basically, every time she has an issue, she tries to go to other people for help and advice and they're super bog down by their workload and their schedules. but the information she's trying to learn is about things that are not yet part of her job. She's just trying to get ahead of herself and learn things that she's not even responsible for yet. Like order rebooking rules, and order balancing. things she's literally not even responsible for yet that the rest of us are. 


New hire was furious that they were asking her to help take some of this additional work. She said it's unfair because people should help her in return if she's going to help them, even though her job is built around taking some work off of numerous people to create another slot on the team.... To balance the work between team members basically, with the addition of a new team member. So the new hire offered to help two people on the team that she liked, behind the manager's back, and told these two people that she would help only them and not the rest of the team. These two team members obviously thought that was ridiculous. So then, the team distanced themselves from her, with the exception of one person on the team who is pretty much her only friend. Her and this girl go out to lunch all the time and hang out. She came to me with her to tell me that the team basically hates her now because she wouldn't pick up their additional workload for the special project. 


Finally, she told me something quite disturbing. The only person on the team that actually likes her and is willing to be friendly to her apparently told her a dark secret. apparently, this other team member on her team had an affair with another member of the team, and both of them are married with children. this is kind of huge because the team does team building activities and team outings all the time, and which their spouses are supposed to attend. but this doesn't really sit well with me because this new hire only has one friend, and this one friend told her this secret and first thing she does is go and start blabbering about it to me. It's kind of been saying to me because the new hire only has one person that likes her and considers her a friend, and tells her this secret in confidence, and the first thing she does is start telling other people... Even though it's something incredibly damaging to her friend, and to the morale of the team. 







TL;DR: New hire with limited job duties tells manager she won't help out overburdened team members on special project because they don't help her. Offers to help 2 team members only but not all of them. Starts gossiping to members of other teams how her team now hates her for not helping them, and how mean they are. The new hire's only friend shares a super secret with her about how she had an affair with someone else on the team, both of which are married and have kids. Extremely damaging to the team and morale. The new hire tells me this.",30Sep2019,2

Obviously, the moment Chloe got home she freaked out and called me. I had planned on being there when she got back so I could explain but I misjudged the timing and that didn't work out. We met up in public to talk things through and I explained my reasoning for leaving. 

She apologised for making edgy jokes and told me that she honestly didn't mean to scare me but she's a sarcastic person with an edgy side and she thought I understood that. I said I did understand and I've made some edgy jokes myself in my past but it went deeper than that. I told her that a big part of the reason I was leaving was that the trust was gone thanks in part to what she'd said about James. I didn't tell her I'd gone to the police at that stage. She immediately started to freak out, getting tearful and angry all at once. She asked repeatedly why I couldn't trust her that it was better for me not to know. I explained that James was my closest friend at one point so I had some kind of moral obligation to investigate. I also told her that I knew she'd lied about him moving back to his family and that the story about him going to Europe seemed completely unfounded. 

Chloe remained tearful for a long time and we just sat there talking it out. She said that she didn't understand why I'd overreacted so much as to move out and throw away a long relationship based on one argument. I kind of see her point but I saw this as an opportunity to get answers. Maybe it was shitty of me but I told her that I'd reconsider if she'd tell me once and for all what the situation with James had been. Eventually, to cut a long story short, she told me that James had confessed to her that he'd been having some seriously inappropriate sexual thoughts. He was in therapy for a form of OCD related to compulsive thoughts about minors. Chloe went on to state that she believed James was lying about his OCD and she believed that he was actually a pedophile. She said they stayed together for a while but she couldn't cope with the knowledge and she worried because there were kids living on her block at the time. She claims that she gave James an ultimatum- leave and never come back or she would expose him as a pedophile to everyone in town. 

I don't know how to feel about this. I've done some research into that type of OCD and it seems like all professionals agree that there is no sexual attraction and it's just a severe unwanted anxiety but I don't know enough about psychology to say for sure. Either way, it's disturbing. Once I got home I left a voicemail for the officer on James' case and he called the next day to go over the details. Didn't seem very interested. 

Anyway, I told Chloe I needed some time to think and she asked to see the dog. We arranged that for the next day and actually ended up spending a lot of time together over the next few days like we were dating again which was slightly weird but honestly quite pleasant. That all came to an end around a week or so later when I woke up to several missed calls from Chloe. The police finally contacted her and asked her to come in for a conversation. She essentially called me a psycho and said there was something seriously wrong with me for taking things as far as I have. I'm starting to wonder if that's the case too- in the course of a few months my entire life has changed all over a suspicion but when I step back and logically look at the timeline of events I feel less like I've overreacted and more like there's something to the theory. 

Chloe told me that she wasn't driving almost an hour out of her way and into another state just to talk about something that happened eight years ago. I told her that was her decision but I'd appreciate it if she did, if only to clear her name and give her side of the story. I don't know if she has gone in to talk to them because we haven't spoken since. She went on to block me on all social medias and I'm told she's made a Facebook post about the situation claiming that I'm blowing it out of proportion. Maybe I am. 

James is now on some missing persons database which is a good step forwards. I've spoken with his sister a few times and she's thinking of reaching out to some YouTubers who run campaigns for missing people to raise awareness so if anything comes of that I'll let you all know. The police investigation is slow at best but they've supported the family with declaring him officially missing. We've put up posters in the town we lived in and the family have an email address for tips now. Honestly, most of the work is being done by the family. The police don't seem too interested. I know this was eight years ago but the circumstances are fucked up enough you'd think they'd want to investigate. 

Anyway, that's all I really have to update you on. Nothing else is happening. This situation made me wonder about my own family and I did send a letter home but haven't had any response yet so I'm not sure if my parents are interested in reconnecting. I'm just trying to focus on my friends and career for now and put this behind me. It's a sad chapter. If anyone has any questions I'll try to answer them but I feel like this is as far as we're going to get. Whatever happened to James the evidence has probably been lost over time. Whether Chloe was telling the truth about his problem or not I'll never know. It's her word against his and he isn't here to speak for himself. It's in the hands of the law now.",30Sep2019,54

I'm part of a group of ""friends"" who i have been hanging around with especially over the last 3 months however they do a lot of things im quite uncomfortable with drug related. i'm okay with bit of weed but they do excessive amounts of recreational drugs but not the really harmful ones like crack, meth etc. anyway i really do not want to be around them when they are a certain way, sometimes they can be great and i have a blast when around them however sometimes i really do not like being around them yet they are the only friends i have and if i flat dropped them i would have no one so i'm kinda trapped on how to deal with this situation. one of them who is my closest friend also has become someone who i find more to be a pain in the ass than the others. he actively disrespects me around all of his friends and would rather argue his defense rather than see my POV when i have tried to talk to him about it and has openly said to me he considered himself better than me in some aspects.

399,"Hey, so I am new here and this is my first post in reddit, so please don't be harsh on me. I came here for any advices or inspiring stories and because I also don't have many friends to talk all this through. I will try to keep this short and clear however, I tend to get carried away.

First short background: I live in UK, however I am not British. Lived here over 7 years now, graduated from university and stayed in the same job for all this time. I am in my mid twenties and started to seek for professional career, however in past months I met lots of personal struggles that I find it difficult to overcome...

I am really introverted person, so staying in the same job (which btw was food retail/customer service so cannot milk much valuable experience out of it) was like a safety blanket. Not the most exciting job and I can't say I enjoyed it thoroughly, but it did pay the bills. Also, as introverted person this routine and familiarity satisfied my emotional needs. However, after graduation my friends started to get it into professional career paths while I was still in my ""student job"". Some of them also started to make comments how it is easy to get something better and it is ""kinda embarassing"" to stay in the place I worked in... 

So, this summer I made a decision to leave the job, get a month of holidays and start looking for more professional opportunities. 
I was so motivated and ready, I even got an interview for a company I REALLY wanted to work for within a first week of leaving my previous job. I was so excited, I thought it could not work out any better, get a new job so quick without much effort. Unfortunately, I was crazy nervous, I blew the interview and did not get a job. This rejection messed up with my head so much. Of course I was unsuccessful in previous job applications, but it always was after application process, not the interview one.
This made me so scared to apply for jobs because I do not want to get rejected again... I look at the requirements in job ads, and I say to myself: ""well I cannot do that or that, so no point to apply"". I literally have no self- confidence in anything I do. Also, as I said before, because I am introvert I find it extremely difficult to involve myself in co-working situations, meet ups etc. I do not meet new people, I barely have any friends close to me and all I can do is just to blame myself.

This also starting to have effects on my health. I am getting chest pains, can't sleep properly, feeling nervous  and overall feeling weak and unhealthy. And I kinda like to think that is all in my head and it can be changed. I read self help books, I try to learn new skills to enhance my resume, I try to better myself, but it still does not work with self-confidence thing. I just don't think I am good enough. I have a wonderful partner who is supporting me and tries to make feel better about myself by saying that I am awesome or funny or smart. But I see it as just as someone being nice rather than meaning it.  It is a shit feeling thinking that you need validation from others but I just can't see it for myself..

I have been stuck in this mindset for couple months now. I have not applied to a single job ad since the rejected interview. I live from my savings and my partner's support and that makes me feel guilty because I was supporting myself from age 18.

P.S. 
I know my situation is not the worst and some people genuinely struggling to get ANY job because of discrimination, disability, upbringing, not getting chance to go school/uni etc. And they would be the happiest if they could get a chance to have a job that my friend has called ""embarrassing"". I know that, and it makes me feel even more guilty for having self-doubts etc. And yes, I have roof above my head, I eat food etc. And you could say ""oh but if you really WERE struggling you would have survival mode and would do anything to get a job. Haven't you seen 'Persuit of happiness'?"". 
But I am not struggling in this way. I am an average person with extreme lack of self-esteem/confidence who wants to better self with getting a job that allows me to gain knowledge, builds self-worth and makes four years of uni to pay back.



So please, fellow reddit'ers tell me your success stories in life. Especially if you are/were struggling with low self-esteem or confidence issues. Or how not to allow you introverted personality affect the social life which is needed to build better connections..",30Sep2019,1

401,"So, I suffer from frequent panic attacks and one thing that calms me down is calling my friend to talk about it. I messaged her today to ask if we could talk in a call but she said she is super busy and that she promises to call me later at night. Well, she didn't, and didn't even message me about it either. Would it come across as needy if I just messaged her?",30Sep2019,2
402,"I'll put it simply; I'm a bad friend. 

More often than not lately, I'll find myself purposefully ignoring messages for friends who need emotional support, or for friends who need help in general, right away and reply later when it suits me to either help with the emotional support, or to say I can't help with other support. I don't do this all the time, though, I do generally help my friends, it just seems like when it doesn't suit me or 'I can't be bothered' i'll blow them off. 

An example of this happened today. A friend of mine needed help finding her cat, who has been missing for two days, and although I knew fully well how much she loves her cats I didn't find the urge to help her at all; I knew I should help, that I shouldn't ignore her or give an excuse just because I didn't want too ( I was also in some pain but it's definitely something I could have had some painkillers for and been fine), and that I only didn't want to help her because otherwise I knew my whole day was free to do ... well ... nothing; and yet I didn't help her. 

To add to this, I know I'm a lazy person. I often don't do things because I'm lazy, and I know that part of the reason I didn't help her was because I was being lazy; but now, it's really starting to bother me. I can see how it's negatively affecting my friendships, and I can see how people are becoming annoyed and angry at me, which they have full rights to be, but I just have no idea where to start on fixing this? 

Otherwise, I am usually a very empathetic person; but I just can't help but feel like something is wrong with me in the way that sometimes I just honestly don't care, I've even caught myself in my head saying 'I don't care' to situations, and how it's leaning on being borderline apathetic? It's like sometimes I don't understand why I should care? 

Does anyone have any thoughts on how I could fix this? do I need to see a therapist or something? I really do want to help my friends, and stay friends with my friends, but I really don't know how to get past this?",30Sep2019,2

Ok so I went to a house party last weekend and caught up with some of my mates that I haven't sen in awhile. I had a good enough time though there were a pair of wankers that didnt leave me alone for the a bit of the night. I didn't drink anything as I was driving that night but I was smoking a bit of weed I have a pretty high tolerance but I had like two and a half to three joints to myself and a dry herb vape so I was suffecitly high (leagal where I live). My friend 'Dan' had brought his sister along and it feels like we have had chemistry since I had been to his house party earlier this year. I had got blackout drunk that night and I woke up in her room. We didn't do anything but I could just feel a vibe almost that she wanted somthing to happen. I just put the thought in the back of my mind and rembered that 'Dan' was my good friend. I also thought it would be wrong to persue anything as she is two years younger than me F=17 M=19 leagal where I live but fround upon I think? at the party we were flity I was a bit reserved as I smoked a dick ton of weed and so was she. Well the wankers that I mentioned earlier were trying to fuck anything w legs including the sister. The wankers also happen to be Dans good friends. If dan didn't care that they were trying to get With his sister why would he care if I did. She texted my first after the party and we got to talking (online) and she is giving super obvious hints and literally told me that she was into me. I pretty sure I would be her first actual bf.

406,"I have kind of been lost for a few years now. It came to the tome of deciding what I want to do as a career path. I chose to study as an Architectural Technologist just because my dad owns a building company and thought I would work with him.

I started University last week. Yes it is hard and I am clueless. However, that’s not really the reason I want to leave because I know if I put my head down I can study and understand it. 

I’m just lost. This isn’t really what I want to be doing with my life. Yet I don’t know what else I could do. I tried to explore my hobbies but nothing interests me. I’m really ambitious and goal oriented (if that makes sense), as in, if I have to achieve something then I will, I have a clear vision of how I want to live my life. 

But I just don’t know what to do. I’m honestly thinking of leaving university. Going to work. I’m kind of into investing. Cryptocurrencies and such. I really wanted to learn Forex at one point and still do but I just kind of forgot about it during the summer. 

I was away for most of Summer travelling to different countries with friends (by no means am I rich, I worked a ton on top of college to save up for the holidays) and I loved it. Going out to restaurants everyday, relaxing, visiting different places, exploring. But I know I can’t just live under my parents roof, save up money and just travel. Sure in the future. 

I honestly don’t know what to do with myself. I’m stuck in my uni accomodation after I finish uni for the day and have sleepless nights just overthinking, I’m very unhappy.

Recently, my mother has been accepted into a job, with the employer waiting for her response to make it official (contract signing). My mother doesn't want to sign it, though, because of the reasons of: 1) the job may be too much for her to handle and 2) too far from our house and expensive for commuting. Personally, I feel terrified of what's in store for our family in the next months as we are living off the contract ending fee she received from her last job back in June.

So anyways my fiances brother in law helped get me another job at a different sonic in lancaster tx well i called and talked to the supervisor of that store and when i talked to him i was told by him that i would be getting 50 to 60 hours a week. And with me moving to this sonic i still kept my position of assistant manager and got an increase in pay i now make $11.00 an hour well since i started working here i havent gotten the 50 to 60 hours a week like i was promised I only get 40 a week. The gm that was working for this store got fired for things she was doing before i even started working for this company. I only worked under her for about 2 and a half weeks before i helped the new gm get her job here. Well when the new gm came in i had explained to her that i was promised 50 to 60 hours a week from the supervisor and she had told me that i cannot have those hours because thats what a gm works and it wouldnt be good for labor.

414,"I got divorced this year, after 15 years of marriage. Aside from the absolute loneliness and depression, one of the big things I’m having to deal with is this overwhelming sense of bitterness. Throughout our marriage, I did whatever I could to encourage her to grow as a person and experience new things and have fun and not be this tightly-wound ball of anxiety that she always seemed to be.

I encouraged her to exercise and lose weight (I would cook for her and prepare her weekly meals and go to the gym with her), I encouraged her to do new things, try new things, go new places, meet new people, and have fun. But she always seemed to say no to everything. She never wanted to do anything at all. She was boring, and everything she tried, she would fail or give up at it. Everything I suggested would be met with reasons why not.

Here’s the kicker, though... as SOON as I was out of the picture, everything changed. Suddenly she is just... going on road trips, getting tattoos, hanging out with friends instead of socially isolating herself. She just got back from a 10 day road trip to Colorado with her *cough* “friend” (who she is probably sleeping with, if I had to guess). She talks about how she would like to try smoking weed, when before she absolutely *hated* it and would get mad at me for suggesting she try it. She’s lost a ton of weight and is now wearing makeup and doing her hair and actually taking care of herself. She’s doing all the things that I encouraged her to do for 15 damn years.

I just don’t understand this, and I don’t know how I’m supposed to see all this and not feel like just dying. The messed up thing is, she was happy *in our relationship* but miserable with herself. And it was her being miserable with herself that ultimately pushed me away.

It’s been weeks since I’ve last talked to her and explained that the friendship is over, so why am I still so salty? 

I find myself checking her social media all the time, to see if she’s subtly posted anything that’s rude and directed at me (she used to do that very often when we were friends). I avoid parties that I know she’ll be at, even though I have some really good friends that are at the party. I’m still so angry with her, I don’t want to be around her BUT I want to find gossip about her, or talk shit about her. She really hurt me and it was a fucked up relationship. I know it’s for the best that we aren’t friends anymore. 

But how do I let go of the toxic feelings? I want to move on so badly but I’m not sure how.",30Sep2019,1

423,"Hey so maybe this belongs on r/AITA but Im after opinions or advice on whether I acted out of place and how to rectify it.

I go to a sports club which meets in a local community hall once a week. I’ve only been going for about 6 months but love it and up till now the people were really friendly. 

Three weeks ago the treasurer announced the club was on financial trouble, unable to meet the rent for hiring the hall, which turned out to be ridiculously high for what we get. 

I’ve had dealings with running previous clubs before I moved here and suggested we applied for grant funding from our local town council, even sourcing them the forms. Now as I’m new I didn’t want to submit this so left it out there. 

Since then the treasurers not been to the club or contacted anyone via our email list. Another guy and I have been canvassing with adverts to post numbers. The other committee members seem to have buried their heads in the sand with one regularly bemoaning  the situation but not acting to help, didn’t even take a couple posters. The secretary seems to be gunning for the club to “close while we attract new members”, which frankly sounds ridiculous but his view is we carry on as we are (in a deficit) or close it. He doesn’t come often and because he travels around goes to similar clubs all over so hes not going to be affected by its closure. 

I’ve spent the last two weeks trying to help by finding alternative venues or suggesting changes the committee should sign off on but no one will engage me. The secretary shoots down my proposals and the last straw was yesterday where I put a butt hurt reply to his latest shooting down of a proposal saying I have no further cases to make, they aren’t going to be able to carry on at present as they are and I’m done.

Since then one guy I got on with really well has stopped replying to general messages, another actually blocked me on messenger because I asked his opinion on what we going on and the rest seem quiet. 

Did I do wrong, should I care or try to rectify it in any way?",30Sep2019,1

This is a bit embarassing to share, please bare with me. Also english isn't my native language, sorry for any spelling mistakes. If anything is unclear, feel free to ask. 

Recently my boyfriend asked me to try something new with him and have no issues in trying out new things, so i agreed and asked him what he imagined.
He basically wants to try ""face fucking"".
Now, i wouldn't have any issues with that, if i wouldn't be super petite, which i unfortunately am. Since i am tiny, everything about me is tiny aswell - including my mouth.
I already dislike giving head, cause it makes my bottom jaw hurt (imagine opening up your mouth as far as you can and hold it like that for several minutes), but i still try my best to make him happy, cause seeing him happy makes me happy too. 
Another issue I ran into is my gag reflex, which is super sensitive. I am scared to gag and accidently bite him. I love him and don't want to hurt him. 
I already voiced my concerns and he told me he will be careful, but i am still super unsure and scared.

Is there anything i can do to make the feeling of being scared disappear? Or is there anything i can do to not gag/potentionally hurt myself or him?

Thank you in advance.",30Sep2019,1
429,"I recently had my 10 year high school reunion and was looking forward to seeing Margo, a girl I've been having a crush on for a while. 

Nothing happened between us back in school, but we recently got back in touch and started hanging out regularly. She began being kinda flirty with me, saying she was looking forward to drinking and dancing with me at the reunion and so on. 

The other 3 players in the unfolding drama are Trevor, a good friend of mine; Dave, Margo's ex and also a good friend; and Heather, Margo's friend.

Margo and Dave stayed friends after breaking up, and I planned on making sure he was ok with it in the event of something developing between us. 

We met at the reunion and started all drinking together (Me, Margo, Trevor, Dave and Heather) and having a good time. That was until we all began dancing and Margo and Trevor started making out like two teenagers. I was kinda shocked by it (she also kept giving me these ""I'm sorry"" looks which really didn't help), but Dave was devastated. He left 10 minutes after that.

It was kinda childish of me, but out of spite I tried my luck with Heather, and we ended up going to my place while Margo and Trevor also left together.

Next morning comes and Trevor writes me to absolutely not tell Dave that he and Margo slept together, implying some kind of drama between the three of them ensued after ths reunion.

Now here are my questions.

1) Should I tell Trevor that he, as a friend of Dave's, should come clean with him about the whole ordeal? 
2) Should I forget about Margo, seeing as she chose Trevor over me and was also kinda disrespectful towards er ex by making out right in front of him?
3) Should I come clean with Heather over why I hit on her?

431,"So I planned an epic birthday trip with some friends at the start of September and before I booked anything, I triple checked the prices  with friends for hotels &amp; activities with notes on what total trip would be with food/tips/etc. Friends were on board with everything. Fast forward to being on the trip and the day before my birthday when one friend texts me, while we are all eating lunch together, to say that he’s going to need some time to pay me back. Now the week before he had been in a car crash where he totaled his car. He was totally fine but will need to get a new car. Now I want to be flexible on this but at the same time I’m moving to a new state so I’d like to get the money from him sooner rather than later since he owes me about $2k. 

I’m not sure how best to follow up with him about the fact that he needs to pay me and while I want to be sympathetic, I have costs of my own. I know his dad has a lot of money so I was curious why he wouldn’t ask his dad for a loan to pay me back so he’d owe his dad the money instead. This “friend’s” behavior during the trip showed me his true colors in other ways apart from not paying me back so I’m not keen to still be friends but I want to be sure he pays me back soon. 

TL;DR: palmed a birthday trip with friends and triple checked total prices with friends before booming anything. Day before my bday on the trip one friend says he’s going to need some time to pay me back the $2k. I’m moving to a new city and would like friend to pay me back ASAP.",30Sep2019,1

He also basically told me we should have seen if I liked it where he is before I gave my notice(he knew I was giving it and even asked how they took the news). I told him I’d probably like it and wanted to be there with him. His response was “you know I’m gonna be working a lot”(so far he’s been working 11ish hr days and some weekends)Then started saying something about me being alone there(don’t totally remember what it was)

437,"Hello Reddit,

Not sure if this is the right place for this but my wife needs a bit of advice. We live \~1-1.5 hours from the city where we both work. We get up at 6 every morning to get ready, let dogs out, ect. in order to get to work by \~8am. We live in a snowy area (Buffalo) and there is construction starting everywhere, so lately my wife (who gets dropped off) has been arriving at 8:15-8:30 instead of her usual 8am. 

Last week some new construction by our house was posted to be starting this week. This would add another 20-30 mins to our commute as it cuts off our main route to the highway. She asked her boss, ""Rather then being docked as late everyday, can I just come in at 8:30 and stay late if I need to. I always work through lunch and almost never take a break anyway. I will also stay until 5:30."" Her boss said, ""No, you have to be here at 8am.""

My wife then reviewed some other people around the office. There are about \~30 employees at her company and 5 in her department. Out of the 30, roughly 10 come in later than 8 and in her department 2 come in later, one at 8:30 and one at 9am because they have kids to get on the bus. One stays late to make up the time and the other just leaves on time and works 35 hours instead of 40.

My wife went to human resources, which is almost the owner (small company), and he said it was ok and he would talk to her boss last week. Upon arriving to work today, my wife just texted me that ""No, they said I have to be here at 8am, no expetions.""

Is this illegal?  They are making special arrangements to allow some employees to show up late because they have kids but my wife is told no because they don't feel her reason is good enough. What kills me most is that her workplace has a high turn-over rate. Most employees last \~1-2 years. My wife has been there 5 years and is their longest employee in her department yet the people who have been there less than a year are allowed special treatment. What also makes me laugh is that her boss, the one who is saying no, used to show up at 11am everyday when they were in their old office because it was far from his home. Now that they moved offices (3 months ago) he shows up at 8am everyday because its closer. 

What can my wife do? I mean, other than find a new job. She really likes her company and her job so not sure what her options are here... But is it legal for them to allow some employees to show up late without consequences but tell my wife to be there at 8 or shes in trouble? Isn't that favoritism or something?

This resulted me in being very skinny for my age(55 kgs/~121 lbs)and also pretty short(1.65m/~5.4 feet).I know I can grow taller because my dad is about 1.9m/~6.2 feet(I am already taller than my mum).I also want to hit the gym(I used to go to the gym but I was super exhausted after and couldn't really push myself then -most likely because I don't eat).I really want like an eating program with which foods to eat, to avoid, when to eat, etc. My goal is to grow a little taller and get in shape(some muscular mass would be nice).

Also, my spine isn't straight. Especially at the bottom and around the neck. Pretty sure I have the hump, and maybe Scoliosis? I need to know if I can attend gym like this in the first place and not hurt my spine even more. I kinda talked to my parents about this and they told me they'll get me to a physical therapist.

458,"I wanted to post here to get an unbiased opinion.

Basically when we first moved into our current property, myself and my two flat mates didn’t pay council tax because I was a student and was exempt. 
When I graduated I didn’t immediately find a job so I was on benefits for a short time so we received a reduction on council tax.
Recently I’ve been earning enough so that we’re not eligible for the reduction however, my two flat mates haven’t been earning anymore so they think I should pay the extra myself.

I’m in two minds about this - I don’t want them to pay anymore but I also feel that we all agreed to live here and we only got reductions due to me so I don’t see why I have to pay all of it.

460,"So I'm a student in India and about to be done with med school in a couple of months.

 Now I was thinking about moving to the US for better job opportunities and a better work life. Because being a doctor here in India absolutely sucks. The work conditions are usually shit, and the pay is not good enough until you've been a doctor for at least 10 years. The work hours are also insane throughout the career because of no properly set regulations. 

My family life is pretty good here though and my parents  make decent money and have a house which I'm sure they would let me stay in as long as I want if I decided to stay. And they're pretty supportive of me moving to the US if I want. 

My concern is that life in the US is not as good as everyone makes it to be. I keep hearing about random shootings and people declaring medical bankruptcy.  I just wanted to know whether I'll be able to live comfortably enough as a doctor in the US or not. 

Also another one of my main reasons to move is so I could live independently. If I stay here I'll be dependent on my parents a lot.

463,"When I went through school I was bullied a lot, i have vitiligo, a condition that changes the pigmentation of your skin creating blotches. I am constantly anxious, always, sometimes I'll be in a perfectly safe space and be dripping with beads of sweat for no reason. 

My mom told me she was bringing me out to go shopping and get a haircut. That's when my anxiety kicked in, I wish it didn't, and I was able to just go to public spaces and feel safe, but when my anxiety kicks in it's like I've stalled... like there's a million thoughts going through my head and I cant turn them into action.

My mom got angry and started saying things like ""what's wrong with you that you cant even go outside!"" ""Your weird"" ""I should have used the belt on you more as a kid!"" ""I always thought you where autistic!"" 

All her shouting obviously forces me further and further into my head making me feel incredibly low and worthless, making any chance of me going anywhere absolutely 0. 

Whenever I was at school and was getting bullied the only advice she ever gave me was to punch them, get in fights with whoever was bullying me, so basically, get in a fight with every boy at school...

467,"Title says most of it however I will provide a backstory. Apologies for formatting, since I'm on my phone.

I'm F16, never been all that great in school. My first day of kindergarten I basically had a meltdown and sobbed so hard I made myself sick. I ended up leaving early that day. Repeat said pattern for a lot of elementary school, end up getting a little better but still horrible issues with going to school and constant meltdowns.

Middle school rolls around. 6th grade, more breakdowns, diagnosed with anxiety and a panic disorder. Start homeschooling, too unmotivated and depressed to apply myself to it. So I go back to public school, cycle repeats.

High school though. High school has been absolutely hell. I was hoping maybe this was a fresh start, I'd be better but even with therapy and medication I'm nothing but worse. Failed my first semester because of the only 4 allowed unexcused absences. Have to redo four classes (and I had high B's in most except for math, somehow), find such out on the first day of the second semester and have an absolute breakdown in class. Sent to the nurses then sent home. Muddle my way through second semester barely passing with 3 unexcused absences and constant days spent in the nurses office from having panic attacks over the sheer fact I'm at school, not helped by the fact there is also 1500 people at said school.

Then comes sophomore year, I think, hey maybe just maybe it'll be better. Freshman year was only bad because it was a new school. Five weeks into the semester and I've used 3 of my absences. I've been in the nurse weekly due to panic attacks and spent half my time in the guidance office freaking out. 

I asked them what I can do, how I can continue my education without having to show up all the time since it clearly isn't good for me. Homeschooling, they say. The thing that has failed before for me. The thingy I'm unable to do, since I'm so depressed I can't motivate myself to finish my school work much less allowing me to just do it 'whenever'. They're completely unhelpful, telling me I just have to 'work through it' even though that's not really worked in the past. 

So, reddit, I come to you. Has anyone ever been in a situation such as this? Any other forms of schooling that might work? Or at least advice on functioning? Programs or whatever else?

Tl:dr - Constant panic attacks and breakdowns are making school hell. Need an alternative or advice besides homeschooling.",30Sep2019,1

I once again didnt do any of that and come to find out a dude in my friend group told my girlfriend too that I had asked the other girl to homecoming as a friend which I did because supposedly my girlfriend was going with her friends.

I had on going feelings for her that were getting in the way of our friendship so we mutually agreed to take some space apart to reset our feelings and hopefully we can come back as friends.

472," 

I fear for her. I know what she is like, she will submit for a while because she wants to prove to herself that **she** can, and **will never, ever use the safeword because to her that would equal to being a coward**  (she is an elite police officer and a long-time adrenaline seeker).  Eventually, however, she will grow tired of not talking to me (despite  the relationships, we were always each other's BAE),  and proceed to  bash his head in with no warning whatsoever. Now, I am afraid that her  idiot bf will do something to her (or me) to prevent this. But I also  know that she will be very unhappy if I try to ruin her newest  ""experiment"". But, this was going on for a week now, and, despite having  a girlfriend of my own and uni to worry about, I feel like half of  myself is missing, and I know she feels the same way. (we usually talk  2-3 times day, and apart from one time when were fighting and didnt talk  for two months before reconciling at the prom, where we abandoned our  dates, we were never out of contact for more than a couple of days. Now,  I feel her recklessness will get her into a problem, because **her boyfrend is more of a psychopath than a dom, but to her, that is the ""true"" BDSM experience.**

**Update!**  I realized people are telling me about incomplete information, and they  are right. So, I feel I should post our previous history. She was raped  at a party, at 17, and when most others were only worried if she was  pregnant, i was the one who found her, who swore right there and then I  would never see her harmed again. A year later, she saved my life in  riots during a football match. if it wasnt for her, I would have been  stabbed in the neck.  And this is just the tip of the iceberg. We lived  through as much shit as a battalion of Vietnam vets, always relying on  each other. We are each others to-go person in all cases, and we have a  trip planned, which I cannot cancel nor go to by myself. Also, apart  from being sexual, we shared everything. Its like being siblings, but  closer. Her mom calls us two souls in one body, I say that she is my  sword, and I her shield. Also, this guy was arrested multiple times for  abuse in vanilla relationships, she actually met him by being one of the  arresting officers.  She said that he is simply misunderstood, and that  those girls couldnt take it a bit rough. She talked to me extensively  prior to this decision of hers, and we agreed that I look out for her,  and we agreed that I am to know what is happening to her. I mean, I cant  really do that without contact. I mean, I am into some forms of BDSM  myself, in both roles, and this is something I would never agree to.  Even her mom, who is our mutual confidant in everything, is worried  because she avoids me. She is still in her family home most of the time  luckily, but that can easily change. I will probably just ask the rest  of the squad to look after her, to see if something changes. Besides, I  am quite sure that she will call me in a few days anyway, orders or not.  i am just afraid that when she decides to leave, she doesnt end up not  having the opportunity because her bf is an abusive bastard. Also, that  one person who said she doesnt care about me, or that I have feelings  for her.. Well, we both broke several relationships because our partners  couldnt accept our connection. Also, yes , I do have feelings, and I  also have a duty, a promise to keep. I told her, when she was battered  and bloody,barely awake, that I would be there for her. And I will. Even  if it ends up destroying our friendship, I will not see her in hospital  again. She deserves better than that.",30Sep2019,0

477,"So...I have only 3 irl friends left. And I consider it lucky to have them cause I hear about people my age who don’t have friends, sometimes going into extremely longs periods of depression anxiety and suicidal thoughts.

However When I am interacting with One of my friends (we’ll call them Player B) I feel like they see me as...dumb and lame and their remarks cause others to see me as dumb and lame  (Doesn’t happen on a regular basis but it happens from time to time)

Even though I try to roleplay, enjoy, and interact with DND world as best as I can (especially since we only can meet on a monthly basis, player B (who has been playing the most out of all of us) kept remarking out loud that I ‘didn't Know how to parent’ or didn’t know how to lie’ in the game (to give some context, my character is parent and last session My character failed to lie).  I wish she should would rather say ‘here let me take over -I’ve got better skills’ or ‘I see what you mean, I think this is a better way to approach it’. Instead out outright embarrassing in front of everyone.

At the time I didn’t say anything to her and just keep quiet for most of the session, even though the DM kept asking me what was wrong ).  I really wished I had stood up for myself, cause I’m dreading it will happen in the next session.

 I told my mom about it and asked what I should do - she says the next time player B (or anyone trying to put me down) does something like that, I should say the following:

 ‘we all bring different strengths and weaknesses  to the game - I may not know much about parenting or lying (and those are also skills the character I play as lacks experience in), but I can bring other strengths to this game and to our team, such as strategy or role playing.  If this game becomes something where we are only pointing out each other’s flaws and just not having fun, then I think we should stop or take a break)’. 

But the thing is I’m starting to loose sleep over this and our next session is tomorrow evening ; I keep worrying that i’ll end up ruining the game or my friendships - or that i’ll Forget what I have to say and just keep quiet again.  

I really want to go back to enjoying DND since I’ve seen my character grow and develop, and (like me) still developing and growing, and learning - and telling me that failure is ok as long as you are learning and moving forward.  And I really want to go back to having a good time with my friends cause they have always been a safe play for me when family and school issues were too much to handle.

Sadly being told ‘you are dumb’ in more ways than one at the table is nothing fun to look forward to",30Sep2019,2
478,"Okay, so the other day a text came up on my moms phone from a guy. I have been really suspicious of this guy for a while, because my mom kept their conversation secret and would delete the texts every night. My mom was away from her phone at the time so I checked it. ""Good morning beautiful"" is what it said, all previous texts had been deleted.

I was worried but asked my mom directly if she was cheating on her boyfriend, she told me no convincingly so I sorta believed her. Thpugh when she wasn't looking, I screenshotted the messages, sent it to myself, deleted it from her phone, and deleted her message to me.

A lot later, she was taking a shower, and I looked at the texts again. It was obvious that they weren't just friends. The texts went as follows: m=mom g=guy
G: good morning beautiful
M: good morning hansome
G:How are you feeling today *sends picture of himself*
M:mmmmm much better now
G: hehe
M: Do you want to see me friday?
G:yes ma'am
M: good deal, I'll be headed yout way
G: can't wait
M:me either

482,"I’m 17 and she’s 13. She was born when I was 4 years old. My mother showed me how to change her diaper, make her bottles, put on her onesies, etc. and that’s what I did. From the day she was the born I was feeding her, changing diapers and clothes, holding her until she fell asleep, and when she woke up in the middle of the night I would try my best to sing her back to sleep because her crib was in my room. I did as much as a possibly could as a 4 year old because my parents were always too busy or tired. As she got older this never changed. I made sure she was up in time for school, dressed, had breakfast, packed her lunch and when she got home I helped with homework, made her dinner, and tucked her in at night. I did just about everything. When she was sick I was the one sitting up with her at night when she couldn’t sleep. I was the one washing her clothes when they were dirty. I was the one that got her back to sleep when she had nightmares. I was the one she came to when she needed advice. I was the one at every single one of her school recitals. I taught her how to ride a bike, swim, and tie her shoes. I did everything our parents should have been doing. My dad left when I was 15 and since then my mom has decided that any responsibility that she did take for my sister was no longer her problem and spent all her time running around with different guys. Last year my sister got really sick and nobody knew what was wrong with her. I made sure she was at all of her doctors appointments and took all of her meds. She was home sick constantly so I dropped out of school and went to online school so I could be home to take care of her. She’s doing better now and that’s all I could have hoped for. I thought everything was starting to turn around when she started to get better. That changed when my mom sat me down and told me that she had found someone and that they were leaving.

She’s gonna wait a few months until my 18th birthday so she doesn’t have to take me with her. I don’t have the money to keep her even if I could get custody once I’m 18. There’s nothing I can do to stop this. I don’t know what to do and I feel like so can’t breathe. Genetically she may be my sister but I raised her and that is my little girl. Our relationship is much more like mother and daughter than siblings, even to the point of her slipping up and calling me mom sometimes. I have raised this girl for 13 years and she’s just being ripped away from me. I feel like someone is stealing my baby and I just have to let them. I’m going to miss so much of her life. Telling her what was happening was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do. All I could do is hold her and tell her I’m sorry while she sobbed and begged me to find a way to get custody of her. She’s having a really hard time with this and I can’t fix it and that kills me. I feel like I’m having a breakdown and once she’s gone I don’t know how to live life without her.

I used to be good at studying and work hard but somewhere along the way I just stopped caring till the last minute.

Like I went to secondary school, then college, applied for uni, didn't get in and rather than calling other universities, I just gave up.

 It's just me and a parent who never got a education so they can't help and just kind of expect me to sort it out, and I just can't unless I'm specifically told to do something

This may be nothing or something many people go through, but I feel as though this will affect my future in a big way.

Like I have late enrollment into uni after a year doing nothing coming up on monday and all I can do is stay up at night and think of lies to tell my parent for why I can't go to uni but at the same time not disappoint them. 

I'm telling myself it will be 3 years of my life then done, I should just go, but even if I do I'm not confident of doing well at all with this mentality.

I doubt I'd get any advice I just wanted to put my problems in writing and try to sort my head out when it's past midnight on Sunday. If anyone has anything they can chip in if you've been through something similar or just some advice for your experiences that you can add it would be very appreciated, like I'm nearly 20, I feel like I should have my life on track at the moment and be enjoying life.

Edit: I've decided to go and just try to sort myself out, like I have nothing prepared and my parent just expects me to go tomorrow. I don't know where to go since apparently my course will start on Monday when I haven't even been fully enrolled, don't know how I'll get there, how to show my previous results and anything to do with finance, or even who to talk to or what to say at reception, but I'm just gonna show up since I've been accepted whatever that means. Again just trying to put down where my heads at and just get it written down so I can work through it systematically since its midnight and I should wake up before 5 to get ready and start walking I guess. I really just don't want to be going.

Will probably post back tomorrow if I decide to go or if not then Tuesday. If anyone can just wish me good luck or anything really would just be very appreciated thank you.

Edit 2: Monday afternoon right now. I plan to go tomorrow definitely. Got everything ready",30Sep2019,1

495,"Hi, I'm a 22 (m) who recently graduated from a state school majoring in graphic design and public relations. I did well in school and graduated with honors and did all the necessary things like getting internships and other design-oriented positions. Throughout college, I worked part-time at a local bank to pay the bills and to have some spending money. After graduation, I went full time at the bank as a teller and the work environment became very toxic and the scheduling became too overwhelming (6 days a week open to close) because of short staffing. I just recently quit that job and are continuing to look for a full-time design position with a few thousand dollars of savings. I am lucky enough to be living at home with my parents rent-free for the time being. A majority of my friends who went to school for business or more technical degrees have already found jobs.  I am currently in a state of panic at all times, I'm feeling stuck in my life, it has been 4 months since graduation and my loan payments will be starting soon. I feel like I'm fucking up my life somehow and it's giving debilitating anxiety. I'm not sure what kind of advice I need but I am just freaking out at all time and I don't know why.",30Sep2019,2
496,"Some backstory first:
I'm 18 years old and about 2 years ago a fell in love with my first real female friend. I loved her more than anything else at the time but she didn't feel the same way about me and rejected me. We stayed friends but I still had feelings for her. A month later she stepped into a relationship with my best friend without telling me anything and since then things have just gotten worse. They broke up 6 months later but it was hell for me. 

When she broke up with him we started hanging out more and I thought she was going to be a life long friend. But since then I have kind of thought about everything that's happened between us and I don't think she's a good friend at all. She never says nice things to me, rarely starts a conversation, never hugs me, and overall just gets me down all the time.

I don't have feelings for her at all but I still love her as a friend and all I want is for us to be nice to each other. Don't get me wrong, it's not like she doesn't care about me or anything like that, she does spend a lot of time with me and we hang out all the time. She tells me everything and so do I. But I just feel like she is being really mean to me and doesn't show any type of love or affection. She isn't that type of person either, she is a lot better to people she isn't even close with, and that ALWAYS gets me down. I've tried talking to her many, many, MANY times but it always comes down to me being the problem.

I know it might not sound like a big problem or anything but I really love her and she is pretty much the only person outside of my family that I truly care about. All I want is for us to be great friends and always stay that way. But things are looking pretty bad right now and I might have to step away for good.

501," I am 19 and just got my first job at the beginning of the month working in retail (and yes I know it sounds late to get a job but I was thinking if I focused more on college I would do better) but I decided to get a job.  

At first the orientation seemed to go really good and I felt like this was going to be a decent job. But then once I actually started I realized this isn’t for me. I have social anxiety and work as a cashier which is a pretty simple job for the most part but the talking part and asking is hard for me. I try to push through it and I do to where it seems like i am the most outgoing person in the world but the fact that my performance is based on how many credit cards I get someone to get in a day... it’s so hard.  

With my social anxiety after I ask the first time to a customer and they say no I just can’t get myself to ask again. Which leads to me not getting any cards and my hours cut. My hours are already soooo little so it sucks. But my managers keep pushing me to get the cards and won’t get off my back about it. I feel like I’m a failure if I don’t get them.

And on top of that I’m the only one working the cash register shift so I am basically by myself working. I haven’t made any friends only acquaintances. Meanwhile everyone seems to be the best of friends there and there I am by myself not even getting the chance to make friends and having to help customers on my own.  Because I’m always working the shift alone.

Can someone give me advice on what I should do? I feel lost and feel like if I quit then Im just a quitter who quits when it gets hard and I should try to push through it. But at the same time idk if I can. I was thinking about applying to a different job and seeing if I could get it but if I quit I probably wouldn’t ever be able to walk into that store again because everyone would be judging me for quitting only 3 weeks in.",30Sep2019,1

But now as the year goes on, im starting to re live my bad habits from last year. No matter what assignment I have, I procrastinate the shit out of it. When I come home and supposed to do my homework, I just lay on my bed and go on my phone for an hour. I have fixed this problem by leaving my phone far away from me. But when I start my homework on my school laptop, I end up watching youtube. Whenever I try to actually get any work done, after 15 minutes I end up making a new tab and going to youtube. Some homework assignments I don't do some assignments all together. For some classes, homework is due friday at midnight.

505,"About 7 years ago my parent got a divorce and a particularly long (3 years) and grueling one.

After all things were said and done, my father immediately found a partner on match.com and they have been dating ever since. My father is an extremely wealthy man making roughly 300k a year. He did some awful things during and prior to the divorce that has taken up until about a year ago to even consider forgiving him for. My sister, on the other hand, has been seeing him for quite some time now and lives at his house almost full time whereas I have almost always stayed with my mother (who never really had much to start and left the divorce with even less) or with friends and whatnot. I have been speaking and visiting with my dad recently and I truly want the best for him and for him to have a life of health and happiness, and I genuinely thought that he was getting this from his new girlfriend.

About a week ago, I got a call from my sister saying that she went out and impulsively got a tattoo, this is her now third. My father has always been super strict and quite aggressive and sometimes violent with us about never getting tattoos of any kind. The last time she got a tattoo and he found out about it, she had all her belongings thrown out of the house along with the house locks being changed along with the obvious screaming and cursing rant of how much of a fuck-up she is and will always be, as she was leaving. He has since apologized apparently, and she has since forgiven him.

My stepmom will never step in to calm him or do anything after and this is nothing new, she stays quiet and acts like they are not happening in all of our fights, no matter if they are physical or just dumb little debates. My sister was curious and wanted to know why she never stepped in and what her personal opinion was on tattoos one day. She replied with an extremely jarring statement which was... “Listen, I know both you and I want the same and that is to marry rich, and with those tattoos that’s all you can do now.”

I have always had the thought she was in it all for the money since the beginning, but she has been a decent person and has given me no reason to think she has any malicious intent until she stupidly admitted that to my sister.

My sister is an insecure 20-year-old with horrible abandonment issues. She said to me that even though she knows about how fucked up that is, she still feels like she is lesser now because of the tattoos and can't survive on her own without a man. I love her so much but I am so confused on how to go about helping her in this case, doing the best thing for my father and his happiness, and getting the gold digger out of our lives.

506,"Ok, so im 16 years old and i met this girl in my freshman year of college and i really like her. I was unsure in the past about my bisexuality but seeing her i'm pretty sure i have romantic feelings for girls too.

So, at first i liked her more as a friend but as i spent more time with her i began to like her as much more. She always flirts with me and compliments me and i do that too, but i can't really understand if that's her personality or if she likes me back.

We message each other a lot and she told me that at the moment she doesn't have feelings for any boy, but i know she finds boys attractive, so it's really confusing. Maybe she's also bi and is shy to tell me about the fact that she likes me, or maybe she sees me only as a friend, that's why i haven't told her yet.

I have many friends from Japan and everytime I go I have a blast but that might just be because I'm on vacation. Living there could be completely different and I might not end up liking it afterall.

525,"Hello all, I would like to get some perspectives on the situation I’m in right now with my girlfriend. So just some quick backstory:
I’m a sophomore in college and she is a junior. We have been dating for 9 months. She’s the first girl I’ve ever been in love with. I have never been more vulnerable and honest with somebody in my entire life until I started dating her. She’s funny, caring, and all around the person I would want in a girlfriend right now. However, this past summer she went through a lot of family stuff (very controlling and manipulative mom) and she’s not back at school this semester. She’s at home taking classes at community college and working this semester. And she lives 2 hours away from me. 

Fast forward to now, and she’s 99% going to a different college in the spring. The college is 2 hours away from me, but I don’t think I want to keep dating. I do love her. I really do. I care about her so much. And right now, she’s so excited about life. This past summer there were more tears than laughs, and many nights were spent on FaceTime (we lived in different states over the summer) crying. Now, she’s been applying to internships, and she’s sooo excited about going to her new school in the spring (she has some drama with her friends at my school so it’s appealing to her to get a new start). And on Friday night she was visiting. We were snuggled in bed having a great convo and she started to talk about next semester and how she wants to go to this new school and she was so excited talking about it. And then she asked me, “would you still want to stay together?” At this moment, it was 12:30am and she was spending the night. She still has a lot going on with her at home with her family. And she really enjoys “getting away” from it all to visit me. And in that moment, I did say “of course.” But I realized I don’t actually want to. As much as I love her, I’m starting to discover some things about myself. I’ve cut down on drinking and partying and have focused on meditation and spirituality. Although she’s supportive of this, she’s not to into all of that at the moment. (Which is expected because she’s focused on trying to figure out college and stuff) in some ways, she is sort of distracting when she comes and visits. I enjoy meditating before bed and reading. And I also like waking up kinda early to get a start to the day. However, when she’s hear, we usually sleep until 10/11am and smoke a little weed or drink (I still smoke and drink a little even when I’m not with her). It’s tough because I want to get up and read and meditate and she wants to sleep in and hang in bed with her boyfriend who she only sees a couple times a month. Another thing is that last spring everything was great. We lived right near each other and spent time together when we wanted. It was bliss. But also I have realized that it’s never going to be like that again. She’s going to a different school. I will never be able to casually text her after a morning of meditating and reading and say “hey you want to get some lunch?” Everything is much more complicated now. 

Part of me wants to break up with her now but I also love and care about her and want to be there for her while she’s going through all that she’s going through right now. While the other part of me wants to keep dating her, and wait until she all settled into her new school to break up with her. 

After this weekend I chose to view things as “a summer romance” that ends at the end of the summer. We can still love each other and everything can be pure, but we will break up once she begins next semester. But also I was thinking that’s unfair to her. Because she was talking To me about what I want to do for my birthday (which is in January) and possibly doing a trip for it. I truly don’t know what to do. If anybody is still reading this, I greatly appreciate it. And any advice anybody has to offer is great. I recognize that I’m only 19 years old and don’t know every answer.",30Sep2019,1

My mom doesn’t have anyone she can talk to about my dad, so she talks to me, which I don’t mind listening but I’ve told her to maybe see a counselor or something like that, so you’re not crying to your daughter about her dad. My dad always complains to me too, and I’ve had it. I know people say it’s better to stay in a marriage, but if it’s causing so much stress on everyone, I think it’s better to divorce. I have been the middle man my entire life, and I can’t take it anymore. My parent have seen someone about their marriage but that didn’t last long. I’ve suggested maybe a therapist for them, but nothing. My mom has suggested divorce for years but has never acted on it, i just want to tell her it would be the best option for her.",30Sep2019,1

My grandfather was a sexual abuser, a really horrible man. Really did belong in jail for what he did to me, and I’m sorry but I do hate him. He took away my childhood. That being said, I never had the courage to stand up to him until recently.

He has Alzheimer’s ysee. He doesn’t remember who I am, or what he did to me. In the few short years his health has declined, he’s become frail and useless, and has pretty much forgotten everyone in the family. I was made to visit him recently, as he’s pretty much on death’s door at this point. And I dunno, I guess seeing him so weak and dumb gave me a boost of confidence? So we he said something that triggered my anxiety I completely went off the handle. I screamed and called him a pig or something, I don’t really remember everything but I do remember saying he’s gonna burn in hell soon and never see his wife again. Really REALLY mean stuff yknow. I remember wanting to punch him, but I had enough sense not to.

From my family’s perspective, I’m a terrible human being. They say it’s like I basically petrified and innocent, confused old man, because after all he hardly remembers anything at all about his past. And I guess they’re right? I’m sorry, I dunno what to think. My friends say I’m completely in my right, no question. I thought my anger was justified at first too, but if I really just took away one of the only remaining peaceful days from an innocent man, then maybe I am a bitch after all, yeah. I really dunno.

533,"17M here. In my last year of highschool. Growing up, I was an outgoing kid. Was able to to up to pretty much anyone and introduce myself. Lived out in a small town. My parents split when I was 8, and they moved into seperate houses in a nearby city. Went to my dads for a week, then my moms for a week. My dad became depressed and pretty much became an alcoholic, constantly told me (at the age of 10-11) that he was living in hell and wishes he could end it. He was slowly losing my brother and I, and his girlfriend was a trap. Had a kid within a month and they moved in together and he got screwed over and can't leave her or he will own nothing. A lot of this really fucked me up as a kid. Stopped going to his house at the age of 13, lived with my mom. My mom had a pretty mentally abusive boyfriend, who finally was kicked out when I turned 15. I was and still am mentally messed up. Was told multiple times I'm living a lie and should kill myself, and was constantly the target for my previous step dad. I have a much better one now. But it doesn't fix the past. I have so much trouble talking to people at school and making friends. I use video games (probably too much) as a coping mechanism. I do well in school, finish all work because I don't really open my mouth, then come home to about 7 hours of video games until I go to sleep. I go to the gym, have a six pack, try to eat healthy. I'm a normal weight, have a bit of acne, but for the most part most people I know say I look pretty good. Not sure if it's out of pity. I like video games a lot, and music that almost no teen likes today. I enjoy old stuff, Metallica, Green Day, My Chemical Romance, blink-182, etc. Every teen now just likes the sex and mumble rap. I've tried just about everything I can think of. Counselling, local events, meetups, friends of friends, and some others. Nothing helps. I don't vape, smoke or drink, and don't really want to be around people who do. It narrows my selection a lot because everyone has to do it to be ""cool"" and ""popular"" at this age. I'm very competitive with the games I play, and usually only play ranked. I'm above the average rank on every game I play (Season 10 Grand Champ on Rocket League, Apex Predator on Apex Legends, Prestige Master Level 800 something on COD:BO4, etc) so the very rare time I find someone in real life who maybe plays a half hour a week of a game I like, I play a game or two of casual with them and then go back to ranked. I can't seem to find anyone with the same interests. Maybe it's because of my ""standards"" or ""tunnel vision"" if you will? I just find it very hard to go out with people after using so many hours of video games as a coping mechanism for so many years. I've also tried many, many YouTube videos, Audible books, and things of that sort on how to ""open your mind"" or find people you want to hang around. It doesn't help me. Sorry for the long question. Any advice helps, thanks.",30Sep2019,2

There was also (what I imagine to be) feces cakes on the walls, and floor. And the bed smells putrid. Like rotting urine, and meat.

Recently I met a girl afterschool in the cafeteria. After around 30 minutes of talking, I asked for her social media and she gave it to me.

553,"Just a little background on myself… I am a 25-year-old social studies teacher in New York. I’ve been considering a career change for a couple years now.. I’ve enrolled myself into a post bacc program at Columbia University for premedical studies while I teach and know that I’ll need to commit to one or the other sometime soon. To be honest, I just need some fresh perspectives on the matter I think.. the salary here in NY is pretty good for teachers, starting at 60k/year and around 25+ years you cap out at 150k/year. This is with full benefits, pension etc. 

I really do enjoy medicine, maybe not so much the prerequisites like physics and chemistry.. but I’d like to become an orthopedic surgeon. I’m having difficulty committing to one or the other in totality. 

With teaching, I am a bit unsatisfied with teaching the same content year over year, just becoming some sort of storytelling parrot.. but I do love the kids, and working with them to help them learn. As a teacher, I can start my life way earlier than if I became a physician. I’d be able to only work 180 days a year, and have time off for a family and to enjoy many different hobbies (travel, which I love). 

With medicine, I’d be able to have a different challenge everyday, being able to save lives and I’d be able to learn absolutely amazing things about the human body that very few people on this earth have the opportunity to know. But it means sacrificing any and all free time, no more hanging out with friends, being poor because I won’t be able to work while in med school (again, I’m a social studies teacher, the sciences don’t come innately to me, but I do have good wrote memorization). This also means not able to start a family for the next 10+ years. 

I’m just not really too sure which direction to go and would love to hear different peoples takes on this. I don’t want to go through life saying I should have done xyz. But I also don’t want to regret potentially walking away from hitting the lotto (it is EXTREMELY rare to get a teaching position where I live bc of how well paid they are). I would appreciate anyone who has a bit more wisdom than me on what they think and why.

560,"im just gonna launch right into this. 

So i just moved 1000 miles away to go to law school. I moved in with a girl who is also a student, and we got to be pretty close friends quite quickly.  The first night we got here, however, I introduced her to my guy friend, who is also a student and is arguably my closest friend on campus (we had known each other before we came here, and coincidentally ended up attending the same med school).   Naturally, they hook up the first night they meet each other, and continue to hook up for quite some time.

Fast forward three weeks- he sends her a text saying that he doesn't want a relationship at this point (med school is tough) and that they should stop hooking up FOR A LITTLE BIT.  And yes, that ""for a little bit"" was capitalized.  My roommate freaks out a bit but is not worried long-term; she has grown to actually like him, and given the fact that he still flirts with her all the time, she is convinced that they'll start hooking up again before too long.  And for a while, I think the same thing.

This is where it gets messy.  My guy friend invites me over two nights ago, saying he wants to talk to me and ask for advice.   Being his friend, I go, but my roommate asks me where I'm going, and of course I don't lie.    He and I are friends, and there's nothing weird about us hanging out alone.   So I get there, expecting him to ask me for advice about my roommate, and he immediately tells me that he's hooked up with THREE other girls in their section (this means that they all have every single class together) and that he's still consistently hooking up with one of them.  He doesn't want a relationship with her, either, but the reason he broke things off with my roommate is because he didn't want to be hooking up with two girls at once (despite the fact that he's still VERY aggressively flirting with my roommate. lol.)  He also said, however, that he still did want to hook up with my roommate- that is why he was asking me for advice. At the end of this conversation, he swore me to secrecy.

I yelled at him for putting me in that position and didn't prescribe a course of action for him, but at the end of the day, I know this information now.  My roommate has already asked me what he said about her, and I said that he still didn't want to hook up as of right now (true) but I left it at that.  She is now continuing to pursue him, and is flirting with him so hard that I just feel bad.  She would not be doing so if she knew he was hooking up with this other girl- she thinks he really likes her.

I don't know what to do.  I am friends with both of them.  He's my close friend so I don't want to betray his trust (yes, i know he's an asshole, but he's always been a very good friend to me. and despite his terrible actions his heart is in the right place. he's jut stupid) but I also know that this information WILL get out and she will find out that I know (based on the fact that I went over there the other night).  I care about her feelings too, and I live with her, so i'd like to keep this from getting messy.   Please help me.

Random facts to consider:

1) My roommate is insane.  I like her, and things are going well now, but she is absolutely crazy and if I wrong her she can make my life miserable.  

2) All the other girls know that he's hooked up with multiple girls, but my roommate thinks that she's the only one he's been hooking up with.

3) If I didn't live with her I would 100% be his friend over hers.

4) If I tell her, I would probably have to give up his friendship.

5) She is BEAUTIFUL and could date any guy she wants here (and deserves better!) but since she's so into my friend, she won't move on.",30Sep2019,1

563,"This might not fit with the overall mood of the sub, but I'm having some issues dealing with this situation. 

I bought from a man second hand white goods. I think this is what he does for a living. 
He was a lovely man and super helpful. However he sold me a fridge that it's incredibly noisy when it runs and I live in a studio flat so it's annoying me. 
I read reviews online and apparently I'm not the only one having the issue so it's not because it's second hand. 

I texted him and he was very nice about it saying he would change it and also told me he had a sofa I'd like for the flat. 

Last time he replied was on Wednesday. He told me he would call soon. 

He's not called yet and I texted him on Friday to see what was going on and got no reply. 

Now, I really wanna get another fridge and might invest some quite money on a new one that I'm sure will be quiet, however I want my money back or at least I want him to pick up and give me another one. 

I don't wanna insist and phone him, because he was a nice man and dont wanna harass him but I also think that if that's what he does for a living , this is part of his job to look after costumers.

566,"Recently I met a girl after school in our school cafeteria. No one else was there directly talking to her and I found her sorta cute, so I took my chances with the dance coming soon. After around 30 minutes of talking, I asked for her social media and she gave it to me. Later that night, I asked her to the school dance as friends. She acquiesced to my request, and for that night we flirted heavily, indicating interest on her part as well as mine. The next day, I took her to a café near school where we continued to interact. I had also told some of my closer friends about the dance that day. However, people began to assume we were a couple when they saw us walking to the café, and so the rumour spread across the school. When it reached her, she backed out from the dance and since then, when I've texted her, she's been very dry. What do I do?

568,"Last year, my boyfriend and I, as well as a couple friends, moved into a house together. One of our friends owns the house (inherited it from his late grandmother). At first it was just me, my boyfriend who we'll call Babe, and our friend who we'll call LL. By november, LL was wanting to move one more person in. He had already moved in one of his friends who was friends with Babe at one point, we'll call him Ghost(he's rarely home). Babe and I weren't real thrilled at the prospect of living with ghost as babe has before and he's an overall POS. I found an old friend of mine that needed a place, we'll call him IR. Anyway, since IR moved in we've had multiple issues with him, the main 2 being that he comes on, cooks(using LL's new skillet because he's too lazy to clean his own), and doesn't clean up. Dishes will sit for weeks before I get pissed and do it myself. Tdd he other issue we have is his friends coming over unannounced. As in he invited them but gives no warning or notice. Babe works late(9 pm usually) at a manual labor job. He's exhausted when he gets home. Frankly so am I but mine is more mental. IR is a grown man(24) and he and his friends play games like Sonic and whatnot. Fine, whatever. The sound effects are loud and obnoxious on the games and get on everyone's nerves, but they play it like they're in middle school still. Constant yelling over each other, cursing screaming, etc. LL has asked multiple times that he warn us before bringing them over as we want to come home from work and relax but can't when we have overgrown teenagers in the house. IR has had his brother spend the night, again with no warning, and when I get up the next day, brother is downstairs in nothing but his underwear in our kitchen. It's been like this for months and LL has gotten annoyed but refuses to say anything or if he does it's in passing and IR brushes it off. I sent him a message last night, but Babe is over it all. Said next time his friends are over with no warning, he's telling IR they need to go somewhere else because we're done with uninvited house guests. I don't want the conflict.

569,"I am really needing some help about what to do in my current situation. I was told this could be the best place to find it. 

Ok so I currently work as teller for a bank. I make around 12.50 an hour and I've been here for 3 years. Due to mostly the pay and other reasons I am looking for another job.

I went on indeed and applied for a job that was 15 to 25 an hour as a sales associate for a jewelry place. So I applied because I have sales in my history of work. 

I got an interview and turns out its actually 12 an hour plus bonus and commission that equal up to 15 an hour. The bonus is meeting goals. I asked what goals are set to make this bonus and all he said was hours.

They offered me the job on the spot even though 32 people applied and have yet to be interviewed. 

Its about 20 mins from my house and I have bills that add up to about 1200 a month. 

They offered to do part time for my training while I'm still at the bank. So after I work a full shift at the bank I have to drive there for a couple hours of training. 

I haven't signed anything yet and I keep getting this gut feeling to back out. But that could also be my nerves. I'm so used to a set schedule and I would be looking at different times everyday.  Plus longer drive and no weekends off.

For more context she was recently on my side and then suddenly shifted without reason. I'm not sure what's going on really, but I want to move past it.

578,"I won a competition in June for clothing. The criteria was simply just comment under a Instagram post and you will be randomly chosen. I commented just for the sake of it with no expectation to be chosen. I ended up winning to my surprise and delight.

I dmed them and chatted a bit on where to send it etc. Due to me being in the United Kingdom they told me they would have me to pay a shipping fee of $30 dollars even though it was a free giveaway. I was wary of a possible scam but due to them not knowing I was from the UK before being chosen from the UK and knowing previous customers who had no problems I went through with it. The worth of the clothing was around $150 and I liked them enough to go through with it anyway. Why not it is still a good deal. At this point I was told to send the shipping money through PayPal as friends and family not business. I was skeptical at this point and in hindsight mad at myself as you cant request refunds if you send through as friends and family.  I sent it through as friends and family and was told I would be sent tracking the next day. 

Its been about three months since then and I've had multiple other conversations with them which result in the same: Me asking multiple times for help which they will only respond after like 10 messages, them promising to send it the next day, not sending anything, repeat. 

Is there anyway to force them to just send me a refund now? I dont even care about receiving the product anymore. Ive asked multiple times for a refund and they just dont respond.

579,"Hi.  So I have a bit of a problem.  I hate my wife's ferret.  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE animals!  I have quite a few and so does she.  But it's this ferret.  Well, frankly, it's every ferret she's ever had, but they just seem to get worse after every one.  

So background: My wife loves ferrets.  Adores them.  I get her one for her birthday.  She's happy.  But I'm miserable.  The ferret gets into everything, poos everywhere, and annoys the other animals so much that it is impossible to let him around any other animals (he pulls on the other animals' nipples or crotches or tries to crawl on top of them.)  The worst part is, I can't get her to control him.  Well, honestly, she doesn't quite have the time.  She works in construction and is gone from 8 am to 6-7pm most days including some weekends.  And she's too exhausted to control him either I think.  

But I just remember telling her that if I got her this ferret, that he would be entirely her responsibility and she said she could handle it.  But she really isn't.  He's my responsibility, which wouldn't be so bad, except that any training I give him, she undoes when she is home.  She coddles him to the point where he refuses to listen to me.  In fact, I'm pretty sure he does some of the stuff he does just to piss me off/instigate a reaction.

Bottom line, I don't want to hate him, but I do.  And for every ferret that we've had over the years, I've hated too, not really because of them, but because she hinders any progress I make to the point where they become untrainable.  I would like to request some advice on the matter on how to go about things.",30Sep2019,2

I feel so out of place and insecure. I have no friends, which wouldn't bother me as much if it didn't make some things harder like finding a seat at lunch or grouping up in classes. The most social interaction I get in school is saying a few things to a girl who I aid with in the library. 

I hate being told I'm whatever for my age. I hate being told I act like I'm older. I hate hating people or not being friends with people because I refuse to let my standards down for someone who's just being 13 or 14. And I think I could solve most of my social and emotional problems if I just acted my age and stopped pretending to be thirty four or whatever. I hate feeling above everyone because I thought how they acted was stupid. It's only just going to isolate me and make me hate myself even more.

584,"I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts for about 3 years now, but have never tried to act upon them. Where I come from, visiting a therapist is considered something only 'crazy people' do, and I personally don't have any means of going to one considering I'm a poor college student living on my own, and there isn't one available on campus.

My family has a long history of dealing with depression. My Uncle, who I was pretty close to, committed suicide when I was 12, and my older sister tried to commit suicide about 5 years ago. Both these experiences marked me, and are probably the only reason I haven't killed myself yet, simply because I don't want to subject my family to the pain of having lost someone they love in that manner, having been known them but not what they were going through, having been unable to stop it.

I've slowly started resenting my family though. Everytime they're out riding a car or something, a small part of me wishes that they can all die in the ride so I can kill myself afterwards. Usually I just wish I could die in an accident, but I'm starting to wish for their death too. I don't know how to stop it. I live alone in college, and everytime they call, I just can't stand talking to them. Being home feels suffocating.

Please help, I feel terrible, I don't know what to do. I don't want to tell my parents that I'm feeling suicidal, because I'll most likely get pulled out of college and asked to move back in with them. I especially don't want to tell them all that I wish they were dead. I don't have any friends and no one to talk to about this.

588,"Throw away. 

Ever since my parents retired (they’re well off), and ever since I’ve become an adult with a decent paying job, my family has gotten into the habit of going to upscale restaurants to celebrate birthdays, etc. It’s something we do because it’s fun going out and because usually the food is amazing. 

The problem is that my parents have absolutely not etiquette skills whatsoever. My mother will burp at the table, gnaw meat off of bones, get way too drunk and act silly... one time she got so drunk she had to lock herself in the washroom to get sick.. Last time my mother even joked about how she didn’t have any class, while imitating fancy people holding a cup with her pinky in the air. Whereas my dad, who is a little bit better, will dip his bread in the butter (instead of using the butter knife)... they’ll eat off of each other’s plates... and generally make a mess at the table. He’s also a terrible tipper -  for example, I’ve seen him give $20 for a $300 meal, which quite frankly is insulting. For this reason alone, I insist on paying every time. 

Please don’t get me wrong, my parents are otherwise lovely people, who’d give you their shirt if you needed it. And I’m not angry about any of this.. Any other context, I wouldn’t care...my parents can do whatever they want, they’re adults. But while it was fun at first, I don’t know if it’s old age, and them not caring anymore, but these experiences have become unbearable and embarrassing. And quite frankly I don’t want to go with them anymore. I just don’t know how to tell them without insulting them (they absolutely will be insulted if I tell them the reason). Asking them to take an etiquette course is not an option lol.

590,"I'm a bagger at my local Grocery Store. I've been there for an entire year and I have requested to become a Cashier for some time now. I'm friendly to every costumer, I do what my bosses tell me without question, I have an extremely open schedule, and since I've been there for a year I have seniority over the new employees. In the past 4-5 Months 5 of the new employees have become a cashier and I have not. Since I want to bring this up to my boss, I asked the new cashiers what they applied for, since they were Baggers and only been there for 3-4 months. I only asked since people that have applied to be a cashier would have a little more leverage of being a cashier before me. 2 of them apparently applied for Deli and Grocery, so its unjust for them to have been cashier trained. About 1 month ago I confronted my boss about it when 3 new employees became cashiers, she told me that there would be a 2nd round of the training in 2 weeks and that I was scheduled. Well come 1 month later and I'm still not trained. I understand that the original trainer transferred from one of the stores to another so they had to train the new lady to train them. Unfortunately I have some disabillities. I have Type 1 Diabetes, Autism and some mild Depression. I was venting to one of my friend/Co-workers and he said its probably because of my disability.

She was telling a small group of friends all about how unappetizing the food was and how all the traditional red envelope gifts were “like the mafia” and super weird etc — like it was inherently hilarious just by virtue of being what it was. It was hosted by his grandma who died last year. For the record, she and I are white and he is Asian American-Chinese/Korean.

Over this two months we would do everything a couple would together( go to party’s, hangout with friends, watch football games and tv together and would still cuddle all the time, she would always say things like “you’re so cute”) then randomly says she had feelings for me again. One week later I’m back to the friend zone, and she made it clear I was. Then since we are “just friends” I was telling her about a girl I was attracted to and was thinking about hitting up, immediately changes her mood and gets crazy jealous, telling me “go talk to your other hoes” etc... and now I’m just so confused because she made it clear we were just friends but is jealous like she’s my gf. I don’t know where to go from here, all my friends are stumped. any advice moving forward would great appreciated!",30Sep2019,4

600,"My best friend (29 f) has been seeing an older guy (early 40s) on and off for the past 5+ years. The entire time he has seemed hesitant to commit to her, and was (sometimes openly) seeing other women at various times throughout their involvement. However, the past year or so she has been led to believe that they are exclusive. This all came crashing down a week and a half ago -- she discovered he has been cheating on her with a 19 (!!!!!) year old who works for him for over a year. Meaning this second relationship literally started when the girl was in high school, which is pretty effed up regardless of the infidelity aspect. I found the girl's instagram and it is FULL of pictures of them together. 

I gave my friend my opinion on all of this when she told me. As someone who's been cheated on before, I basically said, please protect yourself, you don't have to stay with him, cheaters don't change, etc. Maybe the emotion was too raw for her when I said that stuff, but she didn't want to hear my perspective and insisted that the future of their relationship was something she had to decide for herself. I decided to respect her request for space and didn't pursue the topic further. The only other thing she said to me about the topic was that the guy expressed remorse and ""didn't realize"" he was capable of hurting her like he did (?????)

This past Saturday, a little over a week since the news broke, she texted our mutual friend, who I was with at the time, that the dude was over, they had been drinking together, and they were ""talking it over"" and he was ""just an idiot sometimes."" Uggghhh ... this was devastating news for both of us, because we don't think she should still be with him, but neither of us knew how to respond.

So this morning, I check the 19 year old's instagram page and BAM look what it is, a picture of her and the guy posted on SATURDAY. Taken Friday night at a concert. The day before he came over to my friend's and they ""talked stuff over."" 

What do I do? Considering she has already made it clear she's not interested in my take on the situation, should I even tell her? I feel sick :(",30Sep2019,1
601,"I'm a husband, father, and home owner.  I'm the sole bread winner.

I also hate my job.  

I'm good at my job and it's a secure place to work.  But I've been looking for work for a year.  I've done a pro/con list of whether I should stay or quit my job: I should definitely quit (at some point).

&amp;#x200B;

I have a job offer.  It pays a little more with worse benefits, but here's the thing.  It's less secure: as in the company has been laying off people annually since 2015.  If it helps, the Company I'd be working for is HP in Corvallis, and I'd be working as through another company as a contractor.  

&amp;#x200B;

Last night I decided to keep my old job because of security.  I woke up this morning sad and depressed about going to work.  I felt defeated and almost hopeless.

602,"*I'll try and concisely list my problems so it's easier for everyone to read. I'm sorry if it seems like I'm dumping a laundry list of problems, I don't usually seek out help and have no idea how to approach it.*

My employment history has huge gaps &amp; a lack of further education, which makes my CV/resume look very unappealing. The 'best?' job I have on there was for 2 months working IT support at a law firm, which I could not handle.

Most of the gaps are due to depression/suicidal periods in my life &amp; if I were ever confronted about it during an interview, I would have no idea how to explain it.

I've tried to take advice such as 'mention personal development', ""talk yourself up"", but I cannot bring myself to lie or exaggerate. There have been literal year periods where I have just existed in a room living my life on a computer and have nothing of value to talk about in terms of extra curricular activities and such.

I wouldn't say I don't have potential, I've been told I'm intelligent and all that junk but I don't feel wise/sure enough to actually figure out what I want in terms of a career. I have no clue where to start and get easily paralyzed by indecision and multiple possibilities. I'm way too self-critical and can't seem to get out of that mindset.

I cannot afford counseling/mental health services. Those of which that are free, I believe do not prioritize me on account of appearing to be well-spoken/dressed/self-aware/not desperate/ enough during assessments, despite feeling suicidal and worthless every day. It could be that I'm just not looking in the right place or advocating for myself as much as I should.

603,"(Currently having a mental breakdown) 

I would like to start off with the fact that I need 
two more semesters to get my associates degree which will allow me to transfer into the university of my choice in my state. 

I was doing my fafsa this year and it takes rather long because my father is self employed and they ask for a lot of documents. Since this was third year in a row doing this, I thought I had all the documents I needed but, turns out they needed more and those documents took forever to come in and process. It finally got processed and I had one more business day left to get my finically aid package. My school ensured me is like be fine and to carry on with my classes. 

It turns out, I was dropped from all my classes on the last day it was being processed. I have two exams this week that I’ve been studying for about a week now. Now I can’t go to class and take them. I’ll be missing the exams.

I’ve asked what I should do to get reenrolled because I have exams and I can’t miss those or I’m for sure failing the classes. They said that I must ask all my teachers to fill out a document that is basically allowing me to reenroll back into the class. But even that has a process. After that, I have to pay out of pocket $2500+ in order to be able to keep the classes, which I don’t have as a broke college student. After that, I will be awarded my financial aid and my money will be refunded. 

I have no guarantee that my teachers will allow me to retake the exams I’m gonna miss, on top of that, I’ll probably be missing a good amount of classes. I’ll be behind. 

Should I still try to get back to my classes this year? If not, I would be taking a year off of college.",30Sep2019,1
604,"Feedback would be MUCH appreciated. I am a single, hardworking girl, very focused on my career so I have been single for a while. I am also very picky and have a very hard time really connecting with someone. I finally met this really great guy at our soccer end of year team party and we seemed to hit it off. It was my first time meeting the guy but we had all been drinking A LOT that night. We shared a cab home as we were going to same direction and he asked me if I wanted to join him for another drink. Every bone in my body said to say no, because I knew what that would probably lead to but he seemed great and was very attractive to me so I agreed. Of course one thing lead to another and we ended up sleeping together, several times, including many times the next morning. I NEVER DO THIS. I felt so guilty the entire team and felt like he would judge me or think I was a ‘hoe’. He drove me back to my car the next afternoon and he didn’t even ask for my number, he said ‘I’m sure I’ll see you around sometime”. I feel AWFUL. Because this isn’t something I usually do I don’t even know what to think of it. Did I ruin things by going back to his place and engaging in that? Should I have initiated the number thing? I really don’t want him to think I’m ‘that girl’. He also recently got out of a 9 year relationship, about 4 months ago, so I’m just so unsure about it all. Any feedback is MUCH appreciated. I feel shitty about the whole thing, also like I’m not ‘worth’ calling again.",30Sep2019,2

606,"In the past six or so years, I've developed a bad habit where I feel I don't experience my own life from the inside, but rather that I try to plot and control my actions from the outside. Like I'm playing a strategy game, I always try to choose my dialogue options and actions based on what I think will cause the least disturbance. Basically, I don't feel like I can be honest about my emotions or act the least bit selfish, and it makes it impossible for me to really enjoy or even experience my life. I have pretty bad social anxiety, so I worry about getting in the way or even leaving the slightest footprint in the world. I'm sick of it and I know it's not fair. I deserve to exist in the world the same as anyone else. Other people can speak their honest opinions without worrying too much about hurting others' feelings, but I can't. It leads me to adapt my personality for everyone I talk to, which makes me disingenuous. I've actually been called out multiple times by a co-worker for being hypocritical and contradicting myself because I adjust my opinions to be most compatible to who I'm talking to, because I feel compelled to avoid all confrontation.

So I want to work on being more honest about myself, and be okay with the potential of rubbing people the wrong way. One way I want to work on this is by hanging out with people, and making friends. But I experience my life so much on the outside that I don't really know how to hang out with people anymore. How do I live in the moment and be myself? Instead of watching myself move through the actions and overthinking how what I say and do will effect those around me so much?",30Sep2019,2
607,"As we approach the mid point of my first semester as a Sophomore in college, I worry that I am going to let everyone down.  
Some background, I go to school somewhere in the western part of the united states, and my family lives on the east coast. Returning to school I was put on academic probation having failed one of my classes the previous semester. I have no friends at college, but stay in touch with my friends from back home through discord. I'm a crazy introvert and live with an attitude that I'd rather everyone be scared of me, than bother me. (I'm well aware this attitude is bad, but it's something I'm unable to shake) To make matters worse, my grandmother passed suddenly due to cancer about a week before school started, and I attended her funeral the day before I shipped off to college. This shit rips me apart, even writing about it now causes me to tear up.

My current situation, I have a hard time sleeping at night. I can't accept the fact that my grandmother is gone, we were very close, and her death just happened in what felt like a month. When I'm in places where my mind can wonder it always heads back to the thought that I'm never going to get to see her again. This keeps me up all night, and causes me to cry in class when theres nothing going on. I,m taking 5 classes, and have a 9am one everyday. The problem is I can't fall asleep until my body can't stay up anymore, and have found my sleep schedule in needs of refinement. One of my 9am classes I haven't been to since the first week. I am too scared to go back having missed so many at this point, I read the lecture notes and look online for resources but its clear my grade is struggling because of it. I currently have 3 Cs, 1 B, and 1 A (in my probation course). 

My mind has been unable to rest since I got here. I don't talk to my family about this because I believe they're likely hurting just as much as I am. Throughout my life, I have never accepted help, never reached out, never showed or dealt with my emotions. But I'm hurting. I'm at a point where I'm so sad that it isn't even about being happy anymore, but instead how can I distract myself from being sad. I have a midterm exam this friday, in my major specific class, the class I haven't been attending. I worry, that I won't be able to manage a decent grade, and if I fail it may be the end of my dreams, and I worry that my family will be angry.

609,"So my cousin and I have a very bad relationship. He’s a male I’m a female. I recently cut him off because I couldn’t take it anymore. I see a side of him everyone just doesn’t. My sister is biased. She thinks he’s the nicest person on Earth. The reason she is hesitant to take my side is there was a misunderstanding where I though he did something inappropriate which turns out he did not do intentionally. However I let my resentment for him build up and I ended up sending him really awful, mean anonymous text messages. Now my sister is blinded by my actions alone. She thinks that he didn’t do anything to warrant those messages considering his actions weren’t intentional. Ignoring the fact that’s he’s had a history of being disrespectful/two-faced towards me. As if I would bother giving him the benefit of the doubt when he’s rarely been fully honest with me. Not saying what I did was okay. But I no longer beat myself up over it because we both played a part in the error. So because he’s super nice to my sister and they get along well. She understandably gets uncomfortable whenever I say he’s dishonest and not that great of a person. She defends his every action as if he can do no wrong. I’ll mention disrespectful things he’s done in her presence (like cussing me out) and she’ll say she didn’t even notice. And maybe he was still mad about the messages (even though he said multiple times that he wasn’t). I told her if he says he’s not mad and still treats me as if he IS mad then that is manipulation. She brushes my comment off. Which just further proves how biased she is. It makes me very upset with her because I feel like she’s taking his side. I don’t mind that they’re close and I won’t do anything to ruin their relationship...but he’s not this great person she makes him out to be. He’s decent...but certainly nothing to write home about.  He himself says people say he’s unlikeable. Yet does nothing to fix it. This may be an over the top analogy but slave masters were maybe super nice to other white people but they were disgusting to the slaves. Who has better ground in determining the slave master’s character... the white people or the slaves? A less harsh analogy is people who treat waitresses and janitors with disrespect aren’t great people. It doesn’t matter if they treat their friends with kindness and respect. Good, genuinely people treat everyone with respect. And if they don’t respect someone for whatever reason they should have the emotional maturity to communicate that effectively and assertively and create boundaries. We’re both 18. My sister is 23.

TL;DR My sister doesn’t see that my cousin is not that great of a person because he’s always nice to her. She turns a blind eye to anything wrong he does. And justifies all of his actions. Despite his history of disrespecting me that lead to an awful misunderstanding. It makes me very upset with her because I’m her sister.",30Sep2019,1

611,"I met a guy this summer. It was a friend of a friend thing and at first, we only spoke online. After a while, we decided to actually meet up and he seemed like a cool guy. He even invited me to his cabin this summer. One thing I noticed over time was that he constantly made jabs at me. If for example, I had trouble lifting something he would say: ""I didn't think you were **that** weak"". One thing he really wanted to hammer in was the fact that I was a virgin and he wasn't. He **really** enjoys talking about how much sex he has and how all the girls want to bang him. He tells these stories about how he has dated models and of course, it was always he that broke up. A lot of these stories belong on [r/thatHappened](https://www.reddit.com/r/thatHappened). 

  
Now to the jabs he constantly throws my way. He absolutely loves to remind me that I'm a virgin. For context, I'm 16 so it's not even weird. He often talks shit about my appearance and tells me it's the reason I don't have a girlfriend. A common way he likes to end conversations is to say: ""nah, I'm just joking, there is someone out there for you. A hooker perhaps"". 

Today I had enough. He invited me to the mall with him and I agreed. It was going well at the beginning. He said that he wanted to buy some condoms. I have a small stash of condoms at home so I said: ""you should have asked me before and I could have given you some"". He responded: ""Why do you have condoms, you are the last person that's gonna need them?"". I became irritated but didn't answer. He then starts talking about all the times that he had had sex and all the girls that wanted him. I was just silent for most of the time. We meet up with 2 other friends and just walk around a bit. I was silent because I was so fed up with his bullshit so I went home not long after. 

Jesus, writing this made me realize what a fucking dick he is. Here comes the kicker though. This guy has **attempted suicide 5 times.** That isn't bullshit either. Multiple sources have experienced the times where he was deeply depressed. On his facebook, he posts these quotes like: ""Why do you hurt me while you know I'm still down"" and shit. He of all people should know it feels to be treated like garbage. So why the fuck does he do this to me? I have treated him with nothing but respect and he treats me like shit in return. He has also said that he likes me as a friend and that he likes me better than many others. I see through him now. He doesn't like me because he likes my personality. He likes me because I can be his punching bag. 

I just want to know why he does it. How can he seemingly have no empathy when he himself have gone through hell?",30Sep2019,1
612,"I don’t really know who else to talk to/where to post. I feel a lot of embarrassment and regret regarding the mistakes I’ve made in my college career. I have been working and in school since I was 19. Started at community college for general studies. Failed a few classes but somehow got myself into a 4 year school. I wanted to study Nutrition. Turns out it’s a lot of science and math and not my strong suit at all. I’ve take out thousands of dollars of loans and am technically in my junior year, although I still have at least 3 more to go before I get a bachelors degree. Every semester I’ve failed or withdrawn from at least one class. I’ve had to petition to get my financial aid back every time. I’m starting to realize college isn’t for me. I dread going to class, dread studying and feel like I don’t have the mental capacity to get though all these anatomy, organic chemistry and math classes anymore. 

I’d rather work. I love my job as a waitress. I’m always punctual and a hard worker. They even offered me a management position when I said I wasn’t sure I wanted to finish school. But to be honest I’d feel ashamed if I spent this much time and money on school and everyone in my life thinks I’m going to graduate. Whenever I mention my struggles I get the same “You’re smart, you will figure it out” response. 

I just don’t really want to do this anymore. I’ve thought of changing my major to something like general studies. But that’s almost worse than quitting now. With a general degree I’d have no guarantee of a job like a Nutrition degree would get me. I’d be way more in debt and it seems like a pointless degree to get. 

Ultimately I’d feel like a loser if I didn’t get at least a bachelors degree though. Everyone my age seems to already have one. But I’m struggling. Every semester is the same. At what point do I give up and say this isn’t working for me?",30Sep2019,1

623,"TL;DR  Fiance didn't take off work when he had four months notice and is  expecting plans that are already set in place to change because of his  negligence.

To give a little  background, I asked my fiance and my brother (20M) if they would both be  able to come to the fair with me. They both told me, just give them the  dates and they will see if they can make it. My brother is from  Mississippi and I currently live in Alabama, so we hardly get to see  each other other than holidays. My fiance is a Mechanical Engineering  student as well as a full time cook so his schedule is already hectic  and I hardly see him even though we live together. I figured it would be  perfect time to spend with both of them. I found the dates back in June  (4 months ago) and sent them to both of them. Since it was a night  event, both said that they were given plenty of time to request off from  their jobs and maneuver things to make time for the event. My brother  was a little iffy because he is enlisted Army, and was potentially going  to be put on orders but so far things have worked out and he is able to  go.

The fair starts this  Wednesday and we decided to go on Friday because that is the day that  military personnel get in for free which meant that two of our tickets  (my brothers and mine since I'm prior service) would be for free. This  was especially helpful since we are all broke college students/graduates  and I am pregnant so every penny saved counts towards something.   Everyone agreed this would be a good day and said that they would take  off work. My brother bought his train ticket a week or so ago so he can  come in on Thursday, we can go to the fair Friday, and still spend some  time together Saturday before he leaves Sunday. I went to the doctor so  verify that fair rides are okay (so long as they aren't super jerky and  fuck with my blood pressure too much) and I made sure that I was going  to be off.

Things started to get  bad when I went to my fiance's parents house yesterday to go yarn  shopping and before I got ready to leave out, I received a phone call  from him. He asked questions like ""Is the fair only in town for one  night"" and ""is it absolutely imperative that we go on Friday"". I answer  his questions and finally drag out of him the purpose for his line of  questioning. He didn't take off for work, long story short. And by the  time that he did put the request off, he was already scheduled and he  informed me that this particular shift is one that could make or break  any future related shifts, raises, etc. He couldn't get out of it.  Needless to say, I was livid. I was not livid because he got scheduled  because oh well. I was livid because he had the forethought to request  Monday thru Thursday off for school stuff, but in that same thought  completely forgot about something that I gave him 4 months advance  notice on and he gave me confirmation of. And to this moment (the next  morning), I still haven't received even the slightest apology. I tried  to take into account that he made a judgement call and decided not to  take Friday off because he already took Monday thru Thursday off, but I  just don't want to believe that he would be so selfish to make that call  and not tell me about it until now knowing that there is the third  person (my brother) involved.

I  calmly told him that I was hanging up so that I wouldn't cause a scene  and cry in front of his parents because of the extreme disappointment  and I would talk to him later. And I did just that. They saw the look in  my face and asked what was wrong and I briefly explained. They gave me  advice on how to handle it but agreed with me that it was not wise for  me to go home at that particular moment, so I stayed and continued  talking registry stuff with his mom. He attempted to call about 30 or so  minutes later and I declined the call with a text telling him that I  had intentions of coming home, just not until I cooled off. He tried to  call again and his parents answered the phone and politely told him that  it was in my best interest to stay until I cooled. He caught the  understanding then and proceeded to send an inflammatory text message  saying ""Fine we'll talk about it next week"" alluding to the fact that  he's so busy that we won't be able to talk about it for a few days if we  don't talk tonight. I didn't respond.

After  about another hour or so, I drove home walked into his office and told  him I was home. He didn't move from his desk. I told him I was going to  do some reading before bed, to give him the opportunity to talk if he  wanted to. He didn't. I went to bed and about an hour or so later, he  finished up in the office and came to bed. Snuggled me like normal, and  said ""I love you goodnight"". That was it. When we woke up this morning,  he made no attempt to talk even though he had the time (he was browsing  youtube on his computer before he left). He got dressed and went to  school like it was just another day.

I  said all that to say, I'm still a little upset. Not as upset as last  night, but I still have some things on my chest that I would like to get  off. If ideal conditions don't arise, I will have to go to the fair  without him because I am not going to make my brother miss out. I know  if I say all of this verbally, he will get overly defensive and it will  start a fight. I don't want that. But I'm also afraid that putting it  into writing would be just as bad and be looked at as passive  aggressive. So what would be the right say to go about this, because it  is not healthy for me to hold on to this?

626,"Seriously, just yesterday. This girl has put me through hell even though I’ve NEVER done anything to her. I’ve talked about some of it in previous posts but she’s one of the most malicious and narcissistic people I’ve met in my life and the worst mean girl bully I’ve encountered. She’s tried setting me up numerous times to take my kid away even though she knows my ex is a deadbeat and has never helped me with our son so idk why she would think taking my son away would be reasonable. She’s admitted to me she has all of his passwords and goes through everything on his phone so in the past when he would text me discussing our son, it could never be in private because she would read it all and use it to cause problems. She’s encouraged people to call cps on me for literally no reason and has admitted to me that she has “spies” in my mom groups and on my social media that report to her everything I say or do. There was no reasoning with this girl and the only time she’s ever acted friendly towards me if when she was trying to set me up or dig for information to use as ammo. She ostracized me from my ex’s family who I lived with for two years and did EVERYTHING for that family. I was so close to them and for a long time they were the only family I had. I also helped them take care of their kids and pets because they were awful parents so being stabbed in the back was pretty rough. I completely blocked her off months ago because of the fact that she would never cool down and is just 100% purely invested in making me miserable and making excuses for every shitty thing they do to me, even going as far as to call me worthless and a piece of shit. I met her years ago and she was awful to me from the very start and after we met she tried convincing my ex to break up with me. Her past roommates have even told me she’s always had it out for me for reasons they weren’t even sure of. This girl is just completely psychotic and yes they were both drug addicts but I’m not sure if they still are. She continues to post about me even though I haven’t acknowledged her in so long and my ex didn’t even mention our son at all for over five months. My main worry is that now that they’re married, that she’s going to feel like she has a right to my son or can take him away. She’s threatened court and says that because I was a teen mom, a single mom, and a stay at home mom, that it all basically means I’m a selfish awful person and an unfit mother and that she thinks she can do better. I do not care in the slightest that they’re married other than the fact that I’m worried she’ll use it as weaponization towards me and my son. Should I really be worried?",30Sep2019,1

628,"So some backstory, 

-I'm (21F) living on a property my boyfriends mom owns, rent free. I only pay for electricity.

 -I've known/lived with the family for almost 3 years now. 

-Boyfriend (bf)lives at his moms (MIL) house. We go to a christian college that does not allow us to live together unmarried.

- The property I live on is in a remote, dead end neighborhood that has no trespassing signs, private property signs, cameras (that work 10% of the time). No one has any business being in the neighborhood unless they are my one neighbor down the road.

-MIL used to own a business with a family friend. Family friend died and his son (S) thinks he can lay claim to everything, and has tried stealing from the property even though everything is in MIL's name.

- Theres a lot of lawsuits going on and all I know is S is delusional, passionate, lost his job, and has nothing left to lose.**

So the story:

-Three weeks ago I come home to find my gate tied shut, when I always leave it open. I call bf, MIL, his dad(DIL), no one knows who came and tied the gate. So I call the police and they show up, search the house, and nothing. We all think its S so I file a police report (against the cops recommendation(!!!). S is relatives with the chief of police and the cops have been helping him steal stuff. From what I know theres an FBI investigation against the cops on top of everything else. point is, cops arent really helpful to us in this town and we dont trust them) 
This week we found out it was a friend of DIL who didnt know I was living there and was trying to ward off S from taking more. So it was a false alarm all along

-earlier this week I wake up and get ready to go to school and theres a red truck in my yard. I start calling people, freaking out and DIL goes 'yeah hes here to help me move some stuff around sorry bf was supposed to tell you. (I genuinely think my bf should not have been a middle man, DIL has my number he can text me) second false alarm

- three days ago I check the cameras and bfs grandma's (G) truck had shown up. Shes a druggie, manipulative, cracked out of her mind no good person. I do not like her, and I dont like her coming to my place. Last night bf told me he found out from MIL it was actually G's boyfriend who came to pick up some stuff, knocked on my door, realized I wasnt there, and left. The thing is, I've never met G's boyfriend. G told him I said it was fine for him to show up (Which obviously I DID NOT) regardless, 3rd false alarm

- I've had several nightmares of someone breaking in, chasing me, trying to kill me, no one coming to help, and waking up in tears this week. When I get home from work I sit in my car for 20 minutes because I'm too scared to make that 10 yard journey to the house. I am so on edge. If I had been home when G's bf had knocked on my door, I would have put a gun to  him. I dont know who he is, or why hes there, I'm not feeling safe already, my conversation would not be cordial.



**That's the thing though, everything has been a false alarm, but since S is so unpredictable I dont know if or when a real invasion is going to happen. I am willing to pull a gun on a guy even though he meant no real harm to me because I am so freaked out about being alone in a remote neighborhood with my place being a target for someone who is unpredictable.

TL;DR theres a guy who believes in his mind where I live is his place to own, and is considered dangerous. I live alone in this remote neighborhood and have had multiple occurrences of people coming to my place and I get freaked out by it. All occurrences have been false alarms, but since no one tells me in advance someone is showing up, I've gotten so worked up I get frequent nightmares, have made a police report, and had I been home when one did come, would have threatened him with a gun.

 I'm so on edge with not knowing  people are showing up, who they are, or why they're there and knowing theres a malicious guy out there who could show up in this empty dead end desolate neighborhood while I'm living here alone. That's why I'm looking for advice, I'm not sure what to do since so far, everything has been ok, but theres no promise things will keep being ok.

So what do I do? I'm going to have (another) talk with DIL and MIL about just simply telling me if someone is coming by so I dont get so worked up, and I've already looking for apartments to move to but I'm only staying in this state 8 more months and they all have 1 year leases, and with my financial situation right now, paying a deposit and additional ~$600 a month in bills is not incredibly ideal.",30Sep2019,1

631,"I have became close with a co-worker and We have started hanging out nightly after work . 

At first we both told each other we would just be hook up buddies . But before we actually hook up we talk and smoke for a while . We like a lot of the same obscure music and have the same sense of humor. He kisses me , caresses me , and wants to cuddle and be sweet after every time we hook up. He has told me he likes me and there is feelings on both sides . This has been going on for over a month now and every night we close at work together and then hang out until the sun comes up.

It's started to become less fun because im realizing that my feelings are more than that of just fuck buddies . I feel confused because we do things that people in relationships do ,and people at work think we are together because of the way we are around each other . 

I decided to be brave and tell him how I felt last night . He told me he wanted to date me but his beliefs made him hesitant. He is into black activism and very proud of his roots. He brought up police brutalities and said a lot of white people want black people dead . Which I understand is a reality in some places . But tbh most of my friends are black or mixed and so is my neighborhood and people I associate with. He said he likes me but wants to have a child one day with a black woman and said his friends and family wouldn't accept our relationship and it would be hard . He said if we ever were together we would have to keep it on the down low from his family for now. 

So I told him I don't want to hang out anymore because it's just gonna hurt for me in the end . Plus I feel offended that he is more worried about the thoughts of others and my skin color than the chemistry we have that makes all of that not matter.  He kind of back peddled and said he wanted to keep talking about this situation and we would talk later. 

I just feel a mix of feelings . if dating someone of the opposite race is against your beliefs, why hang out with them for hours upon hours every night? Why have sex with them and show your soul to them? What is the difference between this in a relationship at this point? We text ,we talk ,we hang out more than we even hang out with our friends. Just confused ..",30Sep2019,2
632,"I went to uni with this girl a few years back. We immediately became best friends. I care deeply about her, she is a wonderful person. We share a group of friends where she is very popular. Every time we get all together she gets a lot of attention and that has made her bloom. After we graduated, she got a job in a farm, near a small city. She moved to a nearby village and we all come to visit her often.

She is the nicest person I know. She can be very shy but once she's at ease she has a lot of charisma, as she is quite a ""people person"". She does not feel very confident with the whole dating/hookup scene, as lots of times, the people she likes don't see her ""that way"". Ever since she moved to that town about a year ago, she has not made friends or met people she could have something with. In my country, it is common knowledge that having a social life while working in agriculture is tough. But I think it really is starting to make her feel worried and sad. We've talked about trying out dating apps and so but she thinks they take the magic away and would feel awkward using them.
It's kind of a dick move to post about her online but I would like to know what other people think about this. Any serious advice is welcome. What should I tell her? How do I help her without being too intrusive?

634,"Okay, so here's the situation:

I had an interview for a job and a week later I got a call last week (Thursday). Unfortunately I missed it, but a voicemail was left for me to call back at said number and extension. I know that this lady was calling to tell me I got the job because prior to the call, my friend who I put down as a referral on my app, said that the hiring manager had talked to her about me, saying I got the job, etc.

I had missed the call, but returned the call 10 minutes after. No answer. I continued to call on Friday throughout the day, nothing. I even called on the weekend, even though I'm fairly certain she's off then, but I left a voicemail. Now we're here on Monday, I still have been calling her extension throughout the day, multiple times.

641,"So, I've experienced sexual trauma in the past. Growing up, I was abused. So it's extremely hard for me to open up about my body or my sexuality.

Now, we were talking about children and I said how I'm unsure about children. I said, ""I think children can be a bit annoying, at times. Y'know? Like sure, they're great. They're precious beings. However, I don't have a great relationship with my mother &amp; I have a lot of mental health issues. I wouldn't want that to be passed on to my children. I've just never been good around kids.

If you go up to it, it's a very friendly cat- it willingly approaches humans with its tail up, it meows, it rubs itself against humans, it even lay down and exposed its belly to me. So it's definitely not feral.

I've started to wonder if it's a stray because it doesn't have a collar, it seems to be out at all hours of the day, and none of the neighbors that I've talked to seem to know who owns it.

If it's a stray, what do I do with it? I have a cat carrier, and there are a couple of humane societies in my area that I could bring it to. If I did that, would they scan for a microchip? And if I did this, and it turned out that the cat did belong to one of my neighbors, could I be charged with kidnapping the cat?

I am hesitant to bring it into my house because I have a couple of pretty territorial cats of my own who would be mean to it- they're pissed enough at seeing it hanging out in the driveway (they're indoor cats, but they see it through the window.)

She said that I am perfect for her and she really really wants to fall in love with me and spend the rest of her life with me. “I want you as my husband and the father of my children, but I don’t know why I can’t fall in love with you.”

She says I am attractive, and she says there is nothing I have done wrong in fact I have done everything she has ever wanted and helped her with anything she has ever needed. 

A couple weeks ago I told her that even if things don’t work out, I think she and I can have a special connection heck I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her.

653,"Hi all! I live in a 1 bedroom apartment, which I began renting almost two years ago. The plan was always for me to take on full responsibility for all the expenses associated with the apartment, as I was just getting out of a relationship at the time of signing the lease and I was (and still am) completely capable of covering all the expenses. I have a decent job and the only significant debt I have is student loans. Last April, I began a new relationship. My boyfriend had just gotten divorced, and their Separation Agreement (this was entered into before we met) was that he was going to live in the in-law apartment of the marital home until his daughter graduated and the house sold. Regardless of whether he moved out or not, he was still responsible for 50% of the household expenses. Once we met, the atmosphere in their house changed, and I offered for him to stay with me. He started staying with me over the summer, and was unofficially living with me by September.  I didn't ask for money towards rent or expenses, as 1) He was already paying a fortune for a house he didn't want to be in and 2) It doesn't cost me a penny more to have him live with me besides my grocery bill, which we take turns with anyways. In July, the house sold and my boyfriend now officially lives with me full-time. There isn't a ton of space in my apartment, so the only part of the apartment he can really claim as his is half my walk-in closet. Everything else is still mine... the photos, the decorations, the furniture, the stuff in the kitchen, etc. He had to rent a storage unit for all of his personal belongings, minus his clothing. While my financial situation has not changed, part of me wishes I could be putting some extra money on my student loans every month. We have every intention of buying a house in the next year, I need to figure out 1) if I should be asking him to contribute and 2) how to bring it up now that it's been so long. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, its important for me to explain that he does pay for almost all of the nights we go out to dinner and most of our entertainment (concert tickets, etc.). He generally takes his vehicle whenever we go out and if he drives my car, he puts gas in it. I don't want anyone to think he's a deadbeat because he isn't at all, its just that I have never really brought it up.

656,"I joined a really good firm straight out of school when I was 18 and decided to study a university degree part time as well, I'm 23 now, I've been at this a while.

As I was earning decent money at 18, I was happy to pay a bit of rent (or keep) to my parents - monthly payments that worked out around just over 10% of what I was earning a month.

I've had steady pay rises for the last few years, resulting in my monthly payments to my parents rising as well, but in truth it's been pretty marginal, so I havent said much and it hasn't bothered me either (that much).

This year, I recieved a pretty hefty promotion and pay rise, and my parents and siblings are expecting (and applying subtle pressure) for me to pay more into the house, even though what I take from the house, and my interaction with it hasn't changed at all! 

I really don't agree with this. I've worked stupidly hard over the last 4 years to earn this money. If I do what they're expecting (and like I said, subtly pressuring), it would equate to me not even getting much of a pay rise at all. I need to save up for my own things and life ahead, plus no parents should try and enforce their children to support them. Im still happy to help out with what I currently pay pre-pay rise, but unless I'm eating them out of house and home or physically costing them more than I previously did, I shouldn't be expected to pay more

Sorry this was a little ranty

She didn't do it the first time, but today she change her username for something like ""Imgonnakillmyself"" and she didn't respond to my message

I need to notice the autoritys or something that can prevent her from doing that (if she didn't make it).

658,"I've been [29m] wanting to move out of my parents house for a few months now.  I've recently gotten into a good job and make decent money.  Up until a few weeks ago I was looking at places with a friend, now he seems disinterested in moving. In the beginning he said it was going to be fun, but it was anything but fun.  I did all foot work.  I did the research, I called the places for information, I even set up the tours.  All he did was say yes or no on a place.  He then made demands for the apartment to be closer to his work and him getting the master bedroom.  I told him it's one or the other. Not both. It's been 4 weeks since we looked at a place, he even told me if I'm in a rush then don't wait for him.

I live in the middle of no where, it takes me 30 minutes to just get to a grocery store and over an hour to drive to work.  My internet blows, $80 for 12mbs that goes out fairly often.  I love my family but the stress is getting to me.  I desire more independence.  He lives with his friends parents.  He has a tiny room but only pays $250 a month.  I thought it would be a good opportunity for both of us, but he doesn't talk about it anymore.

I can some what afford a 1 bedroom apartment.  But the money would be extremely tight.  My dad says I should stay at home and save more money.  I already have a decent amount saved up. Around $8k.  I feel like he'll continue to say that every point.  I honestly don't know what to do.  Do I stay at home and continue saving till i have a larger safety net? Or do I risk it for the biscuit and get the place?  I'll try talking to my friend one last time, just so I have clarification on what his thoughts are.",30Sep2019,2
659,"My girlfriend and I just moved to a new state and on top of the move/job stress and homesickness  she went through something that lost her a few friends, and we have been doing a trial run with polyamory which brings up a lot of emotions and hasn't been very easy for her. All this combined has been rough on her and she's been really depressed.

The first few weeks she did almost nothing but mope around, daily cries, was only recognizable as her normal self a few times per week and never longer than a couple hours. She seemed to get a little better after having a friend visit for a few days, but still visibly depressed \~50% of the time, and has not seemed to improve much since the friend's visit. Total length is now approaching 2 months.

I have given all the advice I can, but it was either untried or unsuccessful. I was able to get out of my own depression in the past by accepting what sucks, moving past it to focus on what I can control, and focusing on the positives and what I'm grateful for. However, my situation was more chronic, and hers is more acute. I don't think I've ever been in a debilitated state like that for more than a few hours, let alone the majority of the time for months.

Questions:

Is this normal? People who have gone through anything similar, how long did it take you to recover?

What else can I do? She said she might be open to talking to a professional, but she doesn't have that kind of money. Other thoughts or ideas?",30Sep2019,3

662,"I rage quit my job as a Warehouse Lead in mid-August, and to save face I immediately enrolled in a bootcamp for UX Design. 

I've been interested in the tech field since I did an internship at a design agency when I was 19 (I'm now 24), but I was truly happy in warehousing as well because I was learning new skills, growing in my career, and able to provide value to society. 

I'm already $30,000+ in debt, and the bootcamp would set me  back another $30k in the form of an income share agreement.

To maintain my living expenses during the nine month course, I'd do DoorDash after work and resell phones (but things would be tight). 

I'm considering taking a warehousing job at Amazon, getting my finances squared off, and continuously applying for Leadership and Supervisor positions (the role I was in training for at my last company). 

I'm at the age where I'm tired of flopping back and forth and backing out of my decisions and obligations. On principle, I feel that I should get a full-time job to help my family and pay off my debts before I embark on more debt, and only take a bootcamp if I can afford it upfront. 

I also feel like I can try to teach myself coding after work.

664,"My friend F(25) lets call her Nancy, is a self proclaimed animal lover. She cries over emotional animal videos and always wants to cuddle and bond with any animal she comes across. 

When Nancy moved out of home a couple years ago into an apartment, I asked her if she would be taking a dog she had pressured her family into adopting, a male black lab mix that she saw on a shelter website. She said something to the effect of wanting to ""start fresh"" at a new apartment with new pets, as if he was a piece of furniture. The dog was about a year and a half old at this point. Since then, her family have taken over care for the animal, though none of them really seem to emotionally care for it all that much. 

On her own, she adopted two cats (one has feline herpes and needs special eye drop medication, they knew this when she was adopted), a hamster and a bearded dragon.  All these animals her partner protested against and did not want. Her partner would tell her point blankly that she had an animal adoption problem. 

When she recently broke up with her partner and moved back in with her family, I asked her if she was bringing the animals with her. She brushed it off saying she didn't want to disturb the home they were used to, and that her partner was the one who was carrying for the bearded dragon because she never learned how, and that the hamster will probably ""die soon anyways"".  I was surprised by her callous attitude towards animals she's lavished with affection or tears in the past.

Her ex partner ends up texting her and telling her that they have bonded with the cats, but they never wanted the other animals and never cared for them, so if she doesn't pick them up, they would give them away. 

Nancy tells me their ex is being horribly cruel to her for saying this, I don't say anything because I think their ex is being more than fair. Nancy decides to get the bearded dragon. Nancy's family mind you, would not mind if she brought the cats home with her. They told her multiple times it would be okay, but she would brush it off repeating that she didn't want to take them out of the home they are used to, into a smaller home shared with other animals (including the dog she originally left behind).

Nancy to be fair, has been taking care of the bearded dragon, and cuddles with it and talks to it. Which is the most confusing part to me, how much affection she lavishes on the animals one minute, but is totally willing to abandon them the next. She even has tattoos of animals she's had that have passed, and she still gets emotional thinking about animals she's had that have died of sickeness or old age. 

Throughout all this I haven't said anything. But then today she started telling me she was looking for a new kitten to ""start fresh"" with after the breakup.

Technically, her treatment of animals doesn't effect me or my friendship. And she's always had people around her who took care of the basic needs of the animals she stopped caring for. That may be part of the problem actually. But I'm finding it very difficult not to tell her my true feelings about her shopping for a new kitten after trying to abandon two kittens a hamster and a bearded dragon. 

Should I say something to her at this point? If so what? Keep in mind, she is a very old, dear friend of mine, not some acquaintance I don't care about.",30Sep2019,0
665,"I missed my flight on Friday. Tbh I don't have any hopes but maybe someone else has shared the same experience here. I was scheduled to fly with Turkish Airlines at 10:50, 27th September and to fly back with Turkish Airlines at 8:15, 2nd October. Flight would have been from Vienna to Istanbul.

I have no one to blame, it was my own fault. There had been an earthquake and the risk of experiencing another one was not completely impossible, so I chickened out on the day of my flight. All I had to do was driving to the airport, everything else was set. I know that in case of earthquakes, etc. that the airlines is NOT at fault.

666,"Let me just preface with this is going to be long and I dont expect anyone to read this, much less reply. If you do, kudos to you for rolling a 20 on mental fortitude. I appreciate you. And I appreciate anything you want to input. No matter how positive or trollish. 

I grew up the youngest of 3 kids. Parents divorced when I was preteen. Left to live with my mom because she was ""suicidal"" while my older siblings went to live with my dad.

Felt like the black sheep all my life. My lawyer Dad and lawyer brother always making it clear I was less than. Don't have much of a relationship with any of my family. 

Got married (way too) young. 19. Had kids young (when I was 20). They are 22 and 24 now. Unbiased observation, they are really quite good kids.

My marriage, like any marriage I suppose, has had its up and downs. Some really high highs and really low lows. We went thru a bad lull when the kids were young. Then when they were old enough for a babysitter (and really could fend for themselves), we found a sweet spot. Went out on dates again. Fell into swinging. Had a poly relationship for a number of years. Things were good.

Then things fell apart. Poly foursome dissolved. We stopped going out. We stopped having sex. We are more of roommates now. The last time I remember having sex, I was buzzed. On top of her, looking into her eyes and I recall thinking how much I loved her and how much she means to me. Then she says ""why the fuck you staring at me like that? You're ruining it."" /record scratch sound

I dont hate her. I dont have any ill will towards her. I care about her. But I have zero sexual energy towards her. It is what it is.

I dont have a gaggle of friends. Never had. I like to think I'm too nice. At least thats what I tell myself why I end up getting taken advantage of so often. Or maybe I'm just a weirdo. When I first started my job, this other guy on my team - same age, married, same affinities for scifi flicks and music, we hit it off. He was literally my twin brother from another mother. We ate lunch together everyday. We did DIY projects on our respective homes together. We were each other's counselors. Confidants. Swift kicks in the ass when needed. He was a good part of my world.

He died last year. Cancer. It shook me. Deep. Core deep. Cried like a baby. Daily. For weeks. 

Hadnt spoken to my father in years. Fallen out over something judgmental. My sibling calls to tell me he is on hospice earlier this year. Losing his fight, I swallowed my pride and went to see him. Didnt talk about our differences. Just told him I loved him. In between helping change his diapers. Spent a few days with him. Last time I saw him was on fathers day. He died 2 days later. That same day, later that evening, our 15 year old dog was having a vertigo issue. Screaming and running in circles and into the wall. Uncontrollable. Inconsolable. Had to put her down. 

Two straws on one day on the camel's back. Two too many. 

I've been broken. Honestly. Humbly. 

I'm an atheist. God unequivocally doesn't exist. I'll debate all you want. But I have to concede to you that I can't prove a negative (so whats the point). And ""the smart thing"" would be to buy into Pascal's wager, but I feel like I have more sense than that. Apologies to anyone this may offend.

Kids moved out. On their own now. Empty nester / successful parent badge acquired. 

So Ive been masquerading life these last 4 months or so. Working. Eating. Sleeping. Watching tv. Pointless banter with coworkers. Loneliness is my best friend.

Went thru some websites. Found some fake feminine friends. The ones you pay for. Took some bumps. Got robbed. Abused. But found a couple gems. Maybe cubic zirconias, but they were pretty and brought me joy. . .

Figured out what made me feel alive... weekly drug of choice (and availability) and a friend for the day/night.

Sometimes just take the day off work and spend it held up in a room doing ecstasy, watching COPS, and screwing all day. 

I stumbled unto this once of a lifetime creature. All kinda happenstance really. Opportunitistic luck. I found this pure unadulterated woman. Smart. Hella smart. Night and day comparison to these other gems. Making her way through law school. Funny. Witty. Beautiful. Lover of things I adore. Truly makes my heart pound. My eyes bleed with joy when I gaze upon her.

Im not dumb. Its not love. Just extreme infatuation. Times a million mind you. And I know this is a blip in time for her. At the start of her long life. Thats not lost on me. But I am hitting the 1/4 slow button repeatedly and enjoying every millisecond that I am with her. Every touch I get. Every sniff of her on my shirt. Every strand of hair I find in my suitcase.

I kinda feel. Maybe know. I am burning my candle at both ends. Maybe burning the straw house with me in it. 

We get one life. And mine is certainly complicated. And I am being selfish. But this is now. I dont feel like I have the time or stamina (mental mainly) to deal with a martial breakup. Me sitting in the corner on the xbox or in a hotel room banging someone - really whats the fucking difference to everyone else? There's not malice as far as I am concerned. Doesnt mean Im not innately / indirectly hurting people. I know. I get it.

And maybe this next part belongs on the existential board, but at the end, when Im gone, what does it matter? And when my wife is gone? And my kids are gone? What does it really matter? Whatever pain. Whatever bad memories I created... they disappear. Gone without a trace.

I think I see it as some kind of test of my mental capacities and not knowing how to do something makes me feel incredibly stupid and upset. The fact that it's a topic I care about just makes it worse. 

Failing to complete mathematical problems is the only part of school I've ever cried over and I feel like shit whenever I don't understand a topic as it's introduced at school. Sometimes, my classmates seem to pick up on obvious things while I miss them and that makes me drown in my insecurities. 

Now, admittedly, I am way too sensitive when it comes to this and my reactions are ridiculously hysterical, but it's been like this for as long as I can remember and I don't know if I'll ever be able to get over it. I'm trying and it's gotten a little better than it used to be, but the steps I'm taking are so tiny that I don't feel like I'll ever actually get there.

672,"So im terrified of what's after life. This all came from a variety of different sources, like the dimension scene from interstellar, and a conversation about space with my old science teacher, but mainly from a conversation me and my friends had a few months ago.

We where having some deep, completely random and at the time, hilarious conversation about what hell is like when one friend said how it's like drifting, through darkness for ever and ever, floating in a void, unable to sleep or die. 

I thought about this when I went to sleep that night and ever since, have been scared shitless of it. It's definitely my version of hell.

I'm scared that when I die, it will just be as described. I don't believe much this friend says, but this just stuck with me and now I'm constantly thinking about it. Im not sure if I'm religious or believe in anything at the moment. I would like to go with the scientific belief that you just feel the same as before you where born, or when your asleep but not dreaming.

She tells me that she wants to wait before taking our relationship to the next step, because she said she knows herself, and if we take it any further she’s going to fully invest herself into me and lack in the other areas of her life where she needs to stay focused at this time. She asks me to trust her, that no matter how much time goes by or who else comes into her life it will still be me. And that if it’s meant to happen, then Gd will make it so.

679,"so first, a disclaimer: this is not my situation but my friends and it will be from my perspective. i wrote the title like that so it would be easier to understand (i guess lol)

characters: F: friend GF: friends crush/girlfriend BF: friends friend/girl who has a crush on her

okay so a little backstory first: it all started last earlier this year i believe, the day after i told my friend group the girl i was into. i guess my friends just decided to tell eachother who they were into as well, given i had. we were trying to guess F's crush but she was hard to crack so eventually we kind of moved on to BF. this is around when BF and F decided they would tell eachother first alone so we waited as they went into the bathroom being all secretive. when they came back, they were acting weird. we asked what happened and at first they just said they had a crush on the same person, but then revealed that they actually had crushes on eachother. so the day went on and we were giddy with excitement about this news and it felt super surreal. 
the ship kinda died pretty soon though because they decided they shouldn't date right then as they were both going through some personal issues at that moment, so that was the end of that.
fast forward a bit and we had kind of left that whole thing behind and now we all knew that GF had a massive crush of F and we always teased her about it. at that current moment i was under the impression that BF was completely over F. one day we were walking home teasing GF about F and F was complaining about how we were keeping secrets from her. this caused GF to make the comment that there are loads of things F has told BF and not us. this eventually ended up in us discovering F had a crush on GF all along and we were all absolutely ecstatic. that night i walked home with F and she revealed that she actually never had a crush on BF, it was just she was scared if she didn't say she liked her back, BF would kill herself (shes very mentally unstable and prone to self harm and suicidal thoughts). we never really spoke about it again.

okay fast forward a few months and now it is the summer holidays and we decide to go to a local swimming pool. this is where the problems started. BF started acting really weird and it made everyone uncomfortable. she started talking about how her best friend told her that F and GFs relationship was just a ""horny little teenage thing"" and when F got bored she would ""run back to BF and fuck her"". she was acting super sexual and touchy around F and it was making her visibly uncomfortable. im pretty sure she also mentioned her best friend telling her that F was a bitch for choosing GF over her. 
since then she has continually been making F feel uncomfortable around her (maybe not to the extent of when we were at the swimming pool but still). she keeps slightly touching F like on her leg or back and F doesn't want to tell her to stop as to not hurt her feelings. its gotten to the point where F doesn't like being in classes with her, especially today as BF came to school very drunk. today BF even sent F a picture of a tweet that says ""soulmates dont have to be people who u are romantically involved with, sometimes ur soulmate is literally ur best friend"". at this point F just wants to tell her to stop and that she is not attracted to her but, again, she is afraid BF will hurt herself.

682,"I currently live in an apartment with two of my closest friends who I met last year; one was my roommate in the dorm, and the other lived down the hall. We all live together very easily since our personalities mesh well. However, lately I’ve begun to feel very isolated from them. 

The two of them are super similar in personality and interests. They are both very mellow, introspective, and express themselves through artsy stuff like bullet journaling. They are not very open with their feelings in general. I, on the other hand, am the opposite. I am extremely positive, expressive, involved in things, and like to spend a lot of my time on adventures. 

Lately I’ve begun to notice that instead of us doing things as a trio, it seems to be them doing things as a duo with me kinda left on the sidelines. I’m definitely not that jealous type of friend with the mentality that we can only do things as a group and not separately as pairs. But, their separation is so frequent that it feels purposeful to the point where I feel like I’m doing something wrong. And, when I invite them places, the turn me down with whatever excuse but will then go off and do that same thing I suggested just the two of them the next day. 

Maybe this is all just a product of their similarities, and I’m overthinking it. But, I’m really good at reading people and their vibes, and I feel like something is definitely off. I feel isolated and alone, even though I have other friends. It’s starting to take a hit on my self esteem, even though I know my own worth.

I have been at my job for 5 months. Prior to that I hadnt worked in a year. I would last a month at some of the jobs that I have had and then leave because I was so overwhelmed. I have been able to stick it out with this job but I have been pretty angry with the way that I have been treated the last couple of weeks.

I have two different positions at the restaurant. One as a barista in the restaurant and one as a banquet server at banquets. The restaurant and the banquets are combined into one building. Last week while I was a barista, the banquet captain had told me that I had to go to banquets. My mind was all out of sorts, just really confused. I wasnt that angry that time because I make more at banquets than I do as a barista. The same thing happened today, the banquet captain said that he needed me right away, and he told me to follow him into a hallway where the servers at the restaurant dont go to. I followed him and walk past by my G.M who is leaning on the wall, hiding in between two different objects. He tells me that I have to go to room x and start passing out wine glasses. Im very overwhelmed. The banquet captain didnt explain to me who said that I had to go with him or why, just that they needed help now. Wtf? Like Im supposed to drop everything and run into a room while Im working as a barista. I said well I need to sign in as a banquet server and that I need a managers card. My G.M comes out of the shadows and said that we will figure that out later. Wtf? I cant believe the G.M would give my manager the okay for that. Im really upset and I take it out on the servers by not telling them that I switched positions. My G.M should have at least told them. My A.G.M wasnt even aware. My G.M told no one. Maybe he dosent think that my barista job isnt that important? It just sounded like sabotage.

I go into my banquet room and then my banquet manager comes in and asks If they switched me to banquets today. The banquet manager, who has more control of everything in general said yeah. We sign into the banquet server position about 5 minutes later. Soon after he comes back and says they need me upfront. I said Im starting to get angry. He said that they needed me at banquets but now they need me at the restaurant. I go the restaurant and immediately get yelled at by the servers. ""You couldnt give us a heads up?"" I said that I wasnt even given a heads up. He said still. I said listen I just do what Im told. He said to just give him a heads up. Im so frustrated that I have to tell everyone where Im at, at all times because they switch me around.

Later on he tells me to take out the trash that isnt mine which sucked. Thats the dishwashers work. Im just sick of the barista position that I have been at for the last couple of months. They seem to think that they can just throw me around wherever they need and expect for me to be okay with it. I get paid peanuts and I only get 3% tips from the servers. I felt like walking out. I cried, but wiped out my tears quickly. I was looking down so that no one could see. I will be talking to the banquet manager about removing me from barista duties ASAP. They dont pay me as much as they do as a banquet server and I only accepted it to help out the servers and get some extra hours.",30Sep2019,1

Most of us will or have traveled to upwards of four or five countries in a year. I never knew any of my roommates until they walked through the door, but the community of us is small enough that basically everyone is at least a friend of a friend of a friend.

Him and I, and six other people were roommates, so this was totally normal. I knew he had a girlfriend (called B), and although I found him attractive, I didn't intend on doing anything with him despite having a good time that night. He began to compliment me back in our apartment while I was making food, and I reminded him he had a girlfriend and to watch his words. He explained to me that they had an open relationship. Later, we kissed, and that was all I was interested. He proceeded to get extremely aggressive with me, demand sex, hold me down, fingered me after I'd said no, pull down my pants, and I had to slide out from underneath him and fall onto the floor to get away from him. It was a fucking mess. More happened after that, he fingered me again, yelled obscenities at me and eventually left me alone, and there is more that occurred that night, but there's no need to go into upsetting details. The point is there, that's an assault and if I'd been drinking or incapacitated that night, he probably would have raped me (something he later admitted to me).

I spoke with my other roommates about what happened and they believed me but eventually went back to being casual acquaintances with him. This was hard to watch. A few days later I confronted him on what happened after having a couple drinks, and that was when he admitted that if I hadn't successfully gotten away from him it would have ended very differently. He apologized, promised to never do what he did to me to another girl, understood to an extent that what he did was wrong but kept telling me that he was incredibly horny and that I'm very beautiful, that he was drunk, etc. I tried to explain to him that this was not an excuse many times. When the conversation ended and he walked away, he turned around and told me he still wanted to fuck me. It literally made my heart drop, I really thought that I had gotten through to him but clearly I hadn't at all. I looked forward to going to another country constantly. I was lucky in that everyone that I shared this with believed me. I didn't inform our workplace because I was in a country with regressive laws and mindset to do with women, and didn't want to get him in trouble, moreover I wanted to protect myself and the other girls. My intention wasn't ever really revenge as much as I just wanted to feel safe, but I never really did as long as he was home. I considered telling his girlfriend, but the idea of a he said she said type exchange where I could be painted as something I'm not, or slutshamed, or accused of lying didn't sound like my idea of a good time. Maybe that's selfish, but my priority was to protect my own physical and mental safety, and still is.

That all happened over two months ago. I'm now in a different country, and my newest roommate (we can call her C), who I've become pretty close with and spend a significant amount of time with, is close friends with A and B. She talks on the phone with them often. They're often texting back and forth, and they are really close friends. I know that C would probably believe me if I told her, my story is backed up, I disclosed early, I have pictures of my bruises, if I was back home and took this to the police, I might actually have a shot at a case. I just don't know what to do now. I don't know if I have an obligation to tell C, who would likely tell B, and everything with A would be brought up all over again. There is a chance that one of my other roommates may have even told B, but it's somewhat unlikely since I asked them not to and I'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt. I just don't know what to do. I don't know what is the right thing to do, for me, or morally, or anything.

I'd really like to put this all behind me, and I'll be back in my home country in a month, but there's a good chance I'll meet these people again somewhere and I don't want this one stupid night to be on my mind whenever his name is brought up. He has a strong social media presence, is generally well liked, I'm just so afraid all over again.",30Sep2019,1
686,"Or in other terms, why do I have wet dreams that aren't sexual at all in nature and involve me peeing?
Some things that might be important / to consider:
- I was sexually abused when I was six by my primary school teacher
- I wet the bed from 6 years of age all the way until I was about eleven because of nightmares I had
- said nightmares were about someone coming into my room and me hiding in the corner of my bed, terrified. I couldn't ever remember what the person did to me because I'd always wake up drenched in piss before they got to me.
- I'm almost certain due to the nature of the nightmares and when they started that they're linked to the sexual abuse
- since I always woke up before they reached me, there wasn't anything sexual about the nightmares
- similarly the ""wet dreams"" aren't sexual in nature, even though peeing is a kink
- the ""wet dreams"" aren't nightmares at all, but they're not exactly pleasurable either",30Sep2019,2

I’ve took her out on a date once but I’ve offered many times usually we just order food to mine her choice.. I’ve stopped at her house once met her immediate family over a drink she has met my immediate family

But ever since we’ve started to see each other she has been the one that’s wanted to come see me and the one who acted as if she was more interested she’s told me she loves me in the past week multiple times in person I told her I wasn’t ready to rush things into a relationship but she was the only girl I was seeing or talking to but she always replied take it at your own pace I’ll be by your side once you’re ready. she knows I struggle to open up and tell people how I truly feel(I have never been able to) and she started to act a little bit less interested the last few days 

Then yesterday I got to thinking what’s the point in in being scared to tell her how I feel incase I miss out on something that could be great, so this morning I text her telling her I was falling in love with her and I was scared and asked her if me and her was was what she wanted and she has not replied yet she’s been active on snap/ig but blatantly ignoring my message.. even tho she knows how hard it would of been to admit I was falling for her 

How can she go from telling me she loves me and she wants to stick around till I’m ready etc to just straight up ignoring that message

691,"I like to think I’m a pretty patient and understanding person. I’m graduating this year from my 4-year program and also work for my university within the student life department. 

Anyways, this issue all started in my first year, this guy Cameron sat beside me during a class which later found out was because he thought I was attractive. I made it clear that I had a boyfriend, inserted him into conversation and basically trying to get him to fuck off.
After that he has followed me like a dog on an invisible leash, always asking about my relationship, complaining about how he can’t get with girls and how his dating life sucks. I would never really engage in the conversation and just go with “yup, yeah, that sucks” - just bland responses. 

He also has made comments about my body and very sexist comments about other women. On International Women’s Day he made a comment about a TA’s body that made me livid, saying that she was asking for men to gawk at her because of what she was wearing. I told him he was disgusting and left, later finding a Facebook message of him apologizing and realizing that it was International Women’s Day. I didn’t respond.

The problem is I’m too nice and chicken shit to tell him to fuck off. He looks off of my notes constantly, watches my computer screen and always asks for help for assignments. It baffles me how he’s still in university and passing his courses.

I don’t think I can go through another year or semester of keeping to myself. I would like some advice on how to address him without making him go off (he’s a bit of a hothead) or any alternate approaches to this.

It also doesn’t seem to matter whether I’ve eaten recently, how much I’ve eaten, or even if the trip is especially short.

Just twenty minutes ago, I had to take an especially long Uber trip that took about 45 minutes and I nearly had to ask the driver to cut the ride short. As soon as it ended I had to run into a restroom and though I surprisingly didn’t throw up, I still feel shaky and gross. 

What the hell do I do? I have two jobs and I’m taking classes that are all in different locations.

699,"My boyfriend and I have been going out for 7 months now. We have a pretty strong relationship, one that I really haven’t felt with anyone else I’ve been with.

We went on dates and all, things were awesome. 

When we first decided to have sex, he couldn’t keep his penis hard. I thought it might be just from shyness or something. I didn’t think much of it at the time, and we kept living out happy life together, doing all sorts of things couples do. 

A little bit later, I realized this was happening a lot... I decided to talk to him about it, and he admitted he was addicted to porn. As we kept talking, we both made the decision (and he promised) that he should stop watching it, so we could focus on each other in our sex life. 

This whole time, our sex life was successful maybe 30% of the time. I started feeling maybe it was me, maybe I wasn’t attractive like the women he was used to seeing in porn, not doing what they do.. maybe I wasn’t good enough.. I talked to him about this, and he insisted it’s not that. I tried to shake this from my mind.. 

Anyway. Keep fast forwarding, I spent the night with him one night - we were both in the same bed and I woke up to the bed violently moving. I glanced over and he was looking on his phone trying to hide it, jerking off next to me. I was very hurt.. he lied to me saying he wasn’t doing anything, but later ultimately confessed. This may not be a big deal to most, but that promise he made to me to try and help our sex life was broken.. he then said he was doing it to get himself hard, for ME, to have sex that morning. But the thought of him getting hard to another girl, and then having sex with me.. ? I couldn’t really wrap my head around that. 

As of today, we are still having problems. Actual penetration for us is rarely successful. For him to have an orgasm, one thing that works is me putting a condom on him and jerking him off. Other than that.. he just goes soft. 

I’ve tried to forgive him for what happened, but it seems it’s always on my mind, you know? I’ve suggested him going to a doctor. Maybe it’s his testosterone levels. He’s 36. He works out nearly everyday. He doesn’t take steroids. No known health conditions. 

He’s even cried to me about it, on numerous occasions, even after unsuccessful sex, saying he feels ashamed. I always am there to comfort him, telling him it’s okay. 

We love each other very much. But I’m having troubles with all of this. It’s hard for me to enjoy sex with him. As soon as I feel he’s going soft, I get turned off. I feel sex is a big part of a relationship.. I don’t know what to do. 

Any advice?",30Sep2019,1

Is it wrong to think this way. Have a child on the way. Wife is on bed rest and it is unpaid FLMA. Will go on unpaid maternity in a few weeks or even days.

Been applying for second jobs and per diem jobs.

My thought process is this. I can find full time work closer to home with a slight deduction in pay about a $240 a month difference.

Now since I have been at work 5 years I have about $15,000 in my retirement account. If I left work on my own volition and worked per diem I could collect that $15,000. That $15K could pay off my debt and put money in our savings. So even with the reduction in pay be less of a financial struggle then it is now.

707,"So background In 2016 I purchased a certified used 2015 Ford Mustang V6 at 25k. My car now has 55k miles on it and I am very tired of it in every way. However I still owe a little less than 14k on it. A year ago my car was t-boned in a gas station and even though it was replaced fully with OEM parts trade-in value is always minimum of Kelly blue book value.

So I recently received a personalized letter from a local dealership that they want my vehicle and would offer up to 115% of the kelly blue book value. I am not 100% if this is only if I get a new car from them or not but currently I've known that if I want a new car or different car I'm still going to be losing out as my loan is under. 

I don't want to pay more on my monthly payments which are $380 on the loan and then $135 for insurance. But it has always seemed that I am stuck until I either flip the loan or I should just keep it till I pay it off.

So my tl:dr question is. Should I trade in my car with this dealership or are there any other options you would suggest?",30Sep2019,2
709,"I can’t make up my mind about whether or not I should. Background: I am a freshman in college and I have done research into cheap but good gaming PCs. I have found one that is only 500 dollars that has specs that are serviceable for the games I play. I have asked many people for advice and gotten conflicting answers. I’ve tried making pros and cons lists and I still can’t choose. I will provide the shortened pros and cons list in one last ditch attempt to get a definitive answer.
Pros:
1)I like to play video games (that ones kind of obvious but bear with me)
2)The PC will last me for years and can be used for things other than games
3)I’ve already poured hundreds of dollars into steam throughout high school and to simply stop would be a waste of all that money
4)I have plenty of free time so it won’t interfere with my studies
5)There is potential bonding with others, as there are people on my floor that play the same kind of games I play
Cons:
1)it does cost 500 dollars and that’s a fair amount of money despite it being a cheap gaming pc
2)There is potential for me to get distracted because of the games, to the detriment of my grades and social life(though as I said I do have plenty of free time)
3)My parents argued against me getting it, and if I do get it they may be mad. Sounds pitiful from a college student but I hate disappointing my parents or making them mad

Diane and I were close, we shared  clothes, had girl talk frequently and we were very open about sexual stuff with each other- and just very comfortable with venting and confiding in one other. 

Our friendship took the turn for the worse when one night, Diane saw I was having a bad day and let me sleep in her bed with her, I agreed and we cuddled next to each other, her leg was over mine and she played with my hair a bit and my arm was across her waist, but Diane has large breasts so it’s not hard to see how my arm could’ve accidentally brushed against them, though I never had any intent whatsoever to pull on grope her breasts, we were best friends at one point and you don’t fucking do that to your best friend. 

We slept a little but our dorm bed is small so I got up in the middle of the night, went to my bed and slept. The next morning the dorm was a bit cold, and I thought we were comfortable with each other enough so I climbed next to her in bed for warmth and she just said “oh hey” and made space for me, I didn’t stay long because I felt bad for waking her up and realized I should’ve asked again before getting on her bed again. 

Days pass, the only indication that I had that she was upset about our night together was a text stating she needed space. 

A few more days pass, we reconcile when she has a rough day and our friendship goes back to normal, or so I thought. 

A few days later we have an argument because she had brought over 3 of her friends without asking and I was pissed about it, and then she moves out. 

Now she’s claiming the reason she moved out was because of what happened on the night I spent on her bed, and that I purposely tried to touch and grope her and the thing is, I’m pansexual so I’m so afraid she’s going to use that against me and paint me as some sort of pervert who touched her, and there’s already been an investigation launched.

I have talked to the case manager and we will have another discussion soon, I don’t know what to do. I’m emotionally spent and just sort of numb at this point. She is a very persuasive person, and I’m afraid of how more she will twist this to make me seem like the villain.

The video keeps playing in my mind and they posted it on their snapchat story but no one talks about it in school. They are all scared of them to do anything. 

Please i am in need of advice, what do i do?",30Sep2019,1
725,"tldr; I met a friend of mine a while ago on snapchat. We've met a few times but not often over the past year. Became basically best friends, now I'll often be left unopened for hours, but when we do talk it seems like nothings changed. Are we still friends or is she losing interest?

&amp;#x200B;

So, about a year and a half ago I met this girl on snapchat (I go to an all boys school so it's kind of necessary) we talked tons and became really great friends (platonic). We told each other a lot and talked to each other about things like anxiety and such. When school ended we met up and got along well. Then, over summer **I** became really bad at replying. Essentially, I was busy a lot of the time.

When we got back to school I became better at replying and things seemed to be going well, then suddenly she started taking ages to reply, this was only on videos so I thought nothing of it, ""Maybe she's just busy"" I thought. As we were mates I mentioned it but she never really said anything, so it was never really properly addressed.

Then recently, (what made me make this) she didn't open my videos, but then posted on her story ftm (face time me). This almost felt like a betrayal in a way (way to be over-dramatic) and kind of hurt me. I know I may be taking this way to seriously, but it happens a lot and I'm not sure what I should do. We've got plans to meet up sometime in the future but it all feels a bit forced and I honestly don't know if she's just sick of me or not.

Should I just stop replying as much or take it in my stride and roll with it?

My friend now has a protective restraining order and is pressing charges on the individual. My friend will have court throughout the year, and it's like salt in fresh wounds every time it happens. But my friend feels guilty, and I'm honestly running out of things to say. I want to be there for my friend, and I feel like I can't right now because I've never been in this situation. 

I've helped my friend secure their apartment, I've cooked my friend meals, I've given my friend space, and I've just tried to make sure my friend is as safe and comfortable as possible. 

However, now my friend is bailing on plans, sending one word responses, and I'm trying to be supportive over text but honestly I don't know how. It ends up with me saying the same shit every time and I feel like that makes me seem fake. I really do want to be supportive, I just don't know how.

I get that my friend probably needs more space, but I feel like I'm messing up or making the situation worse somehow.

729,"So, basically what the title says.  Ive been at this job for about 2 months now, and it took me several months to find.  It is honestly a great/dream job due to the opportunity.  I work at a law firm and I want to go to law school next fall.  It works out.  The issue is, I will be leaving in February for 3 months for the military, but after I return I would still like my job.  

Im aware that -technically- they have to give me my job back if I leave for training for the Army when I come back, but I dont want to create any bad blood by being like ""Im leaving and You have to hold my job for me"" or something.  Id like to work there later in life maybe as an attorney/summer associate or something if possible and the foot in the door really helps with all this.  Im pretty conflicted, there is only 3 slots for this job at this firm, and the other 2 are full time students so its not like they can handle the workload by themselves for 3 months.  But if its split between 4 people then theres not nearly enough work for all 3 of us to make it worth it and I doubt theyd go thru the effort of hiring someone part time for 3 months then firing them when I get back.

Fast forward till a month ago and I recently broke up with my girlfriend and wanted to talk to someone. I texted her to talk about what happened and such and while we were texting we decided to finally meet the next day. I drove an hour to her place to finally meet this beautiful woman. Everything went great, we spent the day together, I helped her out with some stuff, we got dinner and overall just had a good day, I didn’t think I did anything wrong, it seemed like everything turned out perfectly. I just want to point out that we DIDN’T do anything sexual, only hugged a lot, which was nice. 

A couple days go by and I didn’t hear anything from her, which was weird cause we use to Snapchat just about everyday to keep our streak. I text her to see how she’s doing and she texts back a few hours later. A few more days go by and same thing happens, I didn’t hear from her so I text her seeing how she was doing, but this time it took a few days for her to respond. I text her a couple more times with no response. One day I ask if she wants to hang out and she did respond saying she couldn’t. I text her one more time to see if she moved into her new apartment but to no response, and I don’t want to keep texting her cause I don’t want to seem creepy. 

A week ago she said something about my story and I responded back to what she said, she hasn’t opened that message and it’s been a week. She is active on snap, I can see her on snap maps and see when she was last on.

I honestly don’t know what to do? Do I keep texting her? Do I just ignore her for a few weeks to a month? Do I text her and tell her everything that’s been going through my head? I really care about this girl and I would love to try and go out with her, but I feel like I did something wrong when we met but idk, it’s not really like her to just stop talking to me all together like this. 
If I keep texting her I’ll feel like I’m a creep and I’ll scare her away. If I ignore her I’ll keep thinking about her and keep thinking about what I might’ve done to cause all this.

739," (I originally posted this to r/problems but I felt as though it would work on this subreddit too, thank you for your time in advance)

Me/105=Me, 106=Housemate that lives next to me

So basically my situation is this: I live in a student dorm (I share the ground/first floor with 6 other people) and I am very much kept to myself. I don't talk to anyone else here unless I have to, and when I'm in my room I'm pretty quite; I always use headphones when listening to anything or if I'm on the phone to my family/friends. In other words, I'm not exactly what I'd call ""loud"", especially compared to some of the people I live with. Also, for future reference, my room is right in the middle of two other rooms.

So the ""drama"" started 3 months ago when the new tenants moved in. (I had been living here since early January and the other people I lived with had moved out). There were no issues at all to begin with and I just kept my business to myself. I should mention now that dancing is a big hobby of mine but due to the small amount of space I have, I never do anything interesting, just a bit of stepping to the beat with the music (in my headphones) and I don't do anything like jumping or dropping to the floor, just simple shit. Well quite soon after the new lot had moved in, 106 knocked on my door and the conversation went something like this:

106: Hey 105, sorry but are you making that noise?

Me (slightly confused, I didn't think I'd made any noise): Haha I don't think so, sorry. Maybe it was the people upstairs? (the tenants that live upstairs are the loudest - always talking, drinking, having parties etc).

106: Oh okay, I'll ask them about it

I thought that was that. I wasn't being loud and the people upstairs had a history of making a lot of noise, but of course that's not where it ends. 106 told me that the guys upstairs said that it wasn't them and that it was in fact me so I accepted it and apologised for the inconvenience. From that moment onward I'd had this girl knocking on my door asking me about noise quite frequently and recently, at least once a day and I'd always apologise for it though I know I'm not being loud. Maybe you're thinking that surely 106 wouldn't just decide to randomly start knocking on my door, telling me to keep it down if I wasn't making any noise. Well I thought that too except there's a problem with that: Since January, I'd lived with two people in rooms either side of me and they NEVER once complained to me about noise. Not once. And I was actually a lot closer to the people I lived with before so they'd had many opportunities to bring up any complaints with me if they had any. On top of that, the girl who now lives in the room on my other side has never once complained about noise since moving in 3 months ago. Maybe you're wondering if no one else told me because they don't want to come across as rude but that I am actually making a lot more noise than I think I am when I dance. I wondered about that so I tried dancing without music. Not a sound. As I said before, I don't do any crazy moves and I step very lightly. The floorboards don't squeak at all (and that's not the complaint 106 made, she says that she hears ""crashing"" and ""banging"" from my bedroom) and my steps don't thud or make any significant noise.

It all sort of ""came to a head"" tonight when I was standing in front of my mirror. STANDING. Not even lightly dancing, just S T A N D I N G. I get an angry knock on my door so I open it. 106 is there, glaring and then it starts:

Me: 106?

106: Why the hell are you exercising this late!? (it was midnight at this time btw)

Me: Oh I wasn't?

106: Then what were you doing?!

Me: ...I was just standing and sort of, I don't know, walking around?

106: I am sick and tired of you making so much noise! You can exercise outside!

Me: I'm really sorry I kept you up. (yeah I know, I'm kind of annoyed at myself for being such a submissive bitch and apologising but at the time it just seemed easier than arguing)

106 just leaves in a huff. I was pretty upset after this tbh, I'm not a person who likes to get involved with other people and I always do the best I can to not cause a fuss and just keep myself to myself. This being the case, I called my dad to just have a chat (not about the incident, but just to catch up. I moved out of my home country this January and me and my dad are very close so I like to call him every now and then, especially if I feel sad or lonely). As I mentioned before, I always use headphones when talking over the phone and I kept my voice very low (not a whisper, but low enough to be a mumble if you weren't standing close to me). Well about 15mins into the conversation, 106 starts banging on my door and trying to open it but thankfully I'd locked it so she wasn't able to come in. I was a little shocked but my dad didn't seem to hear it and I was so sick and tired of her shit that I just ignored it and carried on talking to my dad. Eventually she gave up and walked away to do something that I wouldn't see until just now.

In the communal area, she had just posted dozens of post-it notes, saying extremely rude things about me, telling me that she'd ""suffered over the 3 months"" because of my noise and that her patience had run out (what patience though lol). I took them all down and threw them away. I'm still kind of laughing at the ""suffering"" part tbh, I can't believe someone could be that dramatic, but other than that I'm quite upset.

I really don't know what to do, I don't know how to react to all of this or how best to resolve it. I just honestly don't get it. I've got to be one of, if not THE quietest students in this dorm, especially considering the fact that I'm a loner and never invite friends or my boyfriend over to hang out. I just don't understand how me walking in my bedroom is such an issue to the extent that 106 feels as though she is ""suffering"".

Oh, and just one last piece of information: she stays up very late so even when I'm apparently making noise late at night (like just this evening at midnight) she is also awake and not trying to sleep.

I'd love to hear what you all think about this situation and if you have any advice for me, thank you in advance.

I got a in business while they all did majors that earn much more than me. I was always someone who didn’t place much of an emphasis on money, but seeing them have so much more has admittedly made me jealous, and I cannot stop comparing myself to them.  

My job pays me about $50k. My friends all make $80k+.  I’ve told them my salary before, and they were excited for me when I landed the job. However the other day, we were watching tv when the question came up “how much does x career make on average?”. We looked up the answer and it was $50k. Most of them scoffed at the amount and started making comments like “fuck that” and things along those lines. I don’t know if they just forgot how much I make, but it definitely sucked to experience that.

A few days later I was talking to a family friend who is in high school. Somehow he asked me how much I made. Still feeling down on myself from my conversation with my friends, I was hoping to impress someone so I lied and told him $60k. He had a “yikes” look on his face and said “that’s it?”. 

I look at the numbers, and I know $50k isn’t bad. It is a tad inflated since I live in one of the highest cost of living areas in the country, but it’s still above average. But damn I’d be lying if I said I didn’t feel like a loser right now. I guess someone has to be last place in every social group, but I never thought it would be me.

I would like advice about how I can approach a situation with an adult who just does not understand what I am saying.

I am a private tutor, and a parent recently reached out to me about getting some help for her son. She wants me to help him in PSAT prep, and has asked me to use the book she provides. 

Up to this point, I have no problems. She has clearly articulated what she would like me to do.  I list the times that I am available, and then give her some suggestions about how we should start. I always have students take a diagnostic test to see where they are. It helps me out a lot, but ultimately it’s for the benefit of the student. I obviously do not want to waste time on things that they are doing well in. 

She does not understand what I am saying, and seems to barely read my suggestions. She has not even given me a time to schedule her son for! She sends me text saying “That’s what I want you to do. Work on the book. Can you do that?”

It all started when the school bus had it's yellow lights on and so i didn't stop but i did let off the gas and prepare to slow down. As i got level with the bus it turned on it's red lights and i could see the driver motion for me to stop. Without hurting myself or others i tried my best to come to a complete stop but my tires weren't having it. What do i expect and how often do people get ticketed for this?,30Sep2019,0

762,"Well, title basically summarizes it. 

  
I've spent the last year trying to get away from my Dad and be able to support myself away from my Dad (My mother passed away). I moved across country, went to school, got a really good job and have been doing my best to finalize everything for my transition. My Dad has treated me as a personal maid service since I could wash dishes and I have been trying to distance myself for years.  


When I moved to a new city (1 year ago), I had to get shared living. Going to school with a tight budget. I left my pets (small dog, and cat) with my Dad while I transitioned and he understood when I found a place I would bring them. 

  
2 weeks ago, my Dad called me and told me he got diagnosed with throat cancer. So far everything is treatable and the prognosis is good. They just want to get him into chemotherapy fast. He wanted me to move back mid October so I could take care of my animals, I told him I would have to figure that out because I don't want to lose my job.

  
I just locked down a new home, and will be able to move all my pets here and really just move my entire life finally. When I got the keys I called my Dad and let him know that I found a new place, and I will be coming around the end of October near November 1st so I can get my pets. I also have people on stand by if my Dad feels like he can't take care of them before November 1st.  


He was really annoyed with me, and said 'Well who is going to look after me?'. My brother lives 3 blocks away from him and I live 2500km away. When I said 'What about *brother*?' he again got all annoyed but didn't give me any reason other than 'We all need to stick together'.  


I don't want to sound cold or anything but I'm not capable to take care of my Dad, he just bosses me around and is really misogynistic towards me.  I don't want him guilting tripping me out of my job, my new home and my new life to go take care of him. It would destroy my stability and my mentality. 

  
I've lived my whole life under my Dad's abuse and expectations, and everytime I get further he tries to reel me back in and literally take care of him. I'm very sad that he is sick and feels like he needs me, but I'm not capable, I have no idea how to get this through to him.   


My Dad also doesn't understand household responsibilities, his house has been on par with a young adults bachelor pad who's never washed a dish in their life. My grandmother took care of my Dad's house until he was 34, and married my Mom, Grandma moved her responsibilities to my mom. My Mom always resented my Dad for not having household skills. When I'm around he literally expects me to 'do my job', I've lived out of my dad's for at least 5 years now, and that's how he acts even if I'm visiting for Christmas.  


The last conversation I had with him he basically was like 'This is not a choice, I'm buying you a plane ticket and you're coming home'. I told him not to as I may lose my job but now I need to talk to him again. So I really need to figure out how to make this clear to him, I've been really emotional because I get really afraid about saying 'no' to him.  


So I need advice on how to say no, without destroying myself mentally, or having him destroy me mentally. It's been really hurting me deep, like I feel it in my bones kinda thing.  


How do I say 'No, I can't drop my life to take care of you' to my Dad who has pretty much no respect for me?

  
TL;DR Dad is misogynist who sees me as a personal maid and wants me to drop my entire life that I've been building to take care of him, how do I tell him no?",30Sep2019,1
763,"Ended up meeting this guy from my university at a mutual friends party. We were both fairly drunk and ended up talking for a long time. He seemed very, very into me and kept on hitting on me the entire time (he even told me he was hitting on me). We end up making out agressively and make plans to meet afterwards. The same night he sends me a message telling me what a great time he had. 

A couple of days later, I message him in the day asking if he's free to hangout later in the night. He says he is and we plan to meet at a certain time in the night. We both live literally minutes apart from each other. 

Like an hour before we're supposed to meet, he calls up saying he's hanging out with his friends and if we can do it tomorrow. I can understand bailing on me because of unfinished assignments/uni related work or emergencies but this seemed like kind of a shitty excuse. 

Not sure if I should go ahead with the thing tomorrow because I feel kind of unimportant now. And I'm not sure if he actually likes me or whether he was just super drunk the day we met.",30Sep2019,3
764,"Since the past two days,I started feeling like giving up on myself.

Problems being: 
I’m doing really bad in saving money, Even though I work for 70 hours. I always mess up something and end up going negative.
And it has been really bad every since I turned 21.

Failed numerous times to convince a girl for dating.

I have friends who call me a lot for social meetings/clubs and vacation ... little do they know about my economics, and I end up not going. 

But, Recently my younger sister asked me little money for her short trip and I gave it away even though I don’t have enough. 

But that feeling made me super happy like never before. 

And later I started giving more than usual tips for the people working in food courts/ gas stations, delivery guys etc., I love this a lot...idk why.. it is making me really happy when they say 
“Thank you so much instead of thank you”

I’m too tired to make myself happy.
I’m too tired obsessing on girls which will end up nowhere.
I’m too tired of seeking validation from people for everything I do.

So, I have decided to give up on myself. 
And live with a motto of giving and cut all my social life. 

I know I’m a loser, I’m totally aware.
But this new feeling I get from GIVING is super addictive.

Do you think I’m on the right state of mind ?

I’m the type of girl who waits for the right time to do everything. But I’m so lost with this. I live with crippling body dysmorphia, and I have since I was about 9. I know people think I’m attractive but I know that I will forever hate the way that I look, even if I look good. I live uncomfortably every single day, but with him it’s different. He makes me feel suuuuper comfortable, safe, warm, loved. I had to grow up very fast as a kid. My dad has a new family so I never see him, and my mom hasn’t been the same since he cheated on her after I was born. She’s distant, and fills her void with abusive men that I have to protect her from. I’ve gone unnoticed and unloved my whole life. Until I met him, seventh grade. We have been attached at the hip since. I tell him everything and vise versa. We see each other almost everyday, we wait to watch new episodes of shows just so we can watch them together, we made a pact that if neither of us get married by 35 that we would get married, we goof around and he makes me laugh more than anyone. Just little things that I don’t even think he knows how much I appreciate. I can’t even fully describe the way I feel around him because I’ve never felt it before. We’ve hooked up twice but it was just as friends, because we both know that if it turned into something more it would result in us never speaking again if it ended. But I can’t live without him. I want him to be mine, I don’t want to hear about the girls he’s with. I don’t want to see him get married. I don’t want to see him with anyone but me. But there’s no way I could tell him that. I know my soul is bonded with him, and I can feel it in my bones that we’re meant to end up together. But I don’t know that it could ever happen, even if he does feel the same way.

766,"Hello everybody! I am currently a third year medical student in Europe (uni starts tomorrow). Our institution's policy is that there are 12 groups of 11 people in one year.

 During my second year, I made a request to the board to transfer me to a different group than the one I was in during my 1st year. The reason for that was that they had way better teachers in the group I moved to. Now, this third year, I wish to move back to my original group, since my three best friends from uni are there, but lo and behold - the rest of the group doesn't want me back! The school board has approved my transfer, so legally everything is in order, but the people in the group (who btw used to be very friendly to me during our second year!) will not accept me back and have an entire vendetta against me! They even said they will go as far as making an official request to the board to exclude me from the group.

 I am honestly in shock and I tried talking to them but they just won't listen! I'm scared to even go to uni tomorrow, I don't know what to do.

767,"*WARNING* this post contains content about mistreatment of animals. 





To preface this, I am an animal lover. I’ve worked with animals for years including in shelters so I react very strongly to mistreatment of any animal. 
Recently I’ve been home more since I’m not working much, and I’ve noticed something that has been bothering me a lot. My neighbor has a young 4-5 year old son. The family has about four chickens in their back yard and a medium to small sized dog. 
I started to notice about a week ago when I kept hearing slamming outside my bedroom window. I looked outside to find the source and saw the son opening the top of the chicken coup, call the chickens up, and proceed to slam the roof down hard on the chickens... and I mean SLAM. This causes the chickens to startle and run to the bottom of the coup where there is chicken wire. He then whips dirt at them while they frantically move to avoid his attacks.
Along with this, I’ve also seen him let them out only to pull their feathers and chase them around the yard. I’ve also seen him hit and kick their dog multiple times and pull her tail.
His parents and grandparents leave him outside unsupervised in the evenings, this is when it’s bad. When they are outside with him he does it and I’ve heard them tell him off, but he just screams at them. 
I went outside the other day when I saw him throwing dirt again, and said “I hope you are being nice to those chickens” to which he replied “I AMMMM” screaming. He then went right back to hurting the animals. I know it’s not my place to parent their kid for them, and I don’t have kids myself so what do I really know.

Long-distance scares me but now that he's going to away ill be even more lonely, I have no friends and now won't have a partner nearby.

783,"One year ago, I started feeling sick a week after an exam. The day of the exam was a hard day and went on fasted from dinner to dinner (use to fast once or twice a week, not putting too much stress and pretty used to). During the exam, I felt a sharp pain in my back, which turned out to be an herpes. The doctor compared the test I had a week earlier (no herpes) and the one after the herpes. She determined they were ok and it explained why I felt a bit tired and sick.

There was an anomaly that lead me to another test though. The next test showed the same results. This is important: by the time I got my third test I gave vitamins a try. Started taking just vitamin C, B, whey and some sulfur compound (safe) for the stress of a university student's week. Mornings studying from 8 o clock, go home to cook lunch, go to faculty and then 1-2km at the pool. Those vitamins really helped a lot, but that's another story.

I have a personal problem with my mother though, she is nice, but wants to control everything and needs to keep an eye on all the stuff I do. This brought me to the point I was ashamed of asking my parents (her) for anything she didn't approve. I even bought once some candles to meditate and have some time for me at nights, but she found them and asked me about them. Besides, she told me to tell her, cause she would buy better candles for me. Sometimes cheap stuff bought with my money, for myself is just what I need mom.

But when I started my degree, I took some decisions she didn't ""understand"" such as becoming a good swimmer and not telling her about my personal projects and goals. I am writing a book and had an affair with a girl and didn't tell her.

So here's the problem. I am good at hiding stuff (diaries, my vitamins, books and swimsuit I bought with my money, handmade necklaces, tools...) but she found my ""stash"" recently. She is now quite bothered with that and tells me I shouldn't take them. It gets very annoying to be nagged at 20 yo.

Anyway, I took another two tests targeting some possible diseases and it turned out to be nothing. Ideopathic something, which is just an anomaly that they don't know why is it there but it has no effect on my body. I feel good, I perform well and am happy so I only can thank mother nature. I have to take a test I'm a few weeks, just to be sure everything is still ok, nothing important.

But my mother keeps saying I am ""hiding"" the possibility of a disease with my ""pills"". That those tests are not valid if I take supplements and modify my body's response to tests. I think I shouldn't stop taking them if I feel great and they don't harm me (doc knows, I told her). They're part of my weekly nutrition and menu, to say so. Should I stop smoking or drinking if I were to have tests? Or stop exercising? Or stop drinking coffee? Guess I needn't. 

What do you think, do vitamins and so hide and make tests go crazy?",30Sep2019,1
784,"My youngest sister is 28 and has been becoming increasingly withdrawn and secretive since starting a relationship last spring. She has broken up with and then secretly got back together with a man of a similar age who is controlling, constantly asks her for money and is emotionally abusive (threatens suicide when she breaks up and sends her vile, abusive messages when she does leave him). 

Since Easter this year, her behaviour has becoming increasingly odd. She sold her car after having debt collectors make threats because of missed finance payments - but we found out the car was sold on Facebook by her supposed ex boyfriend, along with lots of other items from her flat. Since then she has told the family she is no longer with him, that she has made police complaints about her ex for stalking activities. She also changed her phone number, moved house and jobs to make a fresh start.

However, it is becoming clear she has lied to us about all of the changes she said she has made. She hasn't allowed any of us to visit the flat she said she moved into 6 months ago, and her best friend recently told us that she was saying she'd actually moved back home. So she is lying about where she is living and none or us know where she lives.

Last week her 'old' work email was also copied in on a family email chain by accident and my parents received an out of office reply saying she was on holiday (which she was at the time) - which is not what you expect when she was supposed to have quit and got a new job 6 months ago.

We have checked her ex boyfriends Facebook page and he has within the last week been selling items we recognise as being my sister's, with pictures taken in what looks like the flat she said she moved out of earlier in the year.

In short, we don't know what to do. Every time we have tried to talk to her about this ex she gets defensive and swears blind she's not seeing him, but this always turns out to be a lie (she's been caught out when she posts Snapchats or insta stories with pictures of them together). We do not want to push her away, but we are hurt and worried that she seems to be lying about all aspects of her life to us.

We don't want to turn up at the flat we think she is still living in with this no-good boyfriend, as he can become threatening verbally and we don't want to make her life harder or put her at risk.

What can we do other than making it clear we are here for here whatever happens? Thank you in advance for your advice.",30Sep2019,1

So that you understand my situation. I'm 20 years old, live in Zone 3 London in a beautiful bachelors pad. I work in Central London as a software developer. I make £50k GBP per annum, and I'm pretty well off.

I have 3 good friends. One lives in Poland, the other 2 in London. One is moving back to France in 2 months, the other is sticking around.

My ex left me (for her ex) about 2 months ago. This was my first proper relationship and that hit me hard. I was suicidal and depressed (self diagnosed). I was depressed before the break up, but high functioning. I just saw everything in a negative manner. I'm still dreadfully depressed and come home from work and cry my eyes out every so often over the way my life is heading.

Now, I don't know if I'm the only guy likes this, but I suffer from a lot of confusion in the way my life is heading. I can't continue in my career as I suffer from dreadful Imposter Syndrome. This doesn't help with my depression. I actually enjoyed my job at McDonald's more. I think this is a result of me being a lot more Extrovert than I used to be. I don't know if I want a relationship, I don't know if I'm (maybe) bi?! I don't know who to go to for mental health support. I don't know what I want from my life. I used to be so sure about EVERYTHING and had full control of my life! I feel like I'm slowly spiralling and losing control of my life.

I go to work, sit at my desk for 8 hours and slowly code. I don't talk to anyone as it's a small tech startup and we're all just working hard.  I struggle to focus as I have so much shit on my mind, from suicidal thoughts (thinking of ways to die), a desperate craving for death (not suicide, I genuinely would like to die, but don't intend to commit the act), considering other careers, wondering why I'm lonely, thinking about moving to other countries, etc. 

Because of these long hours, I become very lonely at work and then head home to my lonely, empty flat. I can go a day without talking to anyone and it fucking hurts me.

When I finish work, I just cook something quick, watch TV, listen to music and game. I'm on technology all day!

&amp;#x200B;

I do want a relationship. I was on Tinder and Hinge and met this great girl, so different from many others. She was intelligent yet kinky, small but powerful, cute Asian, Motivated, Happy, etc. I got hooked on to her, and she definitely like me. We had three dates, all went super well (other than a couple of minor arguments as she was very opinionated) . I know I'm sounding BETA, but that's why I'm here, I want advice on everything.

When I get hooked, I get:

1. Attached
2. Happy
3. Desperately checking texts
4. Desperately stalking this girl on Instagram, checking to see if she's online and going to reply
5. Trying to find things to distract me from her

This are all really overbearing and bad traits, I know, which again is why I'm here asking for advice, I'd love to become more self-dependent.  I definitely develop feelings, QUICK, if I like the girl. It's always been returned on their side too, so it's like we both get instantly attached. Even though I'm pretty independent in life and have gotten myself to where I am career wise through my own hard work, I still get very attached and reliant on girls. I get hooked to my phone and literally just wait for a reply from this girl (we're still casually chatting). I've had a couple girls I've just hooked up with and don't get attached to, but when I do get attached it's quick and I become very paranoid/untrustworthy. I think I panic that I'll lose them, because I have a very specific taste

 She ended the relationship because I was too successful and, as someone who was quite powerful, she didn't like feeling as lesser of a person. Very strange, but I believe it fully.

&amp;#x200B;

I can feel myself slipping into addictions, from unhealthy fast-food (I used to love cooking), to alcohol and slowly weed. I used to drink on nights out, now it's any social event (usually meeting friends in the week), to when I'm lonely and alone and watching TV. I'm now drinking about 4 - 5 times a week. Smoking weed once a week. I feel like I'm only sober 1 day a week.

&amp;#x200B;

I have some great hobbies. Motorcycle riding, cars, skateboarding, guitar, fashion, gaming. Motorcycling is my favourite and it's a great way to escape loneliness as it requires full focus and it's forced focus. Shame that I live in London and Motorcycle theft rates are so high that I can't warrant paying for the ridiculous insurance! So I don't even have my favourite hobby anymore. I'm too lazy to skate and learn the guitar again.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel stuck in this constant cycle of work, drinking and getting attached to girls and then crying over loneliness when they leave.

789,"I had a friend (or so I thought) for many years who was like a sister to me. I trusted her and always felt she was genuinely there for me, but as time went on I began to notice how she would take digs at me in front of other people, never appear happy for my successes, and recently I came to find out she had been talking crap about me to others. She has even made up nasty rumors about me to hurt my character. I finally confronted her and this ended our friendship. Soon after she took to Instagram to post ""Bye bitch"" on a picture that was very clearly referring to me. This led to people who did not know the situation start to message me asking what had happened and this REALLY bothered me, as it was an extremely poor representation of who I am. I wanted to be the bigger person so I did not respond in any catty way. She is no longer on any of my social media accounts but has continued to post things with captions that are very much about me (causing people to continue talking and speculating), has even told some of our mutual friends that she was victimized by me, and has now even resorted to HACKING mine and my bf's Facebook accounts. I know it was her because of the location the breach came from, it happened to be a place she was visiting at that exact same time. So what do I do?

791,"I’m a recent graduate in a STEM field with very very few entry level positions. I graduated in June and haven’t even found many jobs to apply to/that I even come close to  for, which has gotten super discouraging. Lots of great mid to senior level positions but how the heck am I supposed to get to that point??

 A little while ago, an entry level position FINALLY popped up that I’d be 100% perfect for, and luckily the founder of the company is my uncle’s cousin. My uncle spent an hour talking me up over the phone, and the founder had me send him my resume directly and said that even though he was mostly retired, he’d talk to the people doing the hiring and see if he could get me an interview. 

The application period closed on Friday the 20th, and I have yet to hear back about an interview. Today I was copying that same cover letter into another application (with tweaks of course), and noticed to my absolute horror that the VERY FIRST few words were “I am recent graduate” instead of “I am a recent graduate”, even though myself and my partner proofread many many times to check for mistakes. 

If I fucked this up I’ll never be able to forgive myself. I have a science degree from a prestigious university and haven’t been able to even hardly find job leads, let alone a position, and it’s been discouraging and depressing to say the very least.

I come from a small town, go to a small college, and keep a very low profile so I’ve never experienced anything like this. 

So recently a started my junior year in college and on the first day of class a there was a guy that started talking to me. He’s 44, I’m a 21 yo girl, but I didn’t think it was too weird so I briefly helped him and didn’t think anything of it. But as weeks progressed he started talking to me more and more, slowing becoming possessive of me to where he gets sometimes upset when I’m talking to other guys in classes, and stays after class to try and talk to me. I told my professors and head of my department last week, and they claimed they were going to talk to him and do something, but his behavior has just gotten worse. (Staring at me across class all class. Bragging about me to the class even though we’ve talked maybe 3 times, hovering over me while I’m talking to other people in class) I didn’t even know this guy’s name until 2 weeks ago. 
I no longer feel safe alone on campus and I have started carrying a high potency pepper spray in my pocket when I am alone. I hide my car in a back parking lot in hopes he won’t find out it’s mine and I make a point to never be alone in a room with him, even if it is an extreme inconvenience. My mother isn’t sure what to do, my professors just want me to keep talking to them, and my partner wants me to stand up to this guy and tell him to “f*** off and stop talking to me”. I’m not sure what to do. I want him to stop treating me like I’m his property but at the same time I’m afraid of upsetting him because I’m honestly not 100% sure on his mental state. So if anyone could offer any advice It would be much appreciated. Thank you in advance!",30Sep2019,1
796,"I'm making this from a new account, since my other username might be known by my ex.

This will be longer. It's a lot of recap of the last year, but you can jump to after the line where I come to the present. But it will be much easier to understand if you read the first part.

My best friend, let's call her J. has a life that seems cursed by bad luck and bad decisions. First of all she is the most lovely person I know. She's strong and sensible. But by now she is broken. And it's hard for me to see her like this. She always had struggles with depressions, but always managed to get out of it by searching for new ideas what to do about it and even taking advice. 

I don't know if she will ever get out of this, or how it is possible. Last year she moved to an other city and got pregnant from what seemed like the first decent guy she ever had. It was a surprise, since she was told she can't have children because of some of the many health problems she has (rheumatism, problems with thyroid which got removed eventually and so on). She wanted to get it and wanted the father to be involved, even though they already broke up. They were back together and the horror started. He got aggressive and very jealous. He would and hit her but yell at her and accuse her of ridiculous things (like having his phone hidden during the night when he couldn't find it). 

I fast forward here, because for a year it was a ""I won't speak with him again"" to a ""But he is so nice, when he is not acting crazy"". He started to act crazier and crazier. Starting to smash plates and threatening to kill himself. The worst part is, that when she moved back home her parents didn't believe her. They thought she was crazy, because that guy is so nice and decent. He was. And he was so manipulative. If I hadn't surprised him when he had a fit (where he was going crazy and destroying her entrance door all night long, because he wanted to come in), I would had a more hard time to believe her, since she was at a point where she wasn't sure herself if whatever happened wasn't that bad at all. (After having seen his fit, I had palpitation for 24hrs and would startle during the night for some days).

So he was having her family turned against her even after the child was there. There was an incident where he was locking her up and hiding her phone so she couldn't call anyone. Later he would say ""I had to hide you phone, because otherwise you would call the police again"". In his brain this made sense. Slowly her family (father, mother, brother) came to realize that maybe the daughter was not overreacting, but they were always going back to believing him. Until she went to a psychiatry where he stayed for some days and they diagnosed him with some kind of borderline syndrome. Before they were at a psychiatrist for one hour and that guy had the nerve to tell him he was fine, but he should look after his girl, because that's the one who needs to have her mental health checked, while she was in the room with them.

She wanted to get away from all this and move to her parents, where her brother (who still lives at home with 28) got really jealous and left with his girlfriend and child all of a sudden and would not answer calls. It was so much drama, most of it seemed like being made up by bad writers. But in reality everything was so hurtful for her. 

---------------------------------------------------------------

There happened so much more. 
Tl;dr: Boyfriend (P) got abusive after J. got pregnant. Parents didn't believe her, because he's highly manipulative. She (J) didn't believe it at some point, but I was witness. Boyfriends mental illness got diagnosed. Best friend's brother is a dick too.

Right now she gave up her flat and wanted to move to her parents house. P wanted to paint the flat, instead he sold her furniture and did not really do much painting, so she has to do it alone in an empty flat, with the baby around. Unfortunately I live in an other city, so I can't help her much. She doesn't have a job anymore since the pregnancy was not going good and she got some strange pregnancy related illness (cholestasis and something else). 

She started a therapy where she realized that her father was similar to her boyfriend. Not that extreme, but still very bad (Was calling her ""pile of shit"" and similar things, which she thought was normal for a family, since all her friends said her dad was so nice). So her parents were visiting her and she witnessed her father saying something disgusting to her mother and kicking her. (Alone writing this seems so surreal). So she got really fed up and kicked him and asked him if this felt good and he should apologise, instead he kicks her back. She starts yelling they should leave her flat, and her mother tells her: ""But it's just one of his fits, it's not bad, ignore him."" and they won't leave. She graps the baby and wants to leave, but they won't let her. At this point P comes in and asks if she is getting crazy again and she should go to psychiatrist. She starts yelling and eventually they leave and take P with them to sleep in her room by her parents. He promised to leave the country by Wednesday (he's from an other country) but soon they realized he doesn't have a ticket yet.

When she told me this whole story while she was crying and telling me she didn't know where to go. It's so hard to imagine this story, since I can't imagine her yelling and getting so angry. I guess it's because she was always holding back, like she was taught by her mom. ""Men just are like this..."". In her family if a man gets aggressive it's ""ignore him, he will get better"" while getting called the worst things, but if a woman is doing this she's hysteric and fit for psychiatry.

She doesn't have any money, has a 8 months old baby, has no family to rely on (maybe her mother, who is also sick and can't hold the baby), and has only me who lives in an other part of the country. 

She tells me I'm the only person she can rely on and I would do anything to help her, but I don't have much money - which she wouldn't take anyway, and don't have much time. And I'm on the verge to depression myself. What can I do to help her? What can she do? What advice can I give her?

Her story is so unbelievable, more so with more detail. I realized when talking with my therapist about it that it seems like something out of a tv show...",30Sep2019,3

803,"So there's a lil backstory behind this.

So basically this all happened a few months back. There was this girl in school that I really like, but I honestly never talked to her. Thing is, she always made eye contact with me, but me being a shy ass guy just looked away all the time. I caught her looking at me a few times, but she just keeps on looking 24/7, like it's just me in the room.

Weirdly enough, there was another friend with me who liked her aswell. So let's call that guy ""Sam"" just so it makes the story a lil easier. So another friend of mine made a snap picture of Sam. Coincidentally he had someone in his snapchat list that was friends with this girl that I liked. So she asked my friend who the guy on the snap (Sam) was. They explained it etc etc and then Sam got her instagram info. Fast-forward after that and they had a ""date"". I wouldn't say date though, since it didn't end well. 

Now we fast-forward to just last week. I saw this girl again, but again, she keeps looking my way. But I honestly ignored it because 1) I thought she just liked Sam back then. 2) Pretty sure she has a boyfriend. Mind you I've never once talked with her at all, just ALOT of eye contact + catching her gaze while I wasn't looking.

Now just a few days back she added me on LinkedIn, which is kind of weird since it's a website for searching jobs. But to me it seems kind of weird that she'd add me on LinkedIn, when I've clearly never talked to her, but again had alot of eye contact and smiling etc etc.

I honestly don't use any other social media platform besides LinkedIn and Snapchat.

So what I wanna know is, did this girl add me on LinkedIn just to be ""professional"", or does she want me to make some type of move on her?",30Sep2019,0

814,"Hello Reddit!

TL:DR: I went to my ex's house, ended up having sex, and her parents found out. What can I do?

So as the title says I went to my girlfriend's house over the summer, the plan was not to have sex but just to hang out. 

Some background: We have been dating for 3 years but she has only recently told her parents that we were dating about 5 months ago, so I'm pretty a new person to them. Her mom has known me for a little bit but 2 of her family members have known me for a little bit over 2 years. 

It all started with us being home alone over the summer and since my parents trust me a lot they let me go out as long as I let them know. Every time I went to her house, I just told them that I was going to go skate with my friends and they believed it until her dad called my mom about the whole shenanigans. Where we fucked up though (aside from me sneaking into her house), was when we had sex. We agreed on not having any until later on but some things led to other things and we ended up doing it. I kept going to her house to hangout for a few more days until she told me that she confessed. She told me that she had lots of anxiety of her mom finding out and there was a breaking point and she had to tell her. 

Her mom went berserk (which is understandable).

815,"I really struggle to connect with new people. I'm a freshman at a  large university, moved in a month ago. Back home I've a tight group of very close friends and I never felt alone or lonely. In fact I'm usually the loudest or most talkative of all of them.

But here, I'm finding it super difficult to make even a single friend. Everyone around already seems to have formed their groups of close friends. And they seem to be having a super fun time. I did join a few clubs and am enjoying it quite a bit. Didnt really bond anyone yet but in any case none of them live on campus so I cant really spend too much time with them even if I did. 

I tried initiating conversations. But even if they respond, I always struggle to get past the initial stage of small talk full of silences. Then I lose contact and basically never talk to them again. Idk, my mind just seems to go blank and it rarely goes past the stage of small talk. Which is weird because with the people I'm close to I don't run out of things to say. I'm pretty self conscious so I guess that's one reason I may be happening. Once I realise someone isn't going to judge me I become more relaxed around them.

So far my university life is rather lonely. I eat alone, spend most of my day alone. And it's getting rather saddening. I enjoy spending time with people, partying, etc and Idk what to do. I tried the things I read online. ""Question them,"" ""find groups of people with similar interests"" etc

Though recently his tone switched. My dad comes home tired and talks about how tough work was. Use to, he would say that the work day was “good”. But now, he just says “It was work” or “stressful”.

Plus, the other night, I was talking to him about how I found out that electricians usually retire in their 50s (he is 51 as of writing this). He basically responded with “Yeah I think I’m done with work” and then said that his 50s would be a perfect time to “fly with the angels.” That caught me by surprise, but my mom wasn’t that phased and said not to worry about.

Now, he is always talking about how he has had enough of work or just had enough in general. This is incredibly worrying to me. The rest of my family members don’t seem to as worried as me, saying that it’s just him getting old.

I’m scared that one day I might go home or wake up in the morning to see that my dad had killed himself or try to.

I want to talk to him, but I’m pretty sure there is a chance that he’ll just brush me off and say “you’re too young to be worrying about me.”

I'm going to just jump right into to:

I have a missing front tooth (#9) that my dental office offered 2 different treatments for, treatment A by Doctor A (is with a different dentist, but same chain) and treatment B by Doctor B.

Treatment A is a classic dental implant, with a post, and porcelain crown on top.

Treatment B, is just a bridge from #8 and #10.

Me and doctor agree Treatment A is best for me. Doctor A then tells me I need a bone graft/cartilage graft since I lost bone density in area, and assures me even if it doesn't hold, we'll keep trying, and even if then it doesn't work/hold the procedures will be credit towards treatment B. Well... I start treatment A over a year long period, and 3 separate surgeries which unfortunately, all failed. Over this period AFTER insurance I payed out of pocket $4,500 (insurance only covered up to $2500) per year. So overall I'm down 7000. My dentist assures me again that this will be credit towards treatment B so I won't lose out. Bummer, but I start treatment B and get #8 and #10 filed down for crowns, and imprints taken. This is where I need help with/cant understand....

My balance for treatment B is not 1500 (since it's 8500 total), it's the ENTIRE 8500. I then get confused and ask to make sure there is no mistake, and they assure me there is not. After a bit of back and forth, they get a hold of Doctor A at the other facility and confirmed there was to be credit given, however the credit amount is only 2500. And to top it off, the insurance declined costs for treatment A, so I am being charged for the full 7000 from treatment A, with only 2500 credit. and then now ALSO expected to pay for the 8500 bridge of treatment B.

Is this something I should being up with a legal advisor/attorney? I am kind of at a lost what to do, since it was never in writing what amount I would be credited, only mentions in the dental notes ""credit to be given for treatment A"".

Thanks for reading, sorry it came out longer than intended.

TLDR: Credit promised to me from failure of treatment A (7000 total) not applied in full (only 2500) for Treatment B (8500).",30Sep2019,1
823,"Background: my grandma has always been eccentric and controlling. Every time me or my 3 siblings did anything wrong (or even if we didn't) then her go-to was saying she's cut us out of her will. I don't think she's a bad person by any means, however both my mum and my aunt have said that she was a very controlling parent and didn't let them do or have much as kids and they were both glad they moved out asap (this is important). 

I don't talk to my grandma much, maybe one text every couple of months, however she called me today to say she's wanting to change her power of attorney to be me instead of my aunt as she says they were on holiday together and my aunt started screaming at her and threw her to the ground. 

 As a 22 (m), I don't have much knowledge around what power of attorney specifically means. She says it means if she gets diagnosed as not being able to make her own decisions then I will have to decide if she goes into a home or whether she gets cared for at home etc, and ultimately to ensure her will is divided up properly. 
 From what she has said, she thinks my mother and aunt will do anything in their power to put her in a home and take her money, hence the urgency to change her power of attorney. 

 In my opinion, she currently is not able to distinguish between truth and imagination, however my concern is that if she's telling the truth and I don't believe her then I'm putting her in a position to be abused (although I do believe this is a very very unlikely scenario). 

If I contact my mum she will go spare about this (she constantly thinks my grandma - her mother - is lying, manipulative and controlling), and it will ultimately get back to my grandma. 

My question is this: would I be better off confronting my mum and aunt about this and letting them know what is happening; or accept power of attorney and deal with any reaction from them at a later date (most likely when gma is in a state unable to look after herself or decide what is best for her)?

Last month I was hanging out with my boyfriend of three months when he collapsed and went into cardiac arrest. I started compressions until first responders arrived and took him to the hospital. The next day I met his sister for the first time and we spent the next five days waiting for my boyfriend (Jon) to stabilize and wake up from his medical sedation.  When Jon finally woke up he showed signs of extreme delirium and didn't seem to recognize anybody.


On day four he seemed to have had a moment of clarity and called for me by one of his nicknames. I was so happy to see life in his eyes again, as soon as I began to get my hopes up he drifted back to the fog of amnesia. Excited to explain his  remembrance to his sister upon her arrival she seemed annoyed and disinterested. I went home that night and was asked to not come visit until he requests me. Sad and confused I obliged not wanting to stress his family out more than what they were.

I continued to text him daily, with well wishes and affirmations until I was asked a week later to stop by his sister citing that his phone wasn't a ""personal love diary and our relationship wasn't valid due to its short length) I was devastated.  Although our relationship was only 3 months i feel strong about our connection whether it be 3 days 3 months or 3 weeks I care about the well being of this man entirely!  After another week I got one followup about his condition/recovery and then they stopped giving me updates altogether.

I am texted and called by his sister from time to time, telling me things like, ""move on, and he doesn't want to see you"" i don't even respond to her because im sure she is angry and is possibly taking it out on me and just yesterday she blocked me from all his accounts including FB where she changed his profile photo (cause I had taken it) and im scared that shes erasing me entirely and spinning some story to anyone who inquired about “the girl who saved him” 

my only alibi is the text messages that shes sent.  I have been told that he has asked ""who found me""  and im scared that theyre lying to him, which is (in my opinion) not beneficial to his recovery. I cry for him everyday, i pray for him AND his sister, that maybe she'll have a change of heart and will perhaps let me see him, if only to see if hell recognizes me,but i won't hold my breath.

i don't know why im sharing this story, perhaps someone else has gone through something similar and can offer some type of advice, this is by far the worst heartbreak i have ever endured, i don't even know how he is and thats what kills me.",30Sep2019,46

So, my roommate and I have a decent relationship. It’s tense at times as he’s a little more messy than I am, and I have trouble with confrontation over little things. We live together in a very small house. I got home from work on Sunday evening, and saw that he is having a couple friends over. The house smells pungently of weed. My one firm rule is, of course, “please just don’t smoke in the house.” I should also mention that I didn’t have any idea that his friends were coming over. These are friends who live hours away, and they both arrived with suitcases. It was late, so I shrugged it off and went to bed while they went out with friends. I left in the morning to go to class, and came home to just his friends alone in my now cluttered living room (Living room is a stretch— the house is genuinely almost impossibly tiny). One of them tells me that they planned to stay until Friday, something that really kind of shocked me considering I didn’t even know they were coming over in the first place. I texted my roommate about it, just saying “please give me a heads up next time you make plans like this” because it gets cramped with just the two of us, and having two friends over for a week seems like it will become somewhat strenuous. He told me that he had told me about it well over a week ago and that I must have forgotten. This, of course, makes me seem like an asshole. He warned me about this and I got mad at him about it anyway. However, while I can be forgetful, I’m certain I’d remember news of something this disruptive. I immediately apologized to my roommate because I can’t shake how bad I’d feel if he really did tell me and I really did forget. I just don’t know what to make of the whole situation.

Hi guys! This might not be even half as serious as some of the other stuff posted on here, and it’s probably kind of stupid but I have a huge tendency to over worry and stress out...

So some backstory; I have a friend who really loves to make spontaneous decisions, and I often just go with them because most of the time, it’s a bit of fun. However, she is also extremely easy to irritate and will get mad at me for having short replies when I’m busy.. etc. 

This summer, approx June, maybe?? We saw that a small band we both liked was doing a concert in a city four hours drive away from where we live. It was going on a Saturday of November. Naturally, my friend asked me whether I want to go with her or not. I said yes, thinking that my school workload wouldn’t be too bad. I was wrong. 

When I go home on a Friday evening, I spend pretty much all of my time from then until Sunday night doing copious quantities of homework. Our teachers really don’t give us mercy, to the point where I have received a bad finger strain that needed medical attention. Note, we’re only like four or five weeks into the school year! This leaves me with barely any spare time as I also spend my Saturday mornings going to an art class and then work for a few hours. 

I’ve also lost interest in the band! Completely! I genuinely don’t know how to tell my friend that I don’t think I want to go to the concert. She has already bought the tickets for us (and I have yet to pay her back.) I don’t know what to do, we’re to leave on a Saturday morning and come back like Sunday evening. This most certainly isn’t enough time to do my homework and study, especially when we get tests almost every week. I was thinking of just being upfront with her and telling her but I’m afraid that she will get really upset and ignore the hell out of me. (She has done this before, and has a habit of talking trash about people..) 

I know she doesn’t really sound great but I’m all that she’s got at this point so I just deal with it.  I've asked my other friends for advice and a lot of their answers have been really mixed, so reddit is my last resort. 

Anyway, I really genuinely need help. How do I tell her that I don’t want to go? Should I be upfront and pay her back for my ticket asap? Should I just go to the concert and try to cram my homework? Please help me, as it’s starting to really stress me out!

It is 2 am and I'm writing this post out of despair.
I'm a university student and I live in a dormitory.
It's my third semester and this semester it was decided that I should be the class representative.
Well, I thought that since last semester our representative did things that screwed us in the exams I decided to do things this time. But suddenly my problems increased, not started just increased dramatically.

You know I'm not gonna tell you my problems or create drama, but so many times my friends just tell me to stop being a right honest nice guy and be a jerk sometimes. But I can't.

You know my main problem is a guy.
 I have a 40 years old classmate who does nothing and tells everyone to do everything. And he always gets what he wants!
You know because he's old and knows how to talk, he can get everyone to do what he wants. He easily traps people into doing things. (He has two times more EXP in life...) he is literally a jerk but I tell myself I must be a good guy and just try to ignore him or be nice to him and try not to do what he says.
But he's literally an alpha male wire puller.

I don't know what to do with him.

Tonight I had an intense argument with him. I knew what he was saying was total bullshit. But after that I went to soften his nerves just because I think this is the right thing.

Hi kind internet strangers! &lt;3 I want to schedule a coffee date or lunch (which do you think is better?) with a former retired English teacher. The purpose would be to catch up and find out how she is doing. Below is the letter I plan to ask a teacher that knows where she lives, to mail to her. Any small or large suggestions for improvement would really be appreciated!!! The names of the school, cities are not the real ones. I also didn’t use her real name.

About me and teacher, in case info is relevant. She most likely lives about an hour away from the school now. My grandma lives in that general area tho. I’m 23. She is retired and in her 70s. She taught High School English. I was in her Society and Politics in Literature class (I didn’t want to take advanced English that year and didn’t want to take philosophy in literature so I ended up in her class). She has a son and has 1 or more grandchildren now. If more info is needed, lmk plz

Please call me at 894-545-4334 so we can schedule a time to meet for coffee and talk about how is retirement going for you, how is your granddaughter and so I can also give you your gift which I still have and I really think you will like. Ms.Lewis will forwarded this letter to you. Someone once told me you live in Rock City. I don't know if that is true. My grandmother lives in Oltia City and I live with her in her house 4 days a week and live in Hiewu (the city that the high school is in) with my siblings and parents, 3 days a week. My job is very flexible in terms of hours and I work from home so my schedule is very flexible. Traveling isn't an issue for me. Let's meet at a place that is convenient for you. Maybe we could meet at a coffee shop. Btw, the coffee would be my treat! :-) Or we can meet anywhere else that is convenient for you. You had a lot of students and if you don't remember me, please don't feel bad. :-) I would be happy to jog your memory about anything related to me. (I don't want her to decline meeting me because she doesn't remember who I am. She is kinda old and had bad health when she was my teacher so maybe has memory issues. I don't know how to say, ""don't feel bad if you don't remember me"" in a better way. I especially need help with rewording this)

Regards,

Kira

Any small or large suggestions for improvement would really be appreciated!!! Thank you in advance, kind strangers &lt;3


Edit: All personal info.. phone number, name of cities, her name, etc are fake. I will replace the fake ones with real ones ofc before mailing the letter

852,"I was invited to a former roommates wedding reception this month, located in the western United States. Not the wedding itself, just a reception the day after with light refreshments, dancing and mingling with the bride and groom. It will be in their parent’s backyard, and is an open house style reception and people aren’t expected to be there the whole time, just stop by for a bit. However, the reception is in another state and I won’t be able to go. 

So my question is, how much should I spend on a gift? I am only casual friends with this person, we have dinner together occasionally and would interact because we lived together, but didn’t hang out much. I really don’t want to spend a lot of money on a gift to a wedding I’m not even going to. Does the fact that I wasn’t invited to the actual ceremony, just a casual reception the next day, mean I can spend less on the gift without being offensive? I don’t have a lot of extra money and this couple doesn’t really need anything. They are both in their late 30s, well established and been living together for over a year so it isn’t like they need help setting up their new household. 

Would it be inappropriate and tacky to just spend $25, either cash or something small on their registry? I haven’t been invited to a lot of weddings, but I get the sense it is expected to spend more like $75-$150 on wedding gifts. I can’t really afford that right now, but they wouldn’t know that as I don’t talk about my financial situation.",30Sep2019,2

from Texas

I'm not sure if this is the correct sub-reddit. Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

I  lost my father in march of 2017 to cancer, I didn't get to have a last  talk with him and it was very painful, my mother started turning me  against him early in life, as young as 4 or 5. When i went to see him  one last time, he lifted his head and i saw the love in his eyes. It  hurt. Ive been fighting with it until now. After my father left i took  my mother in, she is a very mean, selfish person, she broke my fathers  soul, i thought she would change after his passing, but she did not, it  carried over to me, i was called names, tried to ruin my marriage,  constantly drunk(Nothing new).

The  company i work for let me take 1 week off, which was hardly enough, but  its policy. I ended up missing 4 extra days, (He said 5, but one day I  left an hour early, which he insisted was ok), which my boss wrote me up  3 months later for, I told him how i was, he said call the hotline,  what can ""I"" do for you. So i looked him dead in the eye and said ""I  will not miss another day, can i go back to my seat"" I haven't trusted  him since. So i try to keep to myself, i maintain a good scorecard and  haven't gotten any occurrences since.

He  got promoted, another lady took his place as a temporary manager. After  my parental leave I came back and she asked me one day ""Are you going  to teach your daughter about Jesus"". No. I will not  guide her in a  direction, she will choose that later in life if she decides, i myself  am atheist. Her response blew my mind, ""Your family is going to die a  horrible death because Jesus is gonna come and take the believers""

A  little later, this guy gets hired into the team, which I knew him  previously, not well though. The day of his interview i said ill put a  good word in. He says ""Don't bother he is a family friend""....ok....One  day he comes up to me telling  me this story about how he had to protect  his son from some dude that yelled at him, asked ""Would you do that for  your daughter""..weird...

Constantly  comes by my desk asking about my daughter, asking if the pictures, of  which she is very happy in, ""Are they recent"" wtf? shes 6 months old  dude what do you mean recent...But im nice so i just say yes.

Recently  they put this ""Weekly"" quote up like 2 weeks ago, that hasn't been  changed weekly, writes ""One this road called life, you have to take the  good with the bad, smile  with the sad, love what you got, and remember  what you had. Always forgive, but never forget, learn from your mistakes  but never forget. People change, Things go wrong. But just remember the  ride goes on"" from.........netcancerawareness.org, (nobody else has  lost someone to cancer recently to my knowledge).

Now  everyone constantly questions me, people look at me bad, I feel so  incredibly uncomfortable in this place its insane, i don't know what to  do anymore, I've done nothing to anyone here. I'm always kind. Its who I  am.

Ive given thought into  contacting HR but don't know if i should. The promoted boss is still  there, and people worship him because he runs the ship as ""If you  scratch my back i scratch yours"" I don't believe in that so i don't. I   work and keep a perfect scorecard. So I'm afraid people will lie for  him.

Is there anything i can do or should do?, I feel harassed.

It a large business i work for.",30Sep2019,1
858,"So to start it off with some backstory.  
 I met a German girl on an app sometime ago, she planned to move to England to do some Au-pairing. She came over in early august this year.  
 We both had visions of us being in a relationship but were willing to take it slow so we don’t rush in and potentially ruin our friendship.  
 

We met for the first time in person a week after she arrived and all was good. We didn’t do anything risky to the relationship.  
 We met again 2 weeks ago and this is where things have slightly changed.  
 Now normally she has these spells of non talkativeness. I’m used to it, I did too but I haven’t had any for some time now. Normally they last a few days and all is good.  
 But this time on the Sunday of us meeting for the second time we went to the cinema. In a kind of unofficial/official date. This was the weekend of the 15th September.  
 Its been two weeks now, she was in a non talkative mood roughly the 16th after I mentioned it was technically a date.   
 but unlike the other times it seems to have dragged on and still seems like her mood hasn’t changed. She’s been avoiding questions I ask her, sometimes it goes 3-4 days without a response. Nothing seems right, her behavior is all off from the girl I know and i'm scared things are falling apart.  
Am I just overthinking everything or is there cause for concern?  
I really like her and cant think what i'll do if it all ends, shes helped me with so much personally and i'm kinda head over heels for her. its been a horrible 2 weeks now.",30Sep2019,1

Anyways, I‘be asked a few friends if she’s dating or talking to anyone they have all said she’s talking to a guy now that she likes but he likes someone else. Do I stick with it and text her some and build a friendship or do I drop it?? Another question: I’m really shy around girls. I think it’s because I’ve been rejected a lot by girls in the past. I just can’t seem to talk to them unless I’m absolutely forced to, as in a group project or a presentation. I’m really liking this girl and I’ve found we have a lot in common.

We will be about to do the swimming unit.

I talked to a friend of mine about it (who wasn't there) and he says it is wrong and she should get in trouble but I don't see why, I talked to another person and they said this was out of line and should be reported If she was actually doing anything then I would agree.

862,"We both know relationships can be hard, not just romantic ones. But it feels like I'm not being met half way. She shows less affection than she used to, she's always busy sorting out here flat or trying to loose weight. She said once her flat is in order (and there are years of stuff to sort through so I know it's not a lie). She snaps at me a lot, she doesn't like dark humour so I stopped using it around her. But if she does something I don't like I get shouted down. So now I keep things to myself. We used to be spend more time together and have more sex. Now 3 years later I'm still waiting for her to re order her flat and old things she's acquired over years, I'm still waiting for her weight loss (I don't care about her weight, I care about her full stop) But she keeps on saying it/trying it. So I hardly see her compared to how it used to be. She says I love you less. Her friend had cancer and she took a lot of time out of her life. Which I completely agree with and understand. I have a lot of health problems already, and nasty ones at that. They now think I may have a brain tumour. As my memory is terrible, my vision goes blurry or double, I go dizzy and get headaches. Tonight I asked if she had time for a bath before one of her favourite TV shows. And she gets grumpy with me cos she'd already said it in a WhatsApp voice recording. I was taking interest in her and her life. She has known for about 2 months about these symptoms and how worried my Neurologist is about me. And I hardly see her, she spent my cake day with me, then last thing at night says she's going on a short bed and breakfast with her friend and to see her dad. As well as enjoy the beach and town etc. On my bday I had a dissociative seizure, then the day after I have an epileptic seizure (mine can cause brain damage, physical injury or even death. As I come round she's holding me on the sofa and told me what had happened. Since she was going to the coast she rang my mother, who took care of me and let me stay at hers for a couple of days. As my brain fully returned to normal I thought  to myself ""why didn't she book the holiday and train tickets for like 2 days later, its my bday for fucks sake. I got abkut 24 hours with her for my bday, and that's including sleeping. I was really looking forward to a lazy slow start to the day with her and go for a walk in the woods or to a cafe. Then her friend (who is clear of cancer  now) and dad get days with her. I feel low on her list of priorities a lot of the time. I don't/can't tell her when she upsets me cos I get shouted down and I end up saying sorry somehow. So I keep things to myself a lot of the time. So I can't tell her or work on whatever the issue is, and feel safe and supported. And for her to talk like an adult rather than snap at me until I shut up about it. There's always a reason why I'm wrong, and if she does something that I do, then she gets pissed off. And there's always a reason why it's different or not wrong.
I can't stand hypocrisy, I feel like I'm putting nearly all the effort in. Hardly seeing her, waiting on the promise of her flat and body being perfect and we can be together more, go out to eat, have more sex, be romantic and generally have fun. I'm running out of patience with it after this long. I quit tramadol and morphine I took for 10 years (basically them safe as heroin withdrawal) I've organised my flat (I've been here 2 years, she's been at hers for over 10 years), I've lost weight and done sine exercise, I've reduced the nicotine in my vape. I'm romantic, sexual, cuddly and, just chatty sometimes. I've helped her with so many things (usually tech related). Yet I almost feel like I don't matter, like I'm in the way. And I'm running out of patience waiting for this amazing love and sex life she says will happen once everything in her flat is sorted. I've followed through on all my promises, quitting opiates for example. Whilst she doesn't ""oh in 3 months I'll look even sexier, have more sex, and be together and romantic and cuddle up watching TV or go for something to eat or a day trip somewhere. Is this too much to ask? Is she meeting me half way (putting her effort in too?
I know what my answers are but I didn't know where else to share this and get some advice and support.

I was supportive of this as I love her and wanted her to get better.

I waited nearly a year after my 16th birthday to get my G1 after a lot of pressure from my dad. Since then, I've been extremely anxious whenever I drive, and I avoid doing so as much as possible. Throughout my entire experience learning how to drive my dad has threatened me by saying that I'll have no life and career if I can't drive. I've done driving school, and extra lessons, none of which has helped because I simply have never wanted to drive in the first place. I've failed my G2 three times already, and faced a lot of belittling from my dad each time. After my last attempt I simply decided to stop because I never wanted this in the first place. I felt ashamed for ""giving up"" and still do, but I do not want to drive whatsoever. My mom fully supports this and understands how anxious I am about driving.

Right now, we live in a somewhat rural area, with the closest city around 20 minutes from my house. My mom offered to drive me to the nearest bus stop (which is around 15 minutes from my house) while I go to university. My dad found out tonight during dinner and said that I have ""no future in today's society"" if I don't learn to drive.

At the moment, my plan is to live in the city where I can take a bus, taxi, or walk wherever I need once I graduate university. I know I will need to live close to my place of employment. I plan to study physics as my major next year, and I know there are available jobs for physicists in urban areas nearby (I live somewhat near Toronto).

Now, today he messaged me and he asked some more questions. More NSFW ones. It made me really uncomfortable and when he asked he did a weird laugh-chuckle sort of thing. I didn’t answer them of course, and said I had to go.

Should I block him? Cause honestly he’s not giving me the best vibes. And he keeps asking to see my face. It’s just really creepy the way he talks to me.",30Sep2019,1
887,"So I need some advice. Lately, my best friend has been more and more flakey, including cancelling on me to do exactly what we were supposed to do, at the exact time we were supposed to hang out, with other friends. It's not the first time it's happened, either. I don't think I want to lose the friendship, but I also don't know how to confront her about it without sounding uber annoyed with her, she's always super sensitive to criticism. What would you recommend I do? And if I do bring it up, how should I word it?",30Sep2019,1
888,"My ex and I have not been together since 2012. Our kids were born in 2010 and 2012. Our relationship was always very toxic, with each of us always bringing out the worse in each other. 

We broke up because he started doing drugs and cheating. Since then he's been in and out of jail, up until 2015 when he went into a long term rehab where he was until May of this year. 

I have never received any sort of financial help from him, and he's missed every single birthday and holiday since our last child was born. 

Fast forward to him being out of rehab, he had a job when he left the rehab but lost it 2 months later due to his car breaking down and he not being able to make the 2 hour commute. 

He hasn't had a job since the end of July and became homeless since he no longer has money to pay his rent. 
Reluctantly, I told him he could stay with us for a month or 2, while he found a job and found another place to live. Since he had been very active with our kids, I felt bad not giving him a hand. 

Everything was okay at first, but it's been getting worse each day.
He doesn't help around the house, and when I ask him to do something, he'll act like I'm taking advantage of him. 

When he watches the kids while I'm at work, if I don't prepare a meal for them before I leave, they'll be eating cereal for lunch/dinner. 

He asked me to borrow my car, the first few times, I said okay, but then it started becoming an everyday thing, the first time I said no, he got so angry that he started yelling at me saying I wanted to keep him in the house 24/7. 
 
One of those times he borrowed my car, I found out he had been driving around with a girl he was ""talking to"". While I don't care who he dates, or ""talks"" to. I found that extremely disrespectful. 

Yesterday, when I got home, he had 2 of his friends, that I had never met, hanging outside of my house, while he was watching the kids. 
And today, when I got home from work, there was a girl sitting on my porch with him. 

I've told him repeatedly, that I'm not comfortable with anyone that I don't know being on my property. He doesn't seem to care. 

Most of the things I request, are ignored and he ends up doing whatever he wants anyway. 

I'm just tired of dealing with this situation, and I want him to leave, but I also don't want my kids to think that its because of me that their dad isn't doing good. 

Anytime I try to tell him something isn't okay, he says I'm nagging him and it's because of people like me that recovering addicts end up going back to drugs or alcohol. 

I'm just tired of being stressed and don't know what to do anymore.",30Sep2019,3
889,"I'm hoping to hear from women who have successfully exited abusive/predatory relationships.

I have a friend (F18) who's currently in a relationship with a 40 year old divorced father with sex crimes on his record.

This was shocking news to me, I knew she was dating, but didn't know the guy.

The more she talked about it the more abusive it sounded. He likes to make big promises (we're going to move in together and start a family this year), then reneges. He insists on being in contact 24/7, when they're not in the same room they're usually on the phone. At the slightest affront he kicks her out and refuses to answer calls until she admits to her wrongdoing and agrees to change. When she says she's thinking of leaving he threatens to kill himself in increasingly convoluted and painful ways. He also lies constantly.

There's more to the manipulation but I can't quite put it all in words in any way that makes sense.

He wants her to drop out of college to be his wife.

I don't understand how anyone could want this sort of relationship or feel so dependent on someone so harmful, so I need to hear from people who have been in one.

I need help understanding why my friend feels the way she does. I need help convincing my friend to cut it off. I need to know what got you to leave. I need to know what someone could have done to get you out earlier.

Thank you.",30Sep2019,1
891,"I joined a class with a professor who wanted me to  co-author a publication but it turns out that now he doesn't want to do that and just wants a shorter paper for him to grade. 

I feel like this isn't really worth my time because the professor isn't writing my rec letters and I am already taking 5 other classes so it's not like i need the credits.

If i drop i can focus on getting good grades in my other classes but i am in another class with the prof and i don't want him to penalize me for leaving the class

if i stay i will just have to suck it up but it might improve my grade for the other class",30Sep2019,1
892,"So I was air dropping memes to friends  in class and I accidentally sent one to my teacher. It was my social studies teacher and it was a 9/11 me with an airplane mode sign, a battery, and 9:11 as the time. We were leaving the class at the time and he said who air dropped me? Then proceeded to open it and read it allowed. He then said who sent this but no one said anything. Then we left the class and proceeded to science. Everyone knew it was me but the teacher didn’t since we left his class. 

Im scared to go to school now and need advice on what to do if he confronts the class or something..",30Sep2019,0
893,"Today one of my bosses (I’m a gymnastics coach and she’s the head coach of the program) asked me to cover for her because she has been sick all weekend. She asked me two hours prior to when I would have needed to be there, and I lied and told her I had a dentist appointment (I did have one this morning, just not when she needed me to cover) and that I had to study (this is true). I’m in college and I work the next couple days, so I really need my Mondays to study. I told her that if she couldn’t find anyone else to let me know. She never responded. Should I feel guilty that I didn’t cover? We don’t have a whole lot of people that can cover so I have a feeling she had to work. I feel really bad about it, but school comes first. She also doesn’t seem to like me already so I feel like maybe I’ve made things worse..",30Sep2019,1
895,"I honestly don't know what to do. She told me a few months ago that this happened to her and it has been eating me up inside. My whole world feels like it fell apart because I couldn't be there to protect her and that she held it in for so long because it couldn't be real. Since she's told me, she hasn't talked to me about it since. I don't know how to make it right. I know she has it buried deep inside her, and I've been trying to do the same. Since she's told me, I've had trouble sleeping, eating, and basically doing anything normal. I know I've been having outbursts on people because I can't tell anyone about it and it's always on my mind. I've now started taking antidepressants because I guess this whole event was triggering depression and anxiety that I never knew that I had. I am fucked up over this and I feel guilty that I feel this way because I couldn't even stop it from happening, and it wasn't even me that it happened to. I am honestly lost because of this and I don't know what to do. I love this girl and want to always do right by her, but it is eating me apart. She is one of the strongest and best people that I know, and it's destroying me that this happened.",30Sep2019,1
896,"I have been dating my boyfriend for 2 years. He is my best friend, but we have had alot of rough patches. When we first started dating it made me uncomfortable because he would talk about and too his ex so much. He even invited her to a concert we went too. After wards I told him I felt uncomfortable because I don’t know her. Later on I discovered he had an entire conversation with her about me and how I felt uncomfortable, telling her everything I obviously didn’t want her to know. I got through it and moved on. 

Recently, i noticed how much my boyfriend has been talking to this other girl. He will post a picture and I will comment, he likes the comment. On the same picture this other girl will comment and he will comment back. He was on snapchat and he had a message from her, but he didn’t answer it while I was over his shoulder and instead closed out of the app. She is the top person on his messages most of the time, he is always dming her. And with how much he has been talking to her you would think he would talk about her more but he doesn’t, he has not mentioned anything about her to me. 

This obviously makes me feel a little jealous and upset because of how beautiful she is, makes my self esteem go down and drives me crazy.

I am not saying he is cheating, because she lives far away and knows that we are together. But I feel like I can’t say anything about it because I feel like he would tell her that i’m jealous or something. 

I don’t know how to express my feelings about the situation without him telling her everything.",30Sep2019,2

899,"Hey reddit, I’ve been thinking a lot lately, like a lot. I’m a 17 year old kid, ill get to the point.  My parents and some of my friends have been saying I’ve been really “mute” lately, this ain’t new, I’ve been told this more than once for years. My grandparents from turkey told me this last year as well. I’ve noticed I’ve stopped regularly talking a lot with my parents and siblings more than often and I don’t like it honestly. I don’t want to become like one of my uncles, never talks, always looks angry. I haven’t been really happy as much lately either, or y’all a lot at school. I stopped doing the hobbies I loved, stopped my goals, going to soccer practices, etc. I really don’t want to stay in this mindset, or whatever you call this forever. I want to be happy, smile, talk a lot. It’s takes so much of my time thinking about it. It’s not healthy and I know it. What do I do, I can’t tell if it’s depression, or if I’m bi polar, I have different moods all the time. But one thing I did notice is that I’m more talkative with friends than family. I still over think when I talk with friends, like if they like me or not. I beat myself up for not making new friends. What should I do?",30Sep2019,1

I have a fwb thing with a guy and in the beginning he used to always do more foreplay, eating me out, etc. and then the sex was awesome... but I get really wet easily. And he now knows that. So now he basically just gropes me a little and then thinks since I’m wet I’m ready to go. Which physically, I am... but mentally not so much. So I almost never cum anymore.

907,"Hey! Been searching for a job for a couple months now. Mainly car related. I have no experience but got offered a job at a body shop.

A little back story on the job interviews with them.
Each time I went in for a interview they were ""trying people out"" to see if the job worked for them. I have been in touch with the shop for the past couple weeks and they have been through 3 guys. They have been telling me it's not a no but not a yes. I'm next in line and I'm a little worried I'll be fired like the other guys for some bullshit stuff.

Plus they pay less than my job now by a dollar. I have already been tight on money and I scared to be even tighter on money. It's something I want to do but I'm scared
