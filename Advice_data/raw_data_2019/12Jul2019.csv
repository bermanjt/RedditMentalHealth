0,"Ok so I've been applying to administrative assistance and office assistance jobs, and a few of the ones I applied to were for ad agencies. Well, there were a couple interviews where I went, and I found out that the job they were offering wasn't the one they advertised and that they were looking for a salesperson. So, that was obnoxious enough already, because if I'd known that's what they wanted I wouldn't have gone to the interview. Anyways, one I went to yesterday was a bit intense. It was supposed to be a short interview but it lasted an hour. It started out pretty normal but the person interviewing me, who would have been my boss, started talking about having an aggressive and competitive personality. At first it was normal, but eventually it was the only thing she was talking about, and it lasted for 30 minutes. She said that no matter what she is doing she HAS to be the best at it, and her father instilled that in her at a young age. She went on to say that she works the harder than all of her friends, and that she expects similar commitment from her employees. I was actually called after the interview was over for a round two, but I declined, saying I thought that I wouldn't be the best fit for the job. Was this a mistake? I felt like the person who conducted the interview was really friendly but also really intense.",12Jul2019,1

2,"my neighbours 2 teenagers probably around age 17,18,19 somewhere there are using binoculars and staring into my living room where my 2 year old sister plays, this apparently isn’t the first time my moms seen them watching us for no reason. 

so i decide to walk up to the window and see and sure enough 2 boys are coming up to the window and MOONING us then going back to watching, i also remember seeing them a few other times staring in the living room but thought nothing of it.

i’ve also heard they only do this when my moms boyfriend isn’t home, what should we do? should i tell my moms boyfriend about it in hopes he goes over and talks to their parents/confronts the peeping toms or am i overreacting?

this also worries me because if they’re willing to flash their ass at my family in our living room while my 2 year old sister is playing here what else might they flash when she’s looking? sure there’s always the chance they’re just fucking around and it’s harmless fun but i still feel something is very off like something is massively fucked up about that family

what should i do?",12Jul2019,2

5,"I live in a faux luxury apartment building. There are a few really swanky units but most (ie: mine) are regular apartments. But it's a place where you can trust neighbors are on the up and up.

On the 4th of July we had police block anyone from entering or exiting the building and issued a shelter in place warning. All surrounding businesses locked their doors. We looked outside and saw a ton of cops carrying assault rifles coming into the building. Rumor mill starts going and people said it was this guy who lives in one of the penthouses who I'll call Greg. Allegedly he was beating his girlfriend and she locked herself in a closet with one of his AR-15s. Sure enough a woman was eventually brought out on a stretcher and in handcuffs.

I did a little digging and found out Greg was indeed booked around 11pm for second degree assault. A few days ago I found more information on his case. Four class 4 felonies, two class 5 felonies, two class 1 misdemeanors. It includes multiple charges of assault with strangulation and one of being a habitual domestic violence offender. Apparently habitual means 3+ prior incidents. And of course, assault with a deadly weapon. 

I've had scumbags for neighbors before. The big issue here is that Greg has a problem with me. He was trying to sell a car with serious mechanical problems and I maybe told the potential buyer the car had been sitting for months and not to buy it. It scuttled the deal. Next time he saw me he got in my face screaming the he was going to ""put his foot up my ass"". Dude sounding like Red Foreman was funny at the time. Now, not so much.

I get the impression the building isn't going to evict him. The penthouses are between 6k and 10k a month. And the attorney he's hired is no joke. He'll def be out on bail for a while and might not even see jail time. I think it's unlikely he'll cause me problems. But at the same time, situation ain't great. Any thoughts one what I should do here?

7,"I'm reposting from r/infj because I realized this topic fits here better, probably

I hate myself. And I can't convince myself that my self is a self worth being (say that five times fast lol), because who I want to be is objectively just BETTER. 

I have a concept of how I ""feel"" I ""should"" be - and this ideal version of myself is this confident competent badass. Extraverted. Unafraid. People-oriented. Talented. Open. Witty. In perfect control of their posture and body. Stereotypically gorgeous. I see girls that are able to command a crowd by the force of their personality, charm their way into and out of situations, connect instantly with nearly anyone, assert their will, positively captivate members of the same and opposite sex, and I just.

I just want to be that way. To me, it's the clearly superior way to exist. There's no argument in favor of being an introverted, wishy-washy, un-alpha, scared, bumbling, pathetically jealous airhead that gets talked over and forgotten in crowds because apparently they don't have enough of a personality to stand out. And it f r u s t r a t e s me that I can never reach my ideal because it's simply not who I am. I would burn out trying to be who I think I should be/who I wish I was. 

I understand the concept of self-love and the value behind appreciating yourself as an individual no matter who that individual is, but I can't seem to actually BELIEVE it, because it seems useless. I feel like it applies to everybody but myself. Like, yes, everyone has inherent value as an individual and everyone should be a version of themselves that they're happy with - but I can be better. That sort of thing. 

Am I crazy? And if you've already made it to the other side of this craziness... how?

tl;dr: i hate who i am and i can't seem to convince myself otherwise, because my (unattainable) idealized personality is obviously the superior choice",12Jul2019,3

9,"Hi there,

I started a new corporate job only 4 weeks ago and due to sick leave and vacation time none of my team mates where present except the team lead. The team lead is completely busy since she also took over a new department. So I've been thrown into cold water and started swimming without proper onboarding. I already closed some sensitive tasks with praise so I know I'm not completely wrong here. 


In a nutshell I have to do forensics on legacy issues and close gaps with external clients. For that I need to read a lot of contracts. I am not a lawyer but have experience reading contracts of this kind. For complicated cases we have a lawyer team assigned to us. 

At the last project meeting I asked for help with one contract and was told in presence of the lawyer to send it to him for his opinion. I did this, referred to the irregularity of the contract that I wasn't sure how to interpret and collected 3 relevant reference docs in a folder for him so he didn't have to search the legacy systems himself. I was being really nice here.  

My email was polite and I used first name basis as he was introduced to me twice on first name basis and it is standard in the project team. He is also a bit younger than me and the kind that wears sneakers and hoodies to a corporate job so no reason for me to consider the first name was inappropriate. 

He responded back with a message in which he addressed me in the formal last name manner (which means he distances himself from the more colloquial / personal style and that is already super rude). He then goes on to tell me that the case is text book because #1, #2, #3 (means: you are stupid that you dont know this). Then he asks if I knew about the irregular contract already - the one I am asking him about - and he even double underlines that question!

So a) he hasn't even answered my specific question and b) he is condescending in his response and c) he is incredibly rude by choosing the last name basis when we were already introduced on first name.

Now I don't want to run to my manager because she is super busy and I am an adult. I don't want to be snappy because I need information from him and I don't want bad blood with the legal team. 

I was thinking to respond by addressing him politely by his last name and apologising for not knowing that the first name rule doesn't extend to the legal team.

Then I'd ask him to please refer to my first sentence in which I point out that my question is in regards to this exact contract he refers to and if he could please give me his opinion only this regarding. 

Would this response be firm enough yet not too aggressive or do you have an alternative suggestion? 

Thanks a lot!",12Jul2019,1
12,"There’s this good looking guy in my summer math class who sits kind of near me and will try to join the conversation when I start talking to these other girls who I sit in between.

He’s my type but it’s been a week and he already bluntly admitted the following on his own accord

1) He dropped out of Psycholgy in uni and wants to switch to Finance because « he doesn’t care about other people »

2) He called his sister retarded several times for having an almost perfect GPA in uni

3) He said he disliked/hated a specific group of East Asians, which I’m closely and almost related to. He even specified why in depth while my huge pencil case with my Asian name on it was in front of him. It’s even more ironic as we’re the same ethnicity!! I felt so uncomfortable that I flipped my pencil case which also had my Asian name on it and then put on my sweater with more Asian writing.

30 minutes after he asked to see my mathbook for a question he had a bit of difficulty on. I was then like, lol you know you can check your answers in your book, right? As a way to get back at him. He then sheepishly replied with something and I then hit him with a, I can’t believe you said you hated *insert particular ethnic group* and he continued justifying his response and then I cut him off.

Here’s where it gets interesting 

Normally anyone’s first reaction would be to either call the cops or go beat him up and get my Xbox back with a bunch of my friends. But he moved away the night I suspected he broke in and his final goodbye was to take my Xbox.

I recently found out that he moved to a town about 10 mins away but idk where in that town.  He’s blocked me on every social media and my number after he moved so I can’t contact him.  I have some of my friends ask him if he stole it but he keeps denying it, and it’s obvious he took it.

Complete electricity dummy here. I tried the ask an electrician section but no replies.

31,"I feel so needy posting this, half in the bag on gluten-free craft beer and microwaveable burritos, but I need to let it out.

I'm about to be sent to collections because of a private gym membership I was naive enough to get involved in. The owner forged the billing agreement with some extortionist third party and I'm screwed because I can't afford a lawyer. If I get sued, I have options but if no collector sues me, I'm stuck with this on my credit report. Where I live, it will be next to impossible to buy a house. It breaks my heart that anybody would scam somebody, and that there are other people experiencing this all over the country.

My engagement fell about 6 months ago and I'm still as broken as I was the day she dumped me. I loved somebody with my entire heart and lived with them for over 2 years and I don't know how to move on. I mean I've moved on but I can't see myself loving anybody ever again. I am not without fault, but I strived every day to be a good man to her, and it was not reciprocated in the end 

I used to rail Adderall mixed into coke daily for about a year (Adderall about 30mg a day progressing to 200mg a day over 4 years, 17-21) and spent my entire life savings fucking up my teeth and my short-term memory, not to mention my heart. Clonazepam to come down whenever it was available. I'm almost 4 years sober from stimulant drugs but every day, going through all this adult garbage, I feel a tense wire digging into my brain telling me to get high like I'll be able to solve my problems once I'm high. In the last 6 months, I've gone on 4, 3-5 day long oxycontin and/or Vicodin benders just to get some relief from my high strung tendencies. It's gnawing at my very core to get high and I have nobody to even tell about my addictive tendencies, though I've recently realized I could go to NA (I always thought you had to pay).

I suppose my point is, I've had to take care of myself for such a long time, predating adulthood, and now at 25, I feel myself breaking. I am absolutely fucking breaking. I've recovered from so much only to fall again with my credit/monetary reputation at risk. Everything is a racket in the USA and I can't stand that the way humans live anymore. I don't care about Instagram or Facebook or any superficial bullshit that we're designed to feel are important. It depresses me that the human condition defined by America is to produce or be consumed by consumerism and be a slave until you die. I have a decent job and opportunity to advance but I hate it. I want to be educated but our educational system is just another fucking racket and there's no conceivable way for a blue collar guy raised in poverty to just leave to a better place with free education.

I have no desire to hurt other people, but everywhere I look there are people looking to advance through the disadvantage of others and, though I haven't cried in years, I want to break down at the thought of the ego of the people that surround me. It disgusts me. I feel first world life is pointless; at the point we no longer see food, water, sleep, and sex as the ultimate goals and instead put our faith/value in the made up bullshit we call money, humanity is bound for disaster.

Having qbittorrent linked to Ethernet 2 (Virtual Connection that Hotspot Shield creates) Qbittorrent will only download torrents when Ethernet 2 is plugged in. Upgraded Hotspot Shield to the latest version, and now Ethernet 2 no longer connects. PC has two connections, Ethernet and Ethernet 2. I have tried downgrading Hotspot Shield to the version i was originally on with no luck, Reinstalled TAP Windows Driver v9, i even reset Network settings entirely.

Can someone help me sort this issue out?

Thank you in advance fellas!",12Jul2019,1
42,"As some background, my father in law and I were fairly close for a while but then he had an affair and it really changed the dynamic. My mother in law ended up taking him back but ever since hes been a different person so we distanced from each other. About 4 years ago I was offered an amazing Job offer in Canada which I took, ever since we don't really speak and he resents me for moving his daughter away from him (he is an only child and hes never lived more than 20 mins from his parents, currently they live a couple of streets away from each other and he is there most days)

Fast forwarding to today, both in laws have been openly against the move. They give my wife a hard time alot about it and haven't been to visit in nearly 4 years (we go back every year so they said they don't need to make the effort) anyway its always annoyed me and there has been several arguments about the guilt tripping crap they give her, but yesterday it hit a new low. He started on a rant how I had planned this all along and only married her so I could move her away (even though I had previously turned down a job offer in NZ because she didn't want to go that far) and it almost seemed like he is trying to make her mad at me so maybe she would go home, this hurt and really hit a nerve. He is extremely selfish I know but to go to this attitude is a whole different level, my wife is upset by this but is still very close to her family so I have to treat it with a degree of caution to avoid arguing with her, but really I'm done with him and hes not someone I want to be around, we are due to go home for Christmas where we usually stay with them but right now I really dont want to be in a house with him but I don't know what to do? 

&amp;#x200B;

And for further context, my wife &amp; I are not 100% happy with our current living situation and there is no plan to actually stay where we currently are BUT we don't know if that means trying different parts of Canada or going home in the future, but for right now we have to work it to the best we can to open future opportunities, if we do move home we already decided it wouldn't be to the same place but further south to the coastal areas.",12Jul2019,1
43,"So I'm (20F) working a summer job right now, and I have this awesome coworker (19M). He's funny, smart, and I'm pretty attracted to him. Whenever we have downtime on the job we have great conversations and have very similar music tastes, opinions, etc. Early on I found out that he's (totally coincidentally) going into first year at the university I'm currently attending. I was super excited when I heard that, but shortly afterwards it came up that he has a girlfriend lol. I have 0 interest in messing with their relationship, but I want to continue being friends with him during school (which he's also expressed an interest in). But I feel weird because I'm attracted to him, and I definitely think there's some chemistry. I don't know if I'm setting myself up for disaster. Basically should I cut the cord once school starts, or am I overthinking it? Would love to hear ppls experiences.

45,"24y/o. About a year ago, I borrowed money from my mom. She wasn’t home to give it to me, so told me about an envelope hidden in the house that my dad doesn’t know about and sworn me to secrecy. If probably had 15k inside. I repaid her and went on my way and we never mentioned it again. 

Over the past couple of months, I’ve taken money from it without asking.  I’ve always intended to repay her but haven’t. I’m guessing I owe her a good $2k. 

My roommates moved out with a weeks notice and I didn’t have the money for rent so I went over while no one was home and went to the envelope but nothing was there. 

I feel so much guilt. Either my dad found it and she had to explain why she has money hidden (I don’t know why) or she realized a good chunk was gone, knows I’m the only one else who knew about it and that I’m the culprit, and moved it so I couldn’t continue. 

I want to fess up. My mom and I have an otherwise amazing relationship. But I am so embarrassed. I should never have taken anything in the first place, I know. 

How do I approach it? Her texts feel cold but I could be reading in to it. I don’t think she intends to approach me about it. She knows I’m working 3 jobs to make ends meet type broke. Always telling me not to buy her or my dad Xmas/ bday gifts and to save my money, etc. 

I need to apologize and repay her but I guess I’m just scared. Apologizing means confronting that I’m a selfish person and that’s why I’m hesitating.",12Jul2019,2
46,"This has been going on for a couple months now and it's getting more serious. At my job I'm an opener and when I open I'm alone for the first 3 and a half hours of my shift and this guy has been coming in once to twice a week early in the morning while I'm alone and hestarted to hit on me. At first it was asking simple questions I dont mind talking to people about. Then it started growing more personal like what's my hobbies, do I live close to my job, when do i get off work. Now no matter who asked me if i live close to my job or when do i get off and i always lie because even if you're a regular or not you do not need to know that information about me. And then he started asking me do I have any plans for the weekend, when do I get off and if I have plans when I get off. I always said I had something because I knew he was headed towards asking me out and about a couple of weeks ago he said him and i should hang out sometime and i was so shocked he asked that i stuttered out an okay. I KNOW. that was completely the wrong thing to say i should've never said that. i got nervous and didnt know what to say. Then today he comes in and asks if we can go get dinner sometime. I asked him how old do you think I am. he said 20. i said I'm 17. which i am. i asked how old do you think i am so hed realize I'm a minor and back off because hes around 26. after i told him I'm only 17 he then asked when do i turn 18. i said next year when in reality I turn 18 in September but I wasnt about to tell him that because again I was hoping hed realize I'm too young for him but NOPE. he then replied aw man I have to wait a whole year for you to turn 18. I about died right then and there.

I really dont know what to do at this point because I cant tell my boss/owner about it because they wont care and wont want to lose a customer.  Believe me I've tried with other customers before and they've touched me and they still didnt care. and I cant quit because I have too many bills to pay for and once I turn 18 I'm getting kicked out so I need to save money for rent. and I get an overall bad vibe about this guy. I'm afraid one day he'll do something very bad to me because he knows I'm alone in the mornings and that's always when he comes in.",12Jul2019,29

I am a decent cook and I was relatively excited to make my breakfast tomorrow. I went to a grocery store and bought some stuff to make a Belgian waffle. I do a decent amount of sports so I usually only have a protein shake and eggs for breakfast. I had all of the stuff ready tonight until I realized my sister had eaten all the whipped cream that I got. I was pretty pissed and when I asked her about it she said that I ate all of the food so it evens out. But I personally buy all the food that I eat.

49,"So, here’s some context, and apologies for the awful exposition and such.

As a kid, I grew up under my first aunt, especially bad-mouthed but very very sweet, who took care of me after my mom left the country to work overseas. I never liked my mother even during her visits because often she would get angry at me for throwing tantrums because I couldn’t recognize her. This includes physically attacking me with household items.

My mom and first aunt had a fight when my mom came home the third time because she gave up on working overseas, and that she wanted to stay with me, which is understandable, and when my first aunt bad-mouthed my mom to their other sister, my second aunt who lived overseas. My mom got angry because of this, and fought with my first aunt. My first aunt decided to kick us out essentially, because she’d been tired of my mom’s bs and wouldn’t take the fact that my mom took the money my first aunt used to send my mom overseas in the first place. Little me decided to apologize for my mom to my aunt, losing what little trust I had with my mother as a kid. My mom went back overseas, to work again.

Here’s the main part.

A few years later, I, a teen, moved to my mom, because I HAVE to, since my first aunt also had the load of my first cousins(from my uncle) who’s mom left them. Now I live with my mom, currently 15, and have been dealing with her tantrums every single week. She always somehow escalates every little mess-up I make to something bigger, always relating my mistakes to her successes(although she grew up poor), and the very fact that all my mistakes are just because of videogames, videogames, and videogames. She sugarcoats everything she says to “for your own good, health” and whatnot and I’m getting sick of it. Maybe this is because of how I grew up alone, since my aunt never let me go outside for an odd reason I still don’t know the answer too, but I find my mom to intrude my privacy far too much, even checking my phone’s messages, mails, and social medias, to see if what could ever be going on with my life. Whenever she comes home, she always says that I should be doing chores, when I grew up never doing them(I was privileged, and had a babysitter). And when I start to do chores, she always ends up asking for more. She calls me a robot for having to wait for her command to do chores, but that’s what I’ve always grown up to do. Wait for an order, complete it, and expect a break or reward. She won’t order me to do anything, so I barely do the minimum which is entirely my fault, since I grew up without initiative. My mom complains about how I can’t do anything, when she can’t have herself teaching me, cause that’s pitiful. All she has to do is ask, but she won’t. I don’t know why she won’t, but she won’t, and she’ll get angry at me if I don’t do what her brain thinks I should do without telling me. 

Again, I’m sorry, this is a spur of a moment post, I might seem scummy here, and that’s because I AM, but just because I grew up not knowing much doesn’t mean I can’t learn what I haven’t. My mom seems to think that I can learn everything by myself, she doesn’t tell me anything. Hell I can’t even cook, cause she couldn’t up with me four years ago who absolutely did not like cooking(see, I was scum, I might still be scum), and stopped trying to teach me. My mom and I’s trust is nulled. There is no trust in my family, she only trusts me to chores or whatever, somedays she acts sweet to me when she comes home, but fucking hell does she also get mad about the smallest things.

What do I do? Is my mom at fault?
Am I at fault? For the way I was raised?",12Jul2019,1
50,"I tried to make this short but I suck at condensing. I was screwed out of some money (not enough to really care, just the principle of it), along with a long list of minor and a few not so minor grievances with supervisor. Chewed supervisor out (wasn't a fit of rage, but I was quite blunt and not all that tactful). Quit without notice right then (was not working at time). Coworker and I had just got a text message threatening to again lose incentive pay for reason not covered in policy for those bonuses which is set by corporate, not supervisor. She was incorrect about what she even said wasn't done, and when informed that it HAD been done (with witness from a different shift), just repeated to make sure I do it from now on or it's a write-up and loss of incentive.

I don't care about the money, but the principle. It's not a big bonus. This was just the final straw. We've have had lots of issues with this person, and several people have quit because of her. I posted some of what happened on FB, but insisted the issue was with one person, not the facility I work at, and that I love working there, it's my family. Got offered new job nearly immediately (tend to know a lot of people in area when you work this field...lots of revolving doors). Applied, did drug test, etc. All set to start work there. Now HR from first job saw my FB post and wants an exit interview with me and Vice President to discuss the issues, and she mentioned potentially changing my mind about quitting because they know I am a loyal employee.

Some of you might think the exit interview is normal. Not sure about the whole VP thing. But here's the deal. I'm a peon. Just a lowly nurse aide. This ain't normal. CNA's aren't typically asked to do exit interviews in my experience. I feel like I've opened some big can of worms and not sure if this is good or bad for me really.

This is a small town of 1,000 that happens to have a large (for a town this size, but probably considered medium-sized business) company headquartered here. CEO and wife are from here, and decided to start their company here, and quickly grew it. Now they have operations in a dozen or so states and have several subsidiaries, but they still run their HQ here. I know them. I am distantly related to the wife, but not people I talk to unless I run into them at store or something. I have the CEOs brother on FB, and a former nursing home administrator that I worked for back early 2000's who happened to be my neighbor then...she's a marketing account rep for the company. Mainly its just a small town and rumors spread fast, so I guess I shouldn't be shocked my FB post made it to HR.

In any case, how bad of an idea is the exit interview. I agreed to it, but I've never done one. I've only known the Army and being a nobody at nursing homes. Does this sound like a ""what could it hurt?"" situation or more of a, ""nothing good can come of this"" situation?",12Jul2019,1
51,"I am 16-year-old from Texas this past week I was on vacation in the Caribbean the first two days were pretty normal just vacation but the second day I was there I was walking along the beach with no shirt and I noticed three girls looking at me while I walk past I never really thought it to be anything as it’s just the beach but later in the day I saw those three girls again at the pool looking at me and whispering to each other as I walked past them to go towards the beach One of them stops me and the other two walk in the other direction she asked me if I spoke English and I said yes she then explained to me that one of her friends was into me and asked if she could have my Snapchat I said yes and I am with my day . About 20 minutes later I received a Snapchat from her saying her name why she’s here and she said that she was here to celebrate her birthday with her friends and she’s from Brazil and the funny thing is that my birthday is four days after hers.One thing led to another and she asked me if I wanted to meet her at Beach at five I said yes and was extremely nervous and met her there and at night after just a couple minutes talking I was extremely surprised of how much we had in common from the foods we like to have a strict her parents were and the sports we like the TV show we liked and even our irrational fears everything seems so weird that she was so similar to me and we’re so far apart it seems like every answer she gave was the same as I would’ve given even though we live in two totally different cultures . I eventually had to go because I do go eat dinner at my family after I finished eating I Snapchat of her and told her that I enjoy talking to her and that I had a good time the funny thing about that conversation is we’re both so shy that we never even took off our sunglasses while talking anyway that night she snapped chatted me if I can meet tomorrow and I said I was busy so she asked we could meet again later that night I met her again at night and we sat on the beach and we just talked and I was still surprised about how many things we had in common seems like we’re almost same person and yet there for two totally different cultures everything about it was just so similar to me . And again we both had to go as her parents didn’t want to have us out late that night that night again I texted her how was funny how similar we were and I would love to see her again sometime during the trip

She said that she felt the same way and that will meet up again the next morning she asked if I was available that night I said yes and I think about Waze meeting with her and talking to her that night . We finally met that night I was leaving the next day so I was going to make a big explanation and tell her how I felt. That night when we met on the beach I told her how much I enjoyed spending time with her and that she gave me a special feeling and she said the same thing to me and we hugged about 30 seconds later I said how much I enjoyed being here with her and I didn’t wanna leave after that we made it we locked eyes and kissed who is the first kiss for both of us after that we spent the rest of the two hours cuddling and kissing on the beach who would walk around holding hands up and down the beach saying how much we enjoy each other‘s company and how special each of us felt toward the other I told her how I never had a feeling that towards anyone else like her I had crushes on girls and others but she was special she gave me a feeling I never had before towards someone. Everything that night she said from the quotes like how she want to spend the rest of your time with me and how she want to spend more time with me at all of the other even ran closest she said felt like I could’ve said to myself I was thinking almost the same thing eventually after about two hours of cuddling and kissing on the beach we had to go we both said how we Snapchat each other if both of us need anything

I think we both realized that I was living over 5000 miles apart and over on two separate hemispheres of the earth this relationship really just didn’t make sense and this is probably the last time we would see each other

She gave me a feeling that no one else has given me and I’ve never felt before when she was in my arms on the beach I just felt like everything was right everything was in its place and that something a special doesn’t come very often

I left the next morning on a flight and we’s we said our goodbyes how sad we were.

It’s now been a few days since then and I can’t stop thinking that we Snapchat it maybe a few times but I think we both realize that it was just a simple vacation thing if anyone has a previous experience to this or similar experience please let me know I just want to know a way to get this out of my head I cannot stop thinking about it and how much I miss her thanks for reading this really long story if you did.

I held off for so long because i got comfortable and because i have health issues from when im young that scare me but dont really affect me nowadays as much. (heart defects)

I do plumbing and heating for a living and clear about 28k a year. The apartment im looking at is like 425 a month (rural area if your wondering), and my only debt is my truck which i only owe like 6500 on and is paid off over a year ahead right now. I talked with my parents about it and they support the idea but think im being impulsive (which i am). But i feel like if i dont make a move i never will and im sorta self conscious about telling people i live at home yet. 

My other thing is im suck a introvert and i feel like having my own place might get me out more, i dont have many friends and stick to myself other then work so i feel like im becoming really anti-social and anxious. 

My question to you guys is do you think im being to rash or quick to jump and do this? Met with the landlords today and they seem nice, and like i said even though its nothing special is a good size for a single person. They already got back to me and said i could have the apartment if i want it.

60,"Hi everyone,

I'd be grateful for some advice in my pretty unique situation. I will try to summarize as much as possible.

So basically, I am completely inexperienced in relationships and love life, and I have not had any serious crushes up to now. It all happened when I traveled to another state to visit a friend, and I met a girl there through my friend in two different parties. First night we kind of hung out initially and I had no intention to approach her, but I believe she got drunk and showed some interest in me. Eventually by the end of the night we were cuddling and touching each other. This night passed and we went to another party together. This time we had some good conversation before the party starts, and then we both got drunk and pretty much spent all the party together cuddling until the night. Then I happened to sleep next to her. While sleeping she came onto me and touched me until I pay attention to her, then eventually things got hot and we made out and kissed each other before falling asleep (that was my first kiss ever). I saw her for a short time next morning and that was it. I came back to my state and now I have developed a big crush for her. Couple of times we had a short conversation through snapchat, but none of us text each other that much anymore. 

Now I don't exactly know what those nights were and if that's just her nature of hanging out with boys, but the only thing I know is that for a person as emotional as me, I cannot stop thinking about her and I have no idea what I should do since I don't know if she likes me or not.

Should I just try to totally forget about everything that happened or should I try to tell her/show signs that I'm into her? And if I should keep touch with her, how and when should I stay in touch? Also another problem is that we don't live that close that I can visit soon again, maybe later on.  We're both about 20 if that matters.

Thank you",12Jul2019,1
61,"For the last couple years I've felt stuck, unmotivated and a bit lost. I feel like I should be doing something greater with my life or at least making money so that I can eventually retire and not have to worry as much about my future. 

I have no income currently and no real friends other than my girlfriend to turn to for advice really thus here I am.

&amp;#x200B;

**About me:**

I have an AA degree, and have attempted to take a required class after a 3 or 4 year break to transfer and pursue a bachelors in computer science, but was completely lost (calculus 2). I had to drop the class because there was no way I could pass, even with tutoring and studying full time on the single class. 

I did complete a coding bootcamp successfully (Hack Reactor) and had a bunch of job interviews over the course of a 6 month search, but nothing resulted in a job offer - not to discount bootcamps because all of my cohort did get job offers. 

Part of me can't even imagine working as a software dev, probably a lack of confidence, but maybe I'm just not into it.

A lot of opportunities aren't available to me as far as jobs/military etc because of a felony I was charged with 10 years ago at the age of 18 (drugs). So any jobs that require background checks usually skip right over me. 

Also my anxiety is pretty bad, uncomfortable talking to strangers, being in crowds, making friends etc. 

Luckily I have a good chunk of change to live off of from some investments I made in the past, but I think that's only enabling my lack of direction. I was more motivated when I was broke. I know that it's entitled of me to even be feeling like this: I have decent health, I'm not overweight, have a car, money in the bank to take classes, invest and pay rent etc. I have no reason to complain - I just need to get off my ass and do something - but what?

62,"TL;DR my downstairs neighbors music is so incredibly loud and intrusive and we can't get it to stop. We're miserable. I've recorded it on my iphone but want to know if there's a better way to capture it to convey to my landlord how bad the bass gets.

Apologies for the long post. But this has been a saga and I really need solid advice on how to handle this. I'm at my wits end and am considering moving out of my place to keep my sanity.

My SO and I moved into an apartment about two months ago in Queens. We love it except for the downstairs neighbor. Let's call them M. We quickly learned they have an insanely loud speaker system  that M liked to  blast at at all hours. We first were introduced to it by their Alexa talking through the speakers and it shaking the furniture in our living room. That's how loud it is.  Then the insanely loud music started.

&amp;#x200B;

Wanting to be a good neighbor I went down and knocked on their door the first night we realized we wouldn't be able to sleep (our bedroom is on the other side of the apt and it was vibrating our bed). This was a Friday night around 11:30 pm. I had met both roommates who lived there a few days earlier in the hallway and made sure I introduced myself as the new upstairs neighbor so I felt ok with going to their door to ask to turn it down. A stranger answered and, not knowing it was if it was a third roommate, I asked them to turn the music down because it was really loud. Calm. Direct. Cordial. The person gave me a half nod and shut the door. Forty-five minutes later the music was still blasting and I was obviously more annoyed. I went down again and knocked louder (because it took them awhile to hear my first knock due to the  music volume) and M answered. I was obviously annoyed but wanted to remain cordial and direct. I told them that the music was way too loud and we could feel the vibrations all the way in our room and that I had already come down once to ask if they could turn it down. M responded (paraphrasing): ""Well you didn't tell ME it was loud. It's Friday night so I don't know what you want me to do. I work damn hard and I'm trying to relax."" Ok. I think its completely acceptable to play some music on Friday nights and I realize that living in NYC requires having a higher-than-normal tolerance for noise but this was WAY beyond that. I responded ""I understand but the bass vibrates our entire apartment. I work damn hard too and I'd rather come directly to you with this than complain to the landlord"" Obviously this was not the right foot I was hoping to get off on with my new neighbors but there we were. M shrugged this off and said they would turn the bass down. Didn't happen. That's when I knew it was going to be an issue.

Ever since, its been 2-3 nights a week of music. 8 pm on Tuesday? check. 3 am on Sunday? check. What's worse is M treats the living room like a karaoke bar, screaming the lyrics to every song. In the following weeks I went down three more times to ask them to turn it down (each time a stranger answered the door). I tried talking to M's roommate when I realized knocking on the door wasn't working. I caught the roommate in the hallway about a week after the first incident and explained the situation. The roommate was very nice and understanding, said they hadn't been at the apt during the nights in question but understood how loud noise could be a disruption. I asked for their phone number so I could text them if the music was too loud (I said he could do the same if we were loud, walked too loud across the floor, etc).

After two different loud nights and two text messages later (not to mention the one clearly audible argument between M and the roommate about the music), the roommate texted me and said that they unfortunately couldn't control M but that he was sorry but agreed that the music was too loud.

By this point I had furiously googled how to deal with noisy neighbors with very little success (""play music just as loud! That'll show 'em!"" is not helpful advice, internet) We were miserable. I felt awful when my SO's family came to stay with us, excited to see our new place but we had to insist they stay in our bedroom and that they bring ear plugs/headphones to block out the music. That night M blasted music till till 3 am as we sat up awake trying to put on a brave face, nervously trying to laugh the whole thing off with my SOs parents.

I had hesitated reaching out to the landlord because I worried it would just escalate the situation and not sure how much authority the landlord has in the situation. I finally broke 2.5 weeks ago and reached out the landlord and tried to convey the severity of the noise as best as possible. The landlord responded that they would talk to M. In the weeks since, the frequency of the music has dropped a bit (1-2 nights a week) and we have have been able to block out some noise sometimes by turning on our A/C and wearing headphones (thank god for brown noise) But the bass is so hard to block out. I feel my floor vibrating from M's music as I write this.

I feel like I have PTSD at this point. Any loud bump or noise in our old building makes my stomach drop and my heart rate shoot up. I honestly feel dread and think ""Is it starting up again?"" Naturally, I'm seething right now typing these words with their shitty top-40 music rumbling underneath me.

Early on I came across a piece of advice that said you should record the noisy neighbor and note the time and frequency to send to your landlord. I have done this diligently ever since, recording the sound in my living room. I mentioned I had recordings in my email to the landlord but they didn't say they wanted to hear them.  However, hearing the playback of these recordings from my iphone doesn't capture the intrusiveness of the music nor the intensity of the bass.

So here's my question reddit: how do I capture audio that will adequately convey to my landlord how bad this situation is? Do I need a better audio recorder? How should I approach my landlord a second time (talking to M is out of the question, given I've tried over half a dozen times)  Also, is there any other way to get this to stop? How should I prepare if I potentially need to take legal action (witholding my rent to get the noise to stop or breaking my lease entirely)?

Any practical advice is welcome, Reddit.. We're really feeling more and more hopeless every day.",12Jul2019,0

66,"I'm 35, male. I live alone.

I'm still in love with my ex from more than a year ago, who refuses to speak to me. The breakup was probably my fault. She did some things she shouldn't have, but I think I was mostly to blame. I think about her every day, multiple times a day. Not because I want to. I literally cannot stop. Nothing works. Going to bed is a nightmare. Just hours of lying in bed, thinking about our happiest moments together, every single night. 

People tell me I should date. I try. Nobody attractive is interested in me, not that I particularly blame them for that. I've tried lowering my standards and just dating the kind of people I match with on Tinder etc. It's not worth it. Either I don't like them and it's just awful being around them, or I do like them and I feel like shit for pretending to be attracted to them when I'm not. I don't have much hope of being in love again.

I work a nothing office job. I mean my job is literally nothing; I could complete all my tasks for a given week in about 3 hours. I spend all day on reddit or facebook. It doesn't pay particularly well. I can't seem to find much of anything better.

I've started working out obsessively. I spend hours in the gym every day. I don't know why. It's not because I have some hope that transforming my body will transform my life or anything fantastical like that. I think I may like the fact that it hurts. Maybe I feel like I deserve it.

I used to blame other people for my problems. Blame the world, really. I was very angry when I was younger. I'm not anymore. And that sounds like progress, maturation, etc., but a curious consequence is that where I used to turn that negativity outward, now it's all pointed inward, straight at me. I hate myself with an abiding, burning loathing. I hate myself more than I've ever hated anybody else.

I'm suicidal all the time. There's never a moment when I don't wish I were dead. I'm not going to do anything about it; it would be devastating to my family. Also I have cats, and there's nobody to take care of them. My life may not be worth much, but at the very least I can avoid inflicting unnecessary trauma on people I care about who do have some chance to be happy.

The usual response is that I must be depressed, which...sure. You could say that. On the other hand, antidepressants don't seem to work. I've tried four so far. Therapy doesn't help either. I enjoy it, just because it's nice to talk to somebody and feel like they're listening, but it doesn't change anything. My perspective is that it's not just depression, I actually don't want to be here because I don't like being alive, but I suppose that sounds like something a depressed person would say.

Anyhow, it seems like I'm stuck here. Probably for a long time. My sister is younger than I am, and quite healthy, and I can't kill myself while she's alive. I could be alive for another 40 years or more, which is a horrifying thought. 

Any suggestions on what I should do with it?",12Jul2019,1

70,"Hey all, I will try to keep this as short as possible. 

About 2 years ago I broke up with my first ever girlfriend. We dated for about 2 years (end of high school/ beginning of college) and I broke things off because things were not going to well even after trying to fix things for months. 

When we broke up though I cut all communication from her. We had a talk so that we could have a sense of closure but other than that, for the last 2 years we have not spoken once. Not even traded texts. I did this mainly because I did not know what else to do when breaking up with someone. I highly regret this now.

I recently experienced a near death situation and now find myself looking at life differently and one of my few regrets has been in losing that friendship with my ex, even if things were never meant to work out relationship wise between us. 

I want to reconnect with her, and through mutual friends I know she’s got a new boyfriend and everything which is great and makes me happy to know.

71,"I don’t even know where to start.

There’s no excuse and I really don’t even remember it or why the hell I thought it would be a good idea or okay. I sent it to like two friends, I don’t really remember who, and was just really just being a stupid edgy teen.

This was quite some time ago. Now, I just got into a pretty prestigious job and posted about it on social media. My friend sent me a video just now of that exact video from 6 years ago. They somehow saved it without my knowledge (well, they had someone else film their phone so it wouldn’t notify me) and yeah. They said “I could imagine the headlines if this gets out”. Yes, it’s quite a prestigious job and deals with media with a lot of people worldwide. If the video got out, there would be a definite reaction in the mainstream media.

I don’t know what to do. On one side, I know I shouldn’t have said that word and really shouldn’t have filmed it. I was beyond stupid and I don’t even know why I did it, to be edgy I suppose. On the other side, it feels like I just got hit by a brick and my life is about to be ruined by my very own friend that I trusted being such a stupid edgy idiot with. What should I do?

76,"I moved across country for my SO's after I found out I was pregnant. I got rid of pretty much everything we owned because we were taking a greyhound bus here and couldn't bring much with us. He wanted to move here for a good paying job with his step dad that would help us save up before our son got here in the beginning of October. I don't know anyone up here at all aside from my SO and his family (mom, step dad and younger siblings; the rest of his family are back home where my family is). The plan was to move here, him work until sometime in September, then we both move back home so I could have our son where my family (mainly just my mom and dad) could be there. 

Once we got here, he had hurt his foot, not bad but he got an infection in it so he went to the ER and got some antibiotics for it. When his foot was healed he immediately went to take the drug test for his job which he had gotten clean from marijuana just to take. He failed the test for opiods.. He has never taken opiods that I knew of.  His step dad looked up the antibiotics he had took and sure enough.. they can cause a false positive for opiods. So they showed the lab tech that administered the test and he sent the sample off to a lab to be tested to prove it was the medication. Apparently, since my SO thought he was in the clear, he had a celebratory smoke. We wait a week to hear the results and finally we get a call. The sample they had sent to the labs had been ""destroyed"", whatever that means. I'm assuming it leaked. So my SO had to take another test but since he smoked, he failed for marijuana this time. I was so upset I bawled. This was the only reason I had agreed to move. They told him he wasn't completely screwed, he could retake the test in TWO MONTHS. Mind you I'm  22 weeks pregnant already at this time. I just wanted to go home, I was so embarrassed I didn't even tell my parents what happened. He said he wanted to wait and retake it. It's not like I had much of an option, I had no money and had left most of my belongings when we moved so I agreed and we stayed. 

It's been a little over a month now since he failed the test and today he brought up that he'd only be able to work a month before we'd have to go back across country if I wanted to give birth there with my family. I told him I knew and that it sucked. He said he didn't want to go and that he would be staying here to work a few more months. Not the plan, but okay, it's his decision. He then told me he didn't want me to go back. He wants me to stay here and give birth so he wouldn't have to risk missing out on his son's birth and neither would his family. I told him I'd feel more comfortable back home with my family. He got angry and said it's messed up that he and his family might have to miss out on the birth of his son because I want my family to be there. I start stressing because I'm horrible at making decisions like this and I hate to choose between him and my family. I ask my mom and dad if they'd be able to come up here and my mom never answered, which in her words is no. My dad said he wouldn't be able to take off work for my birth but to do whatever made me happier and that he didn't have to be there, it made no difference to him. I feel like he was just saying that to make me feel better. I know my mom would never forgive me if I gave birth here and my SO probably wouldn't if he misses out on our son's birth.

77,"I'm a private tutor and my students are usually adults. They all sign a contract before beginning lessons.

In the contract, it says in red bold font that if they want to cancel a lesson and get a refund, they need to do within 30 minutes of the lesson start time.

I have one student who occasionally makes mistakes with times and days of his lessons. In the past, I \*have\* been lenient and allowed him to cancel even a few minutes before a lesson when he made a mistake with the wrong day / time.

In my prior position, I worked my way up to the best team in the company and always far exceeded metrics and expectations. I had great relationships with my former bosses. Fast forward to now, where I took a job working for a family member who owns a small business. I took a significant pay cut to help out family. Since day one, I've felt that the manager there has had it out for me and now it's becoming crystal clear in my mind.  I accidentally sent an email with a typo in it (it had Wednesday written instead of Monday) and he used this as an example of me needing to ""pay more attention to detail"". I apologized but asked for further examples in all the months I have worked there which he could not provide. I explained my feelings that it was an isolated incident, and a typo and felt it was a generalization.  Flash forward a few weeks to today, and in an email I sent to HIM for review (not to a client) I had saved an attachment in a new way through our system and the formatting was off. I also interchanged one word for another which was technically correct but not what he would use. He FLIPPED out on me and started saying over and over how shocked he was that I made the mistake. He was literally going over and over and over and speaking me to as if I was an idiot. Prior to speaking with me, he went to my uncle who owns the company and showed him my mistake and complained to him that I make mistakes ""over and over and over"". However, he can't provide me with any examples and never has except for the two emails. I've sent hundreds and hundreds of emails in the months I have been there and I feel that he is nitpicking genuine human error as a means to see me fail. I spoke to my uncle about this and explained that as a manager he should come directly to me if he has an issue and not to him.  I have never sent an incorrect attachment, incorrect email, any emails with any other typos to a client before and he has not brought anything to my attention aside from these 2 emails out of hundreds.  I feel that he is looking for reasons for me to fail and setting me up for failure.  This is one example out of many as to why I feel he is a toxic manager. I've never experienced a manager like him in my life before and it makes it worse that he works for family. My family is also completely reliant on him and he very much ""runs the show"" there.

81,"I’m not really sure where to start here, but I try to keep my head up and I try to remain positive... I’ve been diagnosed with severe depression and I haven’t been able to hold down a job because of it. Everything is just exhausting, and medicine doesn’t work. I try to force myself to do things to avoid falling in to bad mental states but I’m starting to think that just maybe I’m getting too old and set in my ways, and this is just how it is.

I don’t mean to whine, but I’m starting to think that I am not actually equipped to take care of myself—as if somewhere along the way I never learned how to do things normal people can do, like form routines, be places on time. It’s bad dude, like I can’t even eat on time without setting an alarm, and I can’t even take a shower without setting an alarm just the same. If I forget to set it, I basically just lay in bed all day and lose track of time...or if I make myself get out of bed, I pretty much just sit there and lose track of time and stare at the wall.

This isn’t an excuse, but most people don’t understand; they simply say cheer up and do shit, but it’s not the type of depression brought about events in life; it is what I call a ‘chemical depression’ where it absolutely is brain chemistry. My grandmother killed herself because of it, my mom disappeared and probably killed herself because of it—it’s pretty hereditary. (I do not want to die, so don’t think this is going in that direction or anything), but I am considering institutionalizing myself so I can try to get help figuring out how to live normally.

Does anyone out there have any experience with that, or is it possible to have a nurse come visit me to help me do day to day activities until I can figure out a way to consistently do things on my own?

82,"The title kind of sums it up. My mother was verbally and physically abusive to my sister and i growing up. Often. My father sit by and let her abuse us and never really stepped in. To be fair, he was abused by her as well. Eventually they self destructed and separated by the time i was leaving for college. My sister turned 18, went off to college and got the hell out of dodge.

I was five years younger, so i pretty much just dealt with it until i left for college. When i left for school nobody helped me at all financially. I took out loans and worked. I basically operated with my new college friends being my family. Didn’t go home for holidays, sat in my room or crashed at someone’s house over break. 

My sister and i had a strained relationship because neither of us could communicate how we felt to each other. I resented her for a little while because i felt like she just left me. We are in a good place now. We both are successful career wise, financially, and in our marriages. 

Both of our parents have apologized and verbalized guilt. My dad is really sincere. However, my mom hasn’t really changed. Historically she’s bad with money. Which was one of her issues with my dad. She’s remarried twice after my dad and is currently married. I talk to my dad every few days and i can tell he never really gets over what happened to us. I live 12 hours away from him and 10 from my mother.  

My dad wants me to visit, but i don’t really want to. I could take the time to go there, but i don’t really want to stay at his house. I’m more than happy to have him at my home whenever and however long he wants, but i don’t really want to go visit him or my mom. I am in a space where i can not dwell on my childhood, but i don’t feel for them as normal people do for their parents. I still am not ok with how we were treated and what that did to me. I still see a therapist and desk with issues because of it. 

How do i not feel guilty about not wanting to visit ? Is it wrong for me to want to kind of keep distance from them ? I answer when they call, i help them out with money when i can, and celebrate their bdays, etc. i just can’t pretend like we are in a perfect place. As much as i can tell it hurts my dad, i just feel like he could have done more. My mom is somewhat of a lost cause to me. I truly think she has something going on emotionally.

The entire reason I had to get it of inbound customer service is I could no longer tolerate every single person I spoke to talking to me like shit on the bottom of their shoe.

Today I had a call with an extremely rude, condescending “professional” who was demanding things that are outside of my control and interrupting me any time I tried to discuss the situation. I immediately got very defensive and basically shut down to being helpful because of the way I was spoken to. The call ended with me providing my supervisor’s email address because they refused to let me speak, the caller emailing my boss a complaint and me beating myself up and secretly crying at my desk for the rest of the day because of how poorly I handled everything. I’m still in my probationary period and really like this job and I’m so scared I fucked up my chances because I took someone’s general snotty attitude personally and lowered myself down to the same level as them in return.

This is not how I want to be in life, I am too old to escalate a rude attitude into a full on yelling match and then spend the rest of my day crying because I’m a failure at being mature and maintaining my composure. So how do I stop taking rudeness from strangers as a personal insult and immediately losing my temper and patience when they treat me poorly?",12Jul2019,1
85,"21m. I've always had problems when it comes to dating. What my normal pattern would be is I see some girl that I see fairly regularly (class/friend circle/etc.), start talking and end up being friends. Then later I would start getting feelings for them. A few weeks/months to build up the courage to do so and end up ruining/losing the friendship by just leaving on bad terms with two exception where we just drifted apart. I don't know if its just me being really weird when telling them or if its the girls or something with me or what exactly.

A few weeks ago, I received a job offer which is close to our family house than my current apartment (it’s 2 hours away from my new job). My job would require me to travel at least 50% of the time which means I won’t be home most of the time.

My problem is that, I don’t get along with my mom. She’s abusive and drives my anxiety. Also, my former room is occupied by my sibling who doesn’t want to move out of it. I will be sharing a room with my sister and she’s okay with it.

On the other hand, if I move back home, I can save a lot of money and won’t spend much on rent. I can save this towards of purchasing my own home soon.

She asked to go out on saturday to a pub i frequent and tell her a lot about. Weve been trying to go together for a while but stuff kept coming up. The other problem is that i could never get with her in the pub if our friends were there too.

Finally she suggested this saturday but all of my usual drinking friends are away, so it would just be us alone.

92,"I have been friends with him since first grade and we both just completed our first year of college. Since our graduation last year, he has started to send me rants where he talks about how miserable he is. At first, it wasn’t very severe, and it was only about minor drama, but now he has started to refer to himself as “depressed” and is hung up on girls. 

He is very quiet and awkward, and he expects a lot from those he trusts. Recently, at work, people have been mocking him for not getting a girlfriend yet, and it’s something he’s very sensitive about. As a result, he sent me another rant today about how he thinks all girls are just “dumb sluts” and all they want to do is sleep around. This is very worrying for me because I do not want him to go down a path of hatred and disrespect for all women, but I don’t know what to tell him.

He is really stubborn, so he refuses to do anything I advise him such as seeing a therapist.

My company has been having an alarming rate of turnover. I have been job searching for a while now. Actually have a place interested in me as well. 

This morning I learned one of my friends was fired Tuesday. I was angry, but not surprised (She is doing okay, in good spirits). She was the hardest worker in our entire office, but the company never prioritized her dept. I cant say much more. 

This afternoon I receive an email with questionable content - it crossed a line for me, I felt it was greatly against the ""ideals"" of the company - and it really felt morally wrong. 
I cannot name departments or any specifics but people agreed with me.

95,"Hello Reddit, I'm an 18 year old male who lives with my parents, my 2 younger brothers and 2 dogs. I Work a minimum wage job/take college courses. So I'm not just wasting away down here.

the basement has no door and is fully covered in carpet, which is fine, we've been here about 4 years and I've been down here since. our two dogs are supposedly potty trained but my carpet would tell you otherwise, between the scratches, piss and crap stains scattered around it. I'm never really home except to sleep and eat dinner, but I have thought of multiple ways to prevent this, including a baby gate, training the dogs/not letting them downstairs and I've also tried many things to treat the carpet, like steam cleaning it and stain removers, nothing works though. It needs to be professionally cleaned or removed altogether.

My mom however disagrees with me on almost everything, she doesn't want a baby gate in the stairs, and says that she doesnt see the dogs go downstairs to begin with, and has called me a liar for trying to go to her for help on this. I asked about the carpet, she isn't concerned about it and said she won't be until I move out, then she will replace it with tile. I asked about just doing that asap as it feels like the carpet physically makes me sick, and even offered to pay for a portion of it. I'm old enough to understand that it would take time, but putting money on the side, even a couple hundred a month would take a couple months to do. She refuses and won't tell me why. Blames me for not being home to take care of the carpet and ignores any concern I ever have regarding the family or home (For example we don't have a vaccum cleaner after 5 years because it was broken by my brother, because she refuses to buy one). I'm constantly told I'm disgusting but she never wants to help me with solutions to fix it. On top of that I have been kicked out 3 separate times and my dad has had to intervene to let me come back.

I’m a 21 year old guy living in the southeastern US. I come from a family filled with drugs and mental illness, could go on for hours but it’s easier to just say that it’s a very toxic environment. Recent deaths in the family, parents divorce, physical and mental abuse, etc. However, there a couple people in my family that I adore and I’m very thankful to have around, it could be a lot worse obviously and I don’t have it as bad as I could.

I could stick around, but it’s not what I want. Instead, I want to move to the northwest and transfer jobs. I have the money saved, I’ve put in the work, that’s not the problem. After a year and once I am eligible for in state tuition, I’d like to go to college. 

However, my family is saying and doing anything and everything to try to get me to stay. Their reasons are all pretty selfish and it boils down to “you’re an only child and we don’t have another kid (or grandkid).”. 

Could I stay here and accomplish the same things? Yes.

Do I want to move somewhere new, adventure, be very independent and figure things out with a clear mind outside of this toxic environment?

Yes.

i'm a grad student working in the chicago art/nonprofit scene and recently i've been feeling inadequate when it comes to my professional life. i can't tell if this is imposter syndrome or something that really needs to be addressed. but i've always considered myself a hard worker, a good student, and passionate.

My wife and I have been married for two years now. We have a good sex life, but every once in a while I get that craving only a good wank will satisfy.

Yesterday when she went out shopping I decided to fire up the computer and have some time to myself. I've got all my material saved on a google drive with a gmail account that I only use in incognito mode.

However in the middle of jerking off my mom called me on skype and I had to stop and talk to her. After that I wasn't in the mood anymore so I closed all my windows and left the computer.

An hour later my wife yells my name from downstairs and tells me to come down. I get down there and she's crying and red faced in front of the computer. I look at the screen and sure enough, she's looking at my folder. I forgot to use incognito and my account was still logged in. She calls me disgusting and tells me she can't believe I would do something like that to hurt her. I'm into SSBBW and the majority of the stuff I had saved was camgirl clips I had bought and amateur hardcore, all with obese women. There was also a lot of stuff I made in photoshop putting my wife's face onto fat women's bodies and such. For the record, my wife is skinny and had no idea I was into fat girls. There were a few photoshops of her friends as fat women as well which probably weren't fun for her to see.

 

I didn't know what to say so I just apologized over and over. She said she felt sick just looking at me and stormed out of the house. I haven't heard anything from her since. I'm pretty sure she spent the night at her friend's place. No idea what to do next. I feel totally destroyed and sick inside. It kind of feels like my marriage is over.",12Jul2019,18

116,"I don't even know how to pick the specifics apart to ask about them. I'm so confused. We have an appointment for couples counseling that was supposed to be today but had to be pushed back (for real and important reasons) to next week. Now I'm not even sure if we should go because I'm scared that it will just be another venue for manipulation. I'm also admittedly kind of scared that I'll find out my partner was right all along because I don't want to be that kind of person especially to someone I care about so much, and it would also mean that I'm very crazy thinking all these things are happening to me that aren't.

The way I see it, my partner is psychologically and verbally abusive. My partner belittles, controls, and gaslights me, struggles to apologize for things whether big or small, struggles to do things that I ask for (e.g. we split the chores and I mention one of theirs that I really would like to be taken care of, they'll do others unasked, but not that one) and uses immediate fear/anxiety as well as gradual manipulation/wearing-down in order to get me to do/not do/agree to/believe things. My partner also seems to use my fear of abandonment against me.

The way my partner sees it, I'm verbally abusive and controlling, I'm always angry/unhappy, I gaslight my partner (this is a newer thing on their side), I play the victim, nag, and present a potential violent/self-harming threat. I'm not sure if there's anything else because I'm trying to go off of what's been said and I'm sorry if that makes this unbalanced.

I definitely yell, cuss, and call names when we fight; this is mutual but not acceptable. I am sullen or annoyed a lot more than I'd like to be. I did once pick up my partner's gun and contemplate shooting myself when I was in a very dark place several years ago. My partner found me sitting like that, and although I never raised the gun and I ended up calling my therapist I'm sure it was nonetheless terrifying. I do a really bad job when it comes to dropping arguments/topics, I freak out if a threat of my partner leaving comes up or if they hang up on me -- as in I get irrationally terrified and try to do anything to keep them there/talking, which is a crazy way to act and I don't know how this started. Some of these are things that I think I've gotten better at over the years (and with therapy) but my partner doesn't seem to think so.

If we were going to split now would be a good time in terms of housing, but I'm irrationally terrified of this prospect and of losing everything we've worked so hard for, especially if I'm in the wrong because I'd definitely be willing to do whatever work it takes to fix myself/my part of this. Believe it or not there's a lot of really amazing, good stuff about our life together, it's just that the bad is so horrible that it can't go on like this.

so i’m bad about the whole fwb thing. i’m an emotional motherfucker. pisces moon, bitch. a lot of my sexual attraction comes from who that person is, not just how they look. so i’m pretty prone to falling for them :( i’ve done it twice now, still in that second run (let’s call him J), and i can feel it coming to an end. except i caught feelings, which i plan on telling him!! except he’s been like, ghosting me pretty much? i don’t think it’s intentional. but either way, knowing when someone is losing interest in you is a shitty feeling when you like them so much. i just don’t know how to bring it up without sounding unreasonably dramatic, y’know? i don’t wanna do a whole thing, ugh

so imma try to keep this as short as possible, so bear with me ;-; so i’ve had two fwb’s at different times; the first we’ll call R, the second we’ll call J (they were well over a year apart from each other, just a lil btw). i’ve fallen for both of them because i’m a FOOL okay? a  f o o l. anyways i didn’t learn my lesson from that first thing with R, clearly, and then i started a fwb dynamic with a long distance friend. i’m an idiot, i’m aware. so i can feel myself falling for J, except right as i realize this he’s just ghosting?? for no reason?? i haven’t even told him yet, haven’t gotten the chance to. 

but this is EXACTLY what happened with me n’ R. i felt strongly, he didn’t, drifted away slowly before finally telling me we can’t be fwb’s. i needed space and i’m cool now but i haven’t seen him since. now with J, because i’m feeling like all fuckin... pouty about how i want romance, i still yearn for him but it makes me want to run and find someone who feels as strongly for me as i do for him. it makes me wanna date and find love and all that sappy shit! and honestly? it makes me miss R. ‘cos R did everything very romantically. it was sweet, i loved it, it’s why i fell so fucking hard for him. and now i miss it :’) i just miss him in general

so uh. i’ve been considering........... reaching out to R to catch up? plus he isn’t long distance because that really ain’t it. i don’t wanna go in with any expectations, i just want to see what’s up, what happened, how did we click so well and then separate, y’know? i was wondering if that’s at all maybe an option after some space and a lot of emotional growth on my part. idk man, is it a good call? or is it a real real bad one?",12Jul2019,1
119," okay so I got fired from two places on my resume instead of left or the project finished. Now one of the companies I got terminated from has an equifax profile, so I managed to get around that by giving the company an equifax number and salary key for proof of employment. The other company, a law firm which I got fired from because I just was not performing my duties properly, does not have an equifax account number. Am I fucked? I called the recruiting company which hired me for the law firm I got fired from and literally asked them ""if a former temp employee got fired from your company, and a company called and asked for a reference, would you disclose that that employee got fired?"" the lady is like ""I don't know, i'd have to check..."" Literally I sat there in awkward silence thinking the lady was checking, but after a while she is like ""is there anything else I can help you with?""

&amp;#x200B;

I'm probably fucked any way this goes so honestly, at this point, it does not matter. I managed to provide proof of employment from one company, but thats because I was a legit employee of that company, this second company which I got terminated from is a recruiting company, but the recruiter does not work at the company anymore. I removed that employment history from my employment application and am planning on telling this company that wants to hire me that I could not find proper references from that company because the recruiter left. If they ask me for the name of the recruiting company anyways, i'm still fucked though, correct?

120,"Okay, there is a bit of a backstory. I live with my dad and my brother and my parents are divorced. So the problem is that my dad gives a zero f*ck to hygiene same as my grandma (his mom) . My dad is a pretty successful business man and he works 12 hours a day, but he doesn’t have time/energy to also be a “house dad”. It’s that the house is getting cleaned by a polish women once a week and the other 6 days it’s just filthy everywhere. I’m talking about dishes in the kitchen, my bed that gets cleaned once week (what  really messed up is in the summer when I’m outside all day chilling with my friends). When I was a kid I didn’t care/knew about the standard hygiene levels and how often you should take a shower. But I’m now getting older and realize more often that’s it’s pretty messed up and gets me angry and frustrated sometimes. I saw at my moms house that she would regularly take care of my bed and showed me that you should regular brush your teeth and stuff. But my dad has never learnt that from his mom that hygiene is such a important thing to take care of. 

Now is my question; how can I convince the dad to take care of hygiene, or should I go live with my mom?

I do have to say that I don’t prefer the second choice, because of all my friends and school that are near my dads house.. I still really love my mom don’t get me wrong, but it’s just that my social live is near my dads house and that my mom lives 30km further away

Yes, it’s quite a prestigious job and deals with media with a lot of people worldwide. If the video got out, there would be a definite reaction in the mainstream media.

I don’t know what to do. On one side, I know I shouldn’t have said that word and really shouldn’t have filmed it. I was beyond stupid and I don’t even know why I did it, to be edgy I suppose.

first off i'd like to say... wow. I did not know my ""cousin"" was fucking 35

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a teenager,  growing up. my father and mother separated my father got deported and my mother is somewhere (not taking care of me)

&amp;#x200B;

I live with my aunt &amp; uncle

and they have brother &amp; sisters

I consider their children my cousins well not blood related but we are, in-law.

&amp;#x200B;

When I grew up 13-14-15

All my cousins used to look down on me and my cousin which is around my age

we're the only two (youngest) in the entire family.

&amp;#x200B;

they'd always say on how we always played games on our phones when we were at family gatherings.

My explanation is uh.. ya'll fuckin drink ... and I wouldn't fit in. they were old. you see the gap. they're 25-35's while i'm just about 18

&amp;#x200B;

and a few days ago

my aunt called asking me to watch their house.

I said yea, yall got fast internet. I'ma DL some porn and games.

I'm here now. after what i'm about to talk about happened. (I got a lotta porn and games)

&amp;#x200B;

anyways.

that's not the point.

&amp;#x200B;

I really feel if they read it they'd know it's me. my story of life is.. not common at all..

&amp;#x200B;

anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

they leave tomorrow

&amp;#x200B;

my cousin started off showing me around his house and stuff. (i dont wanna get specific because i'm scared he'll know it's me) i dont fucking know but it feels uncomfortable please try to understand my viewpoint..

&amp;#x200B;

He eventually talked about my success and praised me and said ""we're always here for ya"" 

because

I grew up 6 to where i'm at now without my parents or siblings ( i have a few, they're like 27 now)

and i'm about to graduate high school and i know my aunt and uncle can't support me. 

I do music producing and rap/sing. 

&amp;#x200B;

i'm not that big. only like 300 monthly spotify listeners but I'm trying to go full-time, I've spent 4-5 years learning.

he praises me and talks about how when he was 21 he started smoking pot and he even said ""it's good for you, he pressured me to smoke a blunt and I took a hit. I feel regret. I was hoping i'd feel nothing. I'm scared try drugs but the look in his eyes were... so scary, I feel regret that I took 2 hits (he pressured me twice). i'm no pussy about smoking a blunt but being pressured to? ... I have lung problems already, when I run 2-3 miles, my breathing gets hard. I'm scared man.. I feel like those two puffs reduced my life. I also feel bad. he told me he was 35 and I was like woah... 

he lives with his parents rn. He has a good job and makes good side money.

idk tho... I felt like I could see his vibe... that vibe of pressure and depression.

he was drinking. I took a few shots of some heavy shit. not willingly at least

he's still nearby as i'm typing.

I'd like you to read this and downvote. I don't want this story going out... or don't vote at all.

Just tell me...

what should I feel like right now

how do I react?

I don't know...

I feel... so sorry.

I've seen a depressed drunk and high guy in an anime or movie..

to have it happen in front of me....

I feel old now. 17

it's been so long.

My great cousins who I thought were cool.

most of them didn't go to college.

I'm scared my music won't make it anywhere.

before a few hours before this..

I had the mindset to work hard and only look at your dreams to pursue music.

but now... it's weight. I feel heavy weight.

I graduate in may 2020. I hope I get somewhere. I'm working hard despite the hate and love i'm getting.

I don't want anyone who knows me to identify me.

if they saw this they'd know right away 

but i hope they see this in a few years and don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

133,"Hello, I'm a 22 year old dude in the US. I'm trying to become self confident and stop being such an introvert, who is afraid to be himself around others. I'm working to stop being so uncomfortable.
Im trying to get better everyday, and I'm making good progress. 

Through highschool I had an awful time. I was awkward, and had terrible anxiety. So bad that I had to leave school and go to online school.
This stunted my social life so much, and I finally began to realise it. I missed out on relationships, friends, parties. I never got to experience any of those things. It got to the point where I stopped leaving the house completely. 

But I knew that had to stop. I hated what I became. So I saw a psychiatrist. And now after cognative behaviour therapy, and exposure therapy. I can leave the house with no fear, I can go out with friends, I can go to places I've never imagined (like movie theaters)
I am ready to start living my life.
I've been making friends, real friends. We went out to the movies and I had a great time. We stayed up all night talking, I loved it. But I still felt me being a little awkward. 

I want to change that. I want to be able to talk to my friends normally. I want to be able to initiate conversations. I want to be able to talk with confidence. I want to be able to take selfies, or post pictures on social media without feeling or looking awkward. I want to have a romantic relationship. 

I'm sorry if this is a vent/rant. I just need to get it all out. I need advice on becoming the social person I want to be. I want to feel comfortable being with people, and with talking to people.
I want to stop shutting myself in, I want to stop being alone and scared to meet new people. 

I've been browsing /r/socialskills. Its been helpful. But I'm trying to get as much advice as I can get.  

How does one become more social, confident and have relationships, and not feel like awkward or scared?",12Jul2019,4

I’ve been assaulted multiple times and they genuinely believe that I should have just worn pants or they simply don’t care, my sister is still friends with one of my worst abusers. They freely say the n word and make casually racist comments. We bicker so much and when I get upset about the comments they think I’m being selfish/over dramatic. I feel like they’re lives would be better without me around. I just got out of a serious relationship and he has just been admitted to a mental health ward. He told me repeatedly that this is my fault and I do feel really responsible. I moved home after ending the relationship and I had to leave my friends, my job that I loved, my uni, everything. I had to get a job at McDonald’s since coming back because it’s a small town with very little opportunities. I have to repeat units at the University here because a lot of them don’t count from my old university because it’s in a different state. I feel like I’ve ruined my life. I just want to start again.

about my school, im repeating my 10th grade (i dropped out midway in my last school year due to feeling really demotivated and down) and i started for the first time in a new school where i dont know anyone and no one knows who i am, the people there are very friendly and ive made a few friends but no one very close. i feel a bit more motivated to keep going to school since its a new school with new people who dont know about me dropping out of my last school so theres no more shame but ive been feeling this odd feeling of emptiness.

i feel emptiness to think of finishing school,i feel emptiness thinking of my future and finally getting out of a country where i feel like i dont belong in (im in the philippines) 

i already know what my goals are in life are and what i want to do in the future but im feeling so empty thinking about it that even accomplishing it all wont make me completely happy and i think ""whats the point?""

146,"Long story short, I (25/F) receive a LOT of commissioned painting requests. I started painting landscapes a few years ago and everything seemed to take off. I make hyper realistic paintings and they take a lot of time and effort. I’ve had people reach out for commissions the past year and done so many that I’m feeling completely burnt. I’m finishing my last 5 right now. Anyway, I just had a former teacher reach out asking to talk to me about a commission they’re excited about. The thing is, I literally don’t have the time to do any more commissions because I am booked with shows and work life, but I seem to struggle turning people down. I feel like they’ll always get mad at me or think I’m lying to them. It gives me so much anxiety to even receive their message because the idea of making them unhappy pains me. I don’t know how to turn people down professionally and kindly without feeling immensely guilty afterwards. In fact, I’ve had fellow artist colleagues say to me I should be grateful for all the commissioned requests and basically shut up and do them. But for my reasons stated above mixed in with some personal reasoning, I just will not do another commission. How do I handle this? Why am I experiencing so much anxiety about saying no and is it in fact wrong of me to turn people down?",12Jul2019,1
147,"So, I don’t really know what to do at this point. 

I went to school to be a phlebotomist last year. After graduating I had tons of interviews. None of them went anywhere. I used to have really bad anxiety in high school. At the worst of it, I could barely function in society. If I drove to the grocery store by myself in hopes of buying chips or whatever, I had to sit in the parking lot and convince myself to go in. Sometimes I lost that argument and would just drive back home, sometimes I made it inside and got overwhelmed and had to leave... even though leaving without buying anything was also an overwhelming amount of anxiety. My anxiety has gotten better the past couple of years, but there’s still a few things that suck me right back. Interviews being one of those things. 

I feel like most of my interviews failed just because of the way I conducted myself. Lots of stuttering, “um”s and “uh”s, things like that. There were a few I kicked ass at, but didn’t get the job due to lack of experience/someone kicking better ass. But regardless, they did fail and I was getting desperate. 

Then there was this plasma center. I knew from the beginning it wasn’t going to be the best place to work. (Let’s just say that I got the first call for a phone interview in October 2018 and I didn’t actually get the phone interview until March 2019.) They were open about how their turnover rate is horrible, and that they have periodic “mass exoduses.” Usually that isn’t a good sign. 

Everything they told me about the job before accepting turned out to be a lie. Shift would be 10-6:30. Lie (on average I work until 8 pm.) It was a part time job averaging around 30 hours a week. Lie (I’m full time which wasn’t what I wanted/needed to fit my life but I’ve been trying to make it work.) Just... everything is not what I was prepared for. 

Originally I was supposed to start in the medical history department but the last minute they started me on the phlebotomy floor. That was the one thing that made all the other things worth it. Getting to be a phlebotomist. But, I got most of the way there (very frustrating process- my managers are dill holes) and then they moved me departments. Which is pretty much working backwards. They acted like it was benefiting me and that I should be excited but I hated it. It has just opened me up to be used. They will call me useless on the floor and send me to screen donors for 7 out of my 8 hour shift, then for my last hour they will move me to the floor to hold and close sections so everyone else who worked on the floor all day can go home. Multiple occasions I was used to send people home early where I ended up having to stay 20-30 minutes past my end shift. 

They’ve been keeping me in the dark about my next training. Will it be in MH (medical history) or will it be the next step on the floor? My one manager, a few weeks ago, was like “hey, we were talking about you in our meeting. The term venipuncture came up... I’m not saying it’s a done deal... but that might be your next step.... maybe. Don’t quote me.” On Monday, everyone got training except for me. A girl who had just moved from MH to the floor when I moved from the floor to MH is essentially where I’m at on the floor as well. So she’s probably going to get sticking before me and I’ll get reception. Which I really don’t want. 

I’d just like to say that being given MH training to begin with was shifty in my opinion to begin with. I was told I couldn’t get the promotion to stick unless I was a senior PCT. In order to get senior status, I needed to learn screening. Then I’d get the promotion to stick. Then a different manager said there was no promotion. One wouldn’t open up for months. Then someone said senior status isn’t achieved until learning 1 full section and a half of another. Yet, there are some senior pcts who haven’t done a single thing in any other department. 

This is getting long and I still have so many more frustrations. Between being called useless by a manager, and all the instances where they flat out used me and then expected me to be grateful for the opportunity. 

I have talked to the scheduling manager about my schedule twice now. I said “being scheduled so late so many times in a row doesn’t work for me. I can’t work until 8 pm, 5 days in a row, for weeks in a row. I want earlier end times and if I have to work until 8, then I want an extra day a week off, considering I was supposed to be part time anyway.” And I was as told it was no problem, the day off could happen even if I had earlier end times, but they might only be temporary and I might need to go back to 5 days in September. Fine. Whatever. The very next schedule I was until 8pm for the whole damn week. No extra day off. Like... it’s just frustrating. 

It’s the only job for me to be out of retail. But I’m at the point right now where it’s so hard to go and be at work that even if I was given sticking tomorrow, I don’t know if I’d even want it. I’m thinking of taking the pay cut and going to Walmart in all honesty. At least I’d have the extra day a week off. 


I’m honestly scared to go to work tomorrow now because I was never told a certain thing/a way to handle a certain thing and it caused a problem today. And I know I did it once or twice more. So I’m probably going to be passive aggressively called stupid for not knowing that what I did caused a 2 day deferral instead of 1 (thinking about it, it makes sense... why it would be that way. but I wasn’t thinking too in depth about it.) A lot of stress-eating tonight. I have been stress eating a lot lately. I gained 15 lbs since starting. Which is just making me more upset lmao. I’m so weak emotionally. I’m pathetic lol. 

Sorry this was so long. And more like a vent. But I don’t know what to do",12Jul2019,1
148,"Instead of living in the moment, I compare myself to how others are happy too often.

One of my friends is happy posting lovey photos of him and his girlfriend? I'll start to feel bad that I've never had one and literally grow obsessive over why I haven't.

Somebody I know posting photos of themselves wasted last night? I'll start to feel boring that I am straight edge.

Somebody I know is having a bunch of friends over and didn't invite me on purpose? I'll feel bad because I know they did it because I'm an introvert who feels uncomfortable with large crowds that I feel I have to impress.

Somebody posts even a photo of their art or photography or music? I'll feel bad that I have no talents besides writing and that I don't have a talent or thing that people know me for.

Overall - I see myself as an extremely boring person. Besides doing well in college and having a good job now, I'm not successful socially and worry about how others see me.

153,"I am 16-year-old from Texas this past week I was on vacation in the Caribbean the first two days were pretty normal just vacation but the second day I was there I was walking along the beach with no shirt and I noticed three girls looking at me while I walk past I never really thought it to be anything as it’s just the beach but later in the day I saw those three girls again at the pool looking at me and whispering to each other as I walked past them to go towards the beach One of them stops me and the other two walk in the other direction she asked me if I spoke English and I said yes she then explained to me that one of her friends was into me and asked if she could have my Snapchat I said yes and I am with my day . About 20 minutes later I received a Snapchat from her saying her name why she’s here and she said that she was here to celebrate her birthday with her friends and she’s from Brazil and the funny thing is that my birthday is four days after hers.One thing led to another and she asked me if I wanted to meet her at Beach at five I said yes and was extremely nervous and met her there and at night after just a couple minutes talking I was extremely surprised of how much we had in common from the foods we like to have a strict her parents were and the sports we like the TV show we liked and even our irrational fears everything seems so weird that she was so similar to me and we’re so far apart it seems like every answer she gave was the same as I would’ve given even though we live in two totally different cultures . I eventually had to go because I do go eat dinner at my family after I finished eating I Snapchat of her and told her that I enjoy talking to her and that I had a good time the funny thing about that conversation is we’re both so shy that we never even took off our sunglasses while talking anyway that night she snapped chatted me if I can meet tomorrow and I said I was busy so she asked we could meet again later that night I met her again at night and we sat on the beach and we just talked and I was still surprised about how many things we had in common seems like we’re almost same person and yet there for two totally different cultures everything about it was just so similar to me . And again we both had to go as her parents didn’t want to have us out late that night  that night again I texted her how was funny how similar we were and I would love to see her again sometime during the trip 
 She said that she felt the same way and that will meet up again the next morning she asked if I was available that night I said yes and I think about Waze meeting with her and talking to her that night . We finally met that night I was leaving the next day so I was going to make a big explanation and tell her how I felt. That night when we met on the beach I told her how much I enjoyed spending time with her and that she gave me a special feeling and she said the same thing to me and we hugged  about 30 seconds later I said how much I enjoyed being here with her and I didn’t wanna leave after that we made it we locked eyes and kissed who is the first kiss for both of us after that we spent the rest of the two hours cuddling and kissing on the beach who would walk around holding hands up and down the beach saying how much we enjoy each other‘s company and how special each of us felt toward the other I told her how I never had a feeling that towards anyone else like her I had crushes on girls and others but she was special she gave me a feeling I never had before towards someone. Everything that night she said from the quotes like how she want to spend the rest of your time with me and how she want to spend more time with me at all of the other even ran closest she said felt like I could’ve said to myself I was thinking almost the same thing eventually after about two hours of cuddling and kissing on the beach we had to go we both said how we Snapchat each other if both of us need anything 

 I think we both realized that I was living over 5000 miles apart and over on two separate hemispheres of the earth this relationship really just didn’t make sense and this is probably the last time we would see each other
 She gave me a feeling that no one else has given me and I’ve never felt before when she was in my arms on the beach I just felt like everything was right everything was in its place and that something a special doesn’t come very often 
 I left the next morning on a flight and we’s we said our goodbyes  how sad we were.
 It’s now been a few days since then and I can’t stop thinking that we Snapchat it maybe a few times but I think we both realize that it was just a simple vacation thing if anyone has a previous experience to this or similar experience please let me know I just want to know a way to get this out of my head I cannot stop thinking about it and how much I miss her thanks for reading this really long story if you did.

So she broke up with a guy who tried to force himself on her and almost immediately rang me on Snapchat, as you do, for advice and just to rant at me. The next day she saw my best friend while her friend was buying cigarettes of my friends friend, and when she gets in she tells me about it etc etc. So i have my best friend round my house anyway and I explain to him about her and he doesn't know who she is. But obviously shes seen him at school sooooo many times so she knows who he is. 
Essentially. They talk. She likes him, he doesn't like her as much as i do. Initially. I say that because now theyre practically together

Tl;dr: I think I had a hallucination but am too embarrassed to tell my parents about it due to embarrassing details.

I'm taking new medication (venlafaxine 112mg)

I'll spare you the details, I was finishing up masturbating and finished in a sock (thats as digestible as I could make it). I was sitting there with the sock over my member and in the process of taking it off a giant (pinkie sized) roach or bug came off. Naturally, I flung the sock and had a silent freakout (can't scream). Went to investigate (and throw out the sock) and it was neatly placed under my bed (where it normally is) and flat as opposed to it being scrunched while it was being removed. With no sign of a roach or bug (I don't normally get bugs that size). It took me about 5-10 minutes to do the deed if that helps. Did I have a hallucination? Really sorry you chose to read this.",12Jul2019,1
159,"Hi there, sorry if this gets lengthy but here goes.

So I (19 F) found out on Sunday that my mother passed away in her apartment. The medical examiner called me and asked me what I wanted to do. I was stunned, she was only 55 (not that she had ever treated her body gently), and I asked him if I could have my dad help me take care of things. The officer said he legally couldn't since they were divorced, and the officer hadn't been able to contact my older sister (27 F) so it was on my shoulders since my sister and I were the only next of kin.

Anyways, flashback time. My mom was addicted to muscle relaxants and almost constantly either passed out or drunk. Naturally this made for a very negligent mother, and when she was awake she was heavily verbally abusive. My parents had been divorced since I was 6 and after the divorce all her addictions just got worse. My dad had no idea so I still spent weekends with her and I was so young that I didn't know that your mom sleeping for three days straight was unusual so didn't bring it up to dad. For 5 years I kept meeting up with my mom like this and of course there would be good days where we would go to the beach or the library but the majority of my memories with her involve me sitting in a room watching tv in a share-house with my mom's unconscious body nearby. She would smack me when I talked about my dad around her. Multiple tomes she said that if I ever told my dad what she did then she would kill herself and a lot of stuff like that, you get the picture.

As a result of her negligence, at age 11 I was raped by some friends-of-friends-of-my-mom's-drug dealers. When she found out she didn't call the cops or get a mew drug dealer, she told me that if anyone found out then my family wouldn't love me and that she would kill herself, etc. They repeated the act regularly for about a year until my dad found out and helped keep me from her via restraining orders and such.

So I haven't spoken to her in almost 8 years and I honestly don't harbor a lot of warm feeling for her memory. As far as I'm concerned the state can dispose of her body as if it were unclaimed. 

But here's the dilemma, my sister who was raised by a version of my mother who was a bit verbally abusive but not off-the-deep-end wants me to help her hold a big ceremony where we scatter the ashes of our mother. I thought it was just going to he something small but she now wants us to get like commemorative tattoos and keepsakes with the ashes in them and I just can't. She also invited my mother's extended family from NC. My mother really fucked me up and I would like to forget all about this. 

The worst thing is that my sister knows about what I went through growing up and still expects me to go through with this while family I haven't seen since I was 4 watch. How do I tell my sister that I don't want to remember our mother? I don't want to make my sister hate me or think I need mental help just cuz I can't cry at my mother's funeral ya know?

My dad has been nothing but supportive of me but we both understand how important it is to my sister and my mother's family that I be there with them to grieve. He thinks I should just humor them for a day and make something nice about her up to say in front of them, but the thought of that just brings back all my old traumas.

Advice on any aspect of this would be appreciated.

TLDR: My abusive mom died and my family expects me to care more about it than I think I am capable of doing.",12Jul2019,1

M22 f 17 before the comments roll in 16 is the legal age here and this girl turns 18 in a few months 

The girl lives an hour away we haven’t met yet and I arranged to see her for dinner in the evening I told her I had an appointment around 1:30 in the city and then she got angry saying I’m basically already going to be there and that I didn’t actually make plans with her as I was already going to be there and said I decided to slot her in on the same day

I think she’s just being immature and unreasonable saying this but how can I talk my way around this dilemma? 

in my opinion I have 2 options I could say relax the appointment is on different day stop overthinking or just hold my ground and say what’s it got to do with anything I’d appreciate if you could let me know the best course of action or if there’s any others?",12Jul2019,1

Sister-17

This account is not my actual account, as one of the people mentioned in this knows my actual account's username. I am a young teen still living with my mom, my mom and dad got in a pretty messy divorce, which hurt us financially, when I was younger, I have a brother and a sister, both of whom I know do drugs (Weed, acid, etc.) (I recently learned my dad does too) I am out of school atm, and my mom recently got a different phone, so gave me her old one to put my sim card in. Since I didn't have any of my old contacts, I told my friends from school to msg me on my new phone (It's the same number) and none did. (this is not very relevant to the advice I'm asking for, just to set my emotions right now) My friends and I from school used to be very close. I have one friend outside of school, but he left with his family, and will be gone until the end of July. I have social anxiety, and I can barely ever start conversations, including with family. My one friend outside of school is the one person I can really talk to, but even then, I second guess myself a lot. Enter my dad, his visits to see us are sporadic, and not very often, the last time I saw him was around last thanksgiving. So, my siblings are not hesitant at all to ask him for money, to pay for things, to get them things, etc. (My dad is pretty wealthy) But me? Nope, I can't ask anyone for a thing, I hate it, it makes me feel terrible. I know he left us and everything, but still, I just can't bring myself to. My dad came by last weekend to bring me over to his apartment that is near an amusement park, my sister was going to come, but she came up with an excuse by the last minute to not come (My brother had summer school and work, he couldn't come) It wasn't too bad, because I spent most of the time watching movies, and riding rides at the amusement park. This week, nothing happened really, my brother snuck out with his ""friends"" to get high with them, my sister stayed in her room, and I did basically nothing and listened to musicals and biked around an empty parking lot alone. My dad wanted to see us again this weekend, but my brother wants to go alone, this is his first week off from summer school, and he wants to spend alone time (And probably get high with) my dad, I, privately, really wanted to come, because I had nobody to talk to about anything, and spending time with him sounded better than spending time alone, because my mom needs to work all day to support us, and whenever she comes home she gets mad at the smallest things, yells a lot, and keeps us all up until sunrise sometimes. She has on occasions, referred to my sisters eating disorder as a ""small problem"" and refused to get her therapy for that (I learned from that and keep my issues bottled up away from all of them with only my friend outside of school to talk to) This has led to multiple nights of us getting involved in yelling until sunrise and saying anything for her to just stop yelling and to go to bed. My brother's mind was set on going alone, and I want to go, but I don't want to ruin his days with our dad (which may be his last ones for like a year).

Multiple questions,  

How do I feel less bad about asking my dad for things?

How can I start conversations with my dad, or find something to talk about?

How do I cope with having nobody to talk to?

What should I do about my brother going to my dad's?

Thank you for all responses,",12Jul2019,1
163,"I have been volunteering in Lab A for 2 years now, I have been their only undergraduate for most of this time, and because of that I’ve gotten to have a lot more to do. Without giving away too many details the work done in Lab A is somewhat delicate, they vet all of their undergraduates and put them through a trial period. I’ve really bonded with some of the graduate students and I feel a sense of loyalty to Lab A. Lab A also hired me for this summer only, I’ve been told they can’t really afford to keep me around during the school year. 

I’ve been spending a lot of time this summer working with Lab B. Lab A and B are doing a project together and so I’m “rented out” to this lab whenever they need me and I’m not doing something for Lab A. I’ve really enjoyed working with Lab B, and they’ve mentioned wanting to hire me for the fall if Lab A doesn’t. 

I am conflicted because I’ve heard rumors from graduate students in both labs that the professors running them are a bit competitive. I don’t want to go so far as to say they don’t get along, but I’m worried that my taking the job will come across as Lab B stealing me out from under Lab A. I really don’t want there to be bad blood, but if Lab B offers me a job and Lab A doesn’t I’m going to take it. I guess I’m looking for advice on how to handle this tactfully? I don’t know if the professor running Lab B has told the professor of Lab A that they want to hire me, and I’m nervous to be the one to bring it up.

167,"There is this girl that I am 100% sure is sick in the head. She has been constantly trying to drive a knife between me and my partner. 

Initially, I believed she was in love with him: she would send him messages stating that, would constantly corner him at strike up a conversation whenever possible, and stalks him on all his social medias. She knows we are together and are madly in love but chooses to ignore that. Because of her interference, our relationship would take a strain and we would take these ""breaks"". During the times I was visibly hurting, she would be all over him, but during the times I paid him no attention, **she also would discard him**. It made me confused and furious. Me and my partner at one point ""broke up"" and once we really kept a distance, she no longer interfered.

As a matter of fact, she began to bother other couples, began to cling and have scandalous affairs with random men, and is now engaged. Me and my past partner are now reconnecting (we are still in love and are grateful for the distance) and she has caught wind of it through our social medias basically and has begun to passively aggressively mention him on posts and ""hit him up"" again. I just cannot believe it. SHE IS ENGAGED. We are feeling the stress again and I am worried we will not be able to make it this time, despite how much we love each other. I have done **everything** to have her back off but she won't and at one point I was advised to ""pretend she doesn't exist/isn't getting to you"" but it really has been putting us both on edge.

170,"Let me elaborate, earlier today my friend texts me and asks if he can come over to my house to talk about something. I asked what it was he wanted to talk about, but he never gave me a straightforward answer but instead told me he felt ‘betrayed’ and would tell me in person. I had already made plans with someone else to go play tennis, so I told him that I was going to be booked for a while. He said that was alright, but told me to text him when I would be available. Let me interject here and say this me and said friend are decently close and *used* to be really good pals but we’ve grown apart and personally I think asking for something like this is very flattering but kind of strange considering we’ve only seen each other like once in the past year. Furthermore, slightly unrelated but I have really bad social anxiety and when people tell me out of the blue to meet them ____ or do ____ with them it stresses me the hell out, and generally people have a hard time understanding this (although that’s probably my fault because I usually express this through making up plans to avoid hanging out and whatnot rather than actually telling people straightforward, in fear that they won’t understand or etc). ANYWAY after tennis is done I check my phone and realize he’s texted me multiple other times asking if I was ready for him to come over or whatever. At this point I was tired and the whole situation was stressing me the fuck out, so, as bad as it felt, I continued to lie throughout the day that I was ‘still play tennis’ and ‘probably wasn’t going to be available for the rest of the day’. 

Here’s why:

1. I hate to jump to conclusions but this friend of mine is known to be pretty girl crazy and it’s not unusual to find him knee deep in some drama a chick from school caused. It could’ve easily been something other than this but I honestly doubt it was because I feel he would taken the situation more seriously and told me straightforward what happened rather than alluding it in and attempt to meet him in person for whatever reason

2. Going back to first point, couldn’t he have just called/texted me? Maybe he feels that this is ingenuine? Maybe if he actually told me what was happening I would’ve had a better understanding of how he felt and what I could do. Again stuff like facetime or making a simple phone call stresses me out (even amongst friends) because of my social anxiety

So what should I do/should I have done? Am I in the wrong for not being there for him when I should have been?",12Jul2019,2

About 20 minutes later I received a Snapchat from her saying her name why she’s here and she said that she was here to celebrate her birthday with her friends and she’s from Brazil and the funny thing is that my birthday is four days after hers.One thing led to another and she asked me if I wanted to meet her at Beach at five I said yes and was extremely nervous and met her there and at night after just a couple minutes talking I was extremely surprised of how much we had in common from the foods we like to have a strict her parents were and the sports we like the TV show we liked and even our irrational fears everything seems so weird that she was so similar to me and we’re so far apart it seems like every answer she gave was the same as I would’ve given even though we live in two totally different cultures .

177,"I started a job back in December 2018, where I was referred by one of my coworkers. I was really excited and eager to learn, I have years of experience in the pharmaceutical field so I was excited to put it into a new job. I go to the interview and she wasn’t sure if she should hire me since I was going back to school, it turned out they like my work ethic and hired me on. During the interview I was promised that I will be going on the computer and have the ability to bill prescriptions etc like I did at my other job. Few weeks into the job, the promised I was given didn’t go through. Every time I touched the computer they panicked thinking I’d fuck up or mess something up. I didn’t end up going on the computer, half the time I wasn’t really doing much but counting pills and mopping the floors. I was never able to take a break and if I did, it was standing up while I eat. They made me feel worthless and stupid. Going to work felt like a drag and I felt I didn’t relate to the coworkers much (they’re much older than me). 

My coworkers in the beginning seemed nice but it was obvious later on they were willing to backstab me. 

Forward to today, the boss showed me her true colours. Recently I had an issue with there debit machine (had a communication issue) and wouldn’t let transactions go through saying “not completed”. My previous coworker let a transaction go through and it was not completed also. I had to do a transaction and I threw out the receipt since I was so busy, my transaction didn’t end up going through and I let the guy go (it usually doesn’t happen like that). I told my coworker what happened, she then snooped through the garbage to see I thrown out a receipt from a previous transaction I didn’t do that was also not completed and blamed me for hiding it when really I mindlessly threw it out because I was busy and needed to do my transaction. I apologized to the boss and she ended up calling me a dishonest person. 

Next thing is I get an allergy at work from eating something from my coworker and get a mild allergy. I took a benedryl and was fine after (no severe symptoms). And they forced me to go to the ER and following me there and inside so I wouldn’t leave - which wasted my time. I left because other people had worst issues and I didn’t need to be there. When this happened my boss was fake, seemed careless. The person I work with who’s a healthcare professional panicked walking back and forth and anxious for something I told her that wasn’t serious. But still they didn’t take my word for that. 

I want to know how I can leave and how to not make it seem I wasn’t guilty or I’m hiding something? How do I resign professionally ? How do I let them know how badly I was treated. 

My coworker thinks this is a dumb idea. But I’m unhappy and I feel worthless. My mental health has spiralled downhill since this job and it’s painful. I can’t do this anymore. I don’t want to be cleaning when I’m always at work, I want to grow and learn new things, I want to feel valued.",12Jul2019,2

180,"If you could link me some hotlines that communicates over messages instead of calling, it'd be appreciated.

As an intro to myself, I'm a 17 year old closeted trans boy who is a senior high school. I have an abusive father, a transphobic family, and I can't find a single reason as to why I should keep going. 

I've always had some suicidal ideation but I've never really considered it until now. It all started about 5 weeks ago when my father beat my mother. It was the worse it had ever been. There was blood all over my bed (the conflict began in my room), all over my clothes, and all over the floor. There's a dent in the wall where he slammed her head. She begged me not to call the police and has been everyday since that incident. I want to call the police but if I did my mother would refuse to press charges and It'd make things worse. Please do not tell me to tell authorities, I will not do it. He is the sole bread winner of the family and my mom is not well enough to hold a job. Anyhow, since that day, I haven't been able to sleep, I go through cycles of starving and binge eating, I don't shower or brush my teeth anymore, because I'm both scared and depressed. I'm arranging plans for me to continue college in an entirely different state while my mother lives will other family. But that plan wouldn't happen until next summer because really, I don't have a choice. My mother and I are just trying not to provoke him so we can slolwy distance ourselves. But a year seems like too long. And even if I manage to leave, what if he hurts my mother again? What if he finds out I'm trans later in life and tries to harm me? What if he just sabotages my plans to leave all together? There are too many what ifs and it's driving me nuts.

In short, I'd rather kill myself now while I still have the balls to. Any dimension without him in my life sounds like a good one, and if I have to kill myself to get that, I would. However, deep down I really don't want to. I want to hopefully transition someday, see my mother break free from his disgusting clutch and what not. But I don't think I can hold on. Please tell me what to do.",12Jul2019,5
181,"Hi, first time poster here so sorry if I get anything wrong.

So I'm a 3rd year college student (f) and this one guy I've known since first year has been really making things hard for me recently. He was quite hard to be around first year and honestly extremely creepy and bad around girls. Since then he's stopped drinking and found a gf but his reputation for being an a-hole and a creep have stuck around. We've been in a lot of the same clubs since first year and have managed to stay on okay terms (after he apologized for some of the not so great things he did first year). We have a lot of the same interests and conversation is usually good when I do see him. He is constantly messaging me to hang out but when I've obliged I've always felt slightly uncomfortable given his behavior before. Every time I tell him I don't really want to hang out he insists he's changed and that I have no legitimate reason to be uncomfortable. Even when I can't hang out because of a conflicting event he always asks if he can come along. When I say no, it leads to a guilt trip and him becoming very sad since he claims he sees me as a best friend. He always tells me I can just let him know anything he does that makes me uncomfortable and he'll change it but that isn't what a friendship should be imo. 

Now my birthday is coming up and I want to have all my friends over for a party and most importantly I don't want to invite him. Particularly since my actual close friends really dislike him. Honestly I want him to stop asking me to hang out (he messages me at least once a day and calls me repetitively if I just say no without giving an excuse) and I want him not to try to crash this party or guilt trip me about it. The one time I told him I can't hang out with him because he makes me uncomfortable he insisted on us talking in person (saying it was only fair to him that I actually talk to him) but I really really don't want this to happen. The other wrinkle is that I will still see him at the clubs we're both a part of and at the gym since we both go every day and I don't want him constantly trying to convince me to give him another shot. 

How do I tell him that I don't want to be friends?",12Jul2019,1

190,"Sorry if you notice some bad English but I'm not native speaker. Well Just as the title says a year ago I over drunk myself and touched my friend in a bad way but after she woke up and said to me ""what the hell..."" I woke up instantly from my drunk state and began to apologize for what I did . After seeing how she reacted for how was her face, realized that she got a trauma from that.

Well not gonna go into much details but I left saying that it was the best that I could do in that moment (at 5 in the morning in a not-so-good neighborhood), days later wrote an apologize but I was with so much anxiety too so the response was in short that for the sake of both she said to never talk to her.

Months passed and I went over my anxiety + depression and got better but in the meanwhile, was knowing from friends that my ex friend that I fucked up was still doing bad and never got better.

A year later passed and on one of those topics I asked a friend how she was doing now, then says that she is doing horrible, dropped college and had a suicide attempt. That was heartbreaking for me, I didn't know how to react, I tried to suicide too so it was really shocking knowing that she was going through that too. So I took a risky move and decided to send her a message to search for help before something went very bad and that I care for her like a friend still. Maybe I did wrong but I had to write her something, when I was deepest in my depression all a wanted was a cheer message and that's what I send to her. Not the best person definitely to send a message like that but seems like she doesn't have many friend to talk her problems. Did I do wrong? Probably yes, and don't know what to do aside from stepping out from this because I'm one of the cause of her depression. Please I need any good advice.",12Jul2019,4

Well, I take it back, I do know the GIST of what I want to do, but that’s it. I already know I want to be an entrepreneur of some sort - start my own thing and make my own money (doesn’t have to be a physical business location or even a tangible object - it can be I’m just saying I’m 200% open about any possibility, just anything that i don’t have to be HIRED to do). 

I don’t want to be an employee/ hired and have the risk of getting fired/ having my ‘salary’ stated for me. 

So that’s all I know. Other than that I have 0 idea. I used to have this desire to do something and I had a whole plan planned out (business model and basic plan) but honestly 1) I never actually did anything to go forward 2) I don’t even want to do it anymore. 

So now I’m just trying to think of what my plan is for my future but I’m just coming up short. 

Right now, I have 0 problems working for other people - I currently have 2 soon to be 3 part time jobs. They’re actually really fun jobs that I don’t hate and sometimes find enjoyable. But I know it’s because I know I’m not going to stay there forever and it’s just until I can find something better/ pay off my debts/ move out and buy my own car etc. 

But it feels like I’m floating along...... I know I’m young but I feel like I’m wasting time by not even knowing what I want to do - let alone having a plan and executing that plan.......

198,"  Back story: (Sorry for the super long post)

  My father and I have been at each other's throats for years now, just could not get along. Fighting almost constantly because I wouldn't conform to his ideal son, For example, he would not have patience with me when I was doing homework and would yell and scream at the top of his lungs at me or he would take away my things because I was not doing what he wanted me to do. My mother and him had a rocky relationship because of this, and would often times fight in which he would leave and wouldn't be seen for two days.  My grandparents (His parents) have stopped telling him about their doctor's appointments and won't tell him anything because he does the same thing to them (yell and scream). Same thing with his brother and my older sister. 

* My older siblings are step-siblings from my mother's previous marriage, and I am the only child from my father

I was told stories about him when I was a baby by my mother and sister about how he would take the wheels off of my brother's car cause he got a speeding ticket and wouldn't let him drive for weeks. Or how he would yell and scream at my sister and brother cause they didn't do what he wanted them to do. Also how he once disconnected the phone from the house so my sister couldn't call her friends (but this also was very worrisome because I was born very sick and might need 911. But he did not care at that moment what so ever)

If someone disagrees with him, or doesn't do what he says, when he says to do it. He flips his shit.

Some times we would have good times, but those were rare. As I have matured I have let the things my father has done slide off. He always wants to pick a fight with someone and wants to be right, but if he gets called out on it he backs up and acts like he didn't do anything. Or he would shut down and pout like a child.

  Just last year I caught him cheating and told my mother. He then proceeded to kick her out of the house via restraining order and was going to fight her tooth and nail into letting her have nothing after the divorce was final, My mother had enough evidence of his shitty ways and what she put into the property she was going to take him to the cleaners. 

  But they ended up going to couples therapy. She forgave him and he promised to change his nasty ways. Stating he wanted his son back (Me) this is because I would not talk to him, nor associate with him during that time. He changed for a little bit and tbh I thought he may be better.

Recently though he has gone back into his old ways but this time it is much worse. We live in a semi-rural area but we have neighbors who ride dirt bikes. Well, he has started complaining about them all the time they ride. He calls them and tells them to stop or threatens to call the police. This was an even bigger issue when my cousin who lived next to us and was raised by his great grandparents would ride his dirtbike. My father would raise hell and call the police on his poor uncle just to be an asshole.  My mother and I have told him to stop it and let them be but he just couldn't. 

   Well talking about this year. My girlfriend and I are looking for a place to stay, Well my mother said that the little house would be good (my mother and father own a smaller house next to their bigger house). I said sure but it needed a lot of work and they knew it needed work too. My father said in March that he was going to put new windows in so we could move into the house by August. Well, we waited and waited for him to put the windows in and its July so he hasn't even gone to look at them even though he keeps saying he will. My mother and I took it upon ourselves to fix it up while we waited on him, which included new carpets, paint, and a good cleaning. I started cleaning out the basement and told mom that there were old paint cans down there could I throw them out. She said yes and so I did. (My father is kinda a hoarder like his father and this is important for the next part). 

  My father caught wind of the paint cans being thrown out and said he needed to go through them, Mind you these were cans from 5 to 10 years ago so they're not any good.  I left the trash cans for him to go through for a week and a half. He didn't go through them. So I put them out on the street to be picked up. He then saw that they were picked up and blew up saying that we had no right to throw them out and there was good paint in there... He blew up about it and told me I did not have my priorities straight, and that I was being an entitled brat for wanting the clean up the house. He said that the paint and the carpets were nice to do things and the windows were need to do things. He then proceeds to dangle the house over top of my head as he has done with many other things before (ex. Game systems, internet, tv, electricity, and now the house). Now yes some of those things were due to my big mouth and not wanting to back down. But a rental property that he and my mother own, and that I am trying to fix up without his help and move into... That's not fair. 

So after another fight of him being an asshole and then acting like he did nothing wrong. I have decided to move down to Texas where my girlfriend's parents live and find an apartment down there as well as a new job. My mother has told me that she is heartbroken of how my father cannot treat me as a son or be a good father. She told me she will be sad and miss me but if I think its right then I should go. So I have made a resume and I am looking for apartments to move into and I am dead serious. But I want to know... How can I fix the relationship with my father and maybe have some peace before I go? And am I a bad son for leaving my mom with the deranged psycho?",12Jul2019,1
199,"I know people may not be able to empathize with me as turtles aren’t as fluffy and cuddly as most cats and dogs, but trust me when I say these turtles were my family. Everything happened so fast I am still in shock. 

I often take my turtles outside to bask in the sun, because after doing research and talking to my vet I’ve been informed that natural sunlight is one of the best things for them. Every other day or so I would put them outside and then take them back in after a half an hour or so. Every five minutes I would usually peek my head outside my window to check on them to make sure everything was alright if I wasn’t sitting out there with them.

I must of been too hot that day. I hope they did not suffer, and I hope the life I gave them was the best they could’ve ever gotten. I had had one of the turtles for about four years now, I got her when she was a baby. I am completely destroyed and am not sure how to handle this. I will miss waking up every morning to turn on their light and watch their cute little heads pop out of the water. My days were so focused on making sure they were happy and now I’m a mess.

I don’t have many friends, so in a way my animals are my form of social interaction. I always feel so happy caring for and being around them. I feel like a mother who has failed her babies and I hope they forgive me. I hope they are happy in heaven.

203,"Hi reddit, a little backstory.

My ex (F) and I (M) dated for about 3 months before we decided to breakup. At the very start, she (my ex/F) stated that she wanted to set a due date for our breakup before the relationship ever started. We both graduated this year and are both smart enough to choose the university that we liked and suited our majors best. Now, I am going to attend a neighbouring city of my hometown and my ex chose to attend a university on the other side of the country. She said this relationship would be a fun relationship, nothing serious and our breakup was because she didn’t want to do long distance. At the time I agreed, and during the relationship everything was great.

Fast forward to now, that due date we set had passed and we decided to breakup. On the day of the breakup, she was the one preaching a happy ending and also said she wanted us to stay close with the possibility of getting back together. I didn’t understand at the time but once I heard she was open to possibly getting back together, I sprung on the idea and kept going after her because she was the one that wanted to breakup in the first place, not me. I never wanted to breakup but I had agreed and this is what she wanted, so I wanted to honor that. 

Now update to yesterday, she texts and says she wants to have a serious talk. She then says she had her time to grieve about our breakup (only two weeks before today), and now she is over it and her feelings for me have faded. This happened so suddenly that I was shocked and speechless, because this was the last thing I wanted. At the time, I wanted to argue and try to get back with her, but she texted saying she doesn’t want to be in a relationship with me anymore. She had made it clear that she already made up her mind. I feel so lost and heartbroken, because it was like watching myself lose someone, and there was nothing I could do about it. I am full of emotions now and just want to cry, but can’t. Until then, how do I grieve over and deal with the loss of someone who is so special to me, but that person no longer feels the same? 

Tl;dr: My ex-girlfriend has broken up with me and now I am full of emotions but don’t know how to grieve, how should I go about my life now that this has happened so suddenly?",12Jul2019,1

206,"I was playing on my computer peacefully until my brother woke up and started yelling at me for ""hogging"" the PC and keeps asking to play. I told him that it was my turn since he played yesterday and I woke up first and all. Then while I was playing he snitched on me to my mom and my mom got mad at me for ""being the worst brother ever"" and tried to make a more strict schedule where there is 1 hour to play while alternating between me and my sibling while the rest of the hours were spend on sleeping, studying and daily chores. I didn't like it because she tried this method millions of times before and all it did was make my family more messed up. So I disagreed with it for the first time and she thought that I was trying to disrespect her so she started yelling at me about ""being a horrible kid where even a baby could do better"" so then I told her to try something else and she shot it down so that she could ""check with my dad"" on whether they should throw away the PC where my dad and mom have been begging to do so. I got mad at her and started yelling at her because she had also used that method before and I wasn't having it so I started saying stuff like ""schedule? No problem solved! Throwing away the PC? No problem solved! Talking with dad about it? NO PROBLEM SOLVED!"" And she started saying all I did was cause problems while my sibling was a angel and that she would do anything to make me more ""better"".  So I got mad and stomped to the room where the PC is and just sat on the floor until my brother walked in and I gave him a death glare and I first mocked him by saying in a baby voice ""YOU NEVER LET ME PLAY!!11! WAAA"" and then yelled at him normally ""SEE WHAT ""PROBLEMS"" WERE SOLVED!?!?!?"" And then he told me to fuck off so I grabbed his wrist and was about to hit him but I stopped myself and let him go where I sat down as he bolts out of the room and hear him stomping downstairs where my mom starts coming upstairs with my brother behind her as she is yelling ""how could you hit him! What is wrong with you!? Are you on drugs?!"" And then once she got upstairs she grabbed me by the arm and dragged me out of the room with the PC and closed the door and said that if I walk inside the PC would be thrown away so I opened the door and stood next to it in a way of refusing but then she grabbed me and pushed me into my room and as my brother walks in she said to stay in my room so she slams my bedroom door and now is in the room next to me and as I type this she is watching the bedroom door and my brother is messing around with my playstation3 CDs.

209,"TLDR; A puppy followed me home and will not leave. I didn't feed it, it drank out of my daughter's swimming pool as I was going to cover it. How can I make her leave?

&amp;#x200B;

Here recently, I have been walking my neighborhood for exercise. I live in the rural part of my town, and people just let their dogs run around, so i really just walk the 6 blocks behind my house because there's not really any over here that aggressive. There's one particular house that I walk by that has a full grown dog who's pretty friendly and she'll follow me for a while then go back home when I go to my house. Yesterday, there was a new puppy. Now, I live right off a highway and there's quite a bit of traffic that passes by consisting mostly of work trucks and 18 wheeler's. Before I went home, I knocked on the woman's home and informed her of this because not only was her dog following me, but now this puppy, and I was afraid of the puppy getting hit. I asked her if there was any way she could keep the dogs in her yard. She informs me that she found this dog on the side of the highway on a different side of town and it was covered in tics so she brought her home and cleaned her up. She then asks me if I want the dog. Now, I'm fixing to move into my mother's 2 towns over. My mother has 2 boxers and 2 cats. 1 of the boxers is very territorial and VERY aggressive. Plus, I don't really have the means to take in another dog seeing as I have a 10 year old shiatsu that belonged to my grandmother before she passed, and she asked me to take care of him. I tell her no, I really can't. I left, and the dogs still followed me. She kind of tried to call them, but they ignored her and she didn't really care. So I went home. They shortly left after.

Well, todayyyyyy, they follow me home again and the big dog leaves but the little one has been on my porch for the past 4 or 5 hours. I told her to leave (lol) and she got out of my screened in area but has not left my porch. What do I do!? I didn't feed her. She drank out of my daughters swimming pool as I was getting the tarp to cover it. How can I make her leave? Just ignore her?",12Jul2019,1
210,"So I noticed this dude who was in the gym very often, very talkative friendly guy. He frequented the same times as me so we often had casual conversation. Mind you, I'm entering college and this guy is in his mid twenties. Recently we had a conversation about meeting up potentially with another guy I knew from the gym who was around my age. Earlier this evening, I was recalling the interactions I've had with him and something seemed a little... off. I began to ponder some wild suspicions I was having and decided to settle it by simply looking his name up. Turns out, he has multiple charges of sexual misconduct/abuse against minors. Honestly, I'm not surprised these people exist in the world because of the Internet. It's a disappointing thing to happen and something I'd of course never expect, but unsurprising nonetheless. I will not be going back to that gym, I've blocked him on all social media and plan on changing my number, and beyond minor details picked up in conversation, he knows little about me. How should I proceed with reporting this? I should take it I need to report it to the gym and possibly to any authorities interested in such an event.",12Jul2019,1

212,"Hi reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

So this is my first post in this subreddit, so hi all. I tend to venture out of my normal communities from time to time, so you'll probably see me start popping up here more often :)

&amp;#x200B;

Onto my issue.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to start out by saying that I do love my mom,  despite our constant conflicts, and she makes a lot of bad decisions.

&amp;#x200B;

In 2016 my dad died, and my mom and I had been on our own. I was going to college later that year as a freshman, but the months leading up to that were incredibly difficult. At this time my mom had been trying to go back to school at the culinary arts program at a local community college. I begged her to pick something more viable, as we are not in a big city and culinary would not be useful here. At one point she was in business management but quit. She kept insisting she would move somewhere else soon after I went to college, and she ""wanted to work on cruise ships to see the world"". We also got into a lot of verbal arguments at home (it's my grandmother's house, by the way, she is 94 and had the misfortune of watching both of her children pass, but she still has me thankfully. the house legally is not hers)

Needless to say she just ended up quitting the program anyways. She kept making excuses about not being able to go to school and work, so she quit. At this point in time she tried some odd jobs here and there, and bar tending. 

  
Around this time, before university, my aunt and uncle bought me a laptop as a graduation gift, since growing up I only had my grandmother's old computer when we went to live with her, until my dad bought me a desktop (although the CPU died and I'm not super tech saavy and did not have the money nor funds to fix it). Anyways, my mother and I got into a pretty big fight once. I was talking to my friends about it (And I would rather not go into the details, as it was rather bad, and I don't think portrays her accurately outside this one instance). She kicked me out and told me to find a place to stay. I did and she got mad because I ""told my friends what was going on"" and she took my phone. I messaged my friends on facebook, not realizing the two were connected. She saw the messages and came to get my laptop. I was 18, and the laptop was a gift, so I said no. She ended up breaking the laptop. A few days after this happened she told me she would buy a new one for me since she broke mine. I noticed 900 dollars I had been saving for school from my father's SS money withdrawn from my account. She told me she needed 900 dollars to drive me to college. She spent about 700 of it on the laptop, and 150 on the rental car. To this day she insists she bought me the new laptop, and when I correct her she blames me for her breaking it. I had it for maybe two weeks, and nobody in my family knows this story except her and I.

&amp;#x200B;

Every summer I would come home from college, the first week or two would be nice, and then things would sour rapidly. Ever since my dad died, she's been selling more and more of his old stuff, some of which I would like to keep, and she knows this. For example, she sold a truck he had. She never asked me if I wanted it (I always told her to keep it anyways because it was in such good condition compared to the other car) and ended up selling it for less than half it's value. Now she likes to throw it in my face saying ""you could have taken the truck for school but you didn't want to"". After that's she's also started selling his old rifles that I kind of wanted. I'm not a super big gun guy, but I like the old stuff as they are historical relics, and I initially said okay because she needed the money. (At this point, a year or two later at the time of this incident, so 2018 or so, she had no steady work still).

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today (and past a lot of other mishaps she's had) and I have a job offer in Europe to teach English. I've never been to another country, and nobody in my family has been abroad since my grandparents went to Japan, but it wasn't exactly on good terms. Needless to say, I'm pretty excited, and all I have to do graduate this Fall. Right now I am working two jobs to save money for my last semester and the fees related to the job.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom hates this idea. She hates the idea of me leaving. Now that I think about it, she even hated the idea of me going to university. Back when my dad was alive they would actually argue about that a lot, because my dad and all of my parents' friends wanted me to go, but my mom did not. The same is true now, it's even more difficult living with her over the summer. After working for almost 60 hours a week in addition to taking my TEFL course, 2 college courses, and tutoring, she still complains I don't do anything around the house. If I get a day off and try to relax or see some friends, she yells at me for not doing work at home. I'm saving all my money for Europe, and I don't have many nice clothes to wear to work (which are not really necessary anyways) and she likes to make me feel bad about it every morning by talking about how awful I look. Today she decided she's going to sell some more of my dad's stuff, including a very nice Winchester rifle. Again, I asked her not to sell it, but she just became angry. She said she can buy another in the future, but I said that's not likely. Then she called me ungrateful and threatened to kick me out of her house, and then went on to say that she would have had ""so much more money if we had not wasted so much on your electronics as a kid"", which I felt kind of bad about because I never asked for much after I was young. I knew about our situation, and told them every year I did not want things for Christmas or my Birthday, but they got them anyways. She also likes to remind me that if she kicks me out, I'll have to pay rent somewhere and won't be able to afford my last semester and airline ticket.

&amp;#x200B;

 Oh, and now would be a good time to mention that she has lost two jobs in the past year, one of which she quit, and the other was not really her fault as the place was destroyed by flooding and she was laid off (although it was a terrible job and I told her it would be wise to start trying to find another anyways).

&amp;#x200B;

Almost done. She called me one day asking if it would be okay if I talked to my grandmother about putting half of our house in my mom's name instead of mine after she passes. Initially my grandmother was going to give me half of the house, and her other grandson the other half. My mom asked for my half, and I said it would be okay, since I know she needs a place to stay, and the house is now 7 decades old and I'd like to keep it in the family. She still accuses me of not doing anything for her and being ungrateful, and it's quite hurtful.

&amp;#x200B;

Last thing. I found out from some of her friends that she initially wanted to follow me to Europe. They told her it was a bad idea because it's supposed to be my experience teaching and seeing the world. Now she wants to move to Alaska, which I found out from the same friend. The reason why she's selling a bunch of my dad's old stuff again is because she wants to use that to fund her move to Alaska, and has even mentioned not getting a job yet because she ""wouldn't keep it after she moved"". I've tried explaining this is not practical, and she just gets angry with me. I don't even know why she wants this as she'll now own half of a house here, and since my grandmother is alive, she does not pay rent, and only pays half of the other bills, like utility.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do anymore. I've considered making her a much smaller part of my life after I get abroad, as constantly being stressed and belittled is not healthy. I know what i've mentioned here is only a fraction of what has happened. At the same time, I feel guilty for thinking this, and I want to help, but I have no idea how to make her listen, and her friends don't either. If you guys could tell me how you might handle this, or how you or someone you know handled a similar situation, I would really appreciate it, because I think I've exhausted all my options, and it worries me.

&amp;#x200B;

If you've made it this far, I really want to thank you for reading all this. I know it's a lot, but I wanted to demonstrate how long this issue has persisted. I know I'm leaving out quite a few incidents, as mentioning everything would make this take so, so much longer.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR my mother and I have a very rocky relationship that only gets worse, and she makes awful decisions and does not listen to anyone. I'm exhausted after dealing with it for so many years, but I also feel guilty for being exhausted about it. I don't want my mom to continue to play a huge role in my life if she keeps up this behavior, but I also don't want to abandon her when I leave to teach English.",12Jul2019,1
214,"I've recently started seeing someone that's 14(M) almost 15 and I'm 16. My friends do not approve due to the age gap, which I don't see as much of a problem. I know it'd be less of a problem with older couples, but is that age gap too wide considering we're still minors?",12Jul2019,2

216,"Hey everyone! So as the ""interesting title"" says I'm lost! 

Every since I was in 11th grade I decided I wanted to be a mortician! For the people who don't know what that is. It's a peson who prepares people who recently passed away for their funeral. They also plan the funeral and all that stuff.  I wanted to help the families and making something that is so sad and so hard to do less painful and simple. I wanted to help people at their low points and get them through it. With that I have heard all the jokes that go with the career. For example,"" well at least you won't go out of business,"" or ,""at least they won't talk back to you."" 

I was so passionate that I went as far as going to the school I would attend and going on a tour. I even did it as a research topic my senior year of high school! Considering I was the only one who found that interesting in a class with only girls, I was the weird one, but I didn't care because when you have a passion you go for it. 

I was 18 then and now I'm about to be 21. Now that I have grown older I matured I guess you could say. I mean I've changed a lot!  I'm not some little girl people once took me for. Unfortunately now though I lost all passion for mortuary. I still want to help people don't get me wrong. I might be an introvert and I'm not a people person. I just hate seeing someone sad though. I always go out of my way to put a smile on someone's face. Even if it's just a compliment or telling a joke. If they smile it makes my day! 

I tried to look into different options I don't want to be a nurse or a therapist. I just don't see myself doing it. I want to do something with my life. I want to do something that means something. I just don't want to be a mortician anymore. I doesn't help that my dad keeps pressing me to continue going to college for a career I'm no longer interested in. I'm really creative not drawing but I am creative! People usually say I'm easy to get along with. The good part is I am going to a community college to get my prerequisites for the mortuary school  so that's a plus I can change my career.

Sorry this is so long I ramble a lot lol! I guess the advice I'm looking for is what career should I go into? I briefly, like ever person thoughts about YouTube but lets be real, I'm an introvert who can talk on and on about the stupidest things. I also thought about being a writer, but autocorrect can only do so much! 

Anyway thanks for reading and thank you to anyone who can help. Fall semester is coming up next month and if I can change it before doing another awful business course that would be awesome!",12Jul2019,1

218,"I'm an ugly, lying, immature, manipulative, beta male with no real discernable or original positive traits. 

My massive inferiority complex has completely convinced that everyone I know is too good for me, even people who seem worse in comparison, so I purposely go out of my way to avoid confrontation and put up a fake mask to make it seem like I'm extroverted, when I'm just scared. 

I'm a liar, I'm probably the most fake person you know, It's so bad that I literally make lies for things I don't even need to lie about just because it's become a reflex, lying to people that I know I could be truthful with not worry about the consequences. 

Those things alone make me disgusted with myself and how I am as a human being, and yet I still have the audacity to try and be like real people and attempt to find friends and a companion, because I'm desperate to be someones support system, and to avoid isolation and loneliness. 

I'm pretty sure that if I dated or started a relationship with anyone in the state I've been in, their life would be tangibly worse by association simply because I would make my problems their problems, and manipulate them into thinking they have to help me, that they have to care about me and stay with me out of pressure. 

I don't know how to function being alone because I'm a insecure person who needs to be controlling of other people because I can't figure out how to deal with the complexity of people in a stable way, especially those who I know are in the same boat as me. 

I don't know how to properly Express my emotions and end up getting overly attached to people who stretch their hand to me and offer friendship, especially with female friends who I end up liking romantically and that usually ends up destroying said friendship with them, usually with me ceasing contact with them out of fear that I'll become obsessive, even though I haven't done anything wrong up until that point, it's my paranoia always controlling my actions. 

Deep down I hope that one of these people or someone in general will come and save me and correct everything that's wrong with me, but I know that's not how real life works, I have to be the person who puts the work in to fix myself.

And it's not that I can't do it, I don't wanna do it, because I'm too lazy, paranoid and scared that I'll put so much effort into myself and not get anything out of it because I've already failed, I have no confidence in anything I do or how anyone sees me, and I'll even go as far as to sabotage myself and whatever is left of my social life with self destructive behavior to prove to myself and everyone else that I'm as horrible as I think I am. 


I wanna lie to myself and say that it's just anxiety and depression that are clouding my outlook or that maybe it's mental instability that is forming this mindset, but deep down I know I'm just a shitty person with a shitty character, a disgusting neurotic mess who needs people to coddle him so he doesn't succumb to self destructive behavior and ruin his already ruined life. 

I feed on people who pity me and care about me to the point where they stress themselves and hurt themselves trying to fix me and make me a productive member of society, I keep doing it because if I drag them down with me they won't leave when they realize how unstable I am, then I go out of my way to contradict my actions by trying to convince them that I'm going to make their lives worse. 

I'm an emotional, mental, and genetic dead end. Someone who should commit suicide but doesn't have the balls to do it because they're afraid of dying, people like me don't have anything essential to offer anyone, people like me end up living and living, becoming more and more miserable and self loathing while they shit talk and harrass everyone else's lives around them like sub-human garbage. 


I deserve to ruin my own life with my self-destructive behavior, I'm a shitty excuse for an actual human being and the fact that anyone is even asscoiated with me is uncomfortable and unnerving, and I wish someone would take pity on me and convince me that  committing suicide was something that is viable and not something to be afraid of doing, because I wanna die, I've been feeling suicidal for awhile but I'm afraid, and I've been going out of my way to talk to certain people on discord, reddit, ect who are also suicidal and think suicide is the best option for me, hoping that It'll fix that fear, but no one who's emotionally or mentally stable would even attempt to deal with someone who has zero to no hope of ever being a normal, functioning person, and no one who has a shred of morality is going to help me end my own life even if I begged them to. 
 
Someone like me who has these parasitic and toxic behaviors is already a useless person, but someone like me who goes out of their way to harm people and drag them into my mess because of my own insecurities and self awareness of my own horrible character, shouldn't have the ability to interact with others. 

Yet here I am, complaining complaining about something I cannot nor will not fix, because my logic is flawed, and I am a flawed person. 

And I've reached a point where I just want to accept that about myself, but  I can't accept it and I'm just looking for some sort of answer or solution that'll snap me out of this disturbing cycle I desperately want to get out of. 


I'm an overdramatic person who doesn't know how to handle his overwhelming multitude of flaws, and I just can't do it anymore, I don't like living like this, I can't live like this. 

I feel like my decisions have caused irreversible damage to my life and me as a person, and I just want it to stop.",12Jul2019,1
219,"So, basically I’m in my mid-teens (F) and i’m honestly so confused and this is all i’ve been thinking about for the past month. 

When I was like 12, my friends all started developing crushes on guys and they would be obsessed with celebrities. They would always ask me who I liked, but I didn’t have any crushes so I would just say I don’t like anyone 🤷🏼‍♀️ and no one would believe me. I asked my mom why I didn’t feel anything towards guys and she just said that I hadn’t gone through puberty yet. 

Fast forward to now, everyone’s horny af and I’ve still never had a crush. I find some guys/girls “cute” but i’m not, like, romantically attracted to them. I’ve never had that “butterflies in your stomach” feeling or whatever before. 

I’ve hooked up with a few guys and I’ve had sex before but, honestly, it was mostly just to fit in and I was drunk and I’m pretty sure I didn’t feel anything.

But, the issue is that I WANT love, I want to feel what everyone else feels and I want the warm fuzzy feeling of love and the shit in the movies. I want someone who cares the most about me and I care the most about them, and I really don’t want to be lonely. But I just don’t FEEL anything towards people that I find cute or nice or whatever. 

I know asexual/aromantic people exist but I really don’t want to be asexual or aromantic. I don’t want to be lonely forever. I don’t know what to do about it honestly, is it possible that I’ll develop feelings for people later in life? 🙃",12Jul2019,1

I’m struggling big time with finances and had a lot of different family and personal issues that have left me in a tough spot. I need $1500 for rent by the end of this month (explaining this would take too long, but I know I made the right calls on a bunch of tough stuff).

I’m 22, live in LA and am willing to work extremely long and hard. I’ve applied to countless jobs and have barely heard back and only gotten a few in person and phone interviews that ended with “Thanks so much for coming in! Unfortunately we’re not hiring right now but we’ll let you know when a position opens up.”

I got a film degree and am trying to pursue a career in Hollywood and have thus far applied for work at nearly every major and minor Hollywood studio, production company and agency. The turn around on the recruiting process is abysmally slow so I need money now and fast.

What are fast ways to make this amount of money? What are jobs that I can take that hire really fast? What are quick gigs that I can get that pay the same day? What’s a job that’s always hiring that would immediately give me a job app if I walked in the door? I don’t care what industry it is in, as long as it pays, I’m interested.

223,"So my girlfriend has had it rough. Her mom had to escape an abusive ex husband with her daughter, my girlfriend Stacy, and therefore hasn't been on good economical terms really ever. She married a new guy and had two girls and maybe that would have solved it but no. This guy is a dick, totally manipulative and a complete man child. Can't hold a job, bounces hobbies, smokes, and is just emotionally abusive to all three of his daughters, including Stacy. 

Now that Stacy is 18 and preparing to go to college, her parents are getting even worse. Stacy spends a lot of time with me as she seems to like me 😂 and getting out of her house is the only way she can escape her parents. They're super critical, insulting, and rather stupid parents. The kind that get mad at her for spending time with her boyfriend instead of them, like that's going to make her want to spend time with them... Whatever.

However, now it's gotten to a point where I feel I need to get advice and step in at least to help her. Her parents are now leveraging her college finances and support against every decision she makes. Whenever she wants to go out and do something that's not with them, they get angry and threaten to not pay for her college. 

Now, I'm highly recommending that she not do college for a year or two, get a job, and become financially independent. That's what I believe is the best way for her to live on her own, push her parents out of control, and live a healthy life. Is that wrong? Is there a better way of handling this situation? What do i do? Is it even legal to threaten to not pay for college for your child?

I went to a therapist and she said to be very honest, I’m beautiful, smart, sweet, but I need to lose weight. I’m 5’8 and 250. She thinks it’s because of my weight that I have a hard time. I’ve been on a diet but I’ve been very depressed. Any words of hope for me?",12Jul2019,5

Last year, I was  suspended from college because I was caught cheating in one of my final examinations.  I took full responsibility for my mistake.
 It honestly was one of my lowest moments in life.  My whole life came under a question mark after that.
Fortunately I am now back to my studies and I have been doing pretty good so far.
However I am worried that it might have a negative impact on my graduate school admission. 
How was your experience and how did you manage to get through it?
Thank you so much.",12Jul2019,1
232,"To all that read this be prepared for tons of background story lol, but anyways I know some would think I’m pretty mature at this point to not care about my parents fighting, but the intensity and frequency of their fighting is ridiculous and I can’t focus on anything (currently about to apply college and taking college summer classes). 
Anyways, my mom has been going on and on about how she KNOWS my dad has been cheating on her with a woman at his workplace. Obviously it’s possible that my dad has cheated, but he has absolutely never had those thoughts, I know him and have always seen him as a kind and righteous man whose sacrificed so much of his happiness for the well-being of our family.  But basically my mom is a stay at home mom and I think she’s always had some self esteem issues so that why she gets really paranoid and angry, especially towards my dad. It also doesn’t help that she’s stressed about my twin sister and I applying for college this fall. These days she’ll fight and scream with my dad to admit to his wrongs right after his long day at work and he’ll always reply, almost in tears at the pure amount of accusations my mom keeps giving him. She’s really good at verbal fights and my dads pretty much just listening for 4+ hours a day of utter madness. He’s tried to explain to her but she just won’t listen and is convinced that he has an affair. My mom will wake him up at 1 am in the morning and fight with him till 4 am even on weekdays where he has to go to work in a couple of hours. I love them both so much and they’ve been looking for therapists for weeks now but have never acted on it since they don’t believe in it. 
Honestly I’m just done with the pure paranoidness and delusions that my mom has cooked up in her head. She won’t listen to reason and she only knows how to vent her anger without considering the other side. She’ll tell my sister and I, “wait for it, I’m gonna make your dad tell you all about his affair” in a malicious way and I’m saddened that she’s gone to this point. She’s even started to suspect everything he does even if he goes to the bathroom for like five minutes. 
Sorry reddit I just needed to rant and get it off of my chest. :/ God I can’t wait till I’m gonna move out when I graduate HS. I’m just worried about their physical and mental health, what should I do? I don’t want them to be unhappy and I think my dad might just explode from these accusations, I feel so bad for them both. Should I tell them to see therapists or? Thanks y’all wish me luck cuz I have a physics exam tomorrow bahaha..",12Jul2019,1
233,"My friend was dating this girl for about 2 months and broke up recently. I have known both of them for a long time. 
I was out drinking with my friend and he decided to leave early. His ex came later and we were talking for a bit and she started to get flirty. 
By this time it was late and we all had a lot to drink. The few people we knew that were left, all of a sudden we’re gone and it was just me and her. 

We went back to her car and had sex, then I left. 

I woke up the next morning feeling absolutely dreadful and ashamed and it won’t leave my mind. It’s driving me insane. Can’t believe I would do something like that!

234,"I'm a 23 year old male and made the mistake of finishing inside a girl I was seeing for about a week. I was going through a mentally difficult time period and she told me that she tracked her ovulation saying it was safe for me to finish inside her. Being in a very mentally unstable state and me being very stupid, I did what she asked and it was only after then that I realized I made a a huge mistake.

She did not respond to my texts for about a week and when I finally met up with her, she said that she was not pregnant. She is currently 4 days late and refuses to take a pregnancy test. She may be in denial or very ignorant but she strongly believes that she is not pregnant.

I am currently unemployed living off my student loans trying to finish up post secondary to find a full time job. I live in Ontario, Canada and abortion clinics do exist that is covered by our Ontario Health Care. She also believes in pro-choice but the issue as of now is that she does not want to believe that she could be pregnant. I was wondering if there is anything I can do to protect myself or if there is something I can do to get her to cooperate with me.

235,"Hello,  
7 years ago I was introduced to my current boss by his father who I'm still good friend with (so i think). My boss is one year older than me and better educated and can be very clever. I have also learned he can be very manipulative and spiteful. Straight to the point I know I need to find better employment. After 7 years I only make $9 an hour and I run his business. I have no health benefits, no retirement, no sick days, no vacation days. I get treated pretty poorly at times, and he is never wrong, even if a text or email say otherwise. He forgets or recreates conversations to make himself right and has thrown me under the bus a few times to save his own skin. I'm just so defeated. As I write this I don't know what kind of information anyone reading this would need to give me the spark to pull away. Some of my friends have worked there and all have quit. They are all rooting for me to get out of there. I did leave once, I gave a one month notice to train a replacement. After a month my boss ended up in the hospital ICU for a week due to the work load. His father asked me to come back to keep his business running and they made a bunch of promises. Only one that stuck was making me a W2 employee. It has been 2 years since then. Right now in the business it is just me and him. Our third employee leaves at the end of the month and the current workload is big enough for 4. I have so much guilt attached to the idea of leaving. I know his business would take a fatal blow, I'm good friends with his family (wife, daughter who is 7 and his parents). A lot of our customers only trust me and refuse to work directly with him, and I know from watching previous employees leave (including myself) he can become very passive aggressive and spiteful during their last weeks working. I know he would not give me a good recommendation if I used him as a reference for my next job.  He has sabotaged past employees, interns, and Work Experience Kids because he didn't like them. When possible employers called him he would make them sound horrible and gloat how they should have never left him.  

For the first half of my time there i wasn't even making minimum wadge. I was given a ""non-taxable grant"" as payment that covered things legally. I stayed because the job is something I have always wanted to do. I did graphic design, help small businesses get branded and get off the ground and we do work experience for at risk kids. A lot of these things have been twisted in ways over the years that make me embarrassed to be there.  The kids went from being an opportunity for them to excel to my boss using them as free labor. He stopped training them and the last few he has painting parking lines and cleaning windows. If the kids started to fall behind or needed mentoring he just got rid of them. If a new company came in and he didn't think they would be profitable he would lead them on with empty promises then just never call them back. He has been replacing our equipment and supplies with cheaper stuff and raising prices. He says we barely have money for payroll, but he comes in boasting about 400 buck cowboy boots, 300 dollar hand guns, and other expensive luxuries monthly while I work unpaid through my lunch to save money. I mean I get it that he pays himself, I just don't believe things are as bad as he says. I don't know if I should hold that against him or not. The dark part of me is mad. His wife makes 6 figures in the school system, his father is wealthy and when he passes my boss will be getting a large inheritance that will become his retirement. So should I even care if I walk away and his business fails? He will be fine one way or another. But I am a moron. 

I should probably go into why I quit the first time. We had gotten a logo request from a potentially huge client. At the time the office had 6 employees (2 for Web, 3 production/design, boss). I was tasked to do create and apply a car wrap on  a 20 ft RV (not my idea, I said no, boss said yes because $) so I handed the logo project to my assistant. She emailed back and forth with the client and got some ideas and got to work. As I was working on the RV my boss made a big deal about having multiple logos for the client to choose from so I started making a few when I could. While I was out doing part of the application my boss informed the office we were past the due date to send the logos for proofing. At the time all projects were kept track of digitally in a shared calendar. He had created the original project and left the due date empty. My assistant on the project had even asked the client if they had a due date and they responded by the end of the following month. He put the office into chaos because he didn't communicate and didn't want to listen. My assistant send the 3 logos she had worked on as my boss asked. He later asked to see the logos after the fact and became irate saying they looked amateurish and lacked creativity. That she and the web team were never allowed to send anything to a client again without him seeing it first. He was also upset we only sent 3 so he made 4 more. His 4 were made from copyrighted clip art so if the client chose his the company would be in big trouble. When I got back to the office I was unaware of what happened and sent in my 3 logos to the client and went along my day. The next day I hear everything that went down and my heart breaks for my assistant and the rest of the team. My assistant gets the amazing news that out of all the logos the client got they loved hers and in the emailed said they loved it and it captured everything they asked for as well as it being delivered early. My boss got pissed again and instead of congratulating her or apologizing he tells the team if it wasn't for him adding his we would have lost the client. The next day out of anger and disgust I gave him my notice. I lied and said I had a job lined up when I didn't. I didn't want to be there any more. I hated just stepping into that office. My assistant said she had enough vindication with the clients email and a portfolio piece for a major company. She would become my replacement when I left.

 I came back after that because I truly thought he had changed. He had a near death experience, his digestive system failed due to stress/a cold/over working and was hospitalized for 2 weeks before his father called me to ask for help. he didn't come back to work for almost 2 months. I had taken over most of his business for him and had the place running ok. But over the course of a year everything went back to how it was and employees left and never came. Now it's just me and him. I'm 40 years old. I'm not in great health. I figured if I find a ""real"" job at this age I may have a chance at an ok retirement with a small 4o1k or something if I stay at the job for 20 to 25 years. I know I need to do it. I have a few friends offering me possible jobs. But I don't want to repeat what I did before. I don't want to quit with nothing solid lined up, but if I apply and get a job now I won't have enough time to train a proper replacement. This has me so torn and depressed. I don't know why I have such loyalty to him. 

If you made it this far thank you for listening to me vent and incoherently ramble in the middle of the night.   
If I need to give any more information please let me know.   
Have a good night.",12Jul2019,1

237,"Hey there, I’m currently in a real tough spot right now about school band. You see I have been doing band for three years at my previous school and near the end before summer we were encouraged to attend an event for those who wanted to join, if we could not come to the event then we could send an email to address it and get the details from the event. I did not go because I anticipated that my parents did not have time to take me to it so I sent the email to the director of the band. A month later a friend of mine who attended the meeting told me of practices scheduled over the summer for those who wanted to join, I freaked out and told my mom about it, after that I found out that my dad received the information shortly after the event. This included a calendar with important events and summer practices, advice from the director and medical clearance forms which were due on the day of the first practice, which I missed. I has been a little more than a week since that and I had been getting extremely nervous and worrisome over it, I then told my mom I simply did not want to do band anymore, she then understood and instructed me to send the director an email despite me asking her to please send one on my behalf since I was so worried. I made some grammatical and formatting errors in the email which my mother saw today after she asked whether or not I sent it and she called me dumb and told me to no longer ask her about this.

254,"So to shorten and sum things up, I've been talking to this girl for about a month + now.. things were perfect at the start and I caught myself really catching feels for her. We went on several dates (they were all great) and were with each other a ton. Then things started getting iffy.

The University I go to is in a town with a nearby Community College. A lot of people lie about going to the University when they really go to the community college (the stereotype is that the people that go to this said community college are stupid and couldn't get into the University so thats why they go there). I started to become suspicious that she actually went to the community college and not the University. I brought up my suspicions to which she denied them and said that she did, in fact, go to the University. I told her that even if she did go to the CC, I wouldn't care because I went there at one point as well. A week or so later, I looked her name up in the school directory and it wasn't there. I also had a friend look her name up using the school system (he works on campus) and he couldn't find it either. I brought this up with her and she kept saying how weird it was and it must be some kind of glitch. Finally after a month of carrying the lie along, she finally confessed to it and said she lied about it because she had been made fun of by her ex for going to the CC. I'm still confused as to why she carried this lie on (and made up other lies around it) for weeks for no reason.

I also have reasons to believe she lied about other things that we talked about (Huge interest in bodybuilding and competing in the future; she has a good body and claims she competed in bodybuilding during high school, however her body isn't necessarily bodybuilding good). I also believe shes lied about a few other small details. She also extremely insecure, her voice shakes when she talks to me sometimes and she has a tendency to interrupt me and pay no attention to what I'm talking about. If I try and have a conversation with her or tell her about anything, she'll usually tell me how ""she already knows about it"" , etc.

Is there a possibility that she's a compulsive liar? Should I run now and run far away?

Lately found her on Instagram and started talking to her.
Found a few similar interests to talk but then the convo ends pretty much soon many times. One day she was really talkative I mean like a lot . She would tell me personal stuff about family and all and about her past and I felt a connection is being made. And the next day she would act all different. ""Hmmmm, okkk"" all one word replies. 
Once she said her friend told her mum about me and now her mum constantly asks about ""that guy"" like show me his pic etc , basically taunts her.
Fast forward to yesterday we were having a long convo and it suddenly took a.sexual turn like she was talking about things about porn and stuff and what things turned her on. I thought she was giving some sort of hint so I went further in her convo but then she changed the topic and suddenly back on her one liner replies.I felt weird as I don't know which territory am I stepping into. I don't want to sound too desperate nor I want her to think I'm not taking interest.
Like there are seriously so many guys in her DM she tells me that she doesn't even bother to reply to but somehow Im having a convo with her each day. She says she's tired of any relationship and Im cool with it.
I just don't want to sound needy or clingy .90% of the time It's just me texting her first, sharing memes .
 Just suggestions or things that I should do to make her think about me or anything that will make her text me herself more. Should I text her less and act all tough sorts?

258,"Hi everyone! I hope you're enjoying your day. I'd appreciate if you took the time out of your day to read my story.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways...I just wanted to know if any of you ever feel the same as I have been lately. But first I'll start with a brief backstory

&amp;#x200B;

About a year ago I had this best friend and we would text every single day for hours. And by every single day I mean we would literally not go a day without texting each other. Each day we would text each other from the time we got home until we had to go to bed.  We were happy and I loved life. It never mattered what we talked about because I loved talking to him. We knew everything about each other and just understood each other. Sadly we had a falling out and rarely talk anymore. I doubt that we could become best friends again after that falling out.

&amp;#x200B;

Lately I mostly hang around a tight group of people and rarely ever talk to anyone outside of that group. In fact, the past couple of weeks I haven't really been talking to anyone. I'm a pretty introverted person so often times I find it easier to just message someone rather than to talk to them over the phone because then I have time to think over what I want to say. But this group of friends, they all like video chatting and that's not my thing as I've said. So most days I end up just minding my own business and only contacting people every so often. I don't remember the last time I had a long texting conversation with someone...

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I enjoy the time to myself, but other days I miss when I could just shoot my best friend a text and end up chatting for hours. I'm not sure if what I miss is my best friend or just a best friend in general, but I've really gotten into a slump. I find myself recalling memories with him, reading over old messages, and just the happy feeling I got when I would talk to him. I get sad when I think about what I miss about him, nostalgic when I remember all the good times we had, but at the same time I remember the reason why we aren't friends anymore and that just puts me in a funk.

262,"This is something that I haven't talked to anyone and left me some trauma that is affecting my desire to move on with new relationships so I am seeking your advice.

I got married with my first girlfriend and the first and only woman I been with so far. We dated for two years and she got pregnant, I already had plans to marry her but due the pregnancy we wanted to get marry sooner.

After the the birth of our son our sex life was terrible, there were times were we spent months without having sex up to three months was the longest period and it only got worse with time. She was mostly never in the mood and only had sex when she wanted. This got me very frustrated and at times I got pushy to be with her but never forced myself on her or at least that's what I thought.

Our marriage got worse and worse and in a heated discussion she told me that I raped her once, she said I was very pushy and only let me do my stuff so I would stop bothering her. This really fucked me up because I think she is right. 

I don't know if it's because I am man and pretty much always was horny, sometimes I would woke up in the middle of the night with her doing me oral or touching me and I was perfectly ok with it. This didn't happen often but when it did I was more than happy. I don't think there was any time that I said no to her but the other way around happened very often. Also I want to mention that before the birth of our son we had a really active sex life maybe not daily but three or four times a week and before getting married it was almost daily.

We ended up getting divorced after two years.

But this experience is not letting me move on, I have turned down woman that I was really into because I keep thinking that I am a rapist and don't know how to treat woman. Maybe I never learned how to satisfy her and that why she lost interest in sex? I dont know, we had bad communication I guess.

I haven't been with a woman since my ex and I am afraid I won't be able to have a healthy relationship",12Jul2019,0

270,"I’ve known my friend Matthew for a really long time (since high school), and we’re both 25 years old. It’s been kind of a running joke between us that I’m “probably into some really fucked up shit” because I never usually partake in guy conversations about regular porn, or engage in locker room talk. I usually just laugh, shrug it off, and change the subject.

Today Matthew was visiting my apartment, and I left the room for a minute. Matthew opened my iCloud folder and discovered my furry porn folder (which is fucking huge). I’ve been amassing images on there for years, because there’s definitely no shortage of high quality art in the community.

I come back, and he says, “I didn’t know you were into that shit...” and he has a big uncomfortable frown on his face. I’m mortified, but I try to save face by clicking off the folder and saying, “Wow, you weren’t supposed to see that haha!” and I quickly change the topic. 

We play videogames for about 20 minutes or so, and Matthew is being really quiet. He asks me if I want to talk about it, and I’m like, “Talk about what?” and he knows that I know what he meant. So I just straight up tell him that I don’t want to talk about it.

I drove him back to his house later, and he wasn’t really looking me in the eyes at all while I was trying to make conversation with him. I could tell he was really weirded out by what he saw, and the sheer quantity of it. He probably assumed I wasn’t actually into any “fucked up shit”, and he was shocked that it was actually true.

I have no clue what to say to him, and I don’t want things to be weird between us. I guess he doesn’t like furries, which is understandable because of how terribly they’ve been portrayed online and irl, so he’s probably upset that he’s been friends with one this whole time. Am I supposed to say sorry? It’s not my fault I’m into that.

I'm 18 years old and i'm beginning to slowly turn into my narcissistic dad and don't know what to do . For my entire life my dads been a straight up narcissist all the way from taking advantage of people with no remorse, he’s cheated on my mom multiple times, he gaslights all of us every chance he gets and is extremely manipulative . He has all the characteristics a narcissistic person has ( according to what I’ve read online). 


With all of that being said I also think it’s important to know that my mom is the exact polar opposite of my dad and is a super caring person . Every time she’s been cheated on she try’s to understand my dad and then blames herself . She’s always tried her best to raise me and my brother to be the opposite of him and not fall victim to becoming a product of our environment.


As for me, growing up I basically had all of my mom’s 
characteristics and had a huge heart caring for others more than myself . As time went on I’ve been picking up tendencies I see in my dad and now it’s come to the point where I’m almost him. I don’t care about anyone but myself, I’m extremely manipulative, I’m very good at hiding all of my toxic tendencies, I’ve manipulated people without any remorse, cheated on girls, I mean anything you can name I’ve probably done it . Before I get murdered, please understand that I know what I am and I’m being honest because I don’t want to be this way . 


As of now I just don’t feel any empathy for anyone other than super close family, everyone else I look at it it’s always how can I benefit off this person . The only thing that’s making me not want to be this way is the love that I have for my mom because I know she’d be extremely disappointed if she knew any of this . I can’t talk to any therapist or anything like that because I lack the resources and I just don’t want to live this way anymore, I want to be able to have meaningful relationships without thinking people are just stepping stools that I can benefit off of . I see all of these tendencies but it just feels like I can’t change no matter how hard I try as if it’s just in my nature to be this way . I’m beginning to hate who I am and wonder if just being 100% isolated would do the world more of a favor .

273,"Hello, so as u read the title they have been talking shit for a while now. It really does upsets me sometimes but yesterday it made me angry as fuck and upset  for my dad in the same time. So it all started when the car's engine fucked up and its better to sell it for 3k or 2,5k than pay 2k for repair. My aunt and dad argued on the phone.y aunt and grandparents started talking about my family that we didnt have any money and my dad was the only keeping us alive (i learned this a few weeks ago since everything is being hidden from me) which is true but still did make me upset a bit. They were all talking about my dad buying the car which is a Volkswagen Passat B5.5 with a V5 engine. They were saying who even buys a car with a salon from leather. My grandma called the car garbage which made me fucking angry and i said no it's not and she repeated it again and this time i said again that ITS NOT but in a higher tone and my aunt asked my grandma why she gotta join in stuff she doesnt even understand. They were also promoting themselves like the saviors of the family, the only ones giving us money and stuff. They were talking also about how selfish my other grandpa is for not giving us his other car (he had 2 and it kinda is true because when my mum was pregnant with my sister he wanted to come back to his apartment which we are living in. I wouldn't say a word to him if he kicks us outta it when we have already put my sisters bed and her stuff in). My aunt yelled at me for nothing saying ""WE ARE THE ONLY ONES HELPING U AND THE ONLY ONE WHO'S KEEPING UR FAMILY ALIVE IS YOUR DAD"". I cant remember everything they said but i remember at the end of their argument my grandpa said ""they borrowed some money 5 years ago why are they still paying it"" and my aunt said in a high tone ""WHAT THAT'S NOT TRUE, STOP TALKING BULL SHIT"".

We are military brats and are only a year apart, so my whole life she has been one of my only constants. We actually go to the same college and even share an apartment together, and I love her so much. She can be funny, kind, and the most genuine person you will ever meet; until she doesn't get her way.

For example, for my mom's birthday I picked up a card for her to give our mom because she is interning and didn't think to grab one. I asked to be paid back, thinking that she would do it no problems, but instead she screamed at me. I understand that was kinda a dick move now, like giving someone starbucks and saying ""ok that will be 4.50."" But the way she yelled at me...my hands were shaking, I cried profusely, and she didn't let me get a word in edgewise. I asked why she felt the need to yell at me and make me feel like garbage, and she said ""I don't care if you feel like that, because right now that's the kind of person you are"". I cried and cried and cried. She tells me to ""be quiet"" and ""shut up"" all the time, and if I ask her to do anything, in her eyes, it's ok to be mad because she doesn't want to do it. Even my friends have come to me privately asking why she is so mean and doesn't want to help out...

I need to stand up for myself more, and I've been better about it as of late, but I don't want to snap back. My mom has commented that I am being snipper and more short. I won't let her take away my kindness to others. She's my sister and I love her, but I don't need to let her change me.

I hope no one misunderstands and thinks shes abusive or a bad person, cause she's not. We all have flaws and I just want to learn how to stand up for myself, not just for me, but to show her that she can't treat anyone like this.",12Jul2019,1

280,"I have struggled with anxiety and depression since I was in high school, but now being 22 and having gone through therapy, I feel as though I have things under control.

On Tuesday, I visited a new doctor for an annual physical. After going through the normal steps, we got on the topic of mental health. I’m not shy about my past struggles and spoke to her about it. She left the room and came back with two questionnaires that she instructed me to fill out. 

These questionnaires were incredibly broad and had instructions like “has there been a time/period you’ve felt...(yourself being too talkative, getting easily distracted while watching tv, etc.).” The doctor then came back and blurted out “You have bipolar type 2 disorder, and I’ve prescribed you non-habit forming mood stabilizers that you can pick up at the pharmacy today. I’d like to see you again in 6 weeks.” 

I couldn’t believe it. Not only had I just met her that day, but she didn’t take the time to ask me more in depth questions, or refer me to a psychiatrist. I’m also fairly certain I am not bipolar. Although I know general medicine doctors have the ability to diagnose and prescribe for mental illness, I do not believe those two questionnaires and our short conversation led her to properly determine I’m bipolar.

286,"This may be a bit of a rant, but I really NEED some help because I feel like I’m losing my damn mind here. I truly appreciate whoever can take the time out of their day to read this to the end and offer even a small piece of advice. 

Ever since I bought myself a phone (yes, with my own money), my mom has felt the need to be overly controlling with is by installing a total of 5 separate location tracking apps, 2 app blockers, and recently, took away the privacy/incognito searching option on my web browser and I now have to “request” to download apps. I understand that as a minor, she has the right to control that sort of stuff, especially since she provides for me financially (which I do appreciate) but I feel like it’s just out of control. 

I’d understand if i were more of a problem child but I legit go out of my way to prove otherwise, in hopes of her realizing how much of an idiot she is. I ended last school year with a 4.0+ GPA (due to taking all AP/advanced courses), maintained a job paying $15 per hour while working 11+ hours per week (hey, I know it doesn’t sound like a lot but that’s on top of school) and let her take 15% of my salary, wash/dry/put away dishes every other time we eat, put away everyone’s laundry weekly, wash/vacuum her car weekly, hardly ever complain about the piano lessons she’s forced me to take for 10 years, keep my room exceptionally clean, walk my dogs 2 times per day, etc etc etc, and of course, have NEVER done drugs or got caught doing anything even remotely bad.

With that being said, she’s constantly blocking my apps for no reason. Anything she considers “talking back” (basically not agreeing to do whatever she asks immediately) is an hour of disabled apps. And because of her location tracking apps, if she somehow thinks I’m “ditching” which I know I’ve never got caught doing, she’ll block my apps in the middle of school and make me send a picture of myself (apparently texting in class is fine, if it’s for her) which is pretty embarrassing. Or if I walk my dogs on a new route, she’ll disable my apps because “they poop better on the other one.” ?!? THEY CAN TAKE A SHIT WHEREVER THEY WANT. IT DOES NOT MATTER. The app blockers are scheduled to automatically disable my apps around 9:30 pm until 7:00 am every day which I think is absolutely ridiculous because as a student busy during the day with AP classes and just as a damn teenager, I’m not sleeping at 9:30pm. My school doesn’t even start until ~7:20am so I basically can’t do anything until I’m already at school. Every time my apps are taken down, I have to MANUALLY reset ALL of my notifications and log back into my accounts, and believe me, that gets old real quick. She also has the same time settings and restrictions on the laptop that I PAID FOR, to where I need to physically bring her my laptop every time I need to download something or check out a “non-educational website” for her to input a password she changes weekly. And if she’s not home, then that’s tough and I need to WAIT on her for what usually takes hours. 

Now as I said, she recently took away the private tab / incognito searching option on my web browser and I now have to “request” to download apps SOLELY BECAUSE OF MY DUMB ASS SISTER (16 F). Apparently she downloaded some dating app, which I don’t think should be that big of a deal since she’s always allowed HER to date (but obviously not me since she’d never let me see the guy I was interested in because he was black, even though she and I are BOTH PEOPLE OF COLOR but that’s a whole different story). Now, my sister’s app restriction bed time (10:30pm) was always whole HOUR later than mine (9:30pm), despite not taking a single accelerated course and generally having an awful attitude, because she’s olderrr and I can’t complain because we’re different people. Okay, whatever, sure. But now that SHE decided do something stupid I GET PUNISHED TOO??? WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK?? WHAT HAPPENED TO US BEING DIFFERENT PEOPLE?? And whenever I ask for the SIMPLE FUCKING REASON as to WHY, she says “because I said so” like a broken record with the smuggest looking face that makes me want to shove her down the damn stairs. Even after all of this, she wonders why I don’t spend more time with her.

Oh my god, I know I sound like a privileged piece of shit complaining about my phone/laptop when I have a roof over my head and food on the table but I’m constantly on the verge of a mental breakdown due to this and I’ve become so irritable around my friends and people in general.

She said she had feelings for me at the beginning of sophomore year but I had to turn her down. Partly because I was new to dating and I wasn’t ready for a relationship. Well then she started dating this older kid for over a year, and they just recently broke up. I’ve never felt this way about someone before but I fear she doesn’t feel the same way. We used to be such great friends but we really aren’t anymore, and therefore I think she doesnt like me back. I’m certain that she knows I like her, but I don’t know if she feels the same way. My question is basically what do I tell her?",12Jul2019,1
289," I slept with one of my best friend's boyfriend's friends. Now, every time I see him he makes things awkward, he cant look me in the eyes, and over all makes the whole room tense. I was at a party with him and everyone there. He was acting fine, a little awkward but over all okay. Until I gave his brother a hug. After that he was talking to this girl very loudly and asking her on a date, dancing with her etc. It was obvious he was doing it on purpose and i later found out from my friend's boyfriend that he was doing it on purpose. He made a comment in front of my friend, another person and me about the relations we had. I confronted him after and he said okay but then we kissed. I KNOW IM A FUCKING IDIOT. I know that hes an asshole but I dont know what was his problem. why was he trying to make me jealous? Make me angry? Because all it did was make me feel like \*\*\*\* about myself. So then I got really drunk and had sex with his bestfriend lol. I'm feeling nasty and guilty for doing it. I feel sad and mad for the way he acted.",12Jul2019,1

298,"My parents have an awful marriage. Overall, my mom spoils my 8 year old sibling and doesn’t approach her in a parenting manner and continues to baby her e.g my sibling still sleeps with my mom because she hasn’t taught her to sleep by herself. Whereas, my father, in many cases tried to get my sibling to sleep in her own room, but because my mother asks her to sleep with her, she continues to do so. (Father sleeps in another room, not with my mother). This is just one example of the things the annoys my father (there are many many more incidents). And my mother, when approached about these issues by my father, does not listen, gets offended, and then starts blaming my father that is anger caused this problem - my father used to have a very serious anger problem but now he has changed dramatically. In conclusion, my mother doesn’t change her behaviour.  

They recently got into a fight, whereby, my father sat me down and told me that he’s giving up on us since my mother doesn’t change and that he gets blamed for his anger, however, his anger now is as normal as any fathers anger e.g if we disobey him he’ll obviously get anger and tell us more, but never anything more. But my mom keeps holding on to how he previously used to act. 

Im 19 btw, still living with my parents and currently they are my financial source (where i live, thats the culture, please put judgement aside). My father told me that, he will no longer interfere with my life e.g he doesn’t want to know where i go, he won’t invite me anywhere, buy me anything - meaning I’ll have to buy everything, food and all by myself. It feels as if he doesn’t want to know what’s happening in my life and i live under his house. This goes with my mom and ofc my sister. All because he knows he’ll get “angry” or disagree with how my mother (and now me) lives our life. 

He told me that because my mother doesn’t live up to parenting expectations, i now must take responsibility for my sibling. I must take her things that a mother is supposed to teach a daughter, i must make sure my sister is studying when I’am full time university student. i must make sure my sister is eating well (since my mother doesn’t make sure that my sister eats, she just places the food in front and hopes that she’ll eat.) 

This is just way too much responsibility for me, like i have no idea how I’ll manage a part time work, University and now basically looking after my sister? As well as, my own father not caring for me as much as he did before. 

My mother is completely inapproachable, she will not listen to feedback, will get offended, she doesn’t understand when someone provides critique.

304,"At 20 years old my sister told me that she was pregnant and would be getting an abortion. At that time I had thought I was pro choice but her decision brought feelings I didn’t know I had. We had grown up in an extremely religious borderline cult like family. I had rebelled against my upbringing since I was 16, and thought that women should have the right to choose. So my sister went to me in believing that I would not tell anyone. She was still living with my family at the time and she wanted her secret kept from them. I fought a battle within myself on whether or not to tell my family. I told my other sister first. We were both shocked by my sisters decision. We had attended many anti-abortion marches through our church. We had concerns her boyfriend was manipulating her into aborting the baby as we didn’t really know him. She had found out she was pregnant three days prior to her abortion appointment and we just wanted her to slow down, She had time and didn’t need to rush a huge decision. I didn’t know what to do. I was angry that she could make a decision like that and keep on like nothing happened. I didn’t know where I stood anymore. I was young, and I was scared so I went to my parents.

I have regretted it every day since. 

I regret having to make her feel like she was cornered in and not allowed to make a decision for herself. I regret having to put her through a harsh pregnancy. I regret that she had to go through the adoption process. I regret her having to become bonded to her daughter, falling in love only to give her away to a couple she promised her to. I regret that the adoption did not go as planned and that she will never know her. I regret that she has to wake up feeling empty every day and full of self loath. I regret that I betrayed the trust she stowed in me. I regret that I haven’t had the courage to speak these words to her directly. She is still filled with so much public resentment towards me, that I feel all I would do is cause more damage if I told her. She needs to tell the world her story. She needs love and support more than anything. I was wrong to have placed my feelings in her decision. It did not matter where I stood, especially when I was so confused and did not even know where that was. 


It’s been three years since my sister’s daughter was born. Only a few people know my regrets. Hundreds know her story. If I could say anything to the world I would say this:

I intervened in my sisters decision and I was wrong. I let my personal feelings get in the way of a decision that wasn’t mine to make. My sister has to live with that pain for the rest of her life. Don’t get me wrong, she loves her daughter deeply from afar. But she wasn’t meant to be a mother for that child. I understand this now. I deeply wish I would have sooner. Please do not make the same mistake I did. Her body her choice. Her life her choice. Adoption isn’t a better option. It isn’t some gift to be given. It’s an extremely painful process and should not be viewed as a solution. We need to do better than this.

 “I” might have “saved” a baby, but I lost my sister. And my sister lost herself. 

I could provide a hundred reasons for why I did what I did. Reasons are not excuses to place your feelings on someone’s decisions. Instead of responding to her with anger and shock, I should have filled her with a place of love and support. Perhaps she would have made the decision to go through with it, perhaps she would have made a different decision. But at the end of the day, it wasn’t my place. I should have never broken your trust. I think about this almost daily. 

Three years later, this is my truth. Perhaps no one will ever see it. I’m sure there are people that are even applauding me projecting my PERSONAL feelings onto my sister. Perhaps you will never know how wrong you are in your thinking.  I’m sure a lot of people who may also want to kick me or publicly shame me. To those all I can say is that I am still trying to learn and grow from this mistake. There is so much more to this story, but I just needed someone to hear what I need to get off my chest. 

Thanks for listening.",12Jul2019,0
305,"hey lads. this is going to be a long one. i'm basically letting everything out. the past few weeks/ months have been very unsettling

met this girl in my uni a few months back. instantly hit it off. started liking her after a week or two. fast forward to end of May, she starts reciprocating and flirting back and i'm on cloud nine. she asked me out, she clearly put in more effort than i did. we hook up twice and yeah cute shit happens, both of us are happy.

but no, fuck all of that. she doesn't stay in the same city as i do and is back home (same country) for the summer. before she left she told me that we can't be together because she's going to be back home with her ex (now ""best friend"") who is like family and their parents are like best friends and her ex basically stays at her place and her parents are okay with that and whatnot. i give her the benefit of doubt and trust her when she says they won't hook up or anything but at the end of her long ass monologue she told me that she still can't get over him...... that was a shocker. they broke up in 2017 and honestly i don't know what i'm doing with my life right bow but please bear with me :)

yeah so she said she needs time to figure things out (2 months of vacation) and i said it'd be better for the both of us if we cut all contact and don't talk with each other at all because a. emotional overload and b. both of us will be busy (she has a job, i have a month long family vacation)

6 days after we blocked each other - she calls me and tells me she misses me and she wants me and proceeds to break down. by this time i had figured out how much she likes me and how much i mean to her and i cry too because it was too many emotions and it was genuinely sweet of her

we continue our correspondence - which had become a daily affair and 3 weeks back was when things started turning sour.

she started telling me to keep things completely platonic and that we aren't a ""thing"" (well she needed time to figure shit out) and that every time i flirt she shuts me down. funny enough, she flirts a lot with me and i don't know what to say :')

two weeks back, she had posted something on her facebook page. it was something she had worked on and i was really proud of it and i genuinely liked it so i shared it on my feed. she texts me and is mad about the fact that i shared it and that ""out of all the people who could have shared it, you're the only one who's going to get me shit because of it""

that shit really hurt. i deleted it and we haven't spoken ever since. i've consulted with exactly 4 of my friends and all have differing POVs. she's confused and she needs time and doesn't know what to feel, stop talking to her and you don't deserve her are what i've heard so far.

i'm genuinely confused and don't know what to do. she's stopped viewing my stories and social media altogether but i'm unblocked from her phone. i don't know how to proceed. part of me wants to wait till uni starts and make her feel like shit, part of me wants to talk to her right now even though it might show how much of a grasp she has over me. and the worst feeling of all is i feel that i'm the only one feeling like shit at the moment and she doesn't even care (i have no facts to back this up but i end up feeling like this all the time)

thank you for your time x",12Jul2019,1
307,She claims she is trying to lose weight but makes no real effort and ive been supporting her for the past year trying to help her with it since shes a bit overweight but I still love her anyways.

308,"My folks adopted me when I was a baby and have always held it over my head. I was always obidient and never spoke up. They're amazing people, just not to me. I never had any freedoms growing up. I could never pursue any activities or hobbies that intrigued me. I was a fatty growing up so my parents joined me up for sports all year around, so I could never really get a job or anything. All of my friends growing up treated me like garbage and whenever i didnt want to partake in any activities, my parents would just make me anyway. When it came time to go to college I had no ambitions besides film making, mostly because of the fact all I did was play sports that didn't really catch my attention.  I know it's a stupid degree but I saved up anything I could so I could try to go to community college for it. My dad offered to pay for me to go to trade school in a different state, and I took this opportunity  (with a lot of thankfulness) and went. When they dropped me off at college, they told me I was actually going to be footing the bill. I was just going to drop out the first day but had nowhere to go and was stuck in another state. I figured I'd do a semester and just find something else to do, but then they'd always offer to pay at the end of the semester. This never happened. I found so many things I wanted to do while I was there, but my parents always said if I quit, that they would be really disappointed in me, so I kept trucking on. They never visited me once for 3 years. I just kept on taking loan after loan after loan so that maybe for one I could make them happy. I eventually just left school for a job that was in the same field, since the degree I was going to get was basically worthless (most of that specific jobs had been filled while I was in school) so I moved states yet again, never talked to my parents until a year later when I asked my dad for a job after I had a mental breakdown. He told me to apply at a place in my home state,different city. He really had nothing to do with the job, just saw there was an opening. I'm still in the same situation as I was in, just closer now for them to hold it over my head that ""he got me this new job"" and 20k in debt. I don't expect them to help me out financially, I just want them to understand why I'm frustrated since they don't think being 20k in debt is a big problem.",12Jul2019,2
309," 

For reference I am a 22F. Last year, in May, I experienced a really difficult and painful situation of a very close friend betraying me and hurting me really badly. A couple other people were involved in what happened and I have sadness, anger, frustration, and deeply hurt feelings towards everyone that was involved. It was traumatic and I went to therapy for a bit over what happened. I don't have any contact anymore with my ex best friend, nor any of the people that were involved in the situation. I don't want to talk about the situation in detail, but I want to clarify I wasn't assaulted or anything, I was just suddenly and really horrible betrayed by someone who I thought of as a sister. She did something truly awful to me and treated me like garbage when all I ever did was support her during the worst times of her life.

Over a year later and I am thinking about this situation every single day, multiple times a day. It is really unhealthy. I constantly look up my ex best friend on her social medias, every day, hoping that she is unhappy and getting ""karma"" for what she did to me. I know this a horribly evil thing to say, but I have thought multiple times how she doesn't deserve to be happy because of what she did to me. I argue with her in my head, and the other people that were involved. I tell her (in my mind) how much she hurt me, and I confront the other people (in my mind) about their role in the situation. I have had nightmares about the situation. I truly feel at this point that my reaction to the situation is not at all normal and I am considering going back to therapy. If I talk about the situation out loud to other people, I get extremely emotional and that is why therapy was so hard for me because I wasn't even strong enough to talk about it for too long. 

In every other way, I am a normal girl with a normal life. I recently graduated a top university and I have a very loving fiance who is an amazing man. This should be the most exciting time of my life. I have a wonderful family and other great friends. It really doesn't make sense to me that I am not strong enough to move past what another person did to me over a year ago. This situation is constantly in my head, darkening my thoughts and I don't think I want to admit to myself how much anger I truly have towards this person. It feels like the darkest and heaviest burden on my shoulder.

I don't know where ""getting better"" or self improvement would begin with this situation, because I have tried everything to try to move on. But I wanted to write out my feelings somewhere and talk about what has been one of the biggest struggles of my life so far. I really hope and pray that I can move on from this and improve as a person and take back my life. I don't like this sad, angry, stuck in the past person that I am now. I really can't remember the last time that I wasn't thinking about this situation, about this person, that I wasn't sad or angry because of her. 

I feel like I have given someone, who is now a stranger, bits of my life in the past year that I won't ever get back. I don't know if I will ever be able to move on, let go, or forgive. But I have to try for the people in my life who do love and care about me, because they deserve better than this person I am now. Half of me is still stuck in May, 2018.

If anyone has any advice for me about moving on past a really hard situation I would appreciate it.

311,"I just got home from a night out with some friends. I was with this newer friend i meet earlier this month. I was driving them back to their house, and they let me have their phone to play music. I accidentally opened another tab, and saw what looked like a VERY underaged girl being molested. This did not look like average ""teen"" porn. I frantically swiped away till it was gone and handed it back saying the phone locked. They opened it and handed it back with the music ready to play. I tried to act normal until i dropped them off because we are opposite sex and i didn't want them to know incase they freaked out, and i got the fuck out of there.

314,"I’ve been dating this girl (20) I’m (21) for three months now. She just got out of a divorce that lasted a few months and she has some sad times here and there but I always try to help her. It’s no big deal at all. But she’s amazing. Makes me very happy and we have a ton of fun together. Unfortunately she has some anger issues. So if I say something wrong or make a mistake it gets blown out of proportion. She is also a Latina (I’m not racist she’s told me that Latinas are more “spirited” women). Well the other night she got drunk and went into a bit of a rage calling me by her ex husbands name and threatening me with a knife. She hit me in the head and called me every name under the book and tried to say what she could to emotionally hurt me. Understanding that she was drunk I kept trying to get her to lay down and go to sleep, she wouldn’t listen to me. So after 6 hours of trying this it was around 3am at the time I decided to just go home while she was calling a guy that she had slept with when we first became a couple....I know it’s a lot.....so I left. I went home and passed out. I woke up to 60ish text messages and 20ish missed calls. All containing her calling me a coward and not a man and stuff like that for leaving her. Now I try to put myself in her shoes. I get it maybe leaving wasn’t the best idea BUT I didn’t drink nor did I ask her to. I didn’t ask to take care of someone all night. I did what I could but my life was being threatened by weapons and her telling me she was gonna call the cops because I bought the alcohol she was drinking. (Few months away from 21) 
Now we’re at today. I woke up and went to her house. We went out and got food and hung out and it went alright she was hungover. Gave me a lot of crap for leaving her the night before. She didn’t seem to understand why despite me telling her what she did to me. She didn’t seem to care at all. Then we got back to her house and she went to run an errand and she came back with an entire bottle of wine that she got from the guy she cheated on me with (same one as before) she told me it would be ok and she would just drink to relax. Boy was I stupid for believing her. She drank the whole bottle and fell asleep. So I thought that was cool and I was kicking back watching some YouTube videos. I got a text from a buddy asking if I was down to meet and chat for a bit. So I left her a note that said I was going to a gas station to get some drinks for when she was hungover the next day. I was at the gas station and she called and asked why I was gone so long. I told her a buddy wanted to chat and that I’d be home soon. She then gets very angry and goes back to name calling. So I start getting worried and tell me friends I wanna go somewhere else because I don’t want her to pull another knife on me or push a fork into my neck like the night before. As me and my two friends went to leave she comes out of nowhere and tailgates me. Keep in mind she is plastered. And she is less than a foot from my bumper going 55mph and she has been calling me non stop and I’m ignoring it because I’m focusing on not dying. She passed me a chases after one of my friends. Hits a turn going no slower than 60mph cause she sped past me. My friend loses her and we regroup. I’m panicking at this point and about to lose my mind. I’m scared of her because of the Vietnam flashbacks I’m having of the night before and I’m scared because my friends are not going to hit her but they aren’t gonna let her hurt me. I’m not a man of conflict. I’m a very calm laid back guy and I just want everything to go back to normal. I just want to go back to being happy with her but I’m scared that it’s done. At this point I’m hiding away at a friends house typing this out in a desperate attempt for advice. I care a lot about her and I don’t wanna lose her but she is acting way out of line? I really have replayed the past two days in my head and I don’t see that I did anything wrong besides leaving the first night I guess??? I feel like my only options are to leave her. Or I can go to her house tomorrow and tell her if she wants to be with me she isn’t drinking anymore and she is blocking all of these “guys” she talks to and she isn’t gonna treat me poorly anymore. No more name calling and anger issues. I’m gonna prepare it and not be rude but be firm. Again I care about her but I’m lost. I hate making decisions like this I need help. I’m exhausted.

315,"I'm a 22 year old girl and I just completed one year at my first job ever. There was another guy who joined at the same time as me. We both bonded over the fact that we were the only people who were fresh out of college, and we had a lot in common. Things were going pretty well. But recently, he's started to make fun of me or roast me for things that I do or the way that I talk. I didn't think too much of it at first because friends roast each other all the time, right?
But then he started making fun of the things I specifically told him I was insecure about. I have social anxiety so I don't talk that much to our group when we're hanging out, and he constantly brings up the fact that I'm so quiet all the time and laughs about it. I'm really insecure about my acne and I use MINIMAL makeup to cover it up, and he pointed out to everyone and said I looked like a clown. He'll call me fat just because he started going to the gym recently and he thinks that makes him better than me, even though he knows I've struggled with low self esteem. I've asked him multiple times to stop but he just brushes it off like it's no big deal. He truly believes he's doing nothing wrong.
I'd stop talking to him, but I'd probably have to stop hanging out with my group as a whole, because they'd prefer hanging out with him over me, he's funnier after all.

316,"hi. i’m a 17 year old girl and i’m moving to america next year. i’ll be living with my retired uncle and his wife who have happily welcomed me to stay. i have planned to finish my last year in an american highschool and will be also trying out for the cheer team. i’m moving in a year because i need time to save for the cost of everything, also because once i’m 18 i can legally change my name to my preferred name, and my dad can’t disapprove of that or of me moving to america. i want to graduate highschool, plan and start up my clothing business, do cheer and acting on the side as well as make money from my social media. 

i’ve told my dad about my plans and he thinks i’m absolutely stupid. he wants me to stay in our small little country, go back to school here and become a teacher or a nurse. however that isn’t my dream at all!! my parents are divorced and i live with my siblings, mom and step dad, and my real dad sees me when it’s my birthday or christmas. he’s not in my life and he doesn’t know me at all. i’ve expressed my big dreams regarding moving to america and becoming famous to him as a little girl and he’s always shut me off, tried to persuade me to stay here, ignored me and thought i was just talking silly. but now the time is approaching for me to actually GO FOR IT and achieve my dreams... and he’s calling me and telling me i’m making a stupid decision, i should be a normal person and have a normal job, i should keep my big dreams as just dreams and that he’s very disappointed in me. my half sister who i don’t get along with or care to get closer with, lives with him and she’s 23. they live in a small one bedroom apartment, my sister has the bedroom and my dad’s room is combined with the living room. she finally found a stable job but says that she’s too stressed with the hours (it’s normal full time 40 hours) and wants to quit. she spends her money on clothes and shoes and doesn’t ever get grilled for her life choices. i’m not trying to judge her, each to their own but i don’t want to turn out like that. once i’m 18, i want to move out and explore the world and work towards a successful life but i’m the one getting crap!! 

i’m so stressed about moving already and overwhelmed by the price of everything, and desperately need to save up. i’ve got a lot on my plate and my parents are not supportive of me achieving my dreams. my mom just “whatever’s” me whenever i have questions or need help, she doesn’t care to help me or support me emotionally. this is so big for me and i’m doing everything by myself, it’s such a huge risky decision I WANT TO TAKE but i feel so alone and want to cry. i’ve never travelled alone, i’m a very ditsy and clueless girl and i know i’m going to struggle a little bit everything. 

i just wish i had supportive parents that didn’t mind reassuring me and offering me some hugs for support. : (",12Jul2019,0
317,"This guy and I have been talking for over a year and since the very beginning I knew I was going to love him. I could see an entire future with him and he was everything I ever wanted. I had just come out of an abusive relationship and he was a breath of fresh air, I saw him as everything that my ex wasn’t and it was lovely. And I believe he felt the same about me.
The problem was he was leaving to go to college in another state in a couple months and we knew it was going to be hard,  but we said we would make it work. Fast forward for when it was days before it was time for him to leave, he said he couldn’t do it.
 I was heartbroken for months afterwards but I eventually got over it and decided to try for a new relationship. As soon as he heard I was with someone else he decided to start giving me the same treatment he used to, talking about the future and he even told me he loved me. So I ended it to be with him, After a couple weeks of long distance he said that he couldn’t handle it and that we should try again when he got back for the summer. I said okay.
He decided that it would be better for him to transfer to a local school and he told me that he was gonna stay in the area for 2 years so there should be no problem with us trying again. 
Now it’s summer. He got home and his parents are recently separated and now he wants no part of having an official relationship with me.
He wants me to wait until he figures out what he’s gonna do with his life and where he’s gonna live before he gives me an official answer. It’s a 50/50 shot and he wants me to wait for him for 2 years. He wants me to be loyal to him, be an emotional crutch to him and basically be his girlfriend with no label. His reasoning is that he doesn’t want to be obligated to be there for me and he has commitment issues. 

I have no idea what to do. It’s destroying me and he doesn’t seem to care at all. I wanna give him the world but this is becoming so hard to cope with. Whenever I express my feelings about it to him he makes me feel like I’m pestering him about something and overreacting. Am I overreacting? It feels like this is a very fucked up thing for someone to do, and I would never string someone along like this, but I don’t want to really lose him again and I don’t know why, I cry all the time. How do I deal with this. Is there a way to coerce him into believing it’s possible? Or should I just end it completely.",12Jul2019,1

319,"First time posting here. Not sure what to expect.
My mother is in a bad place right now, it has been progressively getting worse for quite a while. I can’t even remember when it all started. It’s been a tough few years and she has lost a lot of important people in her life which is why I have been super patient, but those people were important to me too. She has fibromyalgia and also struggles with depression and anxiety, but I think she might have some other mental health problems on top of this. She is very stubborn and always thinks she knows best...she only takes the advice of medical professionals if she agrees with them. She is a very intelligent person but she doesn’t have a medical degree. She has even taken herself off her anxiety and depression medication at times. I can’t keep track of when she is on or off them anymore. Anyway, the point is she has turned into this nasty person that I can’t handle being around anymore. She only ever calls me to complain and bad mouth people (my dad particularly, but also my dead grandma and her own dead mother!). The calls turn into Over 1 hour monologues about how she is a victim. I’ve learned to keep my mouth shut. She doesn’t want my opinion she just wants to rant and if I say anything she has a go at me. She does it in person too which is why nobody (family nor friends) want to be around her. It’s a bit of a vicious cycle because this fuels her anger and makes her talk shit about them. I don’t like the way she talks about my dad and she is definitely trying to turn people against him. 
She has turned into that demanding person who is an asshole to people in client facing roles, like waiters. She fights with anyone and everyone she can. I’ve never met anyone like that. She always has drama about how someone wronged her. 
She is going to group sessions with a psychologist but it’s mainly for her fibromyalgia. Other attempts she has made to see a psychologist ended with her fighting with them (shocker right?).

TLDR my mother with mental health problems has turned into a nasty, manipulative person. How do I help her?",12Jul2019,3
320,"Hi folks,

I'm a young male from the UK. I'm one of a very small number of people in my friendship circle who can drive, most others haven't bothered yet because of money, etc. 

I've been invited to a party almost 30 miles outside my city this Saturday night. As far as I'm aware currently, I'm only taking myself there, but I will be bringing back a full car of passengers. The party is being organised by a good friend of mine that I've known since primary school. In the voicemail I was left, they mentioned that I was the ""only chance"" for certain party-goers to get home.

As I said, I'm good friends with the host, who is best friends with one of my best friends. The mutual best friend is not invited. Some other friends from primary will be going, as well as some other people I'd like to get to know. I genuinely think I would have a good time, but I'm concerned that the only reason I was invited was because I can drive, and my company would be secondary. I spoke to the host and he said two girls I met at a previous party had requested I was invited because I am ""nice"".

They have offered petrol money and we will be leaving the following morning, so I won't even have to stay sober like the last few parties I've been to.

I'm not sure what to do. Do they actually want me there, or am I just a convenient and not-too-socially-inept way to get home? Sorry if this post is a bit vague or difficult to follow, just trying to avoid being identified. Please ask if you need any more info. Cheers",12Jul2019,1
321,"Sigh. I really didn’t wanna do this, but I seriously need help. I’m about to be a Sophomore in high school. My life has gotten a lot better since I started hurting myself when I was a lot younger. Maybe 5-6. I'd shove needles and thumbtacks in my skin. Then in elementary school I'd scrape my skin raw, hit myself, burn myself, and intentionally infect wounds I'd get with dirt and whatnot. Then in fifth grade I reached a breaking point and I began cutting myself. First they were shallow, but as the years went on they became worse and worse. My cutting became so bad that now my legs and arms are covered and rippled with scars. They're fucking ugly and I hate them. But I can't stop. I always have to wear long sleeves and long pants because I don't feel comfortable in my own skin. My cutting has gotten slightly better since my boyfriend has been helping me set goals for myself. But I hate breaking down and doing it again and hearing the disappointment in my mother's voice. The other night I gave myself two very deep gashes in my arm that I'm sure a doctor would say I need stitches. I need to quit. I seriously want to quit but I haven't been able to. I just need some advice. We can't afford to go to a psychiatrist or a therapist. They don't help. They just want to drug me up and put me in a mental hospital. I'm not emo. I don't like being stared at. It's shameful and I hate myself for it. Does anyone have any advice for things I could distract myself with? I draw a lot of vent art, and I've tried a lot of alternatives. Snapping rubber bands, breaking things, pinching myself, etc. I just want to be normal. Thank you for reading.

The TRUE friendship test   


Think about one of your friends.  If 3 or more of the following statements are true they are NOT your friend.  


\- they often ask for my advice, ignore it, and then complain about the outcome

\- they talk about people behind their back

\- they lie/brag/belittle/undermine/use me or others

\- they don't talk to me for an extended period of time unless they want something from me

\- they lack the maturity to accept our differences in opinion

\- they act entitled and don’t appreciate what other people do for them

\- they expect me to drop everything for them but they wouldn't do the same for me

\- they never show up on time and often cancel plans to do something ""better""/""more important""

\- they use ""banter"" as an excuse to bully people and not as a good spirited joke

\- I consider them to be one of my ""top 3"" friends, but I'm not one of their ""top 3"" friends",12Jul2019,0

But the only thing is where me and friend stash our weed is right next to the security camera’s so it might help find the bike but we would get caught for hiding weed.  Our plan is to move the stash and to somewhere else but we would still need an excuse so it could a little more innocent than weed. 

I forgot to mention the fact that my friend (guy who’s house I left my bike at)got a call the same night from a unknown number. Threatening him and saying there going to fuck his mom. But he was to traumatized to remember anything else from what the unknown number said.

333,"This is a long story, but it is something I really need advice on, because I've been trying to convince my dad to stop smoking cigarettes for years, but I'm scared that it's almost becoming too late.

My dad is 46 years old, and he's done a lot of things in his life, he's been an assistant football coach for college teams (not for long), he almost became a National Guard back in the day until health issues put him out of boot camp, he worked as a bounty hunter for over a decade, starting right after he dropped out of middle school in 8th grade. Not in that order, and that's just a few of the things he did. He's tried all his life to provide for us, and deep down, even though he has issues just like any other human being, he is a good man. That's why I'm scared to lose him.

In the past, me and my family didn't really think about it, and it hasn't been a major concern, but he's been a heavy smoker for almost 30 years now. He says it's only been around 20, but he's told me before 4 years back when I was 15, that he started smoking at my age, so I know it's been 30 years, and over the years, with all the stress he's been through and the challenges of bringing up our family poor, he's grown more and more depressed over the past 10 years. I feel like his smoking isn't only part of an addiction, I feel like it has something deeper to do with it.

I'm really concerned for him, so is the rest of my family, not just for his mental health, but considering his age and how heavy he smokes. If he can do it, he'd smoke 2 packs a day if he was able to, and sometimes he's had almost 3 before. We've been shorter on money recently while focusing on bills and other things we have been working on together, so he hasn't been like that in about a year, but his smoking has still been out of control. It's easy to tell that his health is degrading over time and it takes a huge affect on not only him but the rest of us, with how we feel around it and especially how we feel like we can barely control it, it's hard to watch. 

When I started smoking around 16-17, I picked it up mainly because of him and also because of my other friends who were doing it. I've been slowing down recently and I'm trying to stop it since now I've cut myself off of it except every once in a while, it's hard to quit though, because everytime if I don't have a pack of cigarettes or if I'm not smoking one, he'd buy some for him once a day or often even twice a day if he could, and every time he'd walk through the door, he would toss me a cigarette, or he would offer me a few. I used to not turn them down, but now I've been doing so more often to let him know I'm trying to drop the habit full on. I even suggest that he should too.

The thing that's really hard about it is that he doesn't deny it's bad for his health, he knows it is, when he was a heavy drinker too, he stopped that because recently he went to the doctors because he needed to have a gallstones removal surgery from it, and when they were doing the procedure, they took photos of the insides of his kidneys, bladders and examinations of his lungs. None of it looked good.

The doctor told him and my mom that he was now in the beginning stages of asthma and what could possibly be lung cancer if he doesn't slow down and stop his smoking soon. He tells us everytime he finishes a pack too that it'll be his last cigarette and he's quitting, but the next day he would look for any kind of possibility to get $5 to get his Pall Mall Menthol 100s.

I tried giving him my vape recently, and it turns out he really likes it, and I thought it would work to turn him away from cigarettes at least, but now he's vaping AND smoking cigarettes, which is a dangerous combination.

I don't mean to write this to talk down on my dad. I'm not doing this to talk shit on him. I'm not ranting to online strangers to tell you he's some kind of asshole, he's not. I love him, he's my dad, and I would do anything I could to help him, but it's so hard and frustrating and no matter what we do to try and help him live better, he just shuts us out and he let's his addictions take control.

The reason I came on here is because I need advice. I'm tired of being silent on it and I'm tired of it holding everyone back in my family, my father most importantly. I'm tired of seeing him hurt and I'm tired of staying up this late this 5 in the morning everyday being concerned for my parents' health. I just want to know what I need to do to try to at least convince him to do something good for himself for once in a while. I just want what is best for them.

 I'll take any advice. I really appreciate anyone who read this far in and I couldn't thank you enough for anyone who could at least show me what could help.

I'll keep everyone updated on what happens next.",12Jul2019,1

I live in Europe, and we don’t really get poisonous spiders, but somehow I’ve still always been terrified of them. Just to clarify - I am NOT afraid of getting bitten, it is actually the way they look / move that freaks me out. Sometimes seeing a picture will even make me feel nauseous and make my heart race.

Im determined not to let my stupid fear stop me, and I’ve been trying to desensitize myself by looking at the smaller stick legs spiders in my house and even catching one and resting my hand on the glass.

336,"So this is hard for me to talk about with anyone truthfully. Forgive me for the length, i hope someone reads this...
I'm a 24 year old man whose gay (but not out).

 When i was 14, my 18 year old brother came in my room one day as i was laying in bed on my laptop. I was on my stomach and he proceeded to jump over me and hug me tightly from behind. I kept giggling and telling him to get off me, then he proceeded to play with my nipples. This is the first time im going to admit this but I had felt aroused by that, it was the first time someone touched me like that. He kept doing that for a few minutes and i let him. The details are foggy after that but i remember him getting up, locking my door, closing the blinds and proceeded to play with my nipples again. He brought them to his mouth which was when i realized what he was doing and what I was letting him do. I pushed him away, unlocked my door and went crying to my parents. They just brushed it off as rough housing. It kept happening after that, nothing major, he'd just try to fondle me and at certain points I'd let him. I kept telling my parents though and they never believed me. 
One day they were on vacation and I didnt go with them, when they came back my brother came to my room and said he missed me, then proceeded to take off my shirt again. I'd frozen like i always do, until i realized i had a camera tripod next to me and took it and started hitting him with it. When he screamed my parents entered my room and started yelling at me as they thought he ""just missed you and wanted to say hi"" to which i replied yelling ""HOW IS THIS NORMAL TO YOU GUYS?"" 
Looking back, it happened about 4-5 times over a span of 6 months. no dicks involved or me touching him, though one time he did take my hand and caress his face as he was sucking on my nipple. I'm not going to lie and say I wasn't aroused at certain times being that i was a closeted homo and this was my first experience, but I always felt guilty about that.
That was my final straw, I'd locked myself in my room, barely interacting with my family for years. I felt like a prisoner in my own home. Whenever he'd be around I would leave, if I saw him at an extended family gathering i would leave. Keep in mind i was 14, he was 18, and my parents just made me seem like some loner or autistic kid in front of their family and friends due to my reaction to my brother being in the same room as me. 
I finally left the house for college when i turned 19 and couldn't believe how comfortable i felt living alone.
3 years ago when i went home for the summer, my mother wanted to talk to me about something and she looked distressed. She sat me down and started sobbing saying how she'll never forgive me for not speaking to my brother for all these years and how i broke up the family. I simply got up, and very coldly told her that will never happen, to which she just sobbed harder. I left the room and a week later i was back in college. After that i got deep into xanax and all this started taking a toll on my mental health, had certain blackouts where id call my family crying about how they never believed me and never protected me.
Cut to me getting clean by myself last year and back home after graduation. Being back home made me feel like that child who felt like a prisoner in my own home, things started getting pent up until one day i exploded on my mother about what happened. To which she replied ""you think we're ever going to believe you? We're never going to. Even if he did do something, you were old enough to let it happen. Did you want it to happen?"" 
I haven't spoken to my mother since then and i left their house.

Sorry for the long rambling,

Then like 4 or 5 years ago when I was in middle school, I started hearing that song all the time, and I can't go to a dance or party without seeing that dance. How did a song that's older than I am suddenly get so popular nowadays, and why does literally everyone seem to know it when it's been gone for so long? 

What kinda surprises me is that so many little kids like 6/7 years old know the dance; that song is older than I am, I didn't learn about it until I was 12/13 years old, and yet kids who are like 10 years younger than me know how to do the dance, along with everybody else.

341,"Hey, quick disclaimer, I'm pretty new here and I don't know whether this is the right sub to be asking for advice, but my thinking is how wrong can you go with a sub called Advice, amirite? That said, if this is not the right place I'll gladly take down my post and post it in the right sub if someone could point me in the right direction. 

Anyway, I'm [19F] a first-year medical student, writing about another medical student [22M] who is my senior and good friend, let's call him M.
I became friends with M a few months ago, which was about a month after he went through a (typical soap-opera style) messy break-up: his ex-girlfriend broke up with him for ""no reason"" and then started being seen around with his (now) ex-best friend. The two are now presumed to be dating.
M was absolutely shattered by the break-up and felt his entire trust in humans and relationships was lost.
I started talking to him at this time and realised almost immediately that he was feeling these emotions more fiercely than what in my head would be considered normal: his moods wildly fluctuate between devastated, hopeless and raging, wild and paranoid that both of them are determined to ruin his life.
Admittedly, neither party is entirely innocent but at this point I'm really quite concerned about M's mental state.
As of now he tells me I'm the only one he tells about everything as it happens, but I did also speak to his close friends who knew him before the breakup so that they could give me a better idea of what he was like before.
Today he called me saying his ex-best friend ""smirked"" at him and M was tempted to punch him so hard he broke his nose but restrained himself because he was in a public place. The rage is what is frightening me and making me suspect that something might be clinically wrong with him.
His friends have tried to take him to a therapist on multiple occasions but M is afraid of judgement within the institution and has stood opposed to it.
I have seen up close only one case of bipolar disorder and don't know enough about other relevant psychiatric conditions to know exactly what he has, but as a concerned friend of his and also a to-be doctor, I think I need to do something here but I'm not sure how to proceed.

I've tried to include all of the relevant details but if any more details are needed I'd be happy to answer questions to the best of my abilities.

345,"sorry for bad formatting i'm on mobile 
also i don't really know if this belongs here but i need help 

 I've been friends with this girl for about 2 years now and we had become very close. After a few arguments, I can't decide if I still want to be friends with her or not.

  Most of the arguments started as a result of me not answering her texts and leaving her on read. Usually they're about asking me to go out with her. She would follow up her messages with a bunch of angry comments and I've always apologise after a few days. I can't tell if I'm being entitled by wondering why she never asked if I had a problem or anything wrong with me before. I've always had to apologise and sometimes I don't feel like I'm in the wrong.

  Our latest argument was caused by some event i had agreed to go to but I didn't reply to the messages she had sent me and had skipped the event as I was sick. Am I at fault for her being angry at me? 

  Another time that really got to me was when she once had asked me and a few other friends to go to an amusement park, and I had stated that I didn't like the rides and wouldn't ride on them ever. She followed up with a text about how I should just go since I've never tried and how I'm wasting my life away at home. I didn't respond to that and subsequently she stopped texting me and she went along with the other friends and I had to once again apologise. before we started talking again.

  Can someone tell me if I'm in the wrong and should apologies to her or should I just stop being friends with her completely?",12Jul2019,1

In Italy we have a very different school system and basically every school is specialized in one camp.

Do you still subscribe to this belief? Do you still aim to better yourself and at the same time some how, shut yourself from interaction?

366,"Some background: I am in my early 30s, and my mom is in her late 50s. My stepdad, her late husband, just passed away about a month ago. It wasn't unexpected, since he was 27 years older than her and his health had been failing for several years, but it still affected me, as they have been married since I was 10. 

During the last couple of months before he died I suspected that something was going on between my mom and this guy she had gone to high school with. They've maintained a friendship for over 40 years, mainly just calling each other on their birthdays. He wanted to be with her when they were teenagers, but she didn't reciprocate his feelings back then. The first sign was when she was talking to me about some expensive work that she needed done on her property. Her already married friend, now fiancé, happens to perform the kind of service she needed done, and she made a joke about exchanging labor for sexual favors. Now, my family makes inappropriate jokes all the time, but this was crossing a line, and made me uncomfortable because it had the ring of truth to it. He has since done the work free of charge.

A while after this I was out running errands with my partner (a lawyer) and she called him up to ask if he could recommend a good divorce attorney for one of her friends. He did, and after they hung up we joked about how outrageous it would be if this ""friend"" turned out to be the guy in question.

Then, the week after my stepdad died my mom finally told me what was up. She said that they had been talking romantically for a while, and that the second time they spent time together in person he proposed. This, I believe, was before my stepdad had passed away. It was a lot to take in, but she said that he was making her very happy, and that she felt like a teenager again. Considering that she had basically been nothing more than a caretaker for my stepdad for the past three years, I was able to wrap my head around this. Mostly. I felt genuinely glad that she was happy, but told her that I needed to meet this guy and get to know him before I could really get on board, especially considering that he was already married (!!!). I guess they haven't had sex in over 20 years, and they don't get along at all, but there are rules!

I haven't seen this guy or spoken a word to him since I was about 11 years old, and have been waiting to meet him in person before figuring out how to start forming a relationship with him. I know that they've started having sex, and my mom and I have been talking a little bit about it here and there. I'm not going to lie, it's feels weird, but I'm trying my best to be supportive and figure out where the boundaries are. Then tonight he messages me--again, the very first communication we've had since I was a little kid--with pics of three different sex swings, and asks which one I thought would be best for them. It was clearly meant as a joke, but what. the. FUCK?! Are you kidding me?!

After talking to my partner and a couple of friends I decided to sleep on it before responding. But, I can't sleep. I'm livid, actually, and can't stop thinking about how *wildly* inappropriate this is and what the hell I need to do about it. I want to set firm boundaries on this, and communicate my feelings honestly. However, it's the very first time we're talking, and I don't want to start things off on the wrong foot. But then, too freaking late for that! Other than call and lay into this guy, what do you think I should do?",12Jul2019,1
367,"Tonight I went into a night club that was decided into two parts, one side was 18+ and the other, 21+. When you enter the club, they check your id then give you a wrist band if you’re over 21, so I got one. When I went into the club I stayed in the 18+ pet for a bit because that’s where the dancing happens, then I went over to the bar side and immediately walked to the bathroom. Keep in mind that before you can enter the bar side, there’s a worker who checks to see if you have a wrist band. As I’m walking into the BATHROOM STALL, I turn around and see a worker followed me in, then he says “can I see your wrist band”. I said “they checked me at the front”, then he said “can I see it” again! I said “no dude I’m going to the bathroom”, then I closed the stall. 

Later that night, I went to meet up with my FWB, but I realized that I didn’t have any condoms, so I stop at 711. As soon as I walk in the door, I scan to see where the condoms are, walk over, and grab a pack. Then suddenly I hear the lady at the front counter say “ah ah you need an id for those!”. YOU DON’T NEED AN ID FOR CONDOMS. I ignored her and walked over to her a soda then walked to the counter to pay for my stuff. I reach for my wallet and she says “what are you, 15?”. I say, “no I’m 21 haha. I know I look pretty young” then I get on my way. 

This stuff happens a lot to me and honestly I’m starting to feel a little helpless about it. I’m an adult, so shouldn’t I look like one? I know I probably still have some time to grow into myself, but this shit is just so frustrating. Damn near every new person I interact with brings it up at some point in some shape or form. When I talk to girls, it’s “you look so young!”, or “I feel like you look younger than me”, or “you look so innocent”. The only one I get that isn’t bad is “you’re so cute”, but even then I feel like they’re saying it in a ‘baby cute’ way.

I just feel lost. I feel like people don’t take me seriously and never will.

368,"I need some feedback really. My partner works a 9-5 job including weekends so his days off are dotted all over the place. I am a student currently on summer break so my sleep pattern is different to his. My sleep pattern is currently sleep at 5am and wake at 5pm. I don’t know why. It just has gone like that. I seem to work better at night. Going over lecture notes or doing other work. And if I sleep during the day I have the bed to myself which helps me get a better ‘nights’ sleep. When he sleeps he has to have a podcast playing in the background to help him sleep and it keeps me awake. I cannot sleep with it on or very rarely do I sleep with it on. Most night if I sleep at the same time as him, I’m awake until 2am when I finally tiptoe over and turn it off. I find it difficult sleeping next to him and almost always have an restless night. He takes up a lot of space and rolls over covers so I can’t even pull them back (and god forbid I tell him this he will get angry and not believe me) if I accidentally wake him, his half sleep version of himself is really angry and shitty.

&amp;#x200B;

Now even if I sleep at bad times, if I have a meeting or something, I am never late for it. I never oversleep if I need to be awake. All the chores still get done. And on days he works, it works out fine. But today he is off work. And I woke at 5pm after going to bed at 5am. And now he’s angry at me cause he’s spent the whole day without me. And I’m so frustrated because if I try to defend myself, he’s like ‘oh I guess I’m the bad guy again!’ And he just says stuff that twists the argument away from the point and I just have to stop and agree with him and pushes me to tears. And the extra annoying thing is that if I was awake, he wouldn’t even be interacting with me anyway! He’d be playing games or watching tv. It’s hard enough to get him to come for a walk with me and I’ve given up suggesting we go do something. I dunno my point anymore I’m just really upset and need advice. Am I bad for sleeping in? I know it’s not a normal sleep pattern but I still do all my chores and I’m never late for things.

And does anyone have advice on how to speak to someone who’s first instinct in an argument is to make it about who’s ‘winning’ he always says ‘I always have to lose the argument’ and it frustrates me so much!

Because almost all arguments end with me meekly agreeing to keep the peace and then I go cry in the bathroom on my own cause I’m just so frustrated that nothing is resolved and how crap I feel.",12Jul2019,1

372,So to start this off I want to say I don't know why I'm doing this but anyway. I like this girl and she said she liked me too but the thing is that she said she was not looking for a relationship so I was waiting for her but the thing is that my best friend and I have been hanging out a lot and I think I'm starting to catch feelings for her and it looks the same on her side but the thing is that the three of us are friends so I don't know what to do please help.,12Jul2019,1
373,"Normally I can daydream only for an hour or two before I get the need to occupy myself with something. whether that be a video game or a hobby. But when I have homework due, i sit at home in my desk with my work right in front of me and doze off for hours on end.

&amp;#x200B;

Because of this my grades suffered throughout highschool. I didn't have much trouble doing projects or comprehending the material, I just couldn't bring myself to do my homework at home. My parents got fed up, confronted me about my grades and asked why I kept slipping. I told them about my daydreaming habits and that I thought I had a problem and I really hoped they would understand and possibly try to help me. They dismissed it as being all in my head, said I was disappointing, and even said that if that was my case, then i shouldn't even be going to college. Though, I did manage to get by with As, Bs, and the occasional C by cramming all my homework during my study halls.

&amp;#x200B;

I have made it to college now, But my procrastination has only gotten a little better. I would cram homework mere hours before due dates and end up rushing them. This week, my class has gone through a very steep learning curve and there is a related homework assignment due today. Yesterday I concluded I would have to pull an all-nighter to catch up with the material and do this assignment. Ever since I got home in the afternoon, I have spent 14 hours and 3 mugs of coffee with no sleep whatsoever doing absolutely nothing but stare at my walls telling myself I will get to work once I'm done contemplating whatever trivial thing was on my mind. It is now dawn and in a few minutes, I will have to pack up and go to class empty handed.

&amp;#x200B;

My daydreaming has never been this bad before. I know I'm going to face extreme ramifications. I'm depressed knowing this is how I've been for years and somehow only got worse, I'm very worried for my future, and even though my parents tell me they're eager to help me if I'm struggling, I know telling them this would only make them loose more faith in me like it did last time. Is there something wrong with me? Is there anything I can do to get better? Any advice would be appreciated.",12Jul2019,3

So Im a 22 year old from Australia and I have a job that is stable, its not the best but its a good job for going to uni and I earn about AUS $48K a year and Im at uni full time which costs about 10K a year (If I pay it off while working I lose about $5000 a year).

376,"I’ve always had a vague memory regarding sexual molestation from a family member when I was 4 years old. Throughout the years, I learned to repress it and I eventually convinced myself that it was just a weird dream. 

A conversation with another family member triggered the “dream” memory about a month ago and I’ve come to the painful realization that it wasn’t a dream. 

I’m conflicted because this event (to my knowledge) occurred once and it was from a family member that I grew up loving and respecting very much. I still love this person, but now I’m also filled with pain, confusion, anger, and disgust towards him.

I’m not really sure what to do. One one hand, I want to repress the memory again and continue living my life the way I was, like nothing resurfaced. On the other hand, I want to sever the relationship and report the family member so I can protect other children as well (even though he no longer has access to any children, that I know of). 

The other complicated layer to the story is that he is married to a woman who has a history of being physically abusive towards him and she has access to firearms. If I confront the family member and report him to authorities/CPS, I’m afraid his wife might react violently towards him/my other family members.

I talked about this to my therapist but didn’t get much out of it, because the decision is ultimately mine and it’s a complicated situation.

I feel like part of me forgives him and wishes to continue to have a relationship with him but another part wants nothing to do with him, and I feel like I need to do something to protect others. 

What should I do? What can I do?",12Jul2019,0
377,"  

This is a real long one so buckle up. Throwaway account used for obvious reasons. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me (23F) and my boyfriend (24M) have known each other for about 5 years after being randomly placed together in student accommodation in first year of university, we’ve been officially together for about 2, after an extremely rocky start in which we broke up about 8 times (what could go wrong? /s). 

My boyfriend has always been a disaster with money, his dad died when he was 2 and I get a strong impression that his mum has left him without a lot of basic life skills – he can’t cook, can’t budget, has no concept of a sleeping schedule, and has generally displayed some selfish but not relationship-ending behavior such as blasting music full volume, not doing chores he said he will etc. 

Near the start of our relationship myself, him and two other friends were looking for somewhere to live and long story short he was unable to afford the deposit, we couldn’t move in until it had been paid, I ended up paying it. The deposit was a few hundred pounds. He vowed to pay me back as soon as he could and he had a part time job, but we’re also at university still at this point and he receives almost no financial help from anybody including his family. 

Fast forward to end of university (about a year later), me and him are still together and despite the financial issues the relationship is going strong so it makes sense for us to continue living together without other flatmates this time. We find a flat, and I end up putting the deposit down for the two of us (no need to tell me how fucking stupid I am, I’m aware). 

**Now this is where shit really starts hitting the fan.** We move in, my boyfriend goes into a deep depression, he fails his degree and quits his part time job. I get a good degree, a well paid job, and I’m generally doing okay despite all this. However I am now solely financially responsible for both myself and my boyfriend and his debt to me begins to spiral out of control. 

Fast forward another few months, he now owes me almost £10,000 (I’m financially fine despite this – the early death of my dad a few years ago left me with his pension), and he’s finally made progress towards being more healthy mentally after months of almost daily arguments of *‘Why didn’t you apply to any jobs today?’ ‘Why did you stay up until 5am last night playing games?’ ‘Why did you not get out of bed until 4pm?’*. But there’s a ray of sun, he lands an amazing job that’s well paid and begins paying me back – it’s all on the up!

^(JUST KIDDING), about a month into his amazing new job he is fired for calling in sick on days where he had exams! Que me having a complete breakdown. At this point the stress has taken its toll, I’ve not been to a doctor for a diagnosis but there is clearly something breaking in me – I’ve started self-harming very occasionally, I’ve been having suicidal thoughts, I sometimes struggle to get through a day at work without crying, my brain feels foggy and anxious and the highs don’t outweigh the lows anymore.

We’re now at the present day – he owes me almost £12,000 and he’s been applying to a lot of jobs but nothing feels like it’s enough at this point. I’m bitter that he owes me so much and that he sits at home on his computer whilst I work 7:30am – 4pm, I’m bitter that I have enough money to travel the world and instead I’m sat in ^(a nondescript UK city), I’m bitter that he doesn’t do even more to get my money back to me. Adding to my brain-fog is the fact I know he would fall back into his depression if I break up with him and he’s forced to move back home, his mum is lovely but their home is covered in cat feces and urine and she doesn’t have enough money to support him. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some little extras that are too much to explain: half of my friends hate him, he makes no effort with anybody apart from his friendship group he went to secondary school with, we argue a lot and not even just about the money, he’s stolen off me in the past (only one occasion but I mean, holy shit dude I’m your girlfriend), I’ve started to fantasize about being with other men (I’ve never cheated in my life and it’s the first time I’ve ever thought about it). 

&amp;#x200B;

SO, what do? 

&amp;#x200B;

Can any relationship survive this? Half of me wants to end it the other half can’t imagine my life without him, I really do love him. If I stay with him then what can we do to get my money back? HOW DO I STOP FEELING LIKE ME LIFE IS FALLING APART AND I ONLY HAVE MYSELF TO BLAME BECAUSE PEOPLE’S OWN DECISIONS LEAD THEM TO EXACTLY WHERE THEY ARE? 

&amp;#x200B;

If you read all of this then honestly thank you from the bottom of my heart, I don’t know where else to go or what else to do. There's so much more shit to talk about but this post is already an essay. 

&amp;#x200B;

379,"To explain, I have been working full time this summer to save money before starting college in the fall, and I work the graveyard shift where all I do is monitor something (trying to be vague because of an NDA) and it requires very little attention. In short, the times where I have to do anything because of what I am monitoring is very few, maybe an average of 1-2 hours out of my 8 hour shift is actual work. I have been filling the time up to this point with whatever will entertain me, which is either watching YouTube, practicing my french horn (studying music in school), or just goofing on my phone. Other than my practicing I feel like I am wasting lots of time that could be used to do much more productive things with access to the internet and an empty office building at my fingertips. What suggestions would you give me that I can do to be more productive?

Main Characters

dad - my father 

mam - my mother

Grandparents - the bad grandparents

Nan and Bamp - good grand Parents

T - older brother

H - younger Brother 

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My father wasn't the nicest of people in his younger years, he lied to my mam about his age claiming to be 5 years younger and was dating her when she was 17 and he was 25, cheated on my mother and leaving me, my 2 brothers and my now single mother without talking to us for years. (I'd like to point out that my mam is awesome, she had 3 kids, was in uni, had 2 part-time jobs, was denied benefits, was a single mother, and didn't receive a penny of child benefits and through all that she didn't say a bad word about him until i was 18). After cheating on her, my mam was broken down and she really struggled, he found a way to make my mam give him the house they shared making me, my brothers and my mam homeless. We had to stay in my nan's (i think americans call them grandmothers idk) until my mam could save the money to get us a new home. Dad then started going out with the woman (Alex) he cheated on my mam with. not long after they demanded my mother sent us every weekend to visit them in the house my father took from my mam, Alex was a horrible woman looking for any opportunity (I don't think she ever hit us but she would be all to willing to yell in our faces). eventually they broke up and my dad gave her the house, OUR HOUSE, THE HOUSE HE GUILT TRIPPED MY MOTHER INTO GIVING HIM. Between then and about year ago he would be very absent in our lives except us going up to visit him and his parents about twice a year maybe. when there he would chew our ears off about how he was such a great father, funding us (he wasn't) and was always there to help (again he wasn't). His parents (sadly my grandparents) were just like Alex except unlike her they would get drunk infront of us and wasn't afraid to hit us when we were ""misbehaving"". My mam knew nothing about this as we were too afraid to tell her, she would have freaked at them. When we got older they would take us to their caravan annually and the only thing i liked about it was the hot chocolate machine, thats it, i hated them. this continued for years until my older brother (T), who doesn't drink still, refused to go to the pub with them (he was like 13-14), he told my mother and she made sure that we wouldn't have to go to our grandparents if we didn't want to.  still my mother was an angel and refused to say a bad thing about them infront of us.

When i was around 17 my dad decided he wanted to be less absent and contacted us more often, by then he had a new partner, Karen (she has a heart of gold, not the typical Karen). Karen is lovely and if i do ditch my dad i'd probs miss her more than i would my dad.  Like the door matt I am i let him walk all over me, visiting whenever he asked, when he got a dog i would walk him daily (although i love the dog too) for £10 a week, however that was less than the bus fare to his house. this was during college so if i couldn't make it to walk the dog because i was in class he'd make a thing of it, saying shite like i owe him a dog walk on the weekend like i don't owe him anything i'm doing him a favour. just before going to Uni he offered me a job of gardening his garden, this eventually led to me accidentally coming across a bee hive and getting stung a fair bit XD. he then freaked on me for disturbing the nest like as if i would if i could see it. he promised me like £200 if i could  finish the job problem was it was time to go to uni and i was almost done, so i got payed £100 instead. 

Recently, like last week recent, I made the decision to visit him whilst i am back from uni, turns out all he wanted to do was debate me, he was being very transphobic and i shouldn't have been so offended because i ain't but one of my best friends are, and complaining about my younger brother (H) who for some reason our dad hated. calling him lazy and implying that he's stupid. he seemed to hate H for all his life and treated him like shite, he pretended like  H wasn't his son and accused my mam of being untrue (yeah ironic i know seeing as he cheated on her). his hatred for H seems to actually affected him, H became disheartened etc. I texted my mother to take me home and i haven't seen him since.

I have been doing youtube for over two years now, still less than 100 subs, nothing too big. I put a lot of effort into my videos and editing/animating them, but it seems kinda pathetic that I have 20 more subscribers than I have videos (50+ vids). I recently finished my finals and uploaded a gaming video, just to have it come out 3 frames per second. Xsplit lags to the point where it takes 2 minutes for my clicks to register, so I used bandicam (the free version) to get this result. And my editing software de-synchs the sound when exporting, not to mention the lack of filters. I do all this on a gram laptop.

I wanna build a pc or at least buy a small graphic card for my laptop, but both are too expensive. Adobe premiere pro is out of the question entirely, and paid bandicam is too expensive as well.

(If you are blessed enough to not understand how one can't afford a graphic card, now is a good time to leave. Please don't fill the comments with ""Just earn more money"" or something similar)

N/B. My business is to buy used/new items online and resale it because i have many customers who are always interested to buy it from me. I also have my shipping agency that will come down to you for the shipment O.K. Enjoy the rest of your day.""

Then say he will instruct me more once payment is completed.

I got the check today. It's not the agreed price of 500$, it's 1700$. The address it seem to come from seem to be traced back to a US National Guard Army base in Vermont. Name on it is different too. The check seem to come from a Ontario company called EllisDon Civil Limited, "" a world-leading construction and building services company that completes in excess of $4 billion worth of contracts annually, in every market sector and across the globe.

When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d been snotty. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 

A few days before She had sent me the other side of a city instead of her for an appointment with a letter one day because it was the 6 months stage after I called in sick to an appointment at reception when I wasn’t sick I had a job interview but I hated her so didn’t want to tell her.


I emailed her to ask can I go somewhere else instead if that other place she sent me and told her i had an interview I passed and got offered a trial and she sent me back to herself but I never complained a word yet she was snotty first instance back there but was hoping to benefit out of me getting a job myself. 

Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",12Jul2019,0

Same goes for friends, I don’t feel like being judged right now, which is why I’m here using a throwaway account. I don’t know much about Satanism or Witchcraft, but both definitely have caught my interest. 

When it comes to believing in something, I always feel like I can never settle on anything. I believe in God and all that Christian jazz because over these years I hear so much about it and I don’t want to believe in nothing but never paid too much close attention to it. I never could relate to my family and hear God answering my prayers or warning me about things and I could never get on my knees and declare my thankfulness or praise to him. It just always feels too weird. I hate church, it’s very boring, I feel like the theme of every service is the same, the people are sometimes too nice to where it’s kind of creepy, and I feel like when people talk about their experiences with God, it’s bullshit. However, I do pray sometimes and have been doing so since I was a kid because of my parents. 

I don’t know what’s going on with me. It could be a phase but at the same time this has been in my mind for a few years. I would go all in and start talking to people involved in what i’m interested in so maybe I can start practicing or slowly get introduced to it but that little part of me that was raised in a tight Christian household is making me feel hesitant because I start to ask myself, ‘What if I go to hell?’ and that scares me.

408,"Hello there  


This is the first post I have made on this sub reddit and I find myself in a bit of a dilemma. I am a 19 year old high school graduate (Graduated this year) from Sweden who aspires to study aerospace engineering. At present I am at a bit of a crossroads when it comes to making a decision for university which I hope I can get some help with.  


The first option I have is to study in the Netherlands at the University of Twente for a Mechanical engineering BSc degree for 3 years. By doing so I am eligible to study for a masters in aerospace engineering at the University of Delft thereby allowing me to get my education in 5 years time provided that everything goes smoothly. Engineering is at the end of the day what I want to study and is the route that I can see myself wanting to pursue in the long run.  


The second option would be staying in Sweden and studying a year of the BSc in Physics course at the University of Lund before applying abroad to other institutions for engineering. I presently live fairly close to the university and as a result, residence would not be an issue. Additionally I could get a driver's license and a degree in Swedish (since my courses in high school did not include swedish) to study further at Lund for a BSc in Mechanical Engineering instead before ultimately going abroad for my masters.  


Going to Lund would allow me to also apply to other UK institutions as well as other institutions in the Netherlands such as directly applying to the BSc in aerospace engineering course at Delft and the BSc in Mechanical Engineering course in Eindhoven. Both of which would be presently more favourable than Twente.  


I am not sure if there is any right choice here but any advice on the matter would be greatly appreciated.",12Jul2019,1

I completely understand why he would feel this way, and there seems to be no obvious reason for this exclusion - friend 1 is convinced that friend 2 dislikes him and is actively trying to bully him but I've never heard friend 2 say anything bad or negative about friend 1 so it's hard for me to say if that's the case for sure. I think friend 1 would really benefit from having a discussion with friend 2 about how they are feeling because I think there is some miscommunication going on here. 

I'm trying to remain neutral because I absolutely hate conflict, but friend 1 feels unsupported when I take this stance. I also feel like I've been a bad friend for letting him feel this way and not more actively trying to ensure this friend gets invited to these events.

HOWEVER, that was before...I hate writing now. And I'm doing a second degree in something totally different. I accepted the job, though, because I missed the company and working for her. I would say its the most ""glamorous"" company I've had. 

It was dumb of me because I'm miserable. First of all, I'm not even in the office, I work from home so I dont ever really see anyone. All communication is through email. And even though it's just one blog post a week, it takes up so much of my time (6-8hrs/week). It takes away from my personal projects and eventually, school work in September. And third, its sooo boring.

I want to quit but I dont know how to. I feel like i owe her for basically giving me this job because it was so nice of her to think of me after all this time. I'm afraid she'll be upset with me and I really dont want to lose her as a reference either. And since it's only been 2 months, it's even worse and embarrassing.

So, when I do quit, should I do it in person or through email? What should I say? Should I write my resignation in the email or send an attachment?

Previously, we thought he had autism and intellectual disability, but the positive symptoms such as hallucinations manifested very heavily soon after. That’s how schizo works, unfortunately. He is very dangerous. He’s very aggressive and he hurts us. He tries to fight my dad, he throws things at me like once a glass bowl if I even look in his direction, and once he took off a piece of my moms scalp with a shard of glass during a meltdown. My mother doesn’t work to take care of him but I’m helping her apply to part time jobs and she’s getting interviews. He is very low functioning and anti social so he does not work or go to school- we already tried. He refuses to take his medicine and it gets worse during the winter.

A family is something he told me was extremely important to him and he always wanted and it just doesn’t seem that way with the way he treats me and doesn’t help. In every pregnancy I’ve had he has shown no interest in going to appointment, holding my belly, asking how I’m doing or feeling, making sure I’m ok. 
I would make him go to appointment through my first pregnancy and he would be upset with going. My second pregnancy we would still fight over it and I would mention how he isn’t showing interest and it makes me sad because I feel alone in this and like it doesn’t matter. Now with the 3rd pregnancy it’s like it doesn’t exist. He doesn’t think of it period. 
I can’t stand feeling this way completely alone like it’s my problem to deal with and nothing with me matters. He gets home from work and worries purely about himself, working out, eating dinner I cooked and sitting on the couch with his phone in hand. I feel so unappreciated and like carrying this baby is nothing to him like my body isn’t going through a lot. He compares me to women who work even with 3 kids.

so the story with them is a fucked up one. The first time they ever had sex she was 16 and he was 21. She was heavily intoxicated and could not make any decisions for herself but she says it’s not rape (hahah ok hunny). She also went through a lot of trauma within the last few years with her family, so naturally this boy was always around. Also this boy has a girlfriend but has still been telling her he loved her and hooks up with her for the last 5 YEARS and was just recently going to break up with his girlfriend to be with her but my friend said no. 

Here’s my take on it. She got attached because this psycho pervert his controlling and has been taking advantage of her for 5 years, but she always saw it as a place of comfort because he was always around and was going through much of life with her and has always known her. He molested her. She then grew attached to him but she doesn’t think it molestation or rape because she was 16. 

What do I do about this what do I tell my friend? Do I even stay friends with her? She knows I know now and she doesn’t want to do anything with him anymore but she can’t just cut him off cus she sees him pretty much every week.",12Jul2019,4

427,"I dated a girl for 6 months and then decided to break up with her because she never gave me any attention/ love
It’s not like she would avoid me or not try to hangout with me it’s just that we didn’t move forward in the relationship in anyway. It had been 4 months and the most we had done were a couple hugs and a peck on the cheek.
I could understand if she felt uncomfortable with romance and was nervous because I was aswell but I wanted to move forward and more or less she just wanted the title of yungjah69’s girlfriend as I am a popular and  attractive ( as I have been told) boy. I personally don’t believe these statements as popular and attractive but basically everyone in my year likes me apart from a couple people.
I really tried to comfort her and let her feel more comfortable around me but it wasn’t working. I wasn’t trying to force her into all of the romantic stuff but that’s a big part of being in a relationship. Ever since I broke up with her I’ve felt self conscious about myself because I don’t believe that I have any good traits anymore. I  want to move past this and feel better about myself as I am not taking care of my body properly anymore (less exercise, bad diet, 3 hours of sleep on a school night and trust issues)

434,"Hello, all! I just graduated from college with a degree in Mechanical Engineering from a top state school, and now, the my wife and I have just moved to Florida. 

I have about $60,000 in student loan debt, and my wife has about $7,000 in student loan debt. However, we also have about $100,000 in savings. 

Currently, I am in the midst of attaining a job, and my starting salary will be right around 64k gross (job is lined up ~ just going through the final process now). My wife works a part time job, and she'll be making around 17k gross ~ combined income of about 81k gross.

We currently have no other debts ~ cars are paid off, no major credit card debt, no other loans other than the student loans. Though, we are looking to buy a house soon ~ we've been looking for one at around a 250k-300k price point. 

I've been worrying a little bit about our student loan debt lately, and I have considered just throwing a good bit of our savings at it to eradicate it. However, I have been told that is a very bad idea, for cash in hand is much, much more valuable than the impact the student loans are having on us.

438,"I have been suffering for sometime and trying to resolve my issues. Let me break down my story.

\- I was born in Australia to immigrant parents, I never felt like I fit in there. I suffered a lot of racism throughout the years. - After travelling to many places including my parents homeland, the push to leave and try a new place became stronger and stronger. I had a few depressive episodes which pushed me to leave my relationship and job behind and start a new life abroad.

\- I finally did it. Around four years ago I left and moved to my parents home country. I secured online employment and things have been great. I never missed Australia one bit. I do not regret what I did, my path led me here and I learnt a lot in the process. I did visit Australia once and it was nice but after a few days I already wanted to go back abroad.

\- I have met a great girl over here. We do not understand each other 100% and sometimes we have communication issues but I feel like I never will find someone that will understand me! Back in Australia I always felt like an outsider and being abroad I do not seem to fit in anywhere, including my parents home country as I am different from the locals who grew up here.

\- Over the past few weeks something very strange has happened, I have far less employment (working less hours) and work where I am is extremely hard to find and low paid.  I am worried I will not be able to secure a good job.  I have a few family members sick in Australia and I started questioning my relationship with my girlfriend. I feel really unstable and my head is all over the place. All of a sudden I feel like I have been hit by a bus and entering a depressive episode. I feel terribly homesick from Australia (for the first time!). I am thinking about the beaches, the food, my friends, playing sports and my family. The list goes on... I am struggling to understand how this switch in me has been flicked. 

\- So that is the way I feel now but I have this feeling if I go back to Australia then I will experience the reverse. I will miss being abroad and all the negatives of Australia will punch me in the face. I will miss my friends abroad. I am worried to leave my girlfriend, she does not want to go to Australia and wants to stay here close to her family. Now I feel terribly lost and trapped. It is a difficult position to be in because I cannot see a way out of this. When I am in Country A i will miss Country B and when I am in Country B I will miss Country A. I can't just keep ending my careers and relationships to travel back and forth all the time!

\- Soon I will be 35. I feel like I need to do something with my life but I just can't settle down. I feel lost.

Any advice? Have you experienced something similar?",12Jul2019,1

He then removed me from all social media. I was obviously upset by this and turned to my friends for support who helped me get over that situation However, one friend in particular who had helped me get over him had said **behind my back** *""who would want to go out with her, shes a catfish"".* I was very upset by this comment as i do use snapchat filters in my posts, but i have always been wary to ask my friends if they look realistic and not too different from what i actually look like. In fact, the same girl who said the flippant comment was the one who chose a majority of my posts.

You may think its a petty and small comment to be upset over, but I'm a very shy and not very confident person, so saying anything like that really hurts my self confidence. Some of my friends have tried to reassure me that im not a catfish, but its hard to believe them as they may be saying that out of pity.

Around a month ago I (18F) had sex with a girl who I'd been flirting with for a few weeks prior, and we had sex again around a week after that. Afterwards, I mentioned in a conversation that I'd talked about her to my friends. I think she interpreted this as me saying ""I told my friends about you, so therefore we are an item"", despite me never saying or hinting anything about wanting to be serious- all I said was that I had told my friends about her. A few days later I found out that she had been telling her friends that we were girlfriends. I really had just intended for it to be a FWB situation and I thought she wanted the same, as both our past relationships have been FWB, and that seemed to be the direction it was going in.

It's been a few weeks since then, and the other night she told me she loved me. She was drunk, and it's only been a little over a month of seeing each other (twice a week at most), so I'm hoping she was over-exaggerating, but this has made me realise I need to stop leading her on as I don't feel as strongly, and the longer I let it go on the worse it will get.

I'm struggling to find the right thing to say to her- because we text regularly, and there's no tension between us, I feel like it will seem very out of the blue if I cut it off suddenly. Is there any way to let her down gently? I understand her feelings are going to get hurt to an extent no matter what, but I'd really like to minimise that as much as possible, as she really is lovely and has done nothing wrong rather than jumping to conclusions a bit too fast.",12Jul2019,1
443,So my husband purchased a car under his name  only and I am freaking out! So the plan was to purchase a car together as a married couple because I really needed the security of him not taking it away... let me further explain.... we had a pretty rough start during our engagement and we had fights where he would take my phone and say “I bought this it’s mine!” And I would be left with no phone until we eventually made up. I told him how I felt about him doing this but he continued to do it for a bit. Fast forward we got married and during our almost two year marriage he has probably tried doing it once but I then reminded him I purchased my second phone after he had broken the one he had purchased for me. He has then stopped... so my fear is will he try to pull that with the car if we get into an argument? I really need this car to get to work and get the kids to school and I fear this could potentially harm my employment etc. I expressed this to him yesterday and he said he purchased the car for me that it is OUR vehicle! But I can’t help to feel like I’ve been left out! And  there’s a bit of fear he might just take off with the car and then I’ll be stuck trying to figure it out all over again.,12Jul2019,1

I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way.

451,"My boyfriend (24m) his parents moved to a new state and sold their old home. His mother’s uncle passed and left his house to my bf’s mom. He goes to school and works full time and he pays for school himself. As long as he’s doing that he can stay at this home free of charge so he didn’t have to move to Florida. Plus they like having a house here so they have somewhere to stay whenever they visit. He moved in December, and this house is closer to other family members in the area. His cousin (33m) asked my bf is he could come and stay sometimes to get away. My boyfriend said yes. Within a week his cousin moved in all his belongings. 

This cousin has had drug problems in the past and currently has a baby with his ex wife’s cousin. Next thing we know his cousin is bringing a girl over who clearly looks like a junkie and acts like a junkie. She basically also moved in. I do not live there but now she’s staying there all the time. She’s washing clothes there. She has her own razor and lady products in their bathroom. My bf has told his cousin he doesn’t want her there all day especially if no one is home. So for a few weeks she stopped coming around. 

Fast forward to recently. So no one is my bf’s family has met this girl. My bf smokes pot and his cousin keeps telling him he can’t smoke upstairs. His cousin’s baby mom has a restraining order on him so he’s worried about the cops coming because he’s already been arrested twice for not leaving his ex alone. Don’t get me wrong. His cousin helps with a lot of cleaning but I mean he’s staying there for free and has his 45 year old gf there all the time doing her laundry and shit on his aunt’s dime. About two weeks ago his cousin was leaving the gf at the house alone all day. I can only eat certain food so my bf buys things for me for when I’m there. So she’ll be downstairs cooking the eggs that my bf bought for me, which pisses me of. But anyway he left her there during the day alone for 4 days straight. Two of those days she tried to sneak upstairs and pretended she isn’t there because she knows she can’t be there alone. The one day she left her coffee on the table. My by complained to me and I told he to say something so he did. 

He feels like he can’t say anything because he’s basically free loading. The difference is that he’s 24 and getting a degree, while his cousin is in his 30s and his gf is 45 and living for free off his mom. That’s messed up. I’ve stopped saying things about it because I know he’s not gonna do anything. I just don’t like that his cousin talks all this crap to my bf’s mom and then my bf lets him stay there and be taken advantage of. It’s just all messed up.

I know you all are gonna say let it go, but it just bugs me so much and idk why. My family is so different, so if it was my cousin he would’ve been out a long time ago. It’s just annoying.

454,"Hey guys! 

I recently joined a company this Monday and have been seeing this lady in the office pass by my desk for awhile now.

Usually when she passes by, she would look backwards at my desk just slightly and when she comes back, she would look straight and turn her eyes to me. When that happens, I would always back at her for one second and then immediately look down or turn away because I'm too shy.

So here's the problem, I'll be leaving my company after next Monday and would probably never get to see her again.

I want to try at least speaking to her before it's too late.

To be honest, I don't know if she likes me or has a boyfriend already but I kind of want to know.

I'm scared people in the office would know that I talked to her (they love gossip) and I'm not sure how can I get her attention.

And if I do, what should I even say?

I have 2 days to prepare - Reddit help!",12Jul2019,6

457,"For context, I'm [17M], is part if a family of 4 with a younger sister, mum, dad you know the go. My Dad who was once  a very heavy smoker however decided to quit after my mum asked him to. It was for the sake of the family. This was about 6 years ago however my mum who is also a frequent smoker has not quit. She has tried but it has been tough. Family tragedies etc has resulted in the stress amounting hence resulting in smoking cigarettes. 

My parents have always been ones to argue about ridiculous things. whether it be who put what where, who did the dishes, who left their plate out, they've fought about it.

Today my dad asked my mum to stop smoking (which he has repitedly done for the past few years) again and resulted in a large fight. I tried to speak to both sides;
- dad was extremely worried of losing her and won't be able to bear the pain if that happens. He only wants the best for the family
- mum understands where he is coming from and has said she will try but this has been the same case for the past few years
- dad is sick of hearing the same thing and wants something to be done
- fighting erupts again etc

One thing to note is that my dad does drink a bit. Tonight he seemed drunk and could have partly had an influence on tonight's outcome. The fighting which occurred could have been violent had I not been there. I tried to stop it every time.

I'm addition, my sister is quite the opposite. She simply sat in her room through the whole argument and just let it happen. Not to belittle her in anyway she is still an awesome sister however it seems that she doesnt care about the outcome and sees my dad in the wrong. Throughout this whole ordeal i tried to remain as nuetral and unbiased as possible.

therefore, I really just want to know how I could help my parents in achieving common grounds, work something out and hopefully help my mum fight to quit smoking. TIA &lt;3",12Jul2019,2

She found similar level employment at another large retail store. Fast forward 8 months and yesterday she was fired again because somebody accused her of making racist comments.

 Someone suggested a chain installed at the very top of the door but I think she could just stand on a chair and slide it right open. I also found a lock on Amazon that slides over both sides of the door but our front door is 2"" thick and I believe it's too thick for that lock.

I'm currently both overweight and ugly, but I'm working on the weight thing (I've lost 7lbs in a month!) so soon I'll just be ugly. I now need to learn how to make peace with my face.

Some of the muscles in my face don't work properly, meaning that I can't smile properly, as my mouth can't bend correctly, and that when I talk, I only talk out of one side of my mouth. I can't fix this because the muscle structure just isn't there. There's nothing to strengthen or build on. I was offered surgery to hopefully fix it, but I declined it because I was too afraid at the time and now I'm no longer eligible.

I also have very prominent cheeks, a drooping nose, and an extremely jutting out chin. You know a crescent moon? That's what I look like in profile. I know there's no way I can change my bone structure without surgery.

I also don't know how to use makeup (I never bothered to learn because the one positive I got in life was clear skin) so I can't make myself look nicer. Should I learn?

469,"I’ve been in an especially bad place mentally for the past year or so, and I don’t know how to start feeling better. I’ve tried doing some meditation, bought a weighted blanket and light therapy lamp, used a gratitude journal for awhile, and used CBD oil. I’ve been trying to handle feeling bad by myself, but now I’ve decided to turn to Reddit. A couple of months ago I went to the doctor because my heart wouldn’t stop racing and It was making me very scared, and the doctor said I was having an anxiety attack and said it’s likely that I have general anxiety disorder/depression. I’ve never been to therapy though I probably should have went 19 years ago, and maybe I wouldn’t be feeling so unhappy today. 

19 years ago my older (and only) sister died in a car crash when I was 16 years old and she was 26. I think losing her has sort of created this attitude of being frozen in time for me. I see everyone else changing and moving on with their lives and doing big things, and I’m just over here wondering how the world can keep spinning without her in it.

After my sister died, my parents and I became broken. We aren’t who we were before. My dad became addicted to gambling and lost all of their savings and did a reverse mortgage on their house. My mom and I begged him to stop gambling, but it never happened until the bank account was drained and now they live only on their social security checks. I worry so much about them and their lack of a financial cushion now that they are seniors. I worry about their health and I worry about being without them. I don’t know what to do with them getting older. It terrifies me to be alone, and I wish I had my big sister so that we could handle it all together. 

99% of my friends are married with kids (and most have been married for around 10 years), and I feel like this weird broken person who doesn’t understand how to have that sort of life that seems to come naturally to them. I’m embarrassed to admit this, but I’m 35 years old and I’ve never had a boyfriend, I’ve never slept with anyone, and I haven’t really dated. I’ve gone out with a few guys, but I don’t know whether to call those moments dates or what. My first kiss wasn’t until I was 21, and I’ve only kissed guys after I’d had a few drinks. I guess romance gives me anxiety, and I don’t know how to just be in a normal relationship like everyone else. I’ve admitted to a couple of guys I’ve liked them and I was rejected, but then when guys have pursued me I get freaked out and put up a wall. 

I just feel really alone, and I feel like my world is getting smaller and smaller. My sister is gone, my parents are getting older and that scares me, my friends rarely have time for me because they have families, and I have no idea how to be a normal person who can fall in love and be in a relationship.

I wonder sometimes if I have separation anxiety triggered by the loss of my sister and that has carried over into the rest of my life and my inability to get close to people. I don’t know.

Looking for advice. I’m just so tired of feeling alone and like I’m going to feel like this broken person forever. Thank you for reading.",12Jul2019,2

When I trained, I ate whatever I wanted to because I could work it off easily. 
Now, I can’t do that, so I’m starting to revert back to limiting food, counting calories, and intermittent fasting, which is problematic because I suffered from a binge eating disorder through this method of staying slim.

She was very friendly and immediately ran over to other dogs walking in the area. I noticed she doesn't have any tags (so I could call the owner), but she has a collar. I was talking to a couple and one of them accidentally dropped a cup of iced coffee. The noise clearly rattled and shook the dog, but I figured it was just scared without its owner. This one lady started yelling at me to control my dog, but I explained it wasn't mine, I was going to take it to my backyard, and call animal control.

My dad's is right around the corner, so I hurried my dog home and kept whistling for this one to follow. I want to make clear she wasn't being threatening or mean to any dogs along the way. She seemed just playful and goofy.

So I took it home, gave it and my dad's dog a treat, and she's been in the backyard since. I called animal control, but it says online that it doesn't open until 11 and the guy told me he'd send someone out asap. I told him the dog didn't seem threatening, but once I hung up I was staring at it through a window and thought I saw some foam around its mouth.

I don't want to definitively say the dog had foam or not, but it looks that way when I see it. My dad's dog lost interest and is currently sitting in the living room with me. He hasn't been hurt at all and seems very calm.

I don't know what to do. Should I just wait for animal control or call again and report the foam???",12Jul2019,2

I quit my job last year to move and worked on a really large painting commission, the timing worked out perfectly to start doing commissioned work when I moved. Projects are over and I’m looking for jobs and freelancing for my old job in the meantime. My old company’s policy is freelancers get paid within 30 days of project completion. 30 days from completion would be July 7th (Completed June 7th). My boss didn’t mark my project paid until June 14th. So last week I emailed accounting making sure everything was good and they assured me I would receive payment before July 14th. Cut to today (July 12th) and I was getting worried because the weekend is coming up and I assumed I wouldn’t get paid over the weekend. Well they told me my boss actually didn’t do something and the payment wasn’t even in process. I have to pay rent by the 15th or I will get evicted so I’m wondering if anyone has any tricks up their sleeves to make money quickly. Not like dollars and pennies... like rent money.

492,"Good morning, everyone! I hope your week has been great! So, here's the situation I'm in: I have two job interviews coming up. The first is today for a high tech job that I have experience in. It pays amazingly but the drive is really long. They have great benefits and culture, but it isn't what I went to school for (I'm a recent grad). Finally, the manager at this job is ecstatic about having me in for an interview, so I'm fairly confident that I already have the job which is obviously great. However, I interview for another job next week and it's something I'm passionate about, even though the pay is about $10000 less. However, the benefits of this place are amazing as well BUT they are looking for someone with more experience. Still, I did a phone interview with them yesterday and it went perfectly so they want me in on Thursday. 

So, here's the problem: if I interview at the higher paying job, I'll most likely get it and I'll be comfortable and whatever because it pays a lot. BUT what if I interview at the other job and I get that one? How long is a good time to tell an employer that I need to think about an offer and should I just take the really good job for now and hope my dream job comes around again in the future?

Living with my father, he can't move much after a leg injury years ago. (can walk kinda ok, but still no enough to do any phisical work) 

My mother left us and doesn't care about anything. 

Working for a company while studying, they're about 1 month late paying me my last paycheck, they're vague about it.  
Bills to pay, but no idea how to do it, my father hardly works because he finds it hard to move.   
My father blames me for not being able to stand up more for myself, but I actually don't see a solution if the company tells me I can walk away and they'll pay me ""sometime"", while I need money now, so I just hang there hoping. I'm gettin' unreasonable (really angry) at work too. 

Can't study effectively, because I'm too anxious. I don't know if I'll able to attend to exams, since uni is quite far and no money to spend.   
The ones I did this week, didn't go well, I'm too stressed. 

If I fail to graduate this year, I'll have to pay extra next year, I always passed my years with a merit scholarship (good grades, passed exams), so it'll be REALLY hard. This worries me to no end.   


Finding another work will be hard, since hardly any work for young people here, or they're giving minimum pay or worse.

499,"(Native Spanish Speaker, feel free to correct me)  
So... For this, I need a little bit of backstory: I had the same friend from Pre-K (5-6 years old) to 6th grade (11-12): It was a VERY toxic relationship. At the beginning of 6th grade she came up to me and said ""I don´t want to be your friend anymore, I actually hated you all these years and only was your friend out of pity, don´t come near me anymore"" and walked away, I was both: really upset and also relieved to get out of that toxic environment, the problem is that she started badmouthing me to all my classmates, even doing that WHEN I WAS DUCKING THERE!!!!! This lead to a distant relationship with my class, and even if I am a very extroverted person, I just can´t socialise with my classmates, that turns my classes into hell because no one likes me and I like no one.

  
On the other hand, my outside-class-friends, whom I love with all my SOUL are still in my school, and the after-school clubs are the best, I wait impatiently to go to rehearse this year´s musical (we´re doing Hercules, I love it) or to go to rehearse with my band, I love those moments with my whole heart and soul, and can´t even imagine, a world without them without imagining me going deeper into depression (I have depression because of this and my band, musical and group of friends have helped me overcome it) and that´s something I really do not want to do.

Should I change schools? Any advice?",12Jul2019,1
500,"Hi! Using a throwaway. I am a 26 year old. I have a masters degree in bio and I have a job working in a lab at a university. I like my job, it can be a bit boring but I have really good benefits and my boss is flexible and kind. I like my coworkers and I make good money for where I live. I don't love my city but I have good friends and there are definite positives.    



Last year, I applied to graduate school. I always was interested in a PhD AND it was the only way for me to relocate to a location that my (then) fiance and I wanted to live. (Not a lot of biotech jobs out there). He went out first for a job while I stayed and applied to grad school. We broke up. I got accepted to a PhD program. I LOVE the part of the country where the graduate school is. I'm really interested in the research I'd be doing.       


But:
1. I'd be cutting my salary in half and living somewhere more expensive- I'll make ends meet, but barely.  
2. I'd be leaving all my friends and family for a high stress program.  
3. I'm not sure that the job market for a PhD looks that much better than for a masters. I've seen ads for post docs making close to what I currently earn. It's a lot of time and stress to potentially not see much benefit, career wise. I'm not interested in being a faculty member in academia- I prefer to do bench work rather than writing.

My boss wants me to stay and seems to think grad school will not benefit me. However, I am stoked about the research I'd be doing, I'm excited about learning and living in this new place. But pragmatically I'm not sure that it is the best choice. If anyone (especially PhD students or graduates) have any insight I'd REALLY appreciate it. Should I choose security and more leisure and maybe regret not trying? Or should I go for something new and risk that it might not pay off the way I imagine?",12Jul2019,1

504,"My ex of 3 years and I broke up 5 months ago. It was a sad breakup no fight involved but I guess the timing wasn’t right and he probably just didn’t want to be with me. Btw I am 34 years old, an orphan (lol I like to use that word as a way of sounding more dramatic). I’ve always been an introvert this was only my 2nd relationship, my first being when I was 23 and that lasted for a year so I’m not an expert in any type of relationship for that matter. 

So anyway when my ex and I broke up I deleted and blocked him, his family and friends on all social media. Not to be mean but because my heart hurt so incredibly bad just seeing their name.

I told my friends (which is a very small group) not to tell me ANYTHING about what he does or posts I did not and do not want to know. Again because it’s painful for me. I know, I’m an emotionally weak person. Well I knew my friends and some family still followed him, which is whatever, but again I just did not want to be told any information. So my 1 friend who I’ve been friends with since I was little has already told me 2 things about him despite me reminding her to please not bring anything up to me. 

Then she proceeds to tell me he went on a vacation and she really wanted to know where he went (because apparently the picture he took looked like a place she visited ) so her best friend who I’d say is not really a friend of mine but an acquaintance, messaged him and asked him where he was vacationing! And then my friend also told me apparently this girl messages him fairly often, nothing deep but just responds to his Instagram stories or snapchats. 

 I feel like that is so strange. They hung out with my ex maybe a total of 4 times the whole time we dated (I was living with him in his town 2 hours away). My friend is in a long term relationship and the girl who messaged him is married. These are all people in their young 30s. Of course when I found this info out I was kinda mad and I guess hurt. Not that they owe me loyalty but I feel like my ex probably definitely thinks I’m trying to stalk him and I don’t even understand why these girls care what he’s doing. My friend said she’s just nosey and had to know. The whole thing seems very weird to me and I don’t know if I should just let this go, am I making a big of a deal and letting my ex control my life but in a different way? Should I just not care? Or should I consider really stepping away from these friendships?

Hi everyone, I'm not doing well today and have decided to open up to Reddit. I just need some encouragement to stay motivated.

I've  been looking for new job for almost a year now and I can't seem to land  something. I've spent countless hours tweaking my resume and working  with professional job coach.  I've been on interviews or have  opportunities that end up falling flat.  It's depressing to see all the  time and energy I've devoted seem like it's being wasted as the days go  by.

I want to leave my company because  I'm micromanaged, stressed, and burned out. It's been a great ride but I  feel it's time to move on.  I've tried to count my blessings, remain  positive, and change my perspective.  However, it's hard to do when  there is constant gossip, boundaries being crossed, and lack of  professionalism.  Also, people were laid off yesterday - some were my  colleagues.  We've been told to simply put it behind us and move on.  A  company taking that kind of attitude seems like a douche move.

Anyone ever been in this position, and how did you stay resilient for so long?",12Jul2019,1

It's pretty spacious for us 3 (me and my parents, im the only child). My parents obviously sleep in one room and since i was in elementary school, I've been sleeping on a small, twin sized bed in my parents bedroom. The other 2 rooms are for guests or are used as a ""study room."" We don't have guests in the middle of the year and the study room is ""supposed"" to be my room. It's even decorated and also has a bed but I never ended up using it. My mom is very strict and she likes me sitting next to her while studying or watching tv which wasnt a huge problem when i was in elem school but as i entered middle school, i started realizing it was becoming an inconvenience. i just feel like I need my own privacy these days cuz im not able to do anything like watch tv or chat with my friends or even vid call them when im in her room. She insists on watching the same tv that i am or siting next to me. And she's not really the type of mom to listen to ""my reasons."" i can never really logic something out with her. I'm pretty sure u guys get what i mean. I've talked to her multiple times ab it and my dad is p supportive but he started working from home and started using my bedroom as a ""study room."" so even tho he is supporitve, these days when i talk ab having my own room WITH HIM so he can talk to MY MOM, he's like ""bruh im not moving my stuff and there's a desk in this room"" (BUT THERE'S ALSO A DESK IN MY PARENTS ROOM) and he sometimes even stays in my room until 3am or 4am so hes sometimes never even with my mom which causes me to spend MORE TIME and ENERGY with her. And my mom keeps brushing over the topic or saying stuff like ""idk why u need ur own room when u have ur own bed"" stuff like that. idk what to do. she thinks theres NO DIFFERENCE in having my own bedroom vs sleeping in her bedroom WHEN THERE IS cuz im not able to do what normal teenagers do except study.  i rlly want my own bedroom. it feels like i dont have any freedom and i actually dont. pls help.

512,"Throwaway because she uses Reddit. 

I was talking to my daughter recently and asked her why she doesn't confide in me the way she used to when she was little (she's 24 now). I feel we are not as close as we used to be when she was a child and I love her so much so I really want us to be closer. She told me it was because I didn't stand up to my husband (her dad) when he disciplined her as a child. 

Now I know my husband has and has always had a temper, he says no to everything, he shouts at us, he used to scream at her every time she said something that wasn't exactly what he wanted to hear, and he used physical punishment to discipline her. She wasn't a difficult child, she was a very good student and if sometimes she forgot to do her homework or had less than an A on a test, he would slap her on the face and scream at her. I understand this is not right but I didn't want to question his methods in front of her. He never laid a finger on me by the way but used to shout at me and treat me poorly and ruin family time often because things didn't go exactly as he wanted. 

One time he kicked her very hard several times under the table at dinner because she didn't want to go along with what he had planned for us to do that afternoon. Another time he punched her several times on the head because she refused to go and tell her manager why she was quitting her first job and would rather just not show up for work again. I didn't agree with this at the time and I still don't,  we nearly got a divorce both times but I didn't want to question him or stand up to him. 

But we gave my daughter everything. She went to private school, she bought herself brand clothes, she had a car as soon as she passed the driving test. So we spoiled her in other ways. And I have always been affectionate towards her even too much sometimes, I think to make up for what my husband didn't do.

Her relationship with her dad improved a lot since she moved out 5 years ago to go to college and he has changed his ways even with me. He has always loved her but now he is showing it and the screaming and physical punishments have stopped. They grew closer but I didn't grow any closer to my daughter and I dont understand why she won't let her guard down with me as much. 

How can I show her that I do regret what happened and that I wish we could be closer? I want to re-build trust.",12Jul2019,0
513,"Ok so I am a female and I have this guy friend (whom is gay), I’ll call him Phil. I’ve only just been noticing  that the past year he has been blaming me for a lot of things that I haven’t done. For example, one of my other friends made a plan with the group to go to the cinemas and suggested a random time, no one agreed to this time so we assumed nothing was happening. We get a message from Phil asking where everyone was as he was at the cinemas, we were all very confused as no one agreed to go at that time, so my other friend decided to deal with him. The whole thing was a mess they were both arguing and Phil was being very petty and rude towards my friend, I can understand Phil’s anger but he could at least told me he was there and I would have quickly gotten ready and met him so he wasn’t alone. However it turns out Phil told my other friend who made the plans that it was me he was angry at and aiming the petty messages to, but it wasn’t me who made the plans?? Or said I was going. 

Now that was just one thing but there have been numerous little things that he has blamed me for and gotten angry at me for...

- We were going to a day music festival together with a group, I was in charge of the tickets and Phil and his other friend were gonna get theirs off me early and go to the festival and I would meet them there. I was at a different festival the day before and was very tired, so I sent a text to Phil saying I would be joining them later, he said he was absolutely fine with that. So I wake up the next day at like 11am to message from Phil saying that his other friend had pulled out of going to the festival and that he will just go with me, I said that’s fine since I didn’t want him going on his own. But I asked if he was ok missing a certain band, as I planned on going after it was on, Phil said that was the only band he actually wanted to see at the festival, so I said that’s ok I’ll just get ready faster. All this time I’m getting ready, I get a message from my other friend asking why Phil is angry at me! I say I didn’t realise he was angry and if he was I would have assumed it was at his friend who pulled out of the festival. My friend says that Phil is saying that I’m not keeping him updated and that I’m being late on purpose. I was honestly so confused but I decided to just speed up getting ready and try to get there as fast as possible. When I got their Phil greeted me very happily and we even arrived half an hour before the band he wanted to see came on. (After the festival he still complained to my other friend about me).

Another thing to mention is that I got a boyfriend November last year, and it was soon after that Phil started acting up with me. I have been wondering if there’s a slight hint of jealousy that I’m not giving enough attention to my friends, but I always tried my hardest to spend time with everyone. But I just wonder. I always feel like I’m doing something wrong or I haven’t realised I’ve done something wrong with my friends. 
This has all put me off making my own plans just in case I’m blamed for plan changes or something. 

I really want to stay friends with Phil as we are on the same uni course and we have been friends since we were children, but I don’t know what to do or if I should confront Phil about this.

518,"I'm 22, started this band with my friend, 26. After six months of revolving-door musicians and trying to find a second guitarist/singer, we found someone on craigslist who was older than the requirements but we decided to let him play since he seemed cool and was really good at writing lyrics/guitar parts for the sound we were going for.

It wasn't until a few days before we went to record our EP in studio and revealed that he is much older than we thought. Honestly, too old for me to be comfortable playing in a band with as a 22 yo. Nothing against people playing in bands at a later age at all, but for me, it's too much of a difference and I can't relate to them.

I felt really uncomfortable the more we practiced with him throughout the months, his behavior just made me more and more uncomfortable. I just kept playing bc I genuinely just loved playing drums in a band and writing songs. But in the last month, he's missed four consecutive practices, which costs me and my bandmate money when he doesn't show up to contribute. Not to mention, he knew we were getting our EP mixed/mastered and seems to be refusing to pay his share bc he isn't answering our texts. He also didn't show up for the mastering session and has been complaining about how it came out. So it's up to 200+ dollars he's not contributing that we have to make up for.

After talking to my bandmate, we both decided it was time to hang up this project, cut our losses, and move on. But I'm afraid of how this guy will react. He talks a lot, and seems to let everyone know about the band he is in, despite not showing up to rehearsals or paying his share.

I don't know how to say ""we're done"" bc the band has only been the three of us the last four months. So if we're out, he has no band and I'm afraid of how he'll take it or that he or his friends will try to harass us for this.

I just want to move on. I don't even want to play in a band anymore, I just need to focus on my mental health and my own life but I don't know how to get away from this.",12Jul2019,2
519,"i have this friend and she’s super needy/clingy, it’s exhausting to deal with her all of the time. 

she texts me on a daily basis which is completely fine, i don’t mind that. but if i don’t respond in 10 minutes, she’ll text again, and then another 20 minutes go by, she’ll text again. and it’s this whole cycle. she eventually stops after a while. once i finally text her back, she asks “why didn’t you text me back?” or something along those lines. 

she wants to facetime me every single day. i swear she cannot go a day without facetiming me or else she will get upset. she will text me usually 3 times a day asking if i can face time. whenever i say no, she asks me why. sometimes i’m busy, other times i just straight up don’t want to talk to her or am not in the mood for whatever reason. whenever i say i’m busy she sometimes asks me “what are you busy with?”. whenever i say i don’t want to call, she again asks me why. and she also will beg me to call her. i tell her i don’t feel like talking, she asks me why again. this is so annoying, i don’t understand why she can’t just shut up and leave me alone for a second? 

recently, she has asked me to face time and i said okay. when i call, she picks up and she’s crying. i don’t mind if she’s crying but it immediately catches me off guard and i don’t know what to do or say. she has done this a few times very recently and she won’t tell me the reason why she’s crying. we usually sit there in silence for a while. 

she often talks about her problems, which is fine. but it gets to a point where it’s tiring. she’s so consumed in herself, she never understands my side of anything. she never asks me about what’s going on with me. she’s very aware that i have mental health issues, yet never cares to ask how i’m doing. she very rarely asks what’s wrong.

yesterday, i was playing a video game and i had been ignoring her text messages. she joined the game and typed in the chat “wth” and my response was “?” then she said “you aren’t responding to my text messages”. i didn’t respond to that and just thought to myself “fuck.” i do not understand why she thinks i MUST respond to her text messages all the fucking time. i just wanted to play a video game by myself and have fun without her for once. 

she does other things as well that make her clingy and needy but this is long enough so i will leave it at that.

Our dog is a boxer named Kira. She's been part of my husband's life for the past 14 years so she means a lot to him. She's kindly accepted me as a coparental figure as well and we are very close.

Lately I've noticed a change in Kira. She's sleeping a lot more, often in different rooms from us when she's usually been super social and wants to be right beside us at all times.

She also hasn't been eating much. My husband says she's stressed from all the changes in our home life... But I'm noticing significant weight loss and her refusal of beloved foods such as treats and bananas. And I worry.

She's also been moving around much more carefully these days. Her hips are bad and I know that comes with age, but I worry about how much pain she's in. Her vet says she has arthritis so this is not surprising... 

I've brought up putting her down.. But my husband is in pretty deep denial about the quality of his dog's life. I've pushed for getting her to the vet soon just to see what they say and he said we can't swing the money right now, especially if the vet says it's time. Her regular vet is fairly expensive... It would cost us $350 at the least to put her down besides whatever he wants to do with her remains.

Are there cheaper options I can look into to get her checked out/potentially put her down? (Please don't say a bullet...)

545,"TL/DR: My husband refuses to acknowledge a relationship with a co-worker is an emotional affair. Though contact has been reduced, she still reaches out to him and he doesn't see the need to set a boundary. I am at my wits end. I have tried almost everything except the extreme: I want to state that we need couples therapy and if he chooses not to comply that we need space to re-evaluate our marriage. Is this a good idea?

This is my first time posting here, so I appreciate any feedback. This might be long, but I really need outside opinions. I have been with my husband for going on five years - we married this year. We have known each other since we were elementary school children and have been friends almost our whole lives. We work opposite shifts so we rarely see each other. As a result, he became friends with a female co-worker that escalated quickly to what I deem an emotional affair. I do so because: 

\- Early upon meeting, she proposed ""swinging"" between her husband and my husband and I - without me or her husband present. My husband was upfront in telling me about it.

\-It came out that her marriage is on the rocks and a divorce is more than likely going to happen - after that, he told me that swinging would have been a bad idea (no shit). 

\-They would work out together every night and I would rarely, if ever hear from him until I physically saw him.

\- Now living together, she contacts him at all hours - even on our honeymoon. 

\-She claims to have ""no friends"" and relies on my husband for emotional support. My husband feels ""sorry for her."" 

\-She has a confessed ""boy toy,"" on the side. 

\-When I have been around her, she has been overly touchy with my husband, once even asking if what she was doing ""was okay.""

\-My husband while initially willing to break off the relationship is now adamant that no one will dictate who he can be friends with. 

\-I have expressed on multiple occasions my discomfort with their relationship and how it makes me feel unsafe, threatened, jealous and concerned. He has tried to reassure me, but the behavior only changed when his parents confronted him. He in turn became upset with me and said that his trust in me has been damaged. (I broke down in a moment of weakness to his mother because I hadn't talked to anyone about the depth of the issue).

\-Over the past few months he has told me things that make me believe that there is hope for our relationship: They no longer see each other outside of work, he is starting a new job soon, he has told me when she has texted him, he tells me what is in the messages, talks about our future together often, only talks about her in that he ""feels sorry for her"" (never talking about positive qualities) has told me he doesn't have romantic feelings for her though obviously there is a deep connection, continues to tell me that he loves me without prompting him, is open to talking whenever I ask, and has apologizes for how the last few months have been and that it wasn't his intention to hurt me (is it ever anyone's intention?). There have also been times where he's become frustrated at her saying things like: ""Uhg, go away so-and-so"" and has told me that we don't even compare in terms of goals and who we are as people. 

However, with how traumatic and hurtful this has been for me, none of this feels like enough. As I've ready many places, the way he has behaved is not my husband or the friend I have known so long. He has always been considerate of my feelings, warm and empathetic. This isn't the same person. I have seen glimmers of him over the past few months, but again this isn't enough. I don't believe I can move beyond this until he fully understands what his actions have done to me and our relationship and really takes responsibility and turns that into real action. Based on my most recent therapy, my counselor said that couples therapy is the next step. He doesn't like the idea of therapy, but at this point I feel helpless and lost with what else to do. He said that he will go with me if that's what I want, but doesn't see the need for it.   I want to tell him that for my health and our relationship that I need couples therapy. If he won't agree to go with me, I want to ask for physical space between us (he go stay with his parents or somewhere else) so we can both really think about our relationship. 

Because some progress has been achieved, I am hesitant to employ the ""I want space"" tactic in the extreme. Perhaps even emotional and physical space (sleeping in different beds, not reaching out to him which I already do, me doing more things on my own without him, etc). Part of me wonders if he is experiencing denial and guilt and feels stuck with what to do or how to do it. He isn't the most introspective person and usually tries to avoid conflict. The choice is obvious to outsiders, but he is a genuinely nice and caring person and I'm sure doesn't want to cause conflict at work. I also think that his passive and ""easy going"" nature is a huge reason as to why this situation ended up becoming what it is. He has no history of this kind of behavior, but that still doesn't excuse him not drawing a line when I expressed discomfort. I don't want him painted as a ""once a cheater, always a cheater"" because I know that isn't characteristic of him in all the years I have known him. He has always been up front and that is why I know so much about his co-worker and have been around her. That still doesn't eliminate my anger and pain, but I am hurting and need my best friend and husband. I don't think right now he can see beyond the end of his nose. Our relationship is starved of the intimacy and affection that was there early on and right before our marriage and I want to get that back, or have it be better than before.

However, I do acknowledge that if he isn't willing to move forward with me and work on things that I may have to move on without him, as painful as that is. I have to take care of myself and love myself first. I know that is a possibility, but I want to do all that I can first before dropping any kind of ultimatum. 

Please, any advice would be appreciated.",12Jul2019,1

  Okay so me(19) and my boyfriend(18) have been together for a year and a half now. However, throughout our relationship I have always questioned his honesty to me. Recently I found out he's into stepmom porn... but the thing is that seems to be the ONLY porn he watches. I could understand everyonce in a while but if its the only porn you watch that seems odd. 
  He has a stepmom of his own, too. The worst part is she is a redhead and ever since he was little he's had a fetish for redheads. He also mentioned the other day that growing up he accidentally saw her naked alot, which you all know happens. However it does bother me considering his two main fetishes are stepmoms and redheads, which she fits into both those categories. I've specially seen him look at redheaded stepmom porn more than once. Its almost always lesbian porn vs stepmom and stepson but still.

So, clearly, I need some advice. My parents often post about me on their Facebook pages or Instagram, which I am very strongly against. I don’t even have Facebook, Twitter, Instagram because I value my privacy a lot.
I have spoken with my parents about this and, while they have reduced the amount that they post about it, it hasn’t completely stopped. Sometimes it is even identifying information (my place of work, for example, was mentioned in one post). In addition, I am quite different from them politically and, unfortunately, they occasionally say some mildly racist or otherwise ignorant things with which I do NOT want to be associated AT ALL. 
As I do not have social media accounts myself, it is a challenge for me to monitor what they are posting about me, so I have no permanent solution. What can I do to make them stop?

553,"Hello there, so honestly this is just me ranting about myself, so stick around if you're interested. (And i'm sorry in advance for this rant and the bad English lol.) *TL;DR at end*

I have been an introvert for about a couple of years now, and I currently have no friends. No one to talk /text to casually, no one to go out with, and no one to play games with me (my favourite thing to do). I feel like the loneliness is starting to eat me up now. I have zero motivation, I feel tired everyday, I feel like I'm forcing myself to enjoy my hobbies (because it feels so empty, so meaningless like it's missing something) , and I just always want to cry when I see people having fun with their friends for no reason...

*Disclaimer:
 I don't have problems with being alone, or what other people choose to be. I think being alone can give you a lot of time for you to reflect on yourself. 

So that's why i'm trying to find and make friends (through those ""chatting with strangers apps) but there're a few problems with that (I mean i know that you need to listen more in conversation and not talk too much, etc.). See, i feel like i don't know how to keep a conversation interesting:   I ask them stuff, they answer and i share mine, but  then... what's next? What comes after ""what do you do for fun?""? What happens if you don't have the same hobby? How do people talk daily, and joke around with each other? It's so damn hard, so please share any tips on ""talking"" if you do have some.

TL;DR: I'm having trouble keeping conversation interesting, like what do people talk about daily? What do you do if you're talking with someone who doesnt have the same hobby as yours? And how do you make friends. So, please help me.",12Jul2019,1
554,"Yesterday, when I was driving home from work my ex and I saw each other in passing going opposite directions. We went no contact 4 months ago, and have been broken up for well over a year. I checked my rear view just to take a look as it was an interesting sight. It hurt for a minute, but I kept on driving and proceeded  on into my day to go meet a friend. She was a few lights behind me, and I thought nothing of it after a few minutes. Then, checking my driverside mirror at a light, which is just good driving behavior, I saw a car that looked like hers a few rows down. 

I was now 2 towns over, and several miles from where I saw her when she was headed the entirely opposite direction. 

To set the scene on this person, 

she has not respected my request of no contact twice now. She left a letter in my truck, when it was parked outside of my house. She showed up at my work place, obviously without warning and unwanted. She has called me an unnecessary amount of times on a consistent basis despite all of her calls going to voicemail. She has followed me on all mediums, so I blocked her again. She has also sent pictures of my house via google earth to me over text back when we were talking, followed by what song I was listening to due to spotify's feed &amp; then more pictures of inside my house via zillow. 

It was weird. 

She followed me up until our cars were parallel to one another &amp; she had her window down. I was restricted from being directly aligned from her by one car ahead of me. She jumped in front of that car and then switched into the rightmost lane, just stalling, waiting. Eventually she had to swoop into a shopping center. Our cars were directly aligned at one point, but I played it cool and just starred straight ahead singing along to a song ( playing it kind of absent minded). 

Anyway, all of this to say, these offenses against my request of no contact have gotten wildly out of hand. Being followed is something I think is either a huge cry to reconnect or it may be aggressive. 

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I think it's aggressive is because the only time she ever got my attention during no contact was a time she utilized to tell me she loved someone else and that the only time she would ever have me take her back was if she was crying at my doorsteps, which was an insane conversation because i literally had just told her I was not interested / had a new SO, etc. 

I don't understand this person's intentions for me, and i wonder if their only doing it to hurt me or if they just want to talk again? No idea. 

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't responded to the situation aside from telling a few friends, all of which suggest an RO may be a good idea. 

I don't want to get an RO, as she leaves in 2 months for college and by the time she gets back I'll likely be living in a different town, so it seems pointless. I just want to ensure i am standing up for myself properly by holding silence or if I should actually do something, like reach out and say no contact again or actually go through with the RO.",12Jul2019,2
555,"Hi all,

I'm 22 and recently began my career as an analyst in a rotational program for a large and popular corporation. Most of my college career was spent as an accounting major and leveraging this I was able to obtain a co-op and a couple internships with the company I work for now. These weren't strictly accounting roles but mainly focused around finance with some analysis of spreadsheets.  However, later in college I began exploring data science and fell in love with it immediately. I added business analytics as a second major and began modeling, coding, and even published some research with the help of the data science department of my school (my buddy and I are actually working ot develop a website and then app based on this research in the future). 

Through my co-op/internships, I accepted a full-time offer into this company's prestigious rotational program (2 rotations) within finance with competitive pay, excellent benefits, and a lot of room for climbing up the corporate ladder. The culture and the employees are great and I have a decent amount of flexibility (can work remotely as I please and can help with projects cross-functionally).  My family is extremely proud of this...but the one issue is I don't like my job.  It's very manual and involves a bunch of tedious/BS requests.  As one of my coworkers has said, we're ""analysts"" that don't really analyze anything..just filling out files and templates.  I'm far-removed from the data science field in my job but I try to study statistics and program in my spare time.  I'm going to try networking within my company to hopefully establish relationships with data science roles within the company (if they exist).

At this point, I'm unsure whether to wait this out and see if I can get a different role within the company or jump ship to another one altogether because I really like the company but I can't stand my job.  I'm unsure how to go about this,but if it helps at all I graduated from a fairly high-ranking business school with a 3.8 GPA and I currently have no student debt. Any help would be much appreciated!",12Jul2019,1
556,"I will try to be as concise as possible. I am a 25 year old male with a Bachelor's degree in physics and have been living and working at a startup (less than 40 employees) in Austin, Texas. I make $50k and am completely miserable for several reasons. I have been literally ignored about a raise on 3 separate conversations/meetings that I have setup with my director and CEO. The culture is a nightmare and I'm always assumed to be wrong since I don't have a Ph. D. in something, but I have raised points too many times to count that have come back to cost the company upwards of a few hundred thousand dollars. I am frustrated because of the inability to manage capital and employees. I feel like I am stuck doing all of the work with no recognition or career mobility. In addition, the company moved locations so now I sit in my car for 10 hours each week as I sit on the freeway for an hour before and after my workday (the most suicidally inducing, soul-draining exercise ever). I can't even force myself to smile or be happy anymore and have been in therapy for a few months in a desperate attempt to save my relationship of 6 years. 


In order to reach this point, I was unemployed for 8 months after graduation and applied to about 200 positions. In the last few months, I have applied to at least another 20 positions with no call-backs. If I search my major, physics, on any website like Indeed then I have to sort through about 300 jobs before I can find one that is actually feasible for me since I suck and have no interest in learning software. I have another opportunity, but I'm struggling with accepting the offer because it is no salary or benefits and solely commission selling supplemental life insurance. I have been reconsidering my career since I always thought of doing R&amp;D, but now that I'm seeing how much I despise academics and there are no other options for me I can't help but feel like I need to make a major change.


Does anyone have advice or been in a similar position at some point in your life? I would really appreciate any feedback because I am about to go on my first ever vacation and plan on doing a ton of soul searching. I have honestly been planning on putting in my 2 weeks the moment my plane lands so I can force myself in some other direction rather than my toxic work environment. I just can't imagine this for another 30 years (let alone another year). I spend 70% of my waking hours doing something for a job I hate and think about killing myself about half of the time. By the time I'm home, I have no energy to even pretend to be happy or try to do the things that bring me joy.


Last night, I was considering teaching AP physics part time to see if teaching would be a better option for me. I have 6 months of expenses saved up in my emergency fund, but I really dont want to make the wrong choice here. Reddit, help this suicidal young man and give me clarity. Should I stay or should I go?

I will edit or repost to a better subreddit once I have time. I'm at lunch right now and did this on mobile so it might seem thrown together.",12Jul2019,1

561,"So, I just graduated high school in the June, but I'm already almost a sophomore thanks to dual credit and summer courses. This however means that I need to figure out my plan quick if I continue at this pace. 

I'm majoring in anthropology, but I want to make myself as marketable as possible due to the competitiveness of the anthropology field, especially as an archaeologist. I was wondering if possibly I should double major for a Bachelor in History as well, and two of the schools I'm considering also offer a bachelor in Classical Studies. Triple major? But they also offer World Cultures and Literature, but maybe I should just minor in that.

And for other minors, one school also offers Latin and Greek minors, which I think I'd possibly love taking. Would that be too many minors, if I were to take World Culture and Literatures and/or Classical Studies as minor? How useful are minors anyway, or even multiple bachelor degrees? 

And lastly, I'm also interested in possibly getting a degree in something like foresting or wildlife and fisheries, as in my EDUC class we had to do a project over a career based on our personality type (like mine is INTP) and I chose forest ranger, and I really like the idea of it, especially as a sort of backup if anthropology doesn't work out or for later in life if I want a career change. Obviously, I'll take a few classes to see if the subject truly interests me enough to get a whole degree, but if it does, what do I do? I really don't think I could quadruple major. Maybe in something like Anthropology, History, Classical Studies, and World Cultures and Literature where a fair amount of it overlaps, but I don't know about just throwing Forestry in there. 

My main goal is to make myself as marketable as possible, and to try to open as many doors for future me as I can just in case one thing doesn't work out. Most of my interests and skill set aren't going to get me highly paid, (like I like and am good at art, but know I'd likely just be a starving artist should I make it a career) and so I'm just trying to set a good foundation for myself. I just don't know if this is a good idea, and neither of my parents finished their undergrad and no one in my family has majored in anth so I just don't know. Help?",12Jul2019,1

564,"I'm 18 soon to be going to university in Scotland. For some back story I have had a lot of issues with my health when i was younger including multiple surgeries but now i struggle with quite bad anxiety and a dash of depression to seal the deal. I see a mental health nurse and am on the NHS but i feel like I'm just being put through the system without any real improvements being seen if anything getting worse. I have a large group of friends but they have shown over the years to be kinda a bunch as assholes. I know the anxiety thing or the bad health doesn't seem to be related but my asshole friends make jokes about it and honestly make it worse and a lot of my anxiety stems from this time in my life.

Once we made plans to go to the cinema and i ended up going alone and nobody told me they weren't going anymore. One of them lied afterwards and said her mum was ill. She was with her boyfriend. This kind of behaviour is pretty normal for them and i feel sick of trying to make plans when i always end up hurt because of it. My friends are super flaky and ditch each other at the slightest chance to do something they see as better.

My friends date each other and then break up and then cheat then backstab and its exhausting. I am in a stable relationship for well over a year and just started a full time job to get more money before i go to uni meanwhile my friends try to get out of paying for things or sleeping with each other then having issues where they can't be in the same room. For example a couple in the group had issues so he sought out affection with one of the other girls and now its this whole cluster fuck and I'm so just done.

The more i interact with people outside my friends the less i want to see my old friends. I don't know what to do as I'm in this in between of crippling loneliness and not wanting to see anyone. Obviously they have some redeeming qualities but everytime i see them some new drama has to happen or someone's doing something and it stresses me out and i don't know whether its worth the effort anymore. 

I'm afraid to do anything incase it sparks some kind of issues but at this point i don't know whether to just bear with it till university and then hopefully move on with my life or what.

A bit of details on how my school (and the Australian education system) works. After a 10 week school term we get 2-3 weeks of holidays and then after 3 terms we get 8 weeks. During these holidays my mum ALWAYS flies my brother and I down to Melbourne. So around a 1/3 of the year, I'm in Melbourne, not my hometown Brisbane.

There has not been one school holidays where we have not been in Melbourne. For my whole life my family has done this.  I've missed out on countless social events and birthday parties, and we barely even do anything in Melbourne. It's so depressing watching everyone be social on Instagram, it's really bad. I just sit in my room doing jack shit and what's worse is I can't even bring my guitar and piano down to practice.

Recently, I reached the legal age to get a job and I've been desperate to get one. I need money. I want to start saving up and buying my own things. I want a new piano, a microphone (for desired career in music), the ability to pay for my own haircuts and just having my own money so I can be independent.

But the thing is. I can never work on holidays. Mum always flies us down. I've been denied by fucking everyone because I can't be there on the holidays. It's draining, the holidays fucking suck. But I'm never in one place for more than 10 weeks. 

Is there any way around this? Does anyone have advice?

Also, I should mention that my mum would not pay for any of this stuff. It's her hard earned money and I understand that. That's WHY I want a job. So I can pay for my own stuff. But if I want anything there's a guaranteed 20 weeks of labour and guilt tripping before I get it. We already practically go broke anyway on how much we spend on these plane tickets.

575,"Hey.

This is a complex situation, and I'm going to try to keep it short. Here's the very short story: **I want to get brainwashed.**

NOT in any negative way. Here's the current definition I hold of brainwashing - just to tidy this up. If it's wrong, please correct me. From what I've gathered its the practice of making an individual 100% undoubtedly believe in anything - solid conviction. Brainwashing might not be the correct term, I don't know, but I hope that will clear things up a little.

For some time now, I've had some serious interest in politics - and I fairly recently started the study of Business and Economics so I can understand some more political lingo. I won't say which side I'm on, even though I've probably unconsciously revealed it before somewhere - so that'd be the first mistake.

Here's what I want to achieve by ""brainwashing"" myself (if that's the correct term, again). *I want to have 100% conviction in a political ideology.* 

Who would be able to do this to me? I have a fairly large budget to achieve this - any help would be appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

I already surround myself with content promoting this ideology, listen to as many podcasts, news reports, interviews with politicians following the ideology I want to believe in.

&amp;#x200B;

It's a very strange request, I'm aware, but would like this taken seriously.

&amp;#x200B;

I want a future in politics - and I'm taking small steps towards it. I've been offered work experience in the House of Commons working for MP's of the party I support, however, need 100% conviction to progress. As mentioned previously, I'm beginning what is soon to become very intense studying of this political ideology and the basic political lingo I need to understand.

598,"So there's a bit of a backstory here, Anne (the name I'll be using as my friend for anonymity) has been my really close friend for about two years now, we had wonderful moments and spent a lot of time together over that time, I trusted her a lot. 

A few months ago we played around with the idea of dating, but it fell apart when I found out Anne was texting one of my friends about pretty sexual and physical stuff, all the while promising that she maintained loyalty and wanted to be with me. She had recently been out of a fairly long relationship and said that she 1. Wasn't seriously pursuing this person 2. Wasn't ready for committment because she was had just come out of the relationship. We decided to be friends after this and all was well for a while.

Fast forward to a few weeks from now and Anne barely messages me, ignores a lot of my attempts to chat or check up, when we do make plans they're usually pushed back on her terms for a while, and when we actually hang out she tells me that she misses me a lot, that she genuinely likes the idea of hanging out with me and pursue our plans (as opposed to other people, I suppose). She also says that she feels like she can't control her feelings around me after our short stint earlier. I have started to see this as emotional manipulation, I'm not sure what the end goal is but she verbally voices these things and then shows no effort on them.

As of late, on her end, I've seen no effort from her to spend any time or keep in touch at all, I felt really distant, and after a while of giving her the benefit of the doubt (she's a really busy person with work, a big family of siblings, etc), I confronted her about how the friendship feels like an obligation to her and I'd like to talk about it because I've felt confused. She read that message and hasn't messaged me at all since (roughly 6 days now). This is unusual because we usually keep in touch on the daily.

I'm really exhausted of playing these kinds of immature and manipulative games, I don't believe she's been honest with me even when reassuring me that she has, and I'm tired of chasing her around. I felt like my feelings were valid and I feel like if she felt a certain way and brought it up non-maliciously, then I would be happy to talk and clear anything up. I suspect that she tells everybody in her life the same kinds of ""I miss you so much, miss hanging out"" type of things. This is just speculation, but based on what I wrote, do you think this friendship is one worth pursuing? Where do I cut it off? This friend group associated with her has been a large part of my life for quite some time, I do have other great friends but I'd hate to lose these guys over something that seems so stupid and small. Thanks guys.",12Jul2019,1
600,"Ok, i will make this short.

i have been dating my bf (lets call him bf1) for 2 years and started cheating on him the past 6 months. He saw a pic of me and my new bf (bf2) kissing and he confronted me, i acted as if i am the victim, cried, cried, cried and told him that i only met him once because i was depressed and that he is blackmailing me now. That i was afraid he will tell you. He believed me and told me that he will help me. He took bf2s phone number from me.

Then, bf2 called me and asked to meet me, he told me that bf1 called him and asked to meet him. He asked why bf1 still acting this way and stuff, he was mad. Then i started to cry, cry, cry, i said that i am scared of bf1 that he doesnt understand that i dont like him anymore and that he wants to force me to be his gf, He believed me and told me not to worry.

But, bf2, came to my school, today was the last day. He stood in front of the school waiting for bf1. Then bf1 saw him and they both met for the first time, i was clueless, i came out of the school and just saw the two guys arguing. My older brother (26), who came to pick me up recognized bf1 and was standing with him.

Then when bf2 saw me, he said stuff i didnt even understand because i was so scared. Then bf1 jumped bf2 and my brother started to break them apart but he failed. They fought for like 20 mins, people will break them apart but they will just jump each other again. they both bled but bf2 bled a lot.

Did i wait to get confronted? no. I ran as fast as i could to the bus station. I even left my brother there.

My brother and bf1 went home together. I was in my room when i heard them come in, did i stay home? no. I sneaked out, i took some clothes and my laptop and i am in my friends now.

My brother called me but i didnt answer.

I dont even know why i am running away.

I am afraid i will get beaten up by my bfs, i really am still shocked and traumatized by how they fought. I know i am manipulative but things got out of control.

604,"So, I posted here yesterday with the request for some tips when going in for surgery, because I'm very scared of needles. I was having a tonsillectomy. Someone asked me to post an update after the operation, so here I am again.

I'm very happy to report that everything went well. It definitely wasn't as bad as I feared, only going under anesthesia was a very scary feeling to me. When the anesthesiologist pushed the drugs through my IV, I got quite dizzy and I felt pretty scared. It's a very weird and heavy feeling, and I don't quite know what to call it. 

Next thing I knew, I woke up at the recovery ward, still feeling quite dizzy and a bit tired. Luckily I didn't feel sick whatsoever and a nurse came to me as soon as I was awake with ice water so I could drink a bit through a straw. After that, she brought me an ice cream, which I ate while I really woke up. While she was giving me water, I was still in a bit of a semi-conscious state. 

After I woke up a bit, my nurse came to get me to take me back to the ward, where I stayed for about two more hours. My parents were both with me there and I had three more ice creams and half a can of ice water before the nurse said I was ready to go home.

I've been home for about four hours now and I'm doing fine. Of course, my throat is quite sore, but I'm getting painkillers and the ice helps sooth it. Luckily, I'm not feeling nauseous or dizzy, but my ears are hurting a very little bit if I don't drink enough. So for now, it's just resting and making sure I drink and have an ice cream every two hours. 

I want to thank all of you wonderful people who commented on my original post. The tips helped me remember that it was okay to feel scared and that I wasn't alone, and that eventually everything was going to be fine. Thank you! ❤️",12Jul2019,1

606,"So, I've been accepted onto a degree level apprenticeship scheme with this research institution. I had to pass an assessment which I was able to do with my very beginners knowledge of python and some online help (i.e. documentation and github). I made this clear in the interview that I'm very much a beginner and I still ended up getting the position. I noticed that the yearly outline of the scheme focuses on programming in java. I've never used java before, ever.

I'm still getting the hang of python a month later and because of current life events getting in the way, I'm not able to study as much as I'd like to. As such, I've learned next to nothing new since my interview.

My question is, should I continue with python, since it's something I've already got a little experience in or should I learn some java? Do you think I should worry at all? This is an apprenticeship program after all, they're supposed to teach me and I got the position even though I made it clear that I'm a beginner.

Just a brief about myself, i have studied bachelors in business marketing and have 7 years experience in sales in Dubai. I worked for some good companies but in general i hated sales and cant imagine myself working it for the rest of my life (couldn’t shift to marketing or other business paths due to my resume being only sales).

613,"So to understand this story I'm going to give a backstory from 2 years ago: I was helping my mom organize the downstairs room and she found out that I drank from the lemonade bottle downstairs.

The lemonade wasn't alchohol, it was lemonade. She spun it around to make me look crazy. Like wtf. Then my dad started yelling at me like a bitch. Saying something along the lines of ""I'm trying to be like those white party girls"", when he said that I wanted to beat the living fuck out of him.

So here is when the story actually starts: I was helping my mom clean the closet and while I was helping her clean it she made a joke asking if I was sober and then she said ""did I drink alcohol again?"" That sentence triggered the fuck outta me. I rolled my eyes at her, and she said ""did you roll your eyes at me?"" I started crying.

616,"I know the title is kind of vague but I honestly didn’t know how else to put it. I feel as if I carry around so much emotional baggage (resentment, bad coping mechanisms, poor communication skills) from my childhood.  It’s slowly killing my marriage and I don’t ever want to push my shit onto my beautiful 6 month old child. I feel like it’s time that I really address this stuff and work through it. I need to be better for myself and my family. 

My childhood wasn’t particularly bad but I feel like the scars it’s left affect me on a daily basis. 

So background Info...

I’ll start with my mother who is Asian and from a country with a very traditional culture. 

My mother had a traumatic childhood. She was taught early on that she was worthless and “low class” and she watched her close family members get treated very poorly by other family. This lead to her having crippling low self esteem and she coped with the abuse she experienced by developing explosive anger episodes as a defense mechanism. She left home at age 12 and didn’t return until she had graduated college. Before she met my dad she was in a relationship with another man who habitually cheated on her and she repeatedly “took him back” but eventually at age 27 they broke up for good. She then met my dad, married him, and moved back to the US with him. 

Onto my father, my father is a white guy who was a geeky kid. He putzed around in his 20s without my motivation career wise until he met a woman whom I think he truly loved. She liked expensive things so my dad became very work oriented in order to provide for her. She ended up putting him in a ton of debt and then left him. My dad spiraled down for a while before getting a job with the state department and living that ex-pat life. Hence how he ended up in Asia and hence how he met my mom. 

My mom and dad have never been “in love”. The way my mom puts it is they have a “business arrangement”. She wanted to leave her home country and come to the US to start a family. My dad needed a wife to cook, clean, have kids etc. obviously they love each other but they’re not “in love” if that makes sense... my dad also had an affair when I was in kindergarten. My parents would fight pretty regularly and then they kind of just became indifferent to each other like roommates. 

Okay now onto stuff that occurred during my childhood: 
- my mom’s low self esteem meant that she derived all her happiness from me and my siblings successes. This meant we were not “allowed” to make mistakes. Like regular kid mistakes. If we did she would blow up (yelling, verbal attacks, physical attacks). 
- her low self esteem also lead to her constantly thinking everyone is judging her for being Asian or for being a woman, or whatever. She constantly thinks everyone hates her and she DEFINITELY passed on that social anxiety to me. 
- my mom’s early exposure to being told she was “low class” made her obsessed with us being “high class”. If we did something “low class” cue the anger explosions. 
- my mom constantly told me that I needed to meet a good man before it was too late or else I would end up 27 and single like she was and having to settle. She also told me men just want sex so I need to always make sure I take care of my man in that way. Like what the fuck....? 
- my dad pretty much always prioritized work over the family. He moved us around about every 3-5 years. I don’t have a “hometown” because of it and that honestly really affects me. 

They both tried their best. I know they love me. I don’t want to resent them or be angry at them I need help working through the effects of these things...

I feel like I don’t know how to cope with my emotions other than becoming angry. I know that I’m feeling rejected or I’m feeling sad but I outwardly display hostility or anger. 

I don’t know what a functioning, loving relationship looks like. I feel like I push my husband away and don’t allow him to be close to me. 

Most of my self esteem is derived from my physical appearance. I am attractive and I was taught my power comes from my sexuality. It’s one of the only things I feel that I like about myself. However I just had a baby so now I don’t know how to recover my self esteem? 

I constantly feel like everyone hates me. I’m not good enough etc etc. imposters syndrome? I think is what it’s called? So I act “too cool” as a defense mechanism which genuinely makes people now like me...

I know therapy is obviously the way to go. Half of this post is just me needing to get this down but has anyone dealt with any of these things? Am I just overthinking everything? I grew up with 2 parents. Upper middle class. Nice houses. Why do I feel like I’m not well adjusted? 

If you made it this far you’re awesome. Thank you for reading this hot mess.",12Jul2019,1
617,"Throwaway because there’s some identifying information here. 

I recently got accepted to two different masters programs and have been extremely indecisive these past few days. I graduated with my BSBA in Accounting and minored in Political Science just two months ago. I have an acceptance to an MS in Tax program with slightly less than a half scholarship. I feel like this would be the more practical one to go with considering my background and could help prepare me for the CPA. However, I just don’t see myself fulfilling my passion in a 9-5 Office environment (even busier in busy tax season). I was also accepted to a masters in elections and political management. Everyone I know sees me light up when I talk about politics and I feel like it’s something I would enjoy doing. I did work in a government office for some of my undergrad and liked it. If my ultimate goal is maybe going to law school and doing government law, would it make more sense to skip the tax and do the elections masters? The elections masters gave me less scholarship so it would cost a little more. Either program I see myself with a 20k loan to add to my 25k undergrad loan. They are both a year long. I just don’t know what to do because I’m very passionate about politics and it is an election year so I could make something huge out of it. On the other hand it is incredibly niche and I’m just worried that taking out a loan for something like that will never see the light of day being paid back.

All my college friends drive home to their parents on weekends.

I live in a decent flat with a room that I am renting out to other college students. My current roommate will leave starting september.

Now comes the question:
I have 2 options when it comes to a new roommate.

Either I cast a completely new one or another good friend of mine moves in.

With the completely new one there is a potential of finding a new friend. Someone I can hang out with on the weekends.
Although that is somewhat speculation. Maybe we dont get along together that well in the end.

With my friend I am pretty certain that we will have a great time together. Only problem is that he will be home for half of the year straight because of his football team having games. The other half he will be in our apartment more or less.

630,"Okay, I'm going to sound like a jerk, I feel like one and I absolutely hate it, it makes me depressed but I truly can't control this. Everytime I find a girl that's beautiful and interesting and that grabs my attention I go for it. I enjoy a lot the talking face, I make sure to make her happy and have good conversations, get to know her. Then when she starts liking me back, when she reciprocates that affection I just suddenly stop liking her. It's not like I'm trying to be a douchebag and play with her, not at all, I only talk with a girl because I seek a relationship, something serious; it's just that once she likes me back I lose interest, I don't feel comfortable around her, I could say kinda disgusted too. I know, it's awful. This happens to me all the time and I hate it because I have to end things and it hurts them and then I feel really bad.

I'm just scared that I'll never find a partner, I'm literally distancing myself from any girl I like because I don't want to hurt them. What's wrong with me!? I just want to love someone, enjoy the rest of my life with a person but I barely last 3 months talking with someone and then I leave them. Help",12Jul2019,1
631,"okay, so i met this guy around 1,5 years ago at school. we became friends, with nothing really going on between us, or so i thought. until around nine months ago, he admitted he was in love with me. i wasnt so sure about my feelings and panicked so i friendzoned him. after a time he came out as bisexual and started dating one of my not so close guy friends. relationship didnt go so well and my he broke up with my friend. i always had this thing for him but i just wasnt really sure, and when he started dating my friend it was kind of game over for me. 
a few months later i dropped out of school for personal reasons and we didnt see eachother that often anymore. until recently, we saw eachother again at a party. and somehow, my teenage heart just fell hard for him. i really dont know the point of it, it just happened... we kept chatting over whatsapp and gamed together. i really wanted to see him so i arranged to meet with him and another friend, and we had a great time. 
somehow i am, after knowing him for 1,5 year, hardcore crushing on him, but i just dont know if its mutual. sinds he confessed to me and now, almost a year has passed, and in the meantime he dated one of my friends (which he now says he regrets). i have no idea what to do and feel kind of stupid putting him in the friendzone, because i now want him out of there lol. i dont know why my stupid brain decided to love something else then pets but i really need the good advice guru’s of reddit to come help me out...",12Jul2019,0
632,"I’m a first year now becoming a 2nd year wrestler. This summer 90% of the wrestlers not including me have gone to a University to train and workout and learn new moves. This is knowledge I found on their social media page probably not 100% accurate. You get the idea. I’ve skipped this year to do a summer program at my school that basically show’s 7th graders our school to see if they’re interested. Also you have to take a test and essay to get in. This thing I’m doing is called tutoring in the program.

Situation:  With wrestling, I looked at what the other wrestlers are doing on their social media page, I felt kinda bad because I’m missing out on everything and they’re the type of people that trash talk you if you miss something kinda big. Also I might get carried if I get into varsity. With the summer program at my school, I’ve been wanting my brother to go in for a long time. You have to become a tutor in advance that way you could proctor the kids (kinda sucks). I don’t want to become a tutor again if my brother doesn’t get in.

636,"im living at home for a few months after some issues caused me to drop of out school and lose my job.  My parents will completely ignore my locked door and just open it with their keys every time (its one of those doors you just gotta twist the lock with a paperclip or something to open it).  Every time I leave the house they go through my shit, my parents are very strict, they wont even let me use a vape around them.  Im trying to get my shit together but i still lean on drugs from time to time to deal with my shit, ive got some vodka, about a half ounce of pot and a few grams of coke stashed throughout my room, a few pipes grinders n shit.  And ive got some stuff on my PC i dont want people seeing, i meshed with some bad groups online for a few years where DDoSing, Doxing, SWATing, pizza bombing, massive IP lists, scamming etc were considered normal, they were pretty toxic communites that DDoSing full groups to win fights was common so most of my early teens we had a lot of issues with the home internet being DDoSed, and ive had some issues with online gambling through the years, nothing more than a few grand but my parents definitely wouldnt approve.  Im really uncomfortable with my parents going through my stuff because they think im a good kid and i dont want to ruin their vision of me.  


It makes me very uncomfortable having people snoop around my room.  I was sure they were doing it so I started setting up little traps to catch them.  Ill put clothes on the ground inside my door so if anyone opens my door the clothes will be moved and ill know someone was in here.  A lot of the time Ill see when I leave the house someone goes through my closet and room.  I also put my headphones over my mouse on a specific angle so if someone uses my mouse Ill know because the headphones will be moved.  Ill also unplug the back of my monitor but barely so they cant tell why my monitor isn't turning on.  I can see that someone definitely tried to use my mouse but I get they couldnt figure the monitor out.  Am I in the wrong here?

639,"So I helped my friend move out of his toxic family household a few months ago.

Because he suffers from some major childhood trauma (because of his family's toxicity) he still acts like a child. He's 18. He is in the process of moving into a new place by himself but he won't take any action into improving his lifestyle or life skills and won't listen to me (or anyone) and won't accept any advice. He doesn't have any life skills whatsoever. I literally had to write an email for him literally just asking a house owner to go look at a room in their home this weekend. He doesn't know how to cook and whenever he's shown or told how to do anything he always says ""Don't show me, write it down because I won't remember"" (this is because he smokes weed EVERY day and doesn't know when to stop, he literally didn't even remember that I went to his current place LAST NIGHT because he got so high. I'm in the same classes as him at the moment and even with written instruction, he can't even perform those tasks.

His dad died when he was young and because of this he keeps telling me ""you're not my dad yadda yadda yadda"" and proceeds to throw a tantrum whenever anything serious comes up. Whenever he gets drunk or high he doesn't know when to stop. I try to prevent him from having another drink or smoking another cone and he just does it anyway because he has no self-control.

I've been through the not accepting advice or help and smoking weed every day, and he wonders why he's so god damn broke. I believe weed is good in moderation but this kid doesn't know when to stop.

I've gone above and beyond my emotional and mental crisis capacity for this guy. I've tried all possible modes of assistance, taking it slow, trying to kick his ass into gear, leaving him alone for a week or two and none of it has worked.

I've almost completely emotionally detached myself from him and his situation because of the reasons above.

It's 3:30 am and we're working together today at 8 am onwards, I had to get him home tonight because he got way too drunk after I told him not too.  
I'm at a loss, I feel I've done everything I can.

Before I completely detach myself. What can I do differently to help the kid out?

644,"I (17F) am a senior in high school, and I feel like I’m pretty involved in my school and community. I have an academic letter, I’ve taken three AP classes, I’m the president of three clubs, involved in two more, and I’m also a part of five different organizations outside of school. 

This summer I’ve also started working part time, and I work a ton of hours each week. 

Whenever I’m not busy, I love to sit down and play video games. It’s always been a hobby of mine, and I enjoy it a lot. 

However, stepdad absolutely ABHORS the fact that I play them. He thinks that I’m lazy, and I do nothing but take up space in my room. 

Every time something bad happens, he exclaims that it’s because: “I’m always in my room playing games!” Usually, though, it’s because of his two kids. 

My mom also isn’t really a fan of it because she thinks it’s a waste of time. Although I have plenty of other hobbies like playing the guitar, boxing, and watching basketball, she always mentions that I should find “more productive hobbies” whenever she catches me playing games. 

They constantly feel the need to bring up that gaming makes me lazy and that I need to find a new hobby. 

It’s not like I play them a lot either, I just do it on the weekends because I spend eery day after school until around 7:30 for club-related stuff. 

It pisses me off a little bit because I know for a FACT that I’m not lazy and I also sincerely think that playing video games isn’t a bad hobby at all. I also pay for all of my games and the systems I buy, so I’m not really hurting anyone.

They are proud I contacted them when having that episode. They said I have to “take it as a win”. I have generic body image issues and I think I’m dumb. I just don’t like myself and don’t believe others should like me either. 

I always dismiss it and say I’m an average person and nothing’s special. I know a lot of people are like this too. But I feel like a dick for dismissing their statements.

I tell them about my weight loss and how my college student body looks like a moms body. I haven’t had kids but man do I have a saggy stomach like I did.

654,"Hey all, I don't know if this is the right sub for this, if it isn't point me in the right direction please. My issue seems way less critical than the others on here. But here goes.

TLDR: The few friends I have would rather hang out with their other friends than with me. 

I have a small 'group' of friends, me and 2 others. They are the only real friends I have. One of them is a childhood best friend, I have known him since I was 5ish years old. And the other I became friends with in the first year of middle school.

During middle school I am confident in saying that we were all best friends of each other. But once we were done with middle school and we all went our separate ways to college, we kept in contact and frequently hung out, but this slowly died off as they got in new friend groups in their classes. Now we hang out maybe once every 2 months. 

I don’t have any other 'real' friends. Most people like me, but I am no ones close friend. I always put all my energy into doing fun things with my little group. Whereas they seem to be willing to ditch me if their friends come calling. Yet when we do hang out we all have a great time. But I think if I stop starting conversations in our group chat, it would be dead silent. 

I think a big reason for me not having any real friends is because I am not a big drinker or party-goer, I'd rather be at home and chill out with my friends, play some games.

At this point, I feel like shit, I suck at making friends and the ones I do have and hoped would be friends for life seem to be abandoning me. What do I do? Have you experienced similar issues?",12Jul2019,1

658,"Hey, I'll make this as short as possible.

I've been looking to talk to someone for quite some time now about this, but I feel afraid and unable to.

My parents would listen, but there's not much they can do. My other friend group isn't really the type of people to confide in so much, especially since I'm known as the """"edgy"""" one because i used to make edgy jokes when i was 12 (its stuck around the entire time lol).

&amp;#x200B;

So, I've lived in the same home all of my life. Same street. Mainly the same neighbors.

The two neighbors closest to my age are one year older than me, and two years older than me. Both of them are some of the worst people I think I've ever met. They weren't like this from the start, mind you, which is why I always hung out with them from when I was about 5 years old. Now the one who is two years older to me isn't as much of a concern to me as the one who is one year older. 

Now the one who is one year older than me is someone who I speak to fairly often. He's not considered the nicest of the bunch, as he often fights with his parents and never does what they ask. When I'm alone with him or talking in person, it isn't that bad. But when I get in a voice call with him it turns south. It goes even worse when they're both in the voice call at the same time. It just mutates his horrible nature. 

Now what he does exactly is fairly simple. He always tries his damnedest to make sure that you know you aren't special. Everything that you accomplish is child's play to him. Whether it's something big or small, he always tries to one up it or just make it look like nothing good at all.   
He also insults minute details of every single thing that I do. He makes jokes at my expense.

Probably the worst part for me and my mental health is that if he doesn't understand it or know of it, it doesn't work or exist. Whatever his opinion is in his mind is fact to him. If I make something in a different way that he does, even if it performs the same task perfectly, he brigades it with constant insults. He'll call it ugly, useless, and a disgrace.

  
Now why don't I just cut ties with him? It's not that simple.

Our families are pretty good friends and they live quite literally down the street. Around a year ago I tried speaking to him about how this made me feel. It worked for about 2 weeks and then he was back to his old ways. No matter what I try, to get away from him I have to move.

663,"Hey guys, I’ll keep it as short as I can.

So some backstory, I’m 24 and moved across Canada just less than a year ago for work. I moved in October from BC to Toronto, Ontario. Really exciting stuff! I manage to find a cool roommate who I seemed to vibe with. Because I wasn’t sure if I wanted to spend a whole year in a new city, I liked this place because it could be rented on a month to month basis. My roommate (who has been living in this place for 3 years) would remain on the lease and I would e-transfer her my portion of the rent every month. It was great, didn’t have to deal with landlords and all that bullshit. Keep in mind this was my first time moving away from home and living on my own, I had no idea what I was doing and still don’t. 

Fast forward to today, I get a call from my roommate saying we face eviction this Monday. Completely out of the blue.

Essentially my roommate owed our landlord close to $8,000 in arrears and was forced to make monthly payments from May to August. Had no idea about this. Through an alleged miscommunication or something she missed some payments and our landlord has sent us a notice to vacate. And since I’m not on the lease I’m not allowed to get any information from our landlord. Which is frustrating because I technically pay for the majority of the apartment. But it’s my fault for not being on the lease.

Now this would be fine if she told me, but the really frustrating this is why she would only tell me this 3 days before we face eviction. I’m now wondering if some of my rent money even went to our landlord. 

I probably butchered the story, but a lot of this stuff is over my head and in a province I don’t know much about. I’m also really naive and acknowledged I was definitely taken advantage of at some points along the way.

The problem is that it's 45 minutes from where I live, it's in a city. I live in a village where I don't have any good memories. I even did high school in the city because I didn't want to see anyone from my village. I have my life there, I made good friends there and met my actual boyfriend.

The actual problem: I will get out of work at 10pm and won't have a ride home. I told my boyfriend if I could sleep at his house if I get a job there so this is why I accepted the offer. However, I don't want to stay at his house not even for a month because he lives with his family and it's not fair, so I've been thinking about moving out with someone else. 

My mum will not accept me moving out because she thinks I'm not mature enough for that and my brother who's 31 lives with us so it would be very weird for her to see me move out before him. She'll also ask me why accepted the offer if I don't have a way to come home, but I can't tell her that in a way this is an excuse to move out because I can't stand anymore living in a village that doesn't help to my mental health.

So reddit, what should I tell her?",12Jul2019,3
671,"My brother has crippling social anxiety and people keep trying to talk to him at the gym during his workouts. He and I both know that they're just being friendly but since he has such a low threshold for social interaction (and he's also extremely self conscious about being in the gym anyway due to his size) that the shortest, forced conversation can leave him emotionally tapped. Is there a good way to dissuade people from talking to him while at the gym without seeming like a complete tool?

673,"The charge is a check fraud charge and it is a seven month sentence. My daughter she seems to be handling it fine. I told her right away about it and she reacted pretty calmly. I told her mom did the wrong thing and is rightfully serving her punishment. They have a good relationship. The main problem I have is she will see her mom in a jail jumpsuit and see guards and other inmates that could be intimidating. Is that ok for a 15 year old to see? Actually my daughter does not seem scared but instead seems excited and enthusiastic to visit. This is strange to me. Do you find this normal? My daughter seems to find the idea of her mom having to wearing a uniform, sharing a room funny. I wonder why she would think it is funny. My wife says bring her if she would like to and my daughter says she would like to but I don't know if it is a good idea. She hasn't gone yet so we can discuss it",12Jul2019,0
674,"I’ve been emotionally and verbally abusive to my fiancé. Last night we got into a bad fight that escalated quickly into name-calling. I was so angry I went to the other room and ripped all the pillows and the blankets off the bed. We then got into a yelling match where I was condescending. We got into it again this morning because he said he’d call my parents about me throwing the pillows off of the bed. This made me upset because dad was just deployed and my mom is unwell. I was angry that he’d call them about this kind of thing knowing how things are with them right now. 

I threatened to break up with him a bunch of times. In the moment I was so angry I felt like I needed to run/get away, scream, or cry.  

These two fights are abnormal for us but I’m seriously worried about the choices I’ve made during them.

***So here is my big question:***
Is he safe to be around me right now?

I know in my heart I would never physically hurt him. Is that good enough for us to say it’s safe?  **Everything I read online about throwing things says he needs to leave me** does he? 

I don’t want to hurt him. I love him so much but if he was my friend or brother I’d probably tell him to leave me too.

Today at lunch I told him that I loved him but what I did was abusive. He said he didn’t care and that he wanted to stay and work things through. I want nothing more but to change myself forever to be a healthy partner but I’ve been so fucking selfish. Am I being selfish by asking him to stay with me while I get help?

TLDR: I was verbally and emotionally abusive to my fiancé last night. Am I being toxic and disgusting by hoping he will stay with me even though I was emotionally and verbally abusive these past two months and last night?",12Jul2019,5
675,"So, my next door neighbor, whom I have never met, knocked on my door this morning while I was still asleep and screamed ""My Ring caught you leaving a note on my car saying you're going to kill my dog. I have contacted the police. Expect a warrant."" I had taken the day off from work and decided to sleep in a little later than usual, so this was not exactly a pleasant awakening. So, I get out of bed and proceed to wait for the police to show up for the next hour or so. Nobody ever came. I call the police myself and they knocked on my neighbor's door (who had 4-5 cars in her driveway). Nobody answered, the police officer then tells me the neighbor is either suspected or has been caught dealing narcotics. I know they have been renting the house next door since October. Do you think I should contact the landlord and explain the situation? Maybe he could run an updated background check. Would an arrest or conviction likely violate the terms of their lease? I had recently contacted the landlord to complain about them parking multiple cars in their front yard, I wonder if she was mad about that? Otherwise, no interactions to speak of.",12Jul2019,10

677,"I'm 16 and when I was younger I remember my father hugging me and during the hug he would put his hand underneath my shirt on my lower back. I always felt uncomfortable but I never said anything because I thought I was just being sensitive and that it was normal. Also he sometimes touched my butt or breats area but I always thought it was on accident, though I felt really uncomfortable and started avoiding physical contact which allows him to touch me like that. 

I always thought it was normal and just a normal hug but today when I told a friend about it he said that it's not normal at all. Now I'm confused because my dad is a really nice person and I don't think he would do anything bad on purpose although I sometimes get creppy vibes from him. I'm just really confused.

681,"Now I'm sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, and this should be considered animal abuse due to what it ...ensues? Again if I'm wrong I'm sorry.
 First off, I live near a park that is well known for having a protected species, -- Gopher Tortoises. It is shown very plainly that the park owners themselves KNOW that the habitat is here for the Tortoises. Such as slow signs, with a pictute of the Tortoises, or yellow signs saying 'Habitat of the Gopher Tortoises', etc.

  I personally have been going to this park since I was little, so I've seen items within it come and go, and I've come to a sad conclusion as well as an infuriating realization.

For one, over the years, the park has been lazy with fully removing items, trying to restore similar ones but in a different spot thus tearing down more land, installing impractical 'workout equipment' ( like lift up bars or whatever they are called, etc. ) For example, they tore down a very decent amount of land a while ago, and put in it place a black box thing, like of plastic, slightly elevated, that keeps in sand ( i don't know what it's called ), and it HAD a swing set and a METAL slide. They tore it down since for some reason they finally realized that 'hey, it's always either sweltering hot, or storming like a hurricane, this maybe dangerous.' but never tore down the big box, nor replanted.

This park is public ,but would be  breaking laws seeing as the Tortoises and their burrows are under federal law ( maybe simply just the law and not federally ) are protected and considered threatened or in danger.

What they have been doing is tearing down large sections of land, some areas including burrows, for useless things.I have come to realize that many of these areas will be gone, and soon even these tortoises HOMES.

Is there something that could stop this?!",12Jul2019,1

684,"I've known this guy for almost a year now and even though it doesn't sound like much, we've created a rather strong bond since September when I first met him. He's my classmate (don't ask why we're both sophomore, it doesn't matter in the story and I don't like to talk about it)

I don't know anything about his family, asking always felt like walking on thin ice, so I just guess they don't have the best relationship. My friend has a girlfriend, so I could reach out to her, but they're at the edge of breaking up (he cheated while high) and I wouldn't like to add my penny to it. I know she's one of the things that keep him clean and alive, so I can expect anything from him when they break up. He claims he's clean now and is going to stay clean as single, but I don't have any reason to believe him. He always relapses after +/- 2 weeks. I don't even really know what he's addicted to, which makes everything more difficult. He always said he was addicted to ""everything"". I know injections and sniffing take a big part in it, but I don't know the substances. He's been a drug addict since the age of 14, drinks as well, but I wouldn't consider him an alcoholic just yet.

He never said anything particularly related to suicide or self harm, but considering his situation, I think it's possible he could do it anyday. He hasn't responded to my messages or calls in a week, even though we arranged a meeting before (which he didn't come to), so he may be dead even now. I've no idea what to do, contacting his gf/ex(?) is an option, but if he IS alive, he'd be pissed if he knew we talked. 

I want to help him, that guy is freaking intelligent and knows shit. The fact he's an addict doesn't end the possibilities coming in the future, especially when you think of how young he is. If he is, indeed, dead, it'd completely ruin me.",12Jul2019,7

704,"18 / Female
I’m not exactly sure where to start with this... all I know is that I really need to move out of my house.
I’ve been dealing with my mother’s manipulation and emotional/mental/(sometimes) physical abuse for years. I’ve mostly suffered in silence...the only person that I’ve ever told about any of this is my boyfriend. 
It’s gone through its ups and downs over the years, but I’m just really tired of it. I’m 18 years old, and I shouldn’t have to deal with this anymore.
My mom always nags at me and yells at me over the tiniest things, and always degrades and belittles me for no reason. The culmination of this feeling happened this morning...my college payment was due today, and I asked my mom to help me with the payment as I was unfamiliar with the website (she’s the one who makes the payments). So as I’m navigating the website trying to figure out where to go, she keeps yelling at me for trying to help her out. This makes me feel anxious, so I get upset. She tells me that she needs to set up a payment plan, and begins to set up the plan. But she runs into a problem, and instead of calling the financial office herself...she wants to make me do it.
Now, I hate calling people on the phone. And it’s just even worse because I’m not really sure what I’m supposed to be asking in the first place, I don’t understand what she’s doing or what she wants me to do. So I shakily and nervously call my school... but she snatches the phone out of my hands and hits me, telling me to go somewhere else if I’m going to act like a little bitch. This leaves me in tears, and as I try to calm myself down she keeps making faces at me and threatening to hit me.
Once the phone call ends she gets mad at me and told me that it wasnt so hard... and attempt to tell her that I didn’t understand the website, and I didn’t understand what she was asking me to do, so it was that hard. But of course she claims that I’m just lazy and have an attitude and don’t want to do anything. It escalates into a larger argument (but really she’s just yelling at me, I can’t say anything against her. She won’t listen.) that culminates with the following - “I don’t care if you come home from college.” 
Which, even though I can’t stand my mother at all, really hurt.
There is so much more I could say, but I’ll leave it at that for now.

I just don’t know what to do. This woman is the reason I’m depressed and anxious, the entire reason I hate every entire inch of my being. I’ve been wanting to move out for a while now (since I was 15), but I don’t know where to go... I can’t turn to family, and I don’t have friends that I could ask to take me in. I would like to go to my boyfriend, but I could never ask him to take me in. I’d feel terrible.
Essentially, I’m stuck... I don’t want to live in this atmosphere anymore.

TL;DR - I’m tired of my abusive and manipulative mother. I’m 18 years old, and need advice on how to get out of the toxic environment.

Thank you for any and all advice, I greatly appreciate it.",12Jul2019,1

I told him I would buy it but I would need payments and he suggested 25$ a payday and I was super game for that and we made the deal I wasn't sure what was wrong with it at the time of purchase until I paid for someone to look at it and we discovered the cpu cooler pump was broken or not working for whatever reason so I purhased a new one and had the tech install it all in all costing me 75$. So now it comes time I'm hooking the computer up as excited as I have been in my entire life because I have been wanting a gaming PC since I was like 17 (I'm 21 now) I give him the first payment July 4th I paid him 20$ because ATM's only give 20's and all the banks were closed in observance for the 4th. He said this was fine and I gave him the 20$ Fast forward to today and me and our other friend were talking in the group chat talking about how cringy some Furries are, (The videos he was showing me were them saying uWu and panting and shit \*Shutters\*) And the friend I purchased the pc from got offended because he is a furry. He then demands that I pay him the 400$ by the middle of august or else he is taking the pc back. I told him pay me what I paid for the repair cost and you can have the fucking  thing back because I don't want to deal with that shit. He then tells me ""You used your free will to pay for the repairs I don't owe you for them that was your decision, I will give you the 25$ and then you can bring my computer back to me."" That's not even close to how things work if i'm not wrong right? He can't just force me to give the computer back even though I haven't missed a payment or threatened to not pay for it right?

712,"Okay so first off I want to apologize for how petty this situation is but this is why I need advice because I’m shook at the way things went down. I’ll give you a bit of back story first. We’ll call my bestfriend Jane and my boyfriend Matt. 
Jane and I went to high school together. We were both known to be girls that you didn’t mess with we were bitchy and had attitude. If necessary on my part I wasn’t like that to anybody but if you crossed me or tried me you’d have hell to pay. She was a little different. We were never friends in highschool because she was friends with a group of girls that were for lack of a better word hoes and the steal-your-man behind your back and then hold it like a medal type girls/ pull there pants down and twerk in the hall type and I can’t stand that. Also eventually I was told Jane was messing with my boyfriend at the time. So obviously I didn’t like her and I made that very clear so for most of highschool I was down to fight her whenever she was ready. One day I was told she was going to jump one of my friends at the time, mind you, it was this girls first day back after being at the hospital for 2 months fighting double lung pneumonia and almost dying. So as you can imagine I walked up on Jane. We didn’t fight I just got in her face and she denied it and laughed it off pretty much. So the reason that’s important atleast In my mind is because there is already a hostile history there. 
So fast forward to when we become friends. It’s graduation night 2 years after I heard she was sleeping w my ex I had moved on and was with my current boyfriend Matt and she had her own man. The graduation party is at my ex’s house the one who initially created the beef with me and Jane. But her and I are being civil as we were told to by our men before the party lol. A point in the night comes we’re both drunk and I have to pee and don’t know where the bathroom is, she offers to bring me so I go with her. We get to the bathroom and drunk me tells her to come in the bathroom cause we need to talk. I pee and am pretty much like I don’t f*** with you because you were messing with my ex when you knew what was going on. But as soon as I said it I realized he did exactly what he did to me to her and told a bunch of people we slept together when that was never the case. So it was kind of a cool moment we both laughed and spent the rest of the night together after that we were bestfriends. 
So now that you get some of the history you can see that the dynamic we have is a little different lol. Sometimes we butt heads but we’ve never been in an actual argument. It’s been 2 years since we graduated by the way. Usually we argue like sisters and just get annoyed with eachother but being the way I am I am very aware of the way I am in conflicts with my friends since I naturally have a tendency to snap and go off as soon as I feel pushed but I hate hostile friendships and I’ve had a few there not fun and it’s like a constant competition. I don’t want to make my friends feel shitty and I certainly don’t ever want to put my hands on someone I care about. That being said Jane does not have the same filter. She doesn’t really care as long as she’s getting the last word or winning the argument and this situation just kind of proved that that’s how it is no matter the steaks. So without further to do I’ll get into the incident lol. 
So pretty much I had been living with my boyfriend and we had broken up for a short time so I moved my stuff back to my moms. We got back together and my mom was pretty much telling me to pay 500$ for rent with a 10 pm curfew or to move out so she could use my room for storage so naturally I moved back in with Matt. I had originally planned to go grab my stuff to bring back to Matt’s with my other friend well call her Lucy. So I finally get a day off of work and decide I want to go get my stuff. Jane usually FaceTimes me in the mornings so she calls me to see what I’m doing and she also has the day off so we’re excited cause we rarely both get a day off together. She has a doctors appointment in the same town where my mom lives that I needed to pick up my stuff so it works out. I let her know that if she didn’t want to  grab my stuff it was fine because Lucy offered to take me and help me out since Jane is usually in a rush to make it home by 3 since that’s when her boyfriend is out of work. She said it was fine and she’d take me to get it. So we go to her doctors appointment first I wait for an hour and a half in the waiting room which is fine I agreed to go with her. She finishes and we head to my moms. I had aloooooot of stuff to grab and I’ll remind you it was 95° and humid my mom lives on the second floor. I told her I’d run in and grab it because I wanted to get everything together so I’d have to make less trips and I had aloooot of stuff. I had a big trash bag that was atleast 20 lbs of my clothes and there were holes in the trash bag so I had to be careful nothing fell I had 3-4 other book bags and gym bags filled with clothes shoes etc then I had my old MacBook which is heavy asf my jewelry box which is also pretty heavy my books and a few other bags. So a lot of shit and I’m pretty small lol but i bring the stuff to her car just so I can get it done and my moms weird about people in her house. We start heading back to where we both live with our boyfriends now. We’ve had an amazing day great conversations through bumping music laughing everything you do with your bestie lol. So we pull up to Matt’s house and we decide we want to smoke a little before she goes so instead of pull up Matt’s driveway (which is a very steep hill) she turns around on his street and parks about halfway down the street so the house is far out of view so that Matt or his mom wouldn’t see us. (I don’t know why she cared lol) so we smoke we’re vibing listening to music talking about good friends and bad friends and how we love our friendship 🙄 so it’s almost 3 o’clock her mans gonna be out of work soon so she’s like alright I should get going thanks for hanging out and I’m like no problem girly ily but I still have to bring my stuff inside do you mind bringing me up the hill (his driveway) because I have so much stuff. And she was like well can’t you just call Matt and have him come out here and help you. First of all I brought up multiple times throughout the day that Matt was still sleeping cause he wasn’t feeling well and I’d be waking him up when I got home and second of all he would’ve been so annoyed if I called him in 95° weather to walk all the way down his street to help me lug stuff back down the street up the driveway. So I tell her no he’s still sleeping. She says well why wouldn’t you tell me that before I parked this way. Mind you Matt lives down a residential street I think that’s what it’s called but there’s not through traffic it’s a dead end it’s never busy people only go in and out if there live there so it’s not like it would’ve been had to turn around when we were surrounded by driveways. So I’m like I did tell you he was sleeping can you please just bring me up the hill that trash bag is like 20 lbs and there’s rips all over it my stuffs gonna fall everywhere. So she says I’m not pulling up the driveway I’ll help you if you want. This would’ve been a decent offer if Jane wasn’t 80 lbs soaking wet. Either way I would have to do a majority of the lifting and she certainly wasn’t gonna help with that trash back. This wouldn’t bother me so much if I didn’t have 1 injured shoulder and one severely injured soldier that I should be doing pt for. She knows about my shoulders and the pain that I’m in from them. So I look at her on this 95° day in her nice new air conditioned car and say you really won’t drive me down the road and up his driveway. It’s not like we’re a minute down the street we’re 5 minutes down the street walking and then getting up the driveway. So she says I just told you I’m not turning my car around and if you want to be difficult I won’t help you at all. So I respond with if you stay at the end of this street and watch me struggle to bring all of my stuff up by myself I literally won’t talk to you for a week. And I’m still half laughing at this point cause I don’t know if she’s completely serious or not. So she gets in my face and says oh you won’t talk to me for a week? You want to test me ? I’m feeling real bitchy today test me so I was like okay seriously you want to do this rather then just help me out so I can bring my stuff in I don’t even need your help I just need to be closer to the house and she goes yup test me. So I was like alright bet wait here cause I’m obviously gonna have to do more then one trip. And she laughed and goes yeah maybe I’ll stay here or maybe I’ll leave with half of your sh** and I said if you do that I’m showing up to your house and banging on your door lol so she watches me for 15 minutes in 95° weather while she sits in her car on her phone struggle to bring up a trash bag that’s the same size as me with rips all over and all of my other stuff. I called out of work the next day because my shoulder wouldn’t stay in place. 
So what advice do you need your wondering. It’s been over a week now she texted me a few times here and there once directly after everything because a girl she didn’t like friended her and she said it couldn’t wait a week and another time to remind me to take a test because I had a pregnancy scare. I didn’t respond to either. Since she’s shared things on fb saying “stop letting your friends treat you like sh** get new friends” and she captioned it “Heard that🤷🏽‍♀️” so I’m just confused because I’ve wracked my brain around this situation and can’t see how I was a shitty friend lol so maybe enlighten me lmk what my next step should be. I did text her yesterday about some of her work drama that came up mentioning it was the only reason I hit her up and she didn’t respond it seems like she’s flipping it like I did something shitty and now she’s ignoring me but I literally don’t know and I’m so confused. As my bestfriend I don’t know why you would let something like that end a friendship or why she couldn’t help me out and do that favor. I don’t want to hit her up again and at this point i don’t see her hitting me up so is this how it ends? Over something so childish. I’m sick of being the bigger person when she gets like this and I don’t want to be the one to give in can someone please help me out I’m sorry it’s so long but I’ve been lingering on this for a week and a half lol pls help me.",12Jul2019,0
713,"I already know it was a bad idea to begin with but it feels like I have no one else right now. I mean at least I have someone to talk to (but only when they have no one else to talk to). Which ig is okay as there's no obligations. We also get to have a ""sex life"" online, even though he always complains about how he craves sex. I tell him to go find a hook up, as he's always said how loads of girls like him, but he says that it's been too long since he's had sex. He's so confusing. 

We agreed that this was an exclusive thing and that eventually if we find anyone we're interested in, we'll call it off. But today he causally says that he's trying to hit on girls? And I'm just frustrated. Do I have a right to be mad? Can I even tell him or will he think I'm too emotionally invested. He asked if I was jealous and I said yes. He then just said ""dw your my main bish"". 

Idk I don't want it to end as it's only just started but I don't want to be lied to or messed around. I can't tell if he's just using me.

When we were together he didn't feel right for me to use my money to come visit and called me crazy. Now he's asking me to come. And obviously that's just to fuck.

I've got a severe baby face and just an overall shitty voice, so I wanted to do a gaming channel that uses text and images to communicate in the game rather than a face cam.

716,"I've been dealing with depression for a long time I believe, maybe 3 or 4 years of somewhat consistent episodes, and one recently bad one. Every time I heard of depression, whether through the story of others or through my school, I never considered that I could succumb to my own feelings. I denied any belief that I could possibly have it and thought that it only happened to ""babies"". Which I now realize was a terrible way to look at it and contributed to why it took me so long to deal with it. (This is the first time I'm telling anyone. I haven't told my parents or friends.)

This is getting progressively harder for me to write about but I'll push through.

I think my first episode really happened after I quit hockey 4 years ago. I lost that community of people that motivated me and all my hockey friends who I could relate to and hang out with on a regular basis. I did this so I could pursue my academics, but looking back on it, I think I had made a huge mistake. This along with my parent's divorce, as well as a breakup, I believe made me depressed. I developed this pessimistic view on life. I started getting angry easily, lost lots off friends, gained quite a bit of weight, and lost my drive to do well in school. My perfectionist mindset didn't help either as I just thought worse of myself. 

Right now, I've started exercising daily again, weight lifting, etc. Also, I've (trying to) maintain a healthy diet and get enough sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

 I don't know if I should be posting this or even posting it here, and I'm sorry for anyone that gets upset while reading this.  In the past, I would have moments where I would gain this motivation back, but eventually, I would just end up relapsing back into my depression. 

I guess what I'm asking for is advice to keep myself out of this depression permanently and regain my life. 

Thanks in advance.",12Jul2019,0

728,"To start off, sometimes I lack social skills. From the beginning of the year, my college roommate and I would talk a little bit and stuff, but as the 1st semester went on, she NEVER tried to talk to me first. I would sometimes try to be friendly like offering her cookies. She would say, ""No, I'm good."" I just got bad vibes from her. She didn't smile enough, and when she did, it looked fake. Then, mid-semester, she started doing things that bothered me, such as changing menstrual pads in the dorm room, leaving her desk light on way too late/early, not taking out the trash as much as me, and leaving her laundry basket in the way. Eventually, we had bed bugs. She was super grumpy the day we found out and slammed the door. She also glared at me a few times. Honestly, I just decided to tell the RA it wasn't a friendly environment, I was scared my roommate would judge me and I didn't feel safe. The RA talked to my roommate and we eventually had a meeting together. My roommate was super irritated because I didn't talk to her first about the issues I had and she didn't believe I was intimidated by her. She said, ""I don't believe you're scared."" I responded, ""That's because I told my parents about this, and they told me not to act scared so I don't give you power.""

2nd semester, she apologized, made changes, and brought me oreos. I agreed that we didn't need anymore tension in the room, and then everything was fine. However, my guy friend started talking to her even after I told him the weird stuff she did. One day he invited her to go to the mall with us when it was just supposed to be us 2. Eventually, my college roommate sent me this long text at the end of the year, confronting me for everything I said to her 2nd semester. She basically said I had a condescending attitude, that I was judgmental, and she didn't understand why I wanted to be a psychologist because I judge people who ""aren't happy"". For example, one time (in person) she said, ""I'm not trying to avoid the room or anything, I'm just not here most of the time because I've been working a lot."" I said, ""Oh, I don't have a job because my parents have good jobs, and I got lots of scholarships because I'm smart, or at least that's what people say."" She also was talking casually about how she hoped her skin didn't look too oily. I was like, ""let me see."" She says, ""uhh no...."" I was like, don't worry I won't judge."" I got up in her face and looked at her skin and said, ""Oh, you just have large pores. I have small ones."" She also showed me her theatre headshots a different day, because she wanted her top 10 chosen for the photographer to edit. I said, ""To edit this, I would take out the red part on your forehead, and then sculpt your cheekbones, but idk what the acting industry likes."" Those were just a few things she confronted me about in her text. Did it sound that bad? She's a junior and I'm a freshman, so idk why she'd feel intimidated by me.",12Jul2019,1

Other friend died instantly a car accident 9 months ago.

Let me tell you what my dosroder has stopped me from having:

-a job

-a relationship

-friends

-hobbies

Every single day i spend in my room fearing of going outside and being judged. I was bullied relentlessly when i was in school and it turned into a huge anxiety disorder. I can't even run off my calories because of that.

I've visited many psychiatrists but they all want to treat me for depression. It has been 4 years since i started, and they haven't made a bit of progress. I keep telling them I have an ED but they just slap anxiety/depression on my papers and call it a day.

736,"TL:DR at the bottom, because this is my vent about friends venting. 

I have a couple really close friend- once with diagnosed mental health problems, one with physical problems that they have put off getting help for because parents aren't helping much, and I'm anxious for both, but can't do anything. 

The one with diagnosed mental health problems says therapy is too expensive, and while our university offers free counseling, I think it's only like 3 free sessions. And she says she'd need more than those 3 sessions. Personally, from my non medical perspective, I think they need medicine for it, especially seeing how medicine helped one of my cousins with mental health. But they refuse to talk to most people about it, they vent on Twitter, and basically use their favourite band as a meand of escape. And I'm not judging for that, because I like to escape sometimes, but I also don't have a Twitter addiction or say my favourite band is basically the one good thing about living. Since we aren't in classes right now, it's hard to see them, and they get anxious about leaving the house. I don't force them to talk, but I worry, and seeing the Twitter rants make me fear for their wellbeing, as well as concerns that it is further damaging their mental health.

The other friend has needed surgery for a year and hasn't gotten it because their mom has been taking care of their terminally ill aunt and literally said ""imagine the pain your aunt is in"" when surgery comes up. They have had downward spirals in the past year, more than ever in the 6 years we've been friends, and after not being in school and just working for 2 years, they say they are dumb, lost all knowledge, are a failure, etc. I don't know if it's the surgery they need, mental health struggles, environment issues, but probably some unholy combination.

I get the social media rants, the friends confiding in me, and when it feels like they are just having breakdowns, I either don't know what to say more than half the time, or they are too hysteric or set in their mindsets to take what advice I can give them when I actually have a solid answer, based on what they havevsaid about themselves. I love both of them so much, they're family to me, but I get stressed seeing their meltdowns. I don't know what I should do when they never listen but still want my opinion, or if I'm getting stressed out because of them.

TL;DR - My friends are going through a lot, refuse to get or even look for real help or go through with the solutions they need to go through, vent to me or social media. I can't help because they are either venting about what I can't help with, or they are too set in how things are going to take my advice, which results in me getting mild second hand stress.

738,"First I want to clear a couple of things up. The brother I'm referring to is actually my cousin, but we do have a brother-like relationship. He lives in a town close to one I live in and he is 7 years older than I am. I am 15 years old.  
  
He is a long time weed smoker. He started around the time he was 15 or 16 and he still smokes on a daily basis. I don't wanna go into the discussion if that is right or not, he just does that and I am cool with it. I am the only member of the whole family who knows about this. I think he told his parents as well, but I am not really sure. It is also illegal and severely punished in our country.  
  
So after a few months of not seeing I finally paid him a visit. I spent 3 days at his place with him, his gf and all their friends. It was amazing, they accepted me well and I really really enjoyed it. He and his friends were smoking and his girl wasn't. I kind of wanted to but he told me he fears my dad might find out and that I am still far too young. I was cool with that and we just kept hanging out.  
  
Today I came home and on my way back I went to my mom's working place. I haven't changed my t shirt and she told me I smelled weird. I shrugged it off saying it was sweat and thought it'd be over. I went home to take a bath and then dad came home.  
  
As mom was out he just told me ""I know what your brother does, I know that he smoked and that you didn't. I also know that his gf has. I am fine with smoking, just don't ever try it, you are underage."" I was completely speechless. But then I started unfolding the story. There is no possible way he could know about it. We weren't seeing any dealers as all the herb was already at the place. His gf wasn't smoking and he told that she was.  
  
I was and am terrified. How much does he know about things he shouldn't? Did he do that just to scare me not to smoke? How did he miss on the gf thing? Do I call my brother now? It's midnight, I don't want to interrupt him rn and I will definitely see him in under a month again.  
  
The main problem is, he shouldn't have an idea about this. Our family in general is very anti drugs and we would probably be outcasted. Also, I am the only one who knows so brother might hate me if he ever finds out about my dad's information. My mom would ban me from seeing him ever again if she knew this.  
  
I have no idea on what to think or do rn. Any advice or opinion would be appreciated. Thanks a lot.",12Jul2019,2
739,"Okay so I’ve been trying and researching to understand a dream I recently had and have found nothing to clarify the part that’s been bugging me. So basically me and 5-6 people were pretty much slaves, but we didn’t feel like so. We were all happy and enjoyed what we did, we were pretty much like a family. My boyfriend was also part of this team. We would go out in a field- I’m not sure what kind of field, but it was like super long green/yellow grass that came above our waists. So we’d been to this once or twice before in this same dream but I don’t really remember those other times. But we were all messing around and not doing what we were supposed to in the field and the cops would drive by and check on us, even though our bosses were there watching us as well. So of course someone says the cops are doing their drive by and we all flip out a little because we’re obviously disobeying the rules, everyone then goes on the edge of the field and stands in a line next to each other. That’s not what we’re supposed to be doing either, but I take off running through the field and into the house escaping. I go straight to the bathroom and I’m standing beside the toilet now frozen. I cannot move, no commands are responding with my body, and then the toilet begins to glitch. Now it was almost like it was cutting in and out and moving a little, it kinda reminds of me of that one little girl in wreck it Ralph who has that glitch power lol. But at that same time I realized I was dreaming, and fear over took me. (Now I do tend to become self aware at the end of my dreams, so this is not unusual for me.) I literally felt my anxiety go up and panic over take me. I was thinking of how to get out of this dream- I can literally wake myself up in any dream very easily- but I couldn’t this time. And then still standing by the glitching toilet I realized I needed to calm down for me to wake up, that’s what I did. It still took a while then but once I was finally able to command my actual body to move to wake me I awoke.

745,"My mom is soon to be scheduled to have surgery, and in the meantime I'm practicing to get my license for my next driving test of the 13th of August so I can drive her to the hospital, as I failed my first driving test. My mom started to become paranoid because I start school late August and if her surgery gets scheduled near then, then 1. to her I'll have no form of transportation if I fail again, and since she'll be on bed rest and 2. I'll be in school and there won't be anyone to take care of her. 

I told her that transportation back to school for me wasn't something that she should worry about and that it wasn't her responsibility, as well as if even if her predictions were right I'd take the bus and Uber as I'm also working two part time jobs. The fact that my second test is on the 13th, by that time I would've had enough practice to know I'd pass, so she shouldn't stress about it. 

My mom doesn't even know when the surgery will be, and in my opinion she's making predictions that are out of her control.

746,"We have known each other for 2 years now since I've started at the job, and have grown closer over this past year. Over the year she has become more and more annoying to me. She is a good person and has good intentions but she isn't a great friend, basically it feels like she wants to fix me and my problems (which I never asked or want her to do). 

For example, I can vent to her about any problem, and she'll ""know"" and tell me the solution... so the other day I told her I was stressed about finding an apartment for me and my boyfriend (which me &amp; boyfriend are working on together) and she tells me the problem is him putting this on me. (And I tell her no that's not it. He actually makes my life easier and better, it's just a stressful thing to do). Her response,  ""Ya but you know he shouldn't put all that on you!! And he should be able to see it's too much for you and the stress you're in"". This alone pisses me off now. She blames him for my stress, and that hurts me because it's not him and for her to suggest that makes it seem like she knows me better than my own boyfriend
Another problem I have is studying and getting things memorized (I have adhd and study better by myself, I have told her this too) She decides to randomly quiz me at work while I'm with clients... it's not only annoying but rude. Then calls me to come study so she can quiz me more.
One last thing, she has begun calling me her best friend and telling others so... but she is not my best friend. She wants to fix everyone, and because we hangout and know a lot about another, and it really sucks. She called me over once to hang out and I was free so whatever,  i get to her place and not even 5mins being there she goes to take a nap and leaves the tv for me... I just don't understand what she wants me around for. I have my own life and shit to do, and that doesn't include being bored and lonely with her when she has nothing to do. 
There are so many more similar examples, but bottom line is I don't want to see her at work and it's not like I can quit or transfer. I'm not sure if I'm even trying to get rid of her out of my life completely but whenever I see her or get a text from her I feel bothered and annoyed.

748,"Fair warning: lots of back story.

So I'm a 25 year-old female who owns a home with her parents (2 story home with a basement kind of situation), and currently my 27-year-old brother's 2 children are with us as well.  

My brother and his wife are in the middle of getting a divorce, but he is in the army (set to get out in January) and is currently deployed.  After he gets out of the army, he plans to move back to our hometown and will have custody of the kids during the school year. My nephew is 5 and will start school this year, so it was decided that in order to ease the transition and allow his soon-to-be-ex an opportunity to transition from a stay-at-home mom to working, my parents would take temporary custody for the kids as well.

Right off the bat, we noticed some behavioral issues with the kids, which was to be expected as they are young, away from their parents, and experiencing so much change.  I studied developmental psychology for one of my majors in college (only a bachelor's, however, so I know I am not qualified to diagnose anything), and my mom is naturally good at recognizing behavioral issues in children (my brother has Asperger's, I was basically born with severe social anxiety, and she ran a day care for years and still is heavily involved with children's ministries at church), so we've been trying to help them adjust as best as we could.  

Still, when my nephew was enrolled in summer school, it was clearly evident that his behavior stood out from his peers, and not in a good way.  My mother got him into a diagnostitian  (with the parents' blessings), and the results were a bit... Heavier than anticipated.  We had a very good idea that my nephew had ADD (he doesn't have the hyperactivity normally associated with this, but he has immense trouble focusing), but it was also found that he is socially delayed.  His mental development is actually on par with his peers, perhaps even a bit advanced, but he is virtually incapable of interacting with other kids.  He's 5, but socially he is 2 or younger.

The diagnostitian believe that this is due to his mother, which would be to the surprise of no one including her own family.  She apparently told my brother at some point that she doesn't believe she was ever meant to be a mom, although in my opinion I believe that it's more likely she was never meant to be a stay-at-home mom.  The divorce itself started out as messy, and I'll spare you all most of the details as this is already a monstrously long post, but it is believed she neglected her kids.  The kids have some tendencies of neglected kids, but more than that I have witnessed it myself.  

During the messiest parts of the divorce, my brother did not trust her and gave me access to the nanny cams to check in on the kids every once in a while. Sure, they had food and clean clothes and weren't living in squalor, but the amount of interaction she had with the kids was minimal.  She'd check in once every few hours, but mostly those kids were left with just the tv to babysit them. Now that she is working, she seems to be a lot more involved with her kids, despite being states away.  I think that being home all that time left her depressed, which I understand and have sumpathy toward her for, but unfortunately that depression negatively affected her children.

 It put my nephew in an odd spot, as he was left to take care of the emotional needs of his 3-year-old sister, and there was no one to take care of his.  This practice had clearly led to some learned problematic behaviors on the kids' parts.  I watched as my niece would scream her brother's name like he has pushed her or something despite him being halfway across the room just to get time to interact with her mother at the expense of getting her brother in trouble.  I saw my nephew develop his own plans of getting what he wanted by climbing on top of furniture to reach toys so he wouldn't have to ask. I also saw him getting in trouble for doing so hours later when his mother realized what he had had to do in order to get the toy.

Having this knowledge in advance, I knew relatively what we were getting into, as did my mother.  Certain practices, however, I was to have no warning of.

When children start to reach the toddler age, they start to test boundaries and see what they can ""get away with.""  As they get older, however,  and they start to understand unspoken rules of socialization and develop empathy, the need to test boundaries diminishes.  My nephew, however, continues to test boundaries with every new adult he meets to the extreme.  It was difficult for his teacher in summer school to deal with a child who outright refused to do what she said, but eventually he got used to her rules and listened.  Then they got a substitute, and his behavior immediately flipped again.  He is the only 5-year-old I know that has been sent to the recovery room (he threw a book when the teacher had told him to do something) this quickly upon entering school.  He barely knows how to handle himself amongst kids without an adult he knows nearby.  The neighborhood parents and older elementary kids are looking out for him, which I am incredibly grateful for, but he also refuses to listen to them even at the cost of his own safety because they're ""new."" I'm worried his outwear their good will, I'm worried that he won't make any friends (or be able to tell when another child doesn't have his best interests in mind), and I'm worried that he will be labelled as a ""problem child.""

I know he has some anger issues as well, but they are buried so far down that he doesn't even realize he is angry.  Most of his destructive habits have been curbed, but he is still incredibly controlling over his younger sister when they play together (which she does not take lying down by any means).  I'm also worried that he might pull this with other children in the future.

There is more with both children of course.  Sometimes there is confusion since I am so close to their mother's age, there are hints of resentment here and there, and they miss their parents immensely. It's a complicated situation, but they are adjusting remarkably well for kids so young.

At the end of the day, I know my nephew is a good littlw boy.  He can be kind, charming, funny, and smart. I love him to pieces, and that is why I am so incredibly scared of what is could happen.  Maybe some of it is my own social anxiety talking, but I also know how kids can get torn down bit by bit.  Growing up, I watched as my school killed a lot of the joy that my brother had just because no one understood Asperger's, and he was far better behaved that my nephew is.  I'm also concerned that they may put him into remedial classes because of his behavioral issues, which could put him behind scholastically as well.  I'm not sure what I can do best to help my nephew, and I'm also worried that he might shut down if we push too hard too fast, and I have no idea what we can be doing.  

Perhaps this may get better when my brother is back from his deployment, but it'll still be a lot of work.  The diagnostitian told us that it'll take years for him to overcome the gap, if it happens at all. I'm good at seeing the subtle differences in the kids' behaviors and acknowledging little victories and praising the kids for them, so I'll remain optimistic about his development, but trying to figure out what is best for him considering his situation is proving difficult. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to handle a situation like this?  Have you experienced a social delay yourself, or known someone who did?  Or do you know ways of helping a child navigate their way through emotions and resentment?  My goal here is to figure out how to help him in a way that he doesn't feel like he has to stamp down his spirit.  I'm doing some talk therapy with him and trying yo get him to think about why he does things, but I worry that he is letting it go in one ear and out the other (he is able to repeat almost entire conversations to me, but then disregards the meaning of the information).  I just want this kid to get his best chance in life, so any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",12Jul2019,1

755,"So, I'm currently on semester 1 holiday from uni and I have this lady friend who made a deal with me regarding sharing her family's Netflix account. I get to use one of the account's profiles and I'm supposed to pay for it, and I will. It's been 2 weeks since she first gave me access to the account (around the time sem 1 ended) and I won't be meeting her until semester 2 starts (which is in 3 weeks more or less). So what I am basically saying is that I am using her account and I haven't paid for it yet (keep this in mind).

The problem is not about the payment here. The profile I am using on her account was originally being used by her ex-boyfriend. Now, the reason they are no longer together is simply because he moved to another country (i.e was not a bad breakup) and the reason why she let me use her ex-bf's profile was because apparently her ex-bf had stopped using her Netflix (and since it's her family's account, she can share it with anybody else she wants to). Problem is, sometimes when I enter Netflix, on the ex-bf's profile which is now mine (the lady friend even changed the name of the profile to my name), I see that some tv shows, which I never even clicked on, were being watched. Basically, somebody else is using my profile. Now, it could still be her ex-bf, or it could be any member of her family too since her entire family has access to that account. However, I highly doubt it's one of her family member since one Netflix account can have multiple profiles and each of her family member has their own profile.

It's really not a big deal but I kinda want some privacy too. The reason I am hesitant to share this issue with her is because I haven't paid for the account yet, so I cannot simply go to her and tell her to prevent other people from using my profile. That would be rude, even if I do intend to pay for it (I am not a miser). Also, if it actually is her ex (with whom she still is on good terms), I cannot ask her to ask her exbf to stop using the profile, since it could put her in a dilemma over who to give the account to, despite that I will be paying for it (remember I haven't paid her yet, but her ex never had to pay for the profile btw, meaning I will be paying for 1 profile and 2 people will be using it, invading MY privacy)

764,"Hi everyone,

I'd be grateful for some advice in my pretty unique situation. I will try to summarize as much as possible.

So basically, I am completely inexperienced in relationships and love life, and I have not had any serious crushes up to now. It all happened when I traveled to another state to visit a friend, and I met a girl there through my friend in two different parties. First night we kind of hung out initially and I had no intention to approach her, but I believe she got drunk and showed some interest in me. Eventually by the end of the night we were cuddling and touching each other. This night passed and we went to another party together. This time we had some good conversation before the party starts, and then we both got drunk and pretty much spent all the party together cuddling until the night. Then I happened to sleep next to her. While sleeping she came onto me and touched me until I pay attention to her, then eventually things got hot and we made out and kissed each other before falling asleep (that was my first kiss ever). I saw her for a short time next morning and that was it. I came back to my state and now I have developed a big crush for her. Couple of times we had a short conversation through snapchat, but none of us text each other that much anymore.

Now I don't exactly know what those nights were and if that's just her nature of hanging out with boys, but the only thing I know is that for a person as emotional as me, I cannot stop thinking about her and I have no idea what I should do since I don't know if she likes me or not.

Should I just try to totally forget about everything that happened or should I try to tell her/show signs that I'm into her? And if I should keep touch with her, how and when should I stay in touch? Also another problem is that we don't live that close that I can visit soon again, maybe later on. 

We're both about 20 if that matters.

You probably think dude what’s wrong with you everything is good. Well the issue is is that I am having a hard time deciding how I want to earn my bread (income) later. 

At the moment I am doing a bachelor Software Engineering and i started when I was 17 years old. I am 22 years old now and I’m in my fourth year after a hard period of thinking to quit because it was either too hard for me or I didn’t like doing it.

Now it’s July and I couldn’t even finish 1 course… now I am even longer busy with my study’s but the worst part is is that I started thinking do I really want to keep going like this? How else am I going to earn my income when I do not know what I want to do later? Can I really pull of a 40 hour work week for 50 years? I am worried and confused in life at the moment and I do not know where to go… 


Also my motivation for life is like gone. It’s like my interest for the world is gone. The only thing I am doing is gaming except when my friends planned to do something. I cannot motivate myself to do other things like go exercise. Normally when you have something planned with friends you get excited and look forward to it. I do not have this excitement anymore and I do not know why but it makes me very sad and I do not know how to handle this.
 
Any advice is welcome to help me resolve this itch on my back that I cannot seem to remove",12Jul2019,1
773,"Some history:

My father was absent for well over 50% of my life. By his choice... He literally just didn't care. He's well off, but never helped me in any capacity. Rather, he and his side of the family (all rich) would frequently and publicly ridicule me for not being well off.

Quite frankly, that side of the family was horribly manipulative and damaging during my formative years. They hated my mother more than they loved me, and I guess their hatred for her was taken out on me. 

My father has done many insurance claims, for which he has gained financially. At one point I was involved with one as a young child and I distinctly remember being coached on what to say. After that was done and he got his money he disappeared again... And of course nothing was set aside for me for college or anything. He went on numerous vacations. 

Present:

I was injured in an incident that could potentially net a judgment in the millions. I sustained very serious injuries and almost did not survive. 

As soon as I woke in the hospital, he wouldn't get out of my face about suing. I couldn't even respond yet as I had tubes down my nose and throat... He was relentless. 

Since then he has been pestering me to see a lawyer. I went just to keep the peace, knowing even if I do anything legally I would never use a lawyer associated with my father. During the meeting the lawyer mentioned my father is filing a claim. Regarding my incident. 

I am absolutely appalled. He has never been there for me, did not raise me, never cared. What could he possibly have claim to?

I want to tell him off and never speak to him again, but I also may file a claim for myself, I'm worried he may ruin it. The lawyer mentioned also that should I file one, I could block any claims pertaining to me, such as my father's. My father is selfish and just awful. I'm looking for advice on how to best handle this. 

Thank you, I know this was long",12Jul2019,1
774,"I (12M) love my parents they are good people exept when it comes to me and my little brother(7M). My little brother is a oh how do i put this... an honest to god narcissist with no respect for authority or other people and thinks he rules the world. Hes horrible you can ask him to stop blaring the sanic song (yes the meme from 2012) and hell act all tough and get in your face. Here the thing though, when we get into fights the punishment/yelling only happen to me. He is praised as an angel that can do no wrong and he had a reason to beat me. While im yelled at and have crap taken from me. Its horrible i cant stand it. Im scared to do anything outside of gaming and chores because if i disagree with him in the slightest or dont go out of my way to praise him as a god, im punished and yelled at. 

What can i do that wont kill relationships? I still love my parents and my brother but this has put emotional distance between us.

Also: this week ive had one of my best friends over although i do see her alot its still fun to have a friend i can generaly talk to about stuff. Although he has ruined almost everyday of it but constantly doing what he loves: getting food and smacking loudly in my  ear i cant even play video games with my own friend because of him. Everytime i suggest a game he suggests another and calls mine a bad idea. Hes been getting into more fights with me than usual lately and has made it hard to do anything.

783,"I live on a dead end road that goes down a mountain. To get to the main part of you town, you need to go up to the top of the hill, where it meets another road.

&amp;#x200B;

This afternoon, I was going to pick my girlfriend up from work and there was a car dangerously parked on the road that runs parallel in an area where it's not supposed to be.  While passing and hoping I didn't get hit, I told the drive something like: ""You need to move. You're illegally parked in a dangerous spot.""

&amp;#x200B;

The man responded by following my car a couple feet to where I stopped at an adjacent stop sign. By this point, the stranger was getting out of his car and swearing at me. If I had anticipated what was going to happen next, I would have turned up my windows.

&amp;#x200B;

The guy let out a huge gob of spit at my car and some of it hit me. I was perhaps more disgusted than anything. Rather than get into a fight, I looked back, saw what the guy was wearing and noted his license plate number. 

&amp;#x200B;

I then waited until I was safely out of the area and called the police. (As a non-practicing lawyer, spitting on someone when you're in the wrong might not seem serious but it's classified as an assault where I live.)  I gave 911 the details and left for a couple hours.

My question is not so much, did I handle this correctly. My question is more, should I be worried abut this guy coming back and trying to mess with my car or me or my house?

786,"I used to have a pot problem, alot of people think weed is like a miracle substance that u can use 24/7 and just be totally fine. for some people thats the case but for me it deffinetly wasnt. i started and smoked all day everyday for a year. i already had some mental illnes problems wich weed really helped at first. but then it stopped and only made it worse so i decided i wanted to quit. i tried just getting off alot of times but would always come back. i used to vape but had quit that for about a year. well call my friend dan. so dan was one of my main sesh friends. we would hangout all day biking around town and smoking weed at various nature stops. because dan wasnt really into movies and didnt listen to much music wed usually just sit and talk wich got us really close.  when i started quitting we started hanging out less and less because he always wants to smoke. wed still be together alot but maybe 4 days out of the week at this point where it used to be 7. my main concern when quitting pot was that id lose my friends. and honestly thats whats happend. when i stopped smoking elss id want to stay home and relax more often and dan didnt like this. he started thinking i was avoiding him and was angry at him wich wasnt the case at all. i credit alot of this to the weed messing with his emotions and making him more irratable. because thats exactly what was happening to me. over the past couple months hes become more argumentative and annoyed with everything. he always wants to hang out but whenever i go to hangout with him hes usually in a bad mood and pissed off wich makes me want to hang out less. a couple months ago dan bought a vape for partys. this brought vapes around me more and made me remember how much i liked it. we eventually bought these disposable e cigs. it was at this point i discovered this could be my way out of weed. a couple months later and its worked very well. i dont even have cravings for weed anymore and my mental health is 100% better, so is my productivity. but because of that  all i want to do now is stay at home and make music. wich doesnt make dan very happy because i never come out. now on a side note i want to say that dans a very good loyal friend. hes one of my closest but i feel like his attitude is driving a wedge between us because i never want to go out because i know itll probably just be him in a bad mood. so back to the main story. one night dan text me and started giving me shit about vaping and calling me an addict and everything. i tried explaining to him why i didnt like weed anymore and how vaping was helping me quit and how it was only temporary and id be quiting (im very close to quitting. im decreaseing the nicotine amount every bottle i buy and will be done by next month) i really wanted to bring up the problems i have with dan and his weed/attitude but i knew he wouldnt listen to me and just get angry so i didint say anything. he told me he doesnt want to see me vaping when we hangout. so i said ok because thats very do-able and i did it for a couple months. id say right now our friendships at its worst point its ever been because he texts to hang out but im either at work or want to work on music. so i dont go out to much. another reason i dont like going out is because i think its kind of stupid that we can go out and ill say nothing about his weed and wont care if he smokes around me but i cant vape or else he gives me shit. like tbh i dont wanna go out to his smoke shed and just watch him smoke while i cant do my substance of choice. but see i cant talk to him about anything of thi because i know how his mind works and i know 100% itll start a huge argument. i guess i just wanna know what you guys think i should do here, should i just avoid going out and stay at home doing what i want even though i know itll just make him more mad and paranoid that i dont come out and he thinks i have something against him? should i talk to him even though i know hell get mad and most liley wont listen to what i say? should i just go along with his game?",12Jul2019,1

792,"So, I’m 21 years of age and I’m going into my junior year of college. However, as cool as it is, I’m no where near the point where I imagined myself being in. I get that at every point in our lives we encounter wins and loses, but my life really, *really* hasn’t had a taste of any good win. Here’s why- after I graduated HS, I thought hmm- I might get a car, I might meet new friends, I might get a job, and later through college I though I might get an internship, I might find love, I might have money since my tuition is fully paid by a couple of scholarships, and end up being a great person, but no. I’m going into my third year of college without any friends *literally*, I don’t have a car, I don’t have money, I don’t even have a connected phone...but wait, there is more- my college degree expects us to get an internship before becoming a senior which I don’t have, I have no job, and lastly I lost all motivation.

I get that I can use my brother’s car to get a job and make money, but he works way too much for him to have time off. I applied for many *many* jobs near my area and not a single call since I used my brother’s phone number to input in the application. In fact, I’m not a downer or unkind but there was an opening position from Best Buy a couple weeks back and sure enough i applied but got denied the position and came to find out that a guy that I went to HS with got the job. Here’s what I mean by me not being a selfish brutal guy- the guy that got the job, I remember he had remedial classes for not passing the standardized test and he failed a couple classes. Again I’m not brutal but cmon, I have a gpa of 3.3 in college, not that it means anything but it’s quite unfair, but whatever.

Now, I’m not going to ask for any money from my brothers or anyone because I’m not charity-work, I have legs and arms to work. I have no friends, no money, nothing, *literally* nothing- to gain a step into the positive right direction.

793,"This is honestly incredibly difficult to explain, and really gut-wrenching to even say, but I think I may need to end a friendship with someone I consider a good friend. That or something needs to drastically change I just don’t know how to address it.

It’s pretty tricky to explain as I either end up giving too many details or not enough, but I’m going to do my best. Essentially I’m a medical student. I come from a poor family with no one even remotely working in the medical field. As such I’ve kind of felt out of place in school. While I get along decently well with most other students, I just don’t quite feel that real friendship connection aside of maybe a very small handful. This isn’t just a bit lonely at times, its also potentially problematic as a huge part of medical school is making connections. This is where, let’s call her Sarah, comes in.

Sarah is someone who comes from a little bit of a similar background to me, although she’s a few years older and a much more sociable person. We’ve known each other for a little while now, and we’ve become decently close friends. She’s someone I just feel like I click with. She has even told me she considers me a good friend and that she confides in me things she doesn’t really tell many others. The issue is, that while I feel absolutely great to have a friend that see’s me that way, as of late she has not made me feel that way.

As of late, say a little over a month, every idea I have about going out she’ll either reject or agree on but then either cancel or sometimes straight up just not follow up on (like not even a call or text the day we’re suppose to go out). While normally I would just see this as her not wanting to hang out and stop bothering, she has directly put ideas/plans out yet still she either ends up canceling, changing drastically, or just never following up on. And it’s just led to me feeling really confused. On one hand I really do genuinely enjoy her friendship and in person it feels like we’re good friends, but on the other hand she often makes me feel like a pest by ignoring me or not following up on our ideas to spend time together. 

Perhaps another layer to this is that she does hang out with a decent amount of people from the school. I obviously don’t know the ins and outs of her personal life (maybe at one point we were close enough that I had a better idea, but that times kind of passed), but she often casually references how she either went to do this or that with someone. On one hand I feel I may be overthinking it and maybe it’s not as frequent, or maybe its more like short term quick things or what have you, but on the other hand I admittedly feel a bit inadequate or jealous if she seems to have time for all these other people but she can barely make time for me even though we’re “good friends”. For example in a phone call she asked if I wanted to study together in the library the next day, the next day she never followed up, I finally ask if she wants to a few days later and when we’re studying she mentions how she was studying with someone else that day we were supposed to.

There are plenty of examples of very similar things, where she’ll offer something or say we should do something and then I’ll find out often times she ended up doing something different with someone else. To be fair, I guess I don’t really think it’s been malicious and I am more inclined to believe its either been due to poor communication on her part or even old fashioned forgetfulness (she is admittedly decently forgetful), but it’s been incredibly inconsiderate and I just have gotten incredibly frustrated. And admittedly my frustration kind of culminated and I got mad at her and slammed a door in her face (https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/cc3212/aita_for_slamming_the_door_in_a_friends_face/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) (TL;DR She was inconsiderate and wasted my time yet didn’t apologize and instead tried to justify it, so I ended up slamming a door in her face)

But now that I’ve had a little time to think about it, I hate that I got that angry. I hate that I was so frustrated that I slammed a door in someone’s face. And further, I hate that I genuinely don’t know if we actually are good friends and she can just be inconsiderate or if she’s just talk. Aside from that I fear losing her as a friend because I know she’s well connected and I know everyone will think I’m the awful one, but more importantly I don’t want to lose her as a friend because I love having her as a friend.

I’m just so mixed up. I haven’t spoken to her since the door thing and I don’t know what to do or say. I need advice.

TL;DR I’m not sure if my friend really sees me as a close friend but is just inconsiderate or if they’re just saying so for some reason.",12Jul2019,1

802,"(Posting This here because AITA doesn’t allow certain words)
A friend of mine has been cosplaying for a few years now. They’re very passionate about what they do, making all of their costumes from scratch and participating in photo shoots.

The thing is:
 1.) They’re a minor and 5’3”
2.) The characters they cosplay tend to be scantily dressed
3.) They’re disabled in their leg

And if there’s anything a sexual predator loves, it’s someone they can easily overpower and a good excuse to do so. 
Every single convention they’ve been to, they’ve been either catcalled, groped, or have had a much MUCH MUCH older man slip into their IG DMs and attempt to groom them, despite their age being in their profile.

Sexual predators and pedophiles are everywhere and they go to conventions for an easy picking. In a perfect world, they wouldn’t exist but alas! The world fucking sucks, and my friend acts like if they continue cosplaying like they do, it’ll prove a point. 

It’s absolutely horrible.

They keep posting on their story that they, “Will keep fighting tooth and nail to cosplay how they wish,” despite all of this, but I am seriously concerned for their safety. Even when they take precautions like sticking in groups, it still happens!

My heart shatters every time I hear they’ve been sexually assaulted at a con. I feel like I need to speak up as their best friend before something even worse than groping happens. I don’t want them to stop cosplaying per say, but consider cosplaying characters that show less skin for their safety.

803,"What’s harder for me was that it was my own brother who did it. It was at a young age when I had to sleep with him ( we had separate single beds ) and every night he would either try to scare me or playfight with me  even when I didn’t want to (typical brother things I guess?) But one night he told me that I should suck his dick (I was about 7 or 8 at the time, he was around 13 or 14) and I remember him saying that its what everybody else does? Fast forward a couple of weeks and these started to grow into threats where if I don’t start on him, he would beat me. I remember one time he peed when I was doing it and another time he showed me what happens if I kept rubiing it and forced me to lick it ( I fought back and he stopped ). I really can’t go into any more details, this hurts to talk about.

This stopped when I reached about 12. After that I slept in a separate bedroom ( my parents never found out, but they separated us because we kept fighting ) But I was embarrassed about this, not because I knew he was in the wrong, but because I thought I was. I thought that males could never be raped, or I would be in the wrong because I was submissive.

Now, I’m grown up and I have no idea as to what to do about this, I know I’m not in the wrong, but I’m scared of what will happen if I do something about it.

Its so hard to fucking write this without cringing and shaming myself, I felt like I was writing a fucked up incest porn. Right now I just want to kill him or just expose him, but then when I wake up in the morning, I cringe at myself for even thinking about it and try to forget it, but I never do. 

Help me, I have no clue or direction as to what I should do. I haven’t talked about this with anyone because I’m scared of what would happen if I did. Even if I did, I have aspergers so it’d be very difficult for me to get the words out. I also feel like I’m making a big deal out of it.",12Jul2019,11

805,"Hi redditors
(English is not my first language and I'm not in a good mental state right now so pls overlook my elemenary-like vocabulary; tldr at the bottom)

I'm here because of my bad record of emotional decision making. 

I met a girl about a year ago through a mutual friend. We instantly had good conversations everytime we saw each other even though it wasn't often.

Three weeks ago we started doing more together. We went for dinner, cooked together, went to many events and even were swimming naked in the nearby river.
A few days later I found out that her boyfriend broke up with her. We talked about it and she seemed pretty sad about it. 

This started a series of deep conversations about her problems at work, my mental health issues( depression with a possibility of bipolar disorder) , her previous mental health issues and therapy. Some conversations ended hugging each other while crying.

My feelings for her developed pretty late because I cut out most of my feelings to cope with my mental health issues. 

I wanted to talk about my feelings towards her but I was scared to lose a good friend and I didn't feel like I deserved her or I would let her down with my periodic depressive episodes. 

A few days ago I heard from our mutual friend that she's in love with another person and I don't know what to do now.

I can't shut down my feelings and I need to tell her. On the other hand I don't feel like I am allowed to interfere with her starting relationship because I want her to be happy and for some reason I don't think she can be happy with me.

Reading my own text kind of makes me cringe but I finally managed to write it down. If it doesn't fit here just delete it. I don't even know what to expect from this post.

TL;Dr: because of my inability to express my feelings at the right time I don't know if I should confess them now and possibly interfere with her starting relationship",12Jul2019,1
806,"Dear Reddit, I'd like advice on how not to be a self-absorbed bitch. I notice that I always talk about myself and never recognize how others are feeling. I try to see others perspective, but end up being a huge hypocrite. I'd like advice on how to stop these habits and recognize when someone isn't feeling too well, or when to stop talking about myself",12Jul2019,1
807,"Currently I am 8 weeks pregnant. My SO and I have been looking at houses and apartments for months. My mom wants to move in with us which is fine. But now because my SO and I have some bad credit we have nowhere to go. I’ve went to social assistance and asked for help but the only way they added emergency housing is for domestic violence situations. It’s far from that. 

So we’ve looked at well over 30 places and each and every one of them so far have turned us down. 

So now that we are desperate my mom is asking me if I have a backup plan, which I don’t. She is telling my SO that he would have to leave and live with his Nan over 2 hours away while I would move in with my mom and my aunt. 

I’m starting to believe that my mom has something against my relationship. It’s the little things that are starting to bother me. I have until August 1st to be out of my current apartment and I have yet to find somewhere to go. I need help. 

I don’t have the credit to get my own place, or the money even working near constantly. Living in Canada is great for everyone, or so they say. I’m classified as low-income working 2 jobs!! The assistance I get is only if my SO were to beat me? I don’t understand anything anymore. 

What can I do? Do I leave my SO and live with my mom? Do I keep searching for something and somewhere to go? Anyone know of any resources that can help?",12Jul2019,1
808,"Hello. I am in highschool and am sixteen years old if that's helps your advice/help. I have a close friend who I, nine days ago, confessed romantic feelings towards. We've been the closest of friends since middle school and have been practically inseparable. Well, she told me that she has/had feelings for me as well and doesn't know how to respond to the situation and that she'd get back to me but it wasn't a no. She hasn't responded to my messages since and I fear that I've either pushed her away or made her uncomfortable towards me. Amino users know that the notifications on said app are kinda wonky. So the advice I'm seeking is has she just stopped talking to me, is she still thinking about it or has she just not gotten my messages the past nine days? And how should I handle the situation? Please, I really do care about her and I don't want to lose her, even if we just stay friends.",12Jul2019,1
809,"I am currently on an amazing vacation with my wife and i ruined tonight for her.

I have always had a tough time letting loose.  At times I can be fun and let loose, but other times I just cant let go and enjoy things.

A few years ago, a friend got diagnosed with adhd and after talking to him about his struggles, it really resonated with me.  I had difficulty staying on task, always procrastinared, never finished things and frankly, I never shut up.

I decided to get tested for it, and went to a counsellor who gave me some computerized test to see if i had it.  It showed I did, I was prescirbed medication for it.

it worked for a time.  I was doing much better at work and i think at home too.

I have a job where i have an assistant and I then got an amazing one, being able to trust her let me relax.  After about less than a year there were some staff changes, and my assistant changed positions.

For the first time, the adhd medication wasnt working as well, because I stressed too much about work with my new assistant, who was awful.

Around then I started smoking weed regularly because it helped me sleep.  The sleep helped me be more restored and things got better.

Over time, I smoked more weed and it moved up to every night to help me sleep.  

Over time though, it didnt help with my days.  I felt like parts of my adhd were back, despite my pills.

I shoved it down.   I was (and am) scared.  I couldnt even tell my wife, who I love more than anything and want to tell everything to.

Last week we started a vacation to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  It was our biggest trip ever and we were both over the moon.

Our vacation had been amazing, we even met an amazing group of new people.  

A few of those new friends started talking about doing molly.  I have always been scared of anything harder than weed, so I said I wasnt interested.

Truth is, I was interested and that scared me.  

So tonight, someone passed a few joints around and i smoked way more than i normally do, hoping it would make me have an amazing too.

It just made things worse, I was too stoned and didnt know how to deal and I didnt handle it well.

I had ruined my wife's night.  She was gonna stay with our new friends and i was gonna head back to our hotel.

Not far away, I started hyperventilating and I texted my wife that I needed help.  She came over and she calmed me down. 

I apologized and told her I was way too stoned and had to go back.  Told her I was ok and to stay at the event.  She reluctantly agreed.

I spent the walk back overanalysing everything and worried I had ruined things seriously with my wife.

Ive gotten back to my room, texted a little with my wife and I think we are ok (hope).

I have realized that I have and have always had anxiety.  Ive been using weed to control it without realizing and it was no longer working.  

I don't even know where to start and I wanted to reach out anonymously for some guidance.

How do I admit I need help?",12Jul2019,1
810,"I’m a 19 year old girl, and I’m the kind of person that really just likes to have a few really close friends. I’ve gone through phases all my life of having these friendships and being super close, doing everything together, etc. and then all of a sudden we drift apart and they don’t ask me to hang out anymore. I thought I was through with this/that it was just due to all the changes you go through in school (I’ve graduated), but now my best friends from high school have been ignoring my texts (unless they need something from me) and don’t invite me out to do anything with them even though they hang out all the time and live 15 minutes from me atm. My boyfriend is *literally* my only friend right now - and he is my best friend and I love him lots, but I miss having girls nights and things like that. 

I feel like somehow this has to be my fault but I just can’t figure out what I’m doing wrong. Everyone always tells me how nice, sweet, etc I am and I’m always the friend people turn to with their problem/advice. I don’t want to sound full of myself, but sometimes I just feel like I have a hard time finding “real” friends because I’m more mature than most people around my age and have a different way of viewing things, so it’s hard to relate sometimes. This doesn’t prevent me from trying to hang out with people or having fun, but I think maybe people realize that I’m not going to cheer them on for binge drinking, smoking pot, having hook-ups every week etc. like their other friends. Not that I even openly criticize them for it... idk, hopefully what I’m trying to say makes sense. 

Anyway, I’m moving to a major city across the country in a month and I really want some tips on how to make some good friends. I won’t be going to college so I’ll be working, but some of my hobbies include playing music, going to concerts, reading, etc. 

Any advice is appreciated!",12Jul2019,1

813,"Hi I am a 22 year old male. 

I am now 10 years post treatment from cancer that has left me intellectually /somewhat physically (osteoporosis) and with mental issues. 

What I and most people thought is that life becomes normal after treatment. 

I had tried to study at university/college but due to the side effects of the cancer like fatigue severe attention and concentration and more I was unsuccessful I gave it a few more tries with the same result and now I have 6000 debt and it doesn't make sense to go back and study. I have tried to work and encounter the same problems. 

I feel like a criminal for even having this problem and that the people around me are not interested in anyway in supporting me towards a better future no matter how much I try to explain to them how this affects me and will continue to. They give me stigma for it. 

Even if I was able to move out I wouldnt be able to survive on my own. I dont know what my options would be or who I could move in with or if they would even understand. 

I am supposed have high supervision. 

I can't think what another 10 years like this would be like. It has been a very traumatic and painfull journey.",12Jul2019,4
814,I had a crush I really liked in middle school. I think that was the one person I’ve actually had a crush on and felt like she had the same feelings for me. I never had the best looks or personality but seeing her every day just felt great.

815,"my girlfriend (18) tends to party out on the town every now and then, and without fault she always has the contact info of numerous men the day after, something that makes me uncomfortable. not because i don’t trust her, but because i don’t like the thought of other guys trying to flirt with her even though she doesn’t flirt back. i really really hate it actually, especially because i feel like she almost always has a new guy on her phone. to be honest it really makes me feel like shit. 

most instances she gets the guys snapchats, and proceeds to not speak to them but only maintains snap streak with them, so they aren’t having proper conversations. 

one instance especially hurt me. i saw a photo of a very handsome man on her phone when she was showing me pictures, and i asked who it was. she said ‘oh some guy from the club’, and i felt quite stumped. i asked her why she had the photo, and she said her friend asked her what he looked like. this leads me to believe that they spoke about him and his looks.

i’ve asked her before why she adds these men on snapchat, and she says she doesn’t put much thought into it as he has a different and more casual relationship with snapchat than I do. while i understand that, it bothers me that she isn’t willing to surrender this one thing that is seemingly insignificant to her since she also knows that this makes me really sad, and this has put a significant strain on our relationship. thing is, she thinks i’m wrong to not want her to add these men to her snapchat. 

my question: is she right? am i wrong to be hurt by her decision to add these men on snapchat?

PLEASE help me guys i don’t really have anyone else to discuss this with. thanks !!",12Jul2019,1
816,"I knew a guy who sort of embedded himself with me and my friends, but started to bully me when my dad died, mostly making jokes about it. guy’d have very strange responses to anyone, normally saying “same” to nearly anything &amp; everything no matter how serious or important. I cut all communications from him &amp; shortly after he moved away. Gave me hell for 2 years.

Reason i think he’s psychotic is because he’s unhinged, has 0 boundaries, no remorse &amp; no fear, he also has the dead stare.

He’s physically strong, he’d go to bathrooms &amp; take pictures of guys cocks in the stalls for fun, he’s a blood, he’d talk shit to the teachers face &amp; they wouldn’t do shit, i’m not the weakest guy ever but i’ve spoken up to him before &amp; he grabbed me by my neck, he’d also spam my phone nearly every day on every medium &amp; has my home phone number. He would casually shit on ANYONE &amp; if they spoke up to him at all he’d get physical, but instead of doing it angrily he had a grin from ear to ear, this was always the case, he seemed to get a kick out of putting anyone down, no matter how low &amp; how personal.
He had no friends, only aquaintances who he’d shit on, &amp; a pair of equally toxic people he’d cyberbully with who he’d still shit on.

I hadn’t seen or heard from him in years, but I saw him today in traffic today, he was driving like a maniac to catch up to me, as well as honking at me constantly.

What do i do if i run into this prick again? As nobody i’ve seen has been able to put him in line including his family.",12Jul2019,1
817,"I (20F) have always been incredibly close with my mom. She’s my rock, she’s always been there for me and I have an attachment to her. I think it’s because I was young when my older brother passed away and I just stuck to her from then on. She moved away from her home state when she was 20 with my dad. They moved all around and had my siblings and finally settled in my home state. We’ve been here for 12 years so needless to say, it is my home. My parents recently sold the house and moved back to their home state, 1500 miles away, and I moved to the city in my state. I thought for sure I’d be fine, being completely alone, save for my brother a state away. But I’m not. I’m anxious, I’m so sad, I’m becoming depressed. I’m miserable. I miss my family so much. I don’t want to have to get used to being away from family. And I have anxiety about getting a new job again.
