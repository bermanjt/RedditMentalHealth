She is way out my league but one summer we tried to see if there was any sparks so we made out and she slept over with no sex but I enjoyed that it was about sex more about just wanting to be close that night. Problem is it’s been 2 years since that night and we talk about it here and there but I’m the only one that felt it and I’m trying to move on dead ass I want to do friend activities with her like road trip, camping and all that with our mutual friends but i don’t want to feel in love I just want to feel normal.

1,"Hey everyone, 

I'm honestly using a throwaway because I'm kind of ashamed of the whole situation and me being a part of it. I talked about it with my close family members and friends, but other people knowing about it would make me feel really bad.  


When I was a teenager I hung around some troubled kids, selling drugs and getting into fights. We weren't like low-lifes that people avoided and didn't want to be around, and were actually hanging around lots of other people (kids) that weren't into all that. It was just our style back then, to put it that way. I know how stupid that sounds now.  
So, we usually hung out in our neighborhood block after school. We smoked weed there, sometimes drank and stupid teenage behavior like that. There was this one guy from that block that sometimes smoked with us, completely uninvited of course. He probably lived really close by and could smell the weed coming by.  He was a low-life, practically a bum, living alone at 17 because his mother kicked him out. Had no job, a big criminal record, and to be honest he was the scariest guy I've seen. I didn't like being around him but other guys didn't mind so I didn't care.  


We got into a fight at a club one night with a local crew that we knew from the area. The next morning somebody from my crew got in contact with their crew and we arranged to meet and settle all of this (probably fight again to be honest, all of us were expecting that). That afternoon all of us were hanging around the same block again, getting ready for the meetup, when that guy showed. He was very drunk and after hearing about what was going down wanted to come with us. We agreed. Went over there. Got in a huge fight (6 on 7) and most of us ended up in a police station. Great story to tell my grandchildren.  


Okay so not to bother you any more I know this is a big story already, that guy ended up in jail (not only because of that but because I don't know how many charges they had against him) and all of us got some small fines. That passes, I'm 24 now and I'm a completely different person and so are most of my friends from back then. I can't believe I was that stupid and live a completely different life now, I'm finishing up my masters degree in computer science and am very pleased with my life all in all.  


Anyway, I got a fucking call a few months ago from that low-life son of a bitch that I forgot completely about since I last saw him 8 years ago. I couldn't believe who was calling me and I wanted to hang up immediately but was kind of curious to why he is calling me. He told me that he wants all of us (5 guys) to give him $500 each for the time he spent in prison because of us and how all of us got a deal to put him in jail. I said of course not, fuck you, and he told me that he knows where I live and was going to find me. I said fuck you again and hung up.   


Today I was going to a mall to pick up a present for my gf and there he was. Standing at the entrance, doing god knows what, and looking like a escaped prisoner. I didn't look at him but he saw me. He came up and told me that he knew he would eventually find me (which is statistically really not likely unless he is following me around). I froze for a minute but told him I want nothing to do with him. He said let's go somewhere and talk (this place is quite crowded and he probably didn't want to fight me there). I said of course not, and left. He told me that the next time he sees me it will be much different.  


Thanks for reading up until now, it means a lot to me, and I was trying to make it as interesting as possible for you.  
So the question is, what do I do? I can't report him, he literally hasn't done anything, and I can't prove that we even talked. This guy has nothing to lose and will probably spend his whole life in and out of prison.",14Feb2019,1

3,"I've told him basically every secret I've ever had, and now he's told them all to his (basically) gf. I'm not too mad, since those all were just stupid things, but I'm kinda worried about our boundaries, because he didn't get the hint that I wanted him to stop.",14Feb2019,1

6,"Basically I was a passenger in a car crash yesterday where both cars involved were written off. 

My mum's car was taken to a scrap place for storage after we went to the hospital. We contacted the insurance company today and they said they will be collecting the car as it obviously costs money to keep it on someone else's property. 

I've never had a car crash before, so don't know how I retrieve our stuff? Or if it's too late to do so once the insurance company has our car? 

The accident was at 3:20pm yesterday, we got home at 11:30pm so couldn't contact anyone as it was out of hours. And then obviously today we've been trying to clear things up while also dealing with injuries + pains so couldn't really go today. So I'm sure insurance companies take into consideration that we likely don't have a car or the ability to travel to places. But I don't know lmao",14Feb2019,1
7,"I used to weigh 218 pounds and dropped down to 162. I’ve lost weight because I wasn’t very happy with my body(still am not even tho a lot of family that I haven’t seen in a year have a reaction when they see me again) and because I I always told myself I wouldn’t get a girlfriend looking big and ugly but I yet don’t have any luck with girls, I am also considering dropping more weigh(I’m a 17 yr old male high school student) ",14Feb2019,1

This crazy sex drive and lusting has lead me to do some disgusting things, which I really regret (nothing illegal). I won't go into detail but some scarring things honestly.

What should I do? How do I get to feel like a normal person again? ",14Feb2019,1
9,"So this whole fiasco started a while ago when a friend of mine asked if I could buy her some weed. At first I said no since she wanted it at school, but eventually I agreed. I found out one of my classmates sold weed and we agreed on 12$ for a gram of dro. This guy is the type of guy that wakes and bakes, and gets 0s in every class, so I wasn't exactly thrilled when he came into 2nd period smelling like strong weed. We started whispering to each other,

""You got it?""

""Nah man, I smoked that ho"" (being pretty loud)

""Wait, for real?""

""Nah man I'm just playing.""

""When do you want it?""

""In third peri--""

""I gotta get rid of this bitch now."" (again, pretty loud)

He drops the little baggie into my open hand, but since I wasn't prepared for it, it bounced and hit the floor. ""He dropped the gram!"" (at this point my heart has stopped and I pick it up in a millisecond). ""What the fuck are you doing??!"" I whispered in a panic. Even though it was only the start of second period, a teacher assistant is at the table behind us. I'm 99.99% sure she saw it, but at this point I'm just trying to hide it from all of her senses as quick as possible. I stuffed it into my pocket, but 20 seconds later, everyone at my table (luckily friends) smelled it. My friend offers to hold it somewhere it won't smell, and I immediately agree. He puts it in-between his belt and everything is steady for a few minutes, and then we begin to catch a whiff of it again. ""Fuck,"" ""We gotta move this or we're gonna get caught."" At this point I'm sweating balls since class has already started, but he discreetly slips it into a pocket into my backpack, while putting one of my gym shirts on top of it to smother the smell. It works and as I'm anxiously walking to third period, I see my friend who asked me to buy the weed.

""I almost got fucking caught, I'm not doing that shit for you ever again"". 

""Really?""

""Yes!"" I said, on the verge of tears from anxiety. I rummage through my backpack, slip it in her jacket pocket, and move quickly towards my third period class. For the rest of the day, I'm on edge. Every time the door opens my heart skips a beat. I thought that for sure the assistant had filed a report or radioed in to an administrator what happened, but nothing happened. Word began to spread around by 5th period, to a few people I was acquaintances with.

""You're so fucking stupid,"" giggling while she said it.

""You're probably going to jail,"" someone else said.

When I stepped out of the school, I saw my mom (a teacher at the school to make the situation 5x scarier) and we had our usual afterschool talk.

""How was school?""

""Good, how was your day?""

""It was ok.""

I felt sooo guilty acting like nothing was wrong. I walked to the local park to try and cool off, which helped a lot after I told the story to some friends. They were really understand me and wished me luck. As I was walking back to the school to get picked up by my brother, I hear someone yell across the road;

&amp;#x200B;

""Yo \[my name\], gimmie the g!""

My heart instantly fell again, and I heard them say something else about me but I couldn't make it out. This was bad. These were people who weren't even in my acquaintances who found out what happened. I fake smiled at them and started walking again. I get in my brothers car, get home, and I just hugged my mom when we got home. I wanted to tell her so bad but I didn't want to get my friend in trouble so I'm currently holding off. I decided that if an administrator was to ever find out about this, I was going to tell them the whole truth, but I still have that butterfly in my stomach feeling. Even at home when I was watching YouTube, I still felt that guilt and anxiety lingering in my stomach. How can I release some of this nervousness, without incriminating any of my friends or classmates? I will update you tommorow.",14Feb2019,1

12,"Hey, so I'm a virgin girl in my mid 20s. Been told I'm very attractive by both men and women. Sadly, I've never had a serious relationship. I was awkward in high school and early college, and only recently started getting attention from guys. But the one thing that bothers me is that I've never had sex. I just broke it off with a guy who I thought could be my first, but we ended up not being compatible. I've become tired of ""waiting for the right one"" and am terrified that I'll end up like Steve Carell's character in The 40-Year-Old Virgin.

Funny enough, I'm probs one of the horniest virgin girls you'll ever meet--I think about sex often and masturbate an average of 4-5 times a week, and I doubt I'll bleed since I've used toys on myself.

So recently, I've been thinking about getting drunk and losing it to my good friend and one of her boyfriends (she's in an open relationship with two different guys). I've briefly brought it up to her and one of her boyfriends and they both seemed cool with the idea. Plus, I've know them for years and know they're good people who I genuinely can trust.

Just wanna know opinions...is a 20 something virgin (who ISN'T waiting for marriage) a turn-off for most?? Is there a method to making my first time less awkward??

13,"First time posting on this sub, but this has been an issue that's been eating at me more and more recently.

My parents are both ridiculously stubborn and refuse to listen to anything my brother and I have to say that challenges their beliefs. For example, my dad believes mental illness isn't real, despite the fact that I've been diagnosed (major depression and panic disorder \*sad trombone\*), and just in general believes that he's always right about everything, even if he's in the wrong.

The main issue I'm struggling with is coming out. I'm trans (ftm), and I've come out to my mother a total of two times, but have been called by my preferred name and my pronouns in front of her several times (it pisses her off a whole bunch). She's told me the whole spiel, how I'll go to hell if I ""made that choice"" (not a choice) and that I'm a girl because that's how I was born, even how I couldn't be a boy because she wanted one daughter and one son and if I was trans then she'd have two sons (surprise mom, I'm still trans).

The more recent time I came out, I begged my mother to look up resources for parenting a trans child online, but she wanted to hear it from me (how the fuck am I supposed to know??) and just otherwise refuses to believe I'm trans and refuses to learn anything more than it other than what her backwards ass church taught her (she grew up in Mexico in the '70s so she's Catholic TM).

So, what I'm asking, and my TL;DR: My parents are transphobic. How do I get them to at least accept if not support the fact that I'm trans?",14Feb2019,1
14,"Okay to start off, I’m  a pretty young guy and going through puberty so this may be just me overreacting a bit


So the thing is, my dad and I have never really gotten along. He was off in the army and I didn’t see him much for most of my early childhood. I need a place to vent for a moment because I just need to get this off my chest a bit. My dad doesn’t really get me. He’s always seemed to see me as a reflection of him as I look almost identical to him when he was younger. He was the type of kid to root up worms and trespass into places as I’m told of course I didn’t exist. I however, am the opposite. I don’t like to get out much, I try to follow rules and like to think of myself as a bit of a gentleman. He always seems to treat me as if I am like that. He is also just not very empathetic. His family doesn’t share feelings or anything, which is surprising because they’re a wonderful bunch of people. He is very hard on me and my siblings (sister is 13 and brother is 4). He always seems to be very hard on us, never accepting when we point out valid arguments, like not cleaning all the silverware because he decided we should also clean off the entire fucking kitchen and dining room which had silverware on the counters, and we really did clean it all. He is such an up tight dickhead most of the time. He seems to be very quick to anger. Before you say something about him killing people in the army or something, he has told me he never even killed anyone or anything hugely emotionally scarring or anything. I just needed a place to vent and I don’t care if you think I’m wrong, open to people bringing up things I may have not. Not the worst situation in the world, but small things can effect people who aren’t very mentally strong.",14Feb2019,1
15,"I really love my classes in college. My favorite, which I'm in now, is a discussion based English class with 6 people. I idolize my professor (who is also my advisor) and am fascinated by the rather obscure subject matter. Consequently, I do all the readings + lots of extra research. I also often write out my thoughts the night before and spend time thinking deeply about the issues we will discuss in class. Once I get to class, however, and actually open my mouth I sound like a complete idiot. I want to share so badly, I almost feel like I a little kid sometimes. I try hard to keep my mouth shut knowing I'll regret it but I do end up saying at least two or three things per class.
The minute I start to speak, however, my mind just kind of freaks out and shuts down. Everything I'd planned to say suddenly makes no sense or seems extra complicated. I always get so embarrassed and I keep apologizing and then rambling and then apologizing and making a self-deprecating comment. Then I vow never to speak again. Then I fail because I think this time I know exactly what I want to say. But the cycle just repeats.

I always feel like shit about this yet I'm simultaneously compelled to speak all the time because I'm so excited for class and have so many thoughts related to what was just said. This class is the highlight of every week and I spend so much time preparing for it.

 Office hours are pretty much the same, maybe worse. 

I do exceptionally well in essays and have won awards for my papers but I feel like everyone thinks I'm a really annoying rambling idiot. Sometimes people tell me my comments are intelligent but I feel like they're just saying that because I tend to compulsively degrade myself when I speak.

Wtf is wrong with me. Being incoherent itself would be fine if I was also shy but I'm not. I'm anxious as hell but I also can't stop talking!!! 

I wish I could just shut the fuck up but when I enter that classroom I feel like I'm on speed or something. It's like this compulsive NEED to speak (I feel like I'll burst) coupled with an (almost) equally powerful hatred of myself when I speak.

I've been diagnosed with ADHD anxiety and bipolar disorder but have struggled with this my whole life. I'm so full of embarrassment right now going over all the many long rambling incoherent comments I've ever made in front of brilliant professors and students. It's a wonder I've not been made ashamed enough yet to quit speaking for good.

I asked one of her friends if she was being distant with everyone or just me, and she told me that she hadn’t been distant with her and that from what she knows about her that she probably doesn’t want anything serious right now since usually when there’s a lot going on in her life she doesn’t like to put anything else on her plate. i’ve been worrying about it for days now because this is the same thing that happened the last time i was talking to a girl and i ended up just getting ghosted. so now i’m just wondering whether or not to talk to her about it and bring up my worries or should i just give her space and let her work through some stuff and hope that she comes around?",14Feb2019,1

So for about another weekend, I get called into work.

19,"I came here 2 years ago when I became debt free about future investments. Out of the choices I listed, this subreddit chose travel which I've done 4 times since then and love saving for my future trips. This time I come here again asking about career choices. 

&amp;#x200B;

One word to describe my job would be comfortable. I get medical/dental at a great rate, discounts through vendors, 60% of my coworkers are pretty rad, and I can count on a paycheck every other week. I just got a $2/hour raise too recently. On the flip side, it's a long commute(35 minutes and I change highways three times) and office culture is dull and often times filled with safe, but fake personalities.

Personal life feels safe too. Most of my days are spent feeling tense because I live in a suburb where our neighbors don't give a crap about who you are. Everyone is fending for themself. I live in a residential neighborhood on a busy intersection where everything important is at least a 15 minute drive with traffic and stop lights. My roommate, however is very awesome and am sadden she is leaving back to her home state once our lease is up this June. I am 31 with no kids, never married, zero debt, 752 credit score, and haven't made a new friend outside of work since moving here 2 years ago. I feel like I've lost my sexiness with dating too. Conversations in the dating world are too much like office water cooler talk. Maybe I'm just becoming a dull person with built-up anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

With that bit of info about my current situation, I'm trying to decide what to do in June when we have to move out. One option is to buy a condo in a place that would cut my commute in half so I could have something to invest in rather than throw my money at rent. Option two is rather the opposite: leave the job and city behind to work on a small scale organic farm which is where my education and some work background lies(I have a science degree in environmental science, minor in geography). I left the last farm for my current job because of back issues(I have scoliosis, but I am in great physical shape). I was also working 60+ hour weeks at the last farm and more animal work than I work have liked, but not real aware until I was committed. Idealistic, but I have a dream to finding a person I can have a long-term deep connection with that includes starting a farm together and welcome people to Wwoofing or Workaway on.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I talk more about the second option like I've already made my decision, but I worry it is an impulsive and destructive decision. My friends tell me to go with my heart, but I just dont know. Maybe Reddit can help. I love questions btw.

The only documents she really has access to is her birth certificate and knowing her social security number. We don't have the physical card for the SS number, so the only two pieces of physical proof of who she is that we've been able to really get ahold of is her birth certificate and an old library card with her name on it. Her parents haven't really been any help, and aren't willing to go in person with her to the SS office to assist in proving her identity by having them there to prove that she's their daughter. 

I want to help her get everything she needs (Drivers License, Passport, etc), but I have no idea how to go about doing any of this, as when I got all of my own stuff, it was during my teenage years, with being able to use school records as proof to get started; Not to mention I had both my birth certificate and a physical copy of my SS card.

An additional problem: We tried to sign her up for task-based jobs at one point last year (Caviar, UberEats, etc), except, when entering her SS number, her name didn't work with it. At that time, we had access to a physical copy of the card that we no longer have access to, so we knew that the name on the card matched perfectly to the SS on the card. She has two last names, and when we talked to another of her family members, they said that they had the same issue with their SS until they changed their name to only reflect one last name. 

How in the world do we go about this? I've talked to multiple SS employees, who've been basically of no help, citing the same required documents, of which we have access to none of, the whole time. Are there any alternative ways at all?

25,"He is a 25/m and I’m a 25/f. My ex recently asked me to go out to eat with him. We have been broken up for almost two years. We dated for six years prior to that. We have shared a lot of our growing up together. He recently told me that he is generally really happy with his life except for his relationship with his gf as he doesn’t think they’re compatible. 

So we basically talked for six hours until five am the other night about life, our goals, how we have matured, and what our ever changing perspectives of life are. 

So he told me that he has been thinking about past good times a lot because he tends to do that when he is sad. I inquired further and he said he was thinking about what positive things have lead him to where he is now and how I influenced him a lot. He said that he is sad because of his girlfriend situation and how they’re so different and that he thought they could grow together over time but it isn’t happening. He told me he had the crazy obsessive butterfly feeling with me that he didn’t have with her. I reminded him we met as teenagers and hormones probably
Played a role in that and also we have jobs and lives now. 

I also said people are so different and I’ve always wondered if we got along so well because we knew each other for so long and were so similar and saw the world the same or if that kind of grew over time. I said I wondered this with other people who I dated who were up to par but I wasn’t crazy about them. He agreed. 

We couldn’t stop talking for hours and he gave me a very extended hug after our talk and we left and haven’t spoken since. He said it was amazing to talk to me and that he may want to catch up again in the future. 

He is still with him girlfriend and has never said anything well about her ever. 

I am worried I am a rebound for him as he is having these discussions with me while still having a gf. He hasn’t been single since we broke up and am wondering if he just is afraid of being alone. Meanwhile I’ve had multiple short relationships but ended it when I realized it wouldn’t work and spent a lot of time working on myself, my career, and my friends and family, and goals. 

**TLDR: ex and I talked. He said stuff like he didn’t appreciate me when we were together and his perspectives have changed. He is still dating his gf who he has never spoken positively about. I am wondering if I am just being used as a rebound**",14Feb2019,1

28,"Alright, so I've got very vague plans currently about moving to Savannah, Georgia next summer and it has me quite anxious. If you stalk my comments you'd figure out I live in Indiana, and I can safely say I've never lived outside the state in all 22 years I've been alive. That said, I find myself in a serious depressive rut here, and see the move as a good chance to freshen up and experience something new.

So why Savannah? I've got a friend that wants to move back there once he's done with college, and we've both talked about renting a place together for a long while now. He's actually out studying abroad or I'd move sooner. That right there may raise flags, but we've known each other for a decade now. I'm highly adaptable as it is and thinking on my feet has been mildly easy, so I don't see the move as negative just challenging.

Here's the issue: I have no college education and I'm a type 1 diabetic still on his father's insurance. I have no idea how I should go about finding prospective employment in a completely new state, over a year in advance, that can meet a budget of around $1600 a month. That budget is on the lean side of all my bills while still giving a slight padding just in case. I've only ever had one full time job, and even though I'm confident I can handle anything thrown at me given a bit of time to learn it will be hard convincing employers of that.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really sorry for the slight wall of text, but I constantly have this all on my mind. I lack serious experience with any of this, seeing as I've been living with family all my life and have been lucky to have kind grandparents and a good (albeit irresponsible) mother and father.

30,"So i (F) just joined reddit, for this purpose. If i talk about this to anyone i know in real life, they will tell everyone and it just wont go down well with me, so i'm turning to this sub. 

Let's just say i'm in my early teens. I go to a extremely small school with about 150 people, so keep that in mind. I have been talking to this guy, we'll call him Q. so Q is this boy i have liked since i have came to this school (5 years) and we dated for a couple of months but we broke up. That was like 3 years ago though so its not that relevant. Our school announced a school dance, which is very rare for us. So of course i asked Q. I was too chicken to ask him and that was pretty apparent so he ended up asking me (its a Sadie Hawkins). We are gonna go as a date next month to the dance. A week or two after we decided to go to the dance together, I got his discord and we started chatting.   

It started out talking a couple times a week, and now it is a daily thing. We started to call, too. I'm super happy about it. Anyway, yesterday I tried to talk to him and he blew me off. I was upset, but I overthink everything so I tried to ignore it. Later, I said goodnight and he didn't answer. I began to get super worried at this point bc it isn't like him. That day, I noticed how he wasn't laughing when I did or paying attention to me at all. I figured it was just a bad day. Today, he acted a little more normal but still odd. He is the one who initiates the convos and it is 7 tonight and he still hasn't said anything.

A big detail in this is that he said he was gonna ask me out yesterday to a couple of people then just ghosted. I'm worried I annoyed him or did something to make him angry. There are only two possible reasons for this:

  1: My friend yelled that she read our pm's

  2: My other friend told him i hated him (he knows she lies a lot so i doubt this is the reason.)

I don't know if I should give it time, or ask what's wrong. I don't want to let it fizzle out because i'm kinda head over heels for him soooo... please gimme some input.

I said that was fine, and I texted her half an hour ago to see if she was okay. Her mom answered asking how I knew her and what I wanted. What should I do?",14Feb2019,1
32,"I don't really know where to start. Please bear with the scattered pieces of information I'm trying to put together. Note that none of this is exaggerated or blown out of proportion.

I suppose I really enjoy video games. It's something that's always been with me for the majority of my teenage years(I'm 16 btw) 

My parents were fine with me getting 75%+ in elementary school. In highschool, it became a requirement for me to get 80% or higher on all my courses, or else I would be permanently banned from video games. 

I'm think I'm decent at other courses, averaging about 90%. The problem is math. I wouldn't blame it completely on genetics, but my mother and grandfather seem to have a reputation for being mathematically lacking. With that being said, I was barely able to squeeze past grade 9 and 10, and then grade 11 came, got a 72%. I studied math the most out of my courses, and tried the hardest in that course too.

All hell broke loose, my parents told me I'm not getting into university, I'm just a failure like my dad's brother(presumably on the streets, idk) and obviously no more video games at all.

I can't say I was surprised that I can't play games anymore since I knew it would happen, but it still feels like my insides literally tearing apart.

I can't really say I have an addiction to video games; I can live with not playing for a week or two, but once again, it's something I enjoy doing. I usually play an hour everyday, which I don't think is particularly excessive. Also note that this is the only thing I genuinely enjoy doing at home, and is the only stress deterrent I have. I think having the right to play video games at all is the only thing I hold dear.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents abuse that. If I don't literally 'wash my lunch utensils before this time I can't play video games tomorrow.' Dumb shit like that. 

So after I got barred from video games, I told them, 'and what if I don't do (some dumb shit) now?"" And they tell me that ""I'm not going to school anymore."" wtf? I thought the purpose of stopping me from gaming is so I can focus more on my studies and improve at math.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

What I would need advice on is two things: 

First, I feel like what makes me feel like my insides are being torn apart is that my parents aren't reasonable. They know all too well that video games are important to me for many reasons, yet simply because I got a measly 72% compared to the other 7 good marks I got, my rights to relax at home is taken away. They don't even give me a bit of leeway knowing that being bad at math seems to run in the blood. Am I the one with a misconstrued perception of my parents being unreasonable,  or is their belief that permanently disallowing me from touching video games will help me improve at math?  

&amp;#x200B;

Second, what do I do from here? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks if anyone bothers to help me out. It's an emotionally tough and confusing time for me.

40,"I’m not sure where to start. I’m just SO angry about this situation, and I feel completely helpless. 

Some background, I just bought my house in June 2018. It’s in a nice neighborhood that hasn’t had a break-in, or even a porch pirate in 20 years. 

When I bought the house, I asked all the questions I could think to ask, including how to shutoff the water outside so that the pipes wouldn’t burst in the winter. The previous owner told me there isn’t one because the pipes drain themselves after you turn the water off so there’s nothing to worry about. 

Fast forward to last week, Husband comes home from work one day and hears a weird noise in the back yard. He finds some chairs on top of the table, and a couple thrown in the yard. Wrought iron chairs.

And the faucet in the back yard gushing water. He turned off the water and put the furniture back and called me at work. 

He didn’t think it was a big deal, but I said that we should at least file a police report. Our police department used to have online reporting, so I tried to do that when I got home, but they don’t use that anymore. I had to go out of town the next day, but when I got back the day after that I went to the police station to file a police report. 

I was able to check my daily usage online even though my bill hasn’t come yet. Normally we use about 450 units of water per MONTH. Just that day, the usage was 493 units. So I was freaking out and trying to figure out how much my next bill is going to be. 

The dispatcher that was at the window rolled her eyes at me when I explained what happened. She asked if I have security cameras. When I said that I didn’t she said, “well you can’t prove that it wasn’t you.” I said I understand that, but it wasn’t me and I want to file a police report so that if it happens again to me or my neighbors, that this incident is on the record. She then asked if I’ve been arguing with my neighbors and if they’d have done it to get back at me for something. No, my neighbors are very elderly for one thing, and for another, we’ve cut their grass for them, helped with their flower beds and shoveled their driveways for them. One of them had recently sent us a thank you card with a gift card inside it, so I’m positive that it wasn’t one of my neighbors. (Do I think it could have been a teenager from somewhere in our neighborhood or close by, absolutely. But the thought has also crossed my mind that it could have been someone trying to figure out if anyone was home.) Then the dispatcher asks me why I’m at the police station instead of just calling them. My brain was definitely scattered, but when I couldn’t file the report online, I just thought that I’d have to go to the police station to fill out a form. I told her I just didn’t think about it. She rolls her eyes again, but finally says to have a seat while she gets an officer to come take a report. While I’m waiting I hear her on the radio say that there’s an idiot in the lobby that wants to file a police report, and that she already told me that I don’t need to. 

An officer comes out, takes my information, asks some other questions and tells me that they’ll have a report on file, but that there’s really nothing for them to investigate. 

I thanked him and told him that I didn’t expect them to investigate anything. I know they have limited resources and that I know this isn’t worth their time. But all I wanted was for there to be a record of it in case it happens to us again, or to one of our neighbors, or if something worse happens. 

The next day I call the water department and explain everything to them and ask if they can do an adjustment for that day. The lady tells me no, they only do adjustments if there’s a water main break, and that if I’d have turned my water off inside the house this wouldn’t have happened. I tell her we haven’t lived here very long, and that there are no inside shut offs. She says, well get a plumber to install some then because you’re responsible for what happens outside your house. Which, I’m not exactly happy about, but I do understand their position. I ask her if she can give me an estimate of my bill based on the usage so far, and she says that I should expect it to be at least triple what my normal bill is. But that if I call once the bill comes I can ask to get on a payment plan. Ugh. I don’t think I’ll have to do that, but I’m pretty pissed that I now have to pay this extra bill because some asshole turned on my water while no one was home. 

I feel so violated thinking that someone was in my back yard, and what else they could have done. 

Luckily my dad is pretty handy, so he’s going to install the inside shut offs once it is warmer outside. In the meantime I got locks for the outside faucets. I’m paranoid that they’re not sturdy enough to not be picked, so I check the outside faucets like 3-4 times a day. 

My husband is pissed off at me because I told him that once my dad installs the inside shut offs, he’s going to have to turn the water on and off inside and outside every time he wants to water the garden, or use the hose from now on. He says I’m being ridiculous, but I don’t know how else we can prevent this from happening again. 

I’ve also ordered security cameras for the front and back yards, but they’re not going to prevent it from happening again. 

I just don’t know what to do, there’s probably not anything else to do though. Any advice?

TL;DR - someone turned my outside water on while we were at work. I feel violated and paranoid now. ",14Feb2019,1
42,"I have been lurking on Reddit for a long time now, but I finally got the courage to make my first post. Just in case, this is going to be a long one. Excuse me for any mistakes, english is not my first language.

First of all, a little background. I am only 17 years old, and I live in Colombia. I always tried to get along with everyone I knew, so I was always the kind of friend who would be willing to put himself into an uncomfortable situation just to please others or to avoid any kind of confrontation. After years of doing this, some people started taking advantage of this, but I always wanted to believe that nothing was done with a bad intention. Anyway, I unknowingly started to enter a deep depression about two years ago, and this was what started everything.

As time passed, I lost interest on hanging out with people, on doing favors, on getting uncomfortable just to please others, and on my overall life. I lost appetite very quickly, which led me to lose about 20 kilos (about 45 pounds according to Google) in about 6 months, and I isolated myself from the rest of the world. As a result of this, all the ""friendships"" I had started to disappear. People saw how my appearance and my mood changed very quickly, so they stopped going out  with me. Nobody wanted to be around me unless there was something they could get out of it (money, a favor, etc.). Also, it did not help at all that my brother, the only person I could care about in this world, moved to another country to seek his carreer, for this only left me lonlier than before.

In the middle of all this, I started cutting myself, and, in the course of 6 months, I managed to scar most of my upper body. I completely screwed my chest, my arms, my thighs, my wrists, and my stomach. The only result of this will not only be something for me to be ashamed the rest of my life, but also a reason for me not to be capable of taking my shirt of in front of anyone. Apart from this, I started drinking heavily. I used to do it casually with friends, but it became a habit at that point.

As this kept happening, I forced myself to go out just to get distracted. To my surprise, the only time I made myself get out of bed and go to a party or something I ended up getting drugged by someone who took advantage on the fact that I was emotionally unstable. Once I was drunk, he slipped a pill in my drink and almost killed me (literally. I had to be taken to the hospital having arrhythmia, vomiting, and blacked out only to realize that this specific drug could be lethal when mixed with alcohol). Well, guess what? This only helped to keep crippling my confidence on people.

Once alcohol was not enough, I started smoking weed to get away from things, and, once again, made it a habit.

I had a crush on a girl for a long time, and, surprisingly, she seemed to be somewhat into me. She caught me on one of my weak moments, and I ended up telling her about everything. Once she knew this, she started to use to manipulate me. Nevertheless, I knew I would have done anything for her, so I kept up with the emotional exploiting. Everything ended up in her telling me that she had dumped her boyfriend and wanted to be with me instead. After we hooked up one night, she blocked me, started ignoring me, told everyone what a motherfucker I was, and (who would have guessed?) she had never dumped her boyfriend.

On top of all this (and some other minor issues which I will not tell for the sake of not making this longer) my father was diagnosed with cancer, and I started using cocaine as my way to escape reality. Now I fear I may be developing a dependence, because I can only be fine when I am high. I am not able to cover my shit life with anything else. I cannot turn to my family for help with my drug issues, and I have no one else who is willing to listen unless there is something in return. Besides that, all those ""friends"" are pretty well known for not being able to keep a secret.

What should I do? What else is there to do? After the last time I did cocaine, I have been having suicidal thoughts, which has led to more cocaine, more marijuana, more alcohol, and more cutting.

43,"So I am currently a third year Mechanical engineering student (two years at CC) and I am really struggling with the subject.

44,"So for the past six months I (19m) have been talking to a Russian (25f) girl for hours straight just about every single day. She had been planning a trip to America, and I said if she visited my state I would gladly take a week off of work and show her some of the major touristy things in the area... which she took me up on that offer and has purchased a plane ticket recently. The problem arose once I told my parents that I would be taking this vacation since I had wanted to ask them advice about hotels, rental vehicles etc. and the idea of meeting a girl from Russia has them worried to an extreme degree that I will get scammed in some way.  
This is all of the relevant information that makes me think that there is no possible way she can be scamming me:  
I have had many over an hour long video calls with her, she looks identical to her photos.    
The Instagram account I talk to her on has posts all the way back to 2013.   
I have literally seen the plane tickets to my state when I logged on to her account (with her permission)  
She has NEVER asked me for money, and she has never asked about my financial status.  
She has a boyfriend, and I have played games online with both him and her.   
She has NEVER flirted with me, sent explicit photos or tried to ask for explicit photos.   
When I say we've talked for hours straight nearly daily, it is no exaggeration... we literally text each other for as much time as our timezones allow.   
So my question for you Reddit, is it possible for this person to genuinely be someone who wants to visit a friend in another country? Is it more likely that I am getting scammed? Is there a definitive way to know 100% if she is who she says she is WITHOUT making it seem like I do not trust who she says she is?

If there are any clarification questions, I would be happy to answer them all!",14Feb2019,1
45,"So I’ve only been to one high school dance before, and the only other time I’ve slow danced was in middle school. That fame was one of the most uncomfortable, awkward experiences of my life. 

This girl at my school was voted onto court. Her boyfriend goes to a different school, so she asked me to be her partner. I don’t really talk to her too much. 

Basically, all court is at our school is an announcement near the end of the dance, and a slow dance that follows (with the court members). It doesn’t seem too bad, but for me, the only experiences I’ve had with slow dancing have been very bad. 

When I play it through in my head, I just imagine it being awkward. Basically a 3 minute hug with maybe a little awkward conversation. I feel like it’s rude to just not say anything and look away the whole time. I feel like it’s weird to look at each other and not say anything. I feel like I wouldn’t know what to talk about if we tried talking during the song. I know I’m probably just in my own head, but I can’t picture a way where slow dancing isn’t awkward.

46,"I am absolutely crazy about discussion and debate. It's one of my favourite hobbies. I have had healthy outlets for this my entire life, mainly my debate team. Reddit seemed to really scratch the itch that surfaced when our team got too old for any nearby leagues. Everyone's up for some good thorough discourse! I had just deleted tumblr after a long run with it, so reddit was *so* refreshing. Add in the stellar OC (and I'll admit I enjoy some reposts), It's all dandy. 

However, after three years of daily use (hours at a time), nothing is funny and stuff just makes me angry. 

The site is flooded with American politics. Everything just *has* to be argued and contended. So much nitpicking! There's a crazy amount of prejudice. No empathy or compassion. I don't feel entirely comfortable with some comments towards women that I've heard. Everything has to be so logical and scientific. Too often I find commenters asking for peer reviewed, properly cited sources in the middle of some offhanded scuffle (a lot of reddit is AWFUL with Appeal to Authority fallacy) and they win the upvotes!

And, you know what, fat people don't deserve the flack they get here. My initial disgust at their treatment was not misguided. I can't believe this place managed to convince me otherwise. This may seem odd to dwell on, but God damn am I ashamed of the ideologies I ate up here. The fat people hate in particular. I've had to remind myself that calling people bad names due to their appearance is *bad for society*. Literally shit I learned in year 2 at school.

This place really isn't for me. I yearn for debate and new ideas, which is why the switch from flowery Tumblr to hardass Reddit really floated my goat. But, I can't stay here. Problem is I'm pretty addicted, so I'm looking for another outlet.

We've gone on a few dates and all of them I felt sparks and butterflies and I thought she did too. A few days ago she told me that she was battling her own demons and that she didnt feel ready to be in a serious relationship but that she would still like to go out with me and see me. I don't want to lose her because she's made me so happy so I agreed to a less committed ""relationship"".  Especially because we will be going to different states for school pretty soon so it seemed reasonable. We've been able to talk normally (Or as normal as it can get after something like that) but my heartaches and I want to be with her and talk to her and message her but I also don't want to bother her or appear needy. Whatever we are is okay (I think) and I know it'll feel less painful later but it's really made me relapse into some bad habits. I was just wondering how you guys get over this aching feeling (heartbreak) because it really really hurts and also what you guys think would be a reasonable decision to make.

Me and my friends noticed him because of his voice and physical features and we would make Instagram groupchats and add him in it just to be stupid (we didn’t bully him we were just being dumbasses) 

So he thinks that I am gay and interested in him because of the stuff we said “Cutie, x likes you” and even though I told him I’m not gay he thinks I am and he doesn’t leave me alone.

He is borderline sexually harrasing me

I have worked for this company for almost 3 years. I started off as a crew member and worked my way up to a General Manager. It had good pay, benefits, and a crew that I adored, however I was working nonstop. The most I had worked was 93 hours in a week. I was tired, depressed, stressed, but I made a lot of money. The business went through a financial restructuring (Chapter 11 bankruptcy) and I ended up leaving the company for a short time. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. (3 months)  I came back as a crew member because I was scrapped for cash and in a very tight situation financially. The job I had left for was a huge lie and the owner lied to me about pay and my position. It was VERY hard to find another job with similar pay because of how young I am, I have little experience, and I don't have a HS diploma. Now they want me to consider going back into that role, but for more money than I was making before. I'm struggling because having no money is just equally as stressful but I was to an extent unhappy in that role. I dream of owning my own business some day in this same area of work so I know this is what I want to do for the rest of my life. It's just the company I am finding hard to trust.

So as much as we enjoy each other company. They know nothing about me except my name, and I have no intention of getting to know them much more. Anyway.

I was eating lunch and talking when this girl. Let’s call her Sara, cause I don’t know her actual name was crying. And some guy at our table was holding her. She talks about having a boyfriend so I don’t if they were together. But was crying and I leaned over to listen. She said she was either feeling suicidal or tried killing her self again. I’m not sure as she was sobbing and they certainly weren’t going to tell me. She said something about not being able to tell her parents cause they’d punish her. I don’t know if it’s true, I’m just going off what I heard say. One person told her to talk with a counselor but she said the counselor would tell her parents. She eventually calmed down and laughed it off.

It was really concerning and I want to know more, and help if I can. But I have very little of their trust. She definitely won’t spill her guts and will probably just tell me not to worry about it. I did try asking one person in the group and he said he didn’t know (though I don’t believe him as they were dating for a while). And I don’t want to tell a teacher or something because of what she was saying was true, she’ll be punished by her parents. 

So I’m wondering what would be good to do. She won’t tell me, and based off what she said, she’ll be punished if her parents figure out. But I don’t know if it’s true. Should I do anything? Or just leave it alone? Please be aware she has very little trust and we know nearly nothing about each other.

63,"Hello everyone!

A few hours ago, a girl that I went to school with messaged me. She had this long story about how she has been in therapy and had one more thing she wanted to do in order to lift a weight off her shoulders: Apologize for the years she spent bullying me. 

For some background:
We started middle school in 2004, we started off as pretty good friends and hung out with each other often. She came from a more well off family and I’m from a poor one. As the school year moved on, we drifted apart as we ended up making new friends. She ended up being a big part of the more popular crowd, it wasn’t a big deal at first but for some reason I started to become a target and I guess not wanting to lose those friends, she joined them. Since she knew some pretty private issues about my family, she would tell them things, like once how the water got shut off at my house and how I had to take showers at her place and would make jabs at how my clothes were second hand. 

The biggest part of their bullying was about how my Mom was sick (she had avascular necrosis) and would make fun of how she walked. They continued this all throughout middle school, to the point where I ended up attempting suicide and was hospitalized for 2 weeks. When I came back, they tormented me about that. 

In 2007 when high school started, things got way worse. I was a bit on the chubbier side and whenever I’d walk by her and her friends, they’d squeal like pigs and things of that nature. At one point, they gave me a cupcake with trash and spit stuffed in it. I developed bulimia and spent a good chunk of my high school years struggling with it. If I went on with the things they did, we’d be here for awhile. I skipped school trips, failed most of my classes, and skipped walking for graduation in 2011 just to avoid that group. I spent what was supposed to be the best years of my life extremely depressed and suicidal because of them. I was in and out of therapy and mental hospitals.

After we graduated I decided to just try and forget about her and move on with my life and that mostly worked. Just a few weeks ago, I reconnected with a friend I had from high school and last week, we went to hang out with a couple of other old friends. One of those old friends brought the bully along, which made for an awkward night. Bully tried to spark some conversation, like bringing up stories from when we used to be friends with me but I was standoffish and short with her. She was within ear shot of me and said “We’re 25/26 now, she needs to get over it.” That comment made me angry, but I just decided to grin and bear it for the rest of the night. 

So, today she told me she came along because she knew I’d be there and that she’d like to maybe try and be friends again. I just left the message on read and then she came back with her apology and her reasoning for it.

Would it be petty of me to not accept her apology? I’ve been pondering about it and part of me says that we’re adults and I should let it go. The other part of me thinks about how I spent all of those years and how she had the time of her life. I don’t think she understands the gravity of what she did and how I still deal with some of the mental issues from that time today.

64,"When my alcoholic mom isn't raging while drunk my dad create really really small details into rage worthy issues. 

Like for example: 

he'll be right behind next to me watching my every move when I washed my hands. I go to wash my hands and two small drips of water touch the faucet and he automatically rages and starts yelling. I do dishes and let them soak- minutes later he'll take over when I'm not around and does them then rages each time to say I don't do anything right. 

I've tried to disconnect from both of them as they're not even remotely in the same mental ball park as me. They use everything over my head!! Including my dad saying today ""you're using my refrigerator for your food!"" after I have to buy all my food and everything with less than $320 biweekly.

66,"Hopefully putting all the relevant info in bullet points will most clearly depict my problem: 

1. There's a TA that I have a massive crush on. I had him as a TA last spring, immediately found him attractive, and it's only gotten worse the more I speak to him. 
2. I have social anxiety and self-esteem issues, so I'm often (but not always) super awkward when talking to him unless we get settled into an actual conversation, which has only happened like once since I've known him. Our emails back-and-forth over projects/assignments are generally pleasant, and he's very encouraging and helpful. 
3. University policy at my school forbids relationships between TAs and students, which makes sense and I'm totally willing to follow. However, because I have a crush on him, and that's where my mind goes, I'm scared that if I try to be friends with him and we actually get along, people might see that as flirting. Of course, flirting isn't dating, but I wouldn't want anyone to think he's into me and have that in any way tarnish his reputation. I'm also scared that *he* will see my attempts at friendliness as flirting (again, because that's where my mind is and is where I would like things to go after the semester ends), and will either not be interested, or just be scared of what might happen and then push me away for the sake of his reputation/position/degree/etc. 
4. He had to cancel one of our meetings to go over my project because he's got the flu or something. I replied to that email saying, in general, that I was sorry to hear he was sick and that I hope he gets well soon. I was thinking that, when he's better and we can meet up again, I'd bring him some of his favorite candy as a friendly gesture. However, I'm scared that it'll be taken as me trying too hard to win his favor, or me flirting, and that it'll make things awkward between us and any chance of being friends or something more in the future will be ruined. 

Reddit, am I being ridiculous? Can I give the man a Reese cup and sympathize with him about having the flu without it coming off as having romantic intent? I really, really like him, even just as a potential friend/personal mentor, and I'm terrified of screwing up. I've never had such an intense crush on someone that I genuinely couldn't date, and neither have any of my friends, so I just don't know the dos and donts here. ",14Feb2019,1
69,"What's up, everyone. I am new to this subreddit and I would like to ask for some advice..

&amp;#x200B;

It's been a month when I found out that I won a sales competition at work. The reward is a 4-day cruise, all expenses paid for, AND + a guest! My manager first inputted my information and my brother's information as my + 1 (because I found out I won on the deadline date to register for the cruise so we had to put some type information in the meantime to secure my spot). I emailed the person who was setting up all my information and getting me situated for my cruise (we will call her MEGAN for now) if I can change my brother's information to the information of the girl I was talking to (let's call her SUS). It took around 1-2 weeks to figure out that situation but we happened to fix the issue thanks to Megan and now Sus was able to successfully secure her spot as my guest. However, the first issue arose: Sus doesn't have a passport, never had one. Getting a passport is not quick and it is expensive. I was going to help her out with the costs and she would just pay me after in payments. Anyways, we had been talking about this cruise for the next 2 weeks, and then I got bad news...

&amp;#x200B;

Sus BARELY told me she was not able to come with me because she will be missing a lot of her classes (she is currently taking 18 units this semester) and it's too expensive to get her passport ($200+). The cruise is 2 WEEKS AWAY and now all the time and effort that Megan spent to be able to fix my situation has gone to waste. I got upset with Sus because she should have just told me from the beginning that she wasn't able to come with me instead of wasting 1 month of my time to let me know that, JUST KIDDING, she can't go anymore...

&amp;#x200B;

Should I truly be upset at Sus? And if you were in my situation, would you end up taking another girl (and stop talking to Sus) or would you take your mom or who would you take??

73,"I'm really used to running from my problems. I've never really had to deal with things head on, and one such issue from the past has come back to bite me in the ass.

I do a lot of online gaming. I spend usually between 4-6 hours a night after work gaming. This was a lot worse back when I was in school, which is where it all began. Back when I was in school, I spent 10-12 hours a day gaming. A lot of my friendships were online and I had a relationship online. I met my ex-boyfriend online and we met and started spending time together outside of the game. The relationship lasted 3 years and ended in 2016 due to a series of miscommunications and someone we'll call Nicole.

Nicole was a very active member in the gaming community- I didn't know her firsthand but I found that we had a lot in common so we started talking. She told me that there she hated gossip and drama and there was a lot of that revolving around her because of her status in the community. I kind of understood where she came from and we hit it off pretty quickly. Then, Nicole started talking to my ex- a lot. He didn't have school so he was online all day and she would spend a lot of time with him and her boyfriend playing games together. When they weren't playing, she would be IMing him and chatting with him. I had no issues with that since she was my friend as well. She started talking to him about her relationship issues and he, in turn, opened up to her about issues in our relationship. Issues that he would not bring up with me. She would offer her advice and pretty soon, she started sending him pictures when he was upset (nothing rated R, as far as I knew). He started talking about how he wanted to fly to her country and visit her. They spent countless hours talking, more hours than he spent with me. Looking back, the relationship had already run it's course and I should've ended it instead of trying to make it last.

Other members of the gaming community started messaging me, telling me the stories of how she had started talking to their boyfriends and ruined their relationships. They reached out to me because they saw she was spending so much time with my ex. Without going into too much detail, we split, got back together, then realized it wasn't going to work out and split again. We've both moved on since then and I don't really have any hard feelings against my ex, but I get upset every time someone mentions her.

I honestly, honestly thought I was over it all. I never had to talk to her again after the fact, and I didn't bring up what happened except with my close friends. Recently, I started hitting it off with someone else in the community. We talked a lot, played a few games together, and then I found out he's friends with Nicole. It became this non-issue issue. I thought maybe I should stop talking to him because I didn't want to deal with her, but I opened up to him about the past and he was very understanding about my feelings and what happened. However, they are in a team together and she will sometimes message him to play. I have no problems with him playing with her as a team or in practice, but he mentioned a couple of times that she wanted to play outside of practicing as a team and he did say no. I can't control my emotions when he mentions her in that context. I get visibly upset when she gets brought up, and it makes both of us doubt whether or not I'm really over this whole experience. I do understand that he wasn't around when the drama happened between Nicole and my ex, and I can't expect him to drop her or anything when she hasn't done anything malicious to him, but I can't help but wonder if there's another way to handle this whole thing other than telling him not to mention her ever again.

74,"I do not understand why I stay at home a lot. First of all, I'll tell you about my life. There was this group of people I used to be close with but I had to cut it off after realizing they weren't good for me. I did not like going to restaurants and taking the skytrain, nor taking pictures with them and wearing makeup. During last summer, I only hung out with them once. I spent the summer playing video games, all by myself. Btw, I'm used to being alone at home. I basically live in solitude. Anyways, it's not like those people were horrible or anything; we just had different ambitions and interests. It was the time I had with them that I realized I didn't like spending money, like they did. It's fine that they spent their money a lot, but it always felt like I had to open my wallet in order to bond with them. 

I made a new friend after all of that, and I only hung out with her for about 3 months. I stopped talking to her because it always felt like I would never be her true friend. For a while, I thought she was like my best friend. But I found it tiring, always trying to get her attention and she was always busy at lunch. I knew I wasn't anything special to her, so I stopped trying and all that. After a while, I texted her saying whats up and she replied. I told her that I was busy so I couldn't talk to her that much, and she said the same thing. What hurt me most was that she didn't care to talk to me during the couple of weeks I ignored her. Maybe there's something wrong with the way I'm thinking here, but idk. 

The girl I consider my best friend now is... let's call her Liz. She's the same age as me. I've told her a lot of things and I've known her since elementary. She was always my friend but after everything, I've gotten rly close to her. She just doesn't open up to me. The times she invites me to go out, I feel bad because I can't go out with her. I have homework and chores and I have to go home for tutor and online lessons. I just don't want to go outside. I don't like walking outside, then having to walk back home. I'd rather be productive and do some coding or reading or *something.* I think Liz is awesome but sometimes it feels like she's only my friend because she pities me for having no other friends. Yep, I don't have anyone to rely on except Liz. Even Liz, sometimes it's like she just doesn't want to be alone with me. If there's other people, she has her attention to them. And if it's the two of us, we're just in comfortable silence. I always think she doesn't open up to me because I reject her offers to go hang out after school. I don't want to talk to her about this because I don't want it to look like I'm desperate to have her attention. 

There are other people I'm friends with but even they go out a lot, and they have so much more schoolwork than I do. (They're in an advanced program). I just don't really know what to do. I wish I could go outside and have fun with Liz and friends without a care in the world, but I always want to be productive. I've never met anyone who has the same issue as me. Most of the guy friends I have, they like to play games when they're not doing anything, and I get that, but I'd rather be doing something like reading or my online lessons. I want to talk to my guy friends more but that would mean playing games with them, and I think video games are awesome but I used to have an unhealthy addiction to gaming. I want Liz to like me more, but that would mean walking around when I could be doing something else. I don't know why I'm like this.

I'm worried about this. I used to think I'd have someone to always be with, to always talk to, but I don't. I talk to Liz about a lot of things but it just feels like I'm not important to her. I'm not important to anyone. (well theres my family but i dont like to ask for their advice on these things). I'm 16. I should be out and about. What makes me sad is that I've spent this past year of being 16 doing nothing. I have some things, but it doesn't feel right without having a friend to talk about it with. Solitude is nice, but it's not enough. I just wish I had someone to be around with, not having to go out to places to have fun. Someone I could talk to and not care about being judged. To be honest, I don't think I've ever experienced love. Sure, I love my family. But I can't say the same for friendships and romance. I just want someone to hug and talk about my day and sit next to while we both do our own homework and whatever. 

Not sure if anyone will get to this point, but I also want to date. I consider myself as a romantic girl. I've liked guys and they've liked me, but I haven't really dated. Should I try online dating? Is that a thing? 

I just don't know if I have a mental condition or something. My siblings have friendships that go for like 10 years. Liz and I have known each other for about 6-7 years I think, but we've only been close friends for about 2 months I guess. 

If anyone could recommend me online places where I could get more help, please let me know. :)",14Feb2019,1
75,"Could this have been because of her having PTSD or being bipolar?

My gf of ~20 months (26f PTSD and bipolar) spontaneously broke up with me (26m)...

We were fine just a few days ago. We hung out like always and had a good time. We had been okay for months, both stressed about different things in life, but we've always supported each other, then boom. All of sudden she was having thoughts of breaking up and being unhappy. She hasn't spoken to me in 6 days now, and we spoke every single day for nearly 20 months before that. She's my lighthouse. Like. I feel so lost.

Sorry, I literally could make a book series describing how amazing our relationship has been before all this happened, like how we're best friends, into all the same things, have always been very supportive of each other's interests and health, how she's like the Robin AND Tracey to my Ted of HIMYM (just gave her the yellow umbrella a couple weeks ago and she loved it), how she's the Rose AND River to my Doctor from DW, and then a short book about everything that happened this week. 
But to shorten:
She's my best friend. Like, insane level of understanding and help and support and fun and trust. Hung out every week. Went on adventures, out to dinner, to movies, saw friends. Well, before last week...

To clarify: I absolutely want to work things out. I think we've had an amazing relationship, and I want to figure things out. She said maybe break up for the first few days since she mentioned it, but when I upsetly pushed the issue at a time she was stressed, it turned into her not wanting to work on things. 

I've left her alone because I know how she's someone who needs space after being overwhelmed, that she was already overwhelmed and stressed before this happened, and I'm sure she's needed time to recharge. She never said not to talk, but just stopped responding last Friday. She hasn't made any attempt to talk since then. So, I've been terribly depressed for the last week not talking to her, I'm trying to give her time, and I'm just wondering how on earth this all happened out of nowhere. I'm really struggling to wrap my head around what happened because our relationship has been so amazing. No one in my life, nor me, saw this coming. We even had several plans for months from now. The only thing that's made any sense to me is her PTSD and/or bipolar causing all of this. I mentioned that last week, but I don't think she listened. Idk what to think, or of she'll even talk to me. To clarify, she has always been described as one of the nicest people ever. She's has lots of work experience in the psychological field, and is always incredibly understanding. (She doesn't always take care of her own physical pr mental health that well, though.)

(Below is what I've planned for handling things.)

But I bought her Valentine's gift a couple weeks ago. She and I have these soft, foam ball pillows (idk how to describe) that have always been, like, ""our special pillows"" that we always use together. She also loves raccoons. We saw this a few weeks ago when we goofing around having fun in the store, and she really liked it. So I went and got it without her right after.

http://imgur.com/a/gJd8pFh

Thought about taking it to her house tomorrow (Valentine's Day), but I figured that would be too surprising and overwhelming for her. I thought about just texting her ""I love you"" and/or ""Happy Valentine's Day"" at 8:21 because that's her birthday. She LOVES her birthday, and usually tries to look at the clock for that special time. But I still worried that wasn't a good option.

To keep my mind off of her the other day, I had been stress cleaning. I found a small piece if paper on my dresser that I have NO IDEA where it came from. It had some Gallifreyan on it and said ""GALLIFREYAN TRANSLATION: I LOVE YOU"". Out relationship has had TONS of ""signs from the universe"". Legit. So, I thought of this as one. I figured I could attach it to her gift and just overnight it to her for Valentine's Day. I printed out a larger copy of it. 

http://imgur.com/a/6pVBljP

Her favorite color is green. So, green crayon. Mine is blue, so blue, obvious, but is also cool cause I randomly picked the crayon ""cornflower blue"" and that's the color tie Barney from HIMYM freaks out about before his wedding.

She LOVES vines. Like, a LOT. One of her favorite vines is:
🎶 ""You are my dad. You're my dad! Boogie woogie woogie"" 🎶 ?
https://youtu.be/BsuY9lHxg88
🎶 ""To Ariel. Ariel! Boogie woogie woogie"" 🎶

One of her FAVORITE THINGS EVER is Hamilton. Our first date, which we've always bragged to people about being the best first date, was to a gay bar to see Hamilton in drag. It was an amazing night. So, Hamilton has always meant a lot to us. We LOVE to sing together. Our mutual friends we were just on vacation with sent us a bootleg copy of the show. She had never actually watched it, not just listen. So, it was a huge deal. We had been meaning to watch it for weeks, but she kept forgetting it when she came over. We had finally nailed down plans to watch it last Friday. That was the plan until Thursday when she broke up with me. But the past weeks she had been ecstatically telling me about her favorite song, Wait For It. She passionately sang it to me in the car. (I started singing it over and over yesterday. Didn't even know the words yesterday. It's one of the only things that's given me hope.)
https://youtu.be/73P0-ebdGus

So I sent her this, 
http://imgur.com/a/6pVBljP

And now I'm anxiously waiting to see what happens. If she doesn't get ahold of me herself tomorrow, I planned on texting her Friday and trying to talk.

Could this have been because of her having PTSD or being bipolar?

Bless whoever read all of this.

79,"TL,DR: Girlfriend's mom makes her buy her own food, has taken all her credit card money, and put her into debt and left her to pay for it herself. We don't know what to do

This will be long so please bear with me. I of course have my girlfriend's consent to write this. It's also been an on going thing for a couple of years so some of the information might be a bit scrambled up. Sorry for that.



My girlfriend is going through a bit of trouble right now and I need advice. 2 years ago when she was going to apply for University, she didn't really know what to go into. Her mother pressured her into going to a course she was not content with, and she felt she had no choice but to listen. She then applied for a government loan program and they gave her the money for school since her family is low income. 

Few months go by, she paid half of her school loan when she was supposed to, then her mom asked to borrow money from her to pay a bill. My girlfriend agreed since the bill impacted her as well. Her mom promised to pay her back but she never did.

Her mom then stopped paying for her basic everyday needs such as bus fare and food/drinks/snacks etc. my girlfriend's money was decreasing. Please keep in mind that she was unemployed at the moment and only had money from the government. 

Ok fast forward a few months and my girlfriend paid her school again with the remainder of money she had. she still had to owe the school around $2000. When her first year finished, she didn't apply for a summer job because she was travelling in May for a month with her mom; for a trip that was planned for years. That trip was around $5000. You could guess where the spending money came from— my girlfriend's credit cards. 

When she got back in June she was supposed to apply for school again. But she couldn't because she owed the school $2000 and her mom refused to pay it because she apparently ""had no money"". You're probably wondering where her dad is. Well, her mom takes her dad's money too so he really can't do anything either. He's in debt as well. Anyway, my girlfriend couldn't pay the $2000 because she had no money. So yeah she couldn't go to school. She decided to take a year off and try to find a job. Took her 4 months to get a job and she's working there right now. 

She's been working there for around 6 months and she gets paid minimum wage. She works part time (less than 20 hours a week). Every pay day (2 weeks) her mom tries to take at least $200 from her to ""pay bills"". My girlfriend gives in to her mom because the bills do effect her. At the same time, my girlfriend is trying to pay her debts with her credit cards AND her school because her mom ""has no money"". 

Her mom has a decent pay full-time job by the way. Same with her dad. My girlfriend has no idea where the money is going half the time. 

So, right now, my girlfriend is struggling to STILL pay off her school, credit cards and she has to pay back the loan from the government (when she applied for uni), on top of food and bus fare and basic necessities. 

I just want to help my girlfriend out because she's very stressed. She won't take money I offer her. We don't want to contact the police or anything legal like that since it would make her life way harder than it should be. She could get into legal trouble as well since she consented everything. I've tried helping her the best I could right now but it pisses me off how she has to pay off debts that she didn't cause. 

Please note that her mother or father isn't abusive towards my girlfriend. Her mom is just toxic. My girlfriend is content right now but it's stressful to deal with constant debt and worrying about her next meal all the time. Any help would be appreciated. ",14Feb2019,1

The last thing I would want is for her to feel pressured or anything like that. I have asked her to do something over text while we were on our long school break and she said yes, but I never specified a certain time. I asked her a couple days later to go ice skating and she declined saying she didn't like to. I haven't asked her to do anything since.

She has honestly been on my mind a lot lately and I really want to ask her but every time I'm with her I just chicken out and I hate myself for that. We are both in college and talk regularly but never one on one because she is always with her friends if that helps haha.

85,"  

TL; DR: My university said I didn’t have to attend mandatory freshman housing, changed their mind, and now I’m required to do freshman housing. Any advice to get out of it would be appreciated. 

I applied to the University of Arkansas in October of last year, and was accepted to the University without any trouble. However, after I accepted my enrollment, I was informed I needed to participate in the mandatory on-campus housing. 

I’m currently a dual enrollment student, which means I go to my local college and enroll in their courses for free because my high school pays for it. This is very important. I will be graduating with my Associates of Art in May, almost a whole month before I’ll be graduating high school. These classes are completely legitimate, as I’m expected to attend at the college campus among other college students who pay to be there.

Anyways, a few months back I called the housing department of my University to confirm if I needed to proceed with the freshman housing plan. I was told no, because I had 24 transferrable credit hours. I’m a very cautious person, so I checked on three or four different occasions to be sure this was the case, as I was still receiving information on applying for freshman housing. They said yes, I do not need to apply as long as I have those 24 credit hours. Fast forward to January, and I call to confirm this once again. I ask if I need to submit any paperwork just in case, and the man on the phone informs me that I may want to fill out a housing exemption form JUST IN CASE. 

After submitting this form, I received an email stating that my form was denied and I was still required to live on campus. I called, and the staff member who denied it stated that the college credits have to be post- high school. I have to take at least 24 post-high school credit hours to avoid freshman housing. I asked to speak to her higher-up, and after she argued with me, I was able to leave a message for the assistant director of housing (I was never rude with her, and I told her I know it’s her job to tell me I have to do the freshman housing but I would like to speak with her higher up). However, this matter is time-sensitive now and the director hasn’t gotten back in two days. 

I already had off-campus housing situated because I was informed that I would not have to participate in on-campus housing. I’m now very stressed out because I can’t get in contact with anyone who can resolve this issue. 

I’m looking for advice on what I should do. I don’t need on-campus housing because I already achieve academic success (which was their reasoning on the exemption form of requiring on-campus housing), and I already had plans for off-campus housing. Furthermore, on-campus housing is much more expensive. My parents make too much to qualify for financial aid though, despite currently putting 5 other students through college. I’m not sure what to do, I need off-campus housing but I’m stuck in a limbo. Any advice would be appreciated. ",14Feb2019,1
86,"In roughly two months I’ll be moving out after three years of desperately trying. About a month after I announced I was moving, my step father impulsively (without any talks on the matter with my mother) takes another job a few hours away in a different town. His new job starts this Sunday and they had to quickly find an apartment for him to live in up in the new town. My mother and I are staying behind as she tries to sell the house and I count down the days until I can finally get away. 

He’s more than emotionally abusive. He has a short temper and doesn’t handle any sort of stress well. Though their marriage has always been rocky, since him taking the new job it’s really been bad. These past few weeks have been him screaming at my mother about everything she needs to do even though this was all brought on by him. He has broken things, slammed doors, started fights, and a multitude of other outbursts. All of this is being aimed solely at my mother, with the occasional short comment being made my way but the vast majority of anger is being directed at her. As we speak (it’s 9pm) she was pretty much demanded to clean the bathrooms...even though we aren’t showing the house until Saturday and it would be better to clean them then but whatever. Even so much as filling out papers to get the house on the market sees him getting frustrated and raising his voice whenever he has to repeat himself or he gets confused. 

My mother on the other hand is a bundle of issues in her own right. She copes with all of this by drinking, nothing heavy but basically just a streamline of beer the moment she gets done with work. She’s never been good with handling stress and caves easy whenever anyone gets even mildly aggressive with her. When my stepfather gets angry she chooses to be passive just to avoid conflict with him. This then leads to her unbottling every emotions she has welled up when we are alone. This is coupled with her getting snappy with me for saying anything if she’s in a bad mood, which is fairly often. But when she is in a decent to okay mood, she uses me to vent every annoyance and issue and wants to make all of her problems then my problems.  

And then there’s me. I’m currently a senior in college with a heavy workload and a job that sees me working midnight to 6am. Not only do I not get any sleep because they are actively choosing to show the house fairly early on mornings I work (meaning I have to get up and leave the house so they can tour my room), but I also am being asked to clean and organize the house for them when I actively cannot because I have class or I’m simply just not home. They are making this whole ordeal my problem when I have nothing to do with it. I’ve been trying to get out of this hell for years and it’s so close...These past few weeks have really been pushing me. I don’t feel any strong connection to either of them, frankly my mother hasn’t really been the best and I’ve never liked my step father, but even still when I hear him yell or hear my mother cry, I get so angry I shake. There are nights I want to throw him against a wall and wail on him until he leaves. Then there’s nights I just want to scream at my mom for her to just be quiet. To top it all off they have been trying to actually claim some of my stuff as their own for their new house. I have a few things stored away for when I move that don’t fit in my room that they have actively tried to steal from me even though they have plenty of furniture. 

I have two months of this and I don’t know if I can do it. I’m trying so hard to focus on my studies and stay out of it but I know I’m going to keep being drawn back in. Next week it will just be me and my mother until I move and while that’s a better situation on the whole, it’s still not the best. My schedule is still going to be fucked. My mother is still going to use me as a therapist. Anddddd I have everything school and work related to still worry about so....I just need advice on how to handle this, how to handle them or my stress or just...what should I do to make these two months go by as fast and harmlessly as possible.

87,"It’s basically all in the title. For background reference, I was married to my ex and we were together for 7 years. We have a son together. He recently told me that he still loves me. I didn’t tell my current boyfriend about this conversation.

Tonight when my ex dropped my son off, he gave me a bottle of wine and a few big canvases (for my art hobby.) It’s a bit strange because he and I aren’t really “friends,” at all. We don’t talk, and when we do, it’s about our son.
Now when my boyfriend comes over later, he’ll probably see the canvases and wine and might ask about it. Should I just hide the stuff and not mention it? I don’t want him to feel weird about it, but i also don’t want to hide it from him.

We both got caught at a red light and were stopped. I calmed down a bit. Rolled down my window to apologize. Started to say sorry as she was yelling over me. That got me hot-headed again :/ so I yelled back. We exchanged some nasty words and some honks and fingers. Finally, I was turning away from her and she yells out the window “you’re messing with the wrong person.”

Throughout that time we have always gotten along great and I would occasionally visit each other's house to play games or just hang out. But these past few months I have been feeling that they did not respect me as much as they did in the past. 

At first these two friends did not know each other until I introduced them to each other because I thought they may get along well since they both liked Melee, soon after I suggested we make a group chat which turned out to be a big mistake. I first noticed it when they started making jokes about me that I did not like, when I confronted them about this they stopped, but later they just made new jokes. At first I didn't mind, but hearing the same insult towards me over months got really annoying so I eventually stopped talking to them for a week because I couldn't take it anymore. With one of them they get really angry whenever I beat him in Ultimate/SSB4 \[which is rare cause he's really good\] and he just decides to not talk to me for the day and sometimes rants on how bad I play. With the other, the worst he's done was that he thought it would be funny to make a comment/joke on a popular NSFW site using my name as I told him not to since anyone who knew me who read that would know it referred to me.

Fast forward to today and it seems like they just hang out with each other and leave me out of the picture most of the time, but still insist that I am their friend and they would occasionally invite me to some gaming events. Nowadays whenever I try to talk to them about something they would message me a day or two later, I know they are both busy people with their life and all, but honestly I feel like the punching bag in this group because I never fight back.

It's the end of highschool. There's no way to have a real life relationship because we're destined to go to different colleges yada yada... And I don't think I want to have my first ever relationship to be a long distance one.

My whole life has been a mess for the past couple of years and I don't wanna bring her into this mess.

Ofcourse I'm afraid she'll turn me down and it'll ruin what we already have.

Right now, it's the middle of our final exams and I don't want to ruin our studies so I decided that even if I do this, I'm going to do this literally on the last day of school which will give me absolutely zero time with her.

And reasons I wanna ask her out: 

I like her, yeah I really do, a LOT!  And that's pretty much it.

So now, go on dear Redditors, do your part!

102,"Hello, I'm (29F) fairly new to this but I urgently need advice. I work as an assistant set decorator and I consider I do my job very well, I'm a hard worker and enjoy what I do. Recently my boss (the decorator) changed jobs and the one that came in to cover for him and I haven't been able to get along. Mainly because she is veeery egocentric, selfish and doesn't let me do my job, always wants to be checking every piece of decision I make and frankly it is very annoying. I've been on the verge of resigning a couple of times but the truth is that I like and need the job. The thing is the other day someone I trust told me she is talking s**t about me to everyone, no matter who. That includes our bosses, and the bosses of our bosses. Luckily i think they know me a little and realize I'm not the person she says I am, but I don't know if I should confront her (I want to) but my work enviroment has been very bad and difficult and I'm afraid that if I confront her it will be worst. What can I do? Should I talk to our bosses? Or to her directly? (I think is appropriate to mention that she is bad at her job and everyone in the team hates her) Please help, i would really be thankful for your advice.",14Feb2019,1

105,"So I’m in high school and currently managing signing up for the same overnight summer camp I’ve gone to for the past 6 years. This year I’m going two weeks for two different programs at the same camp. For the past few years I’ve done a two-week program, but this year I’ve aged out of that program and am doing two separate weeks: one counselor-in-training camp, and one beach trek, in which we take a bus a few hours out and camp on the coast for the week. 

I’ve already been signed up for the counselor-in-training camp, but my parents are worried they won’t have the budget for my beach trek, as well paying for my two younger sisters to go to the same camp. It looks like they may not be able to sign me up for the beach trek, although we’re currently discussing options.

Now, let me say that this camp is genuinely my favorite place in the world. If I could choose one place to live the rest of my life, it would be this place, hands down. The two weeks I spend here are consistently the best two weeks of my year.

However, I also completely understand my parents’ struggle with paying for three kids to spend two weeks each at a leisure camp, as well as every single other expense needed for a family of six. I’m not here to nag on them for not giving me what I want, and yes, I’m aware of how much of a first-world problem this is.

I’m planning on offering to contribute a few hundred dollars to the cost of the camp. I babysit just about every weekend, but I won’t be able to get a job until I’m old enough to drive myself there. Is there any other way I can make money in my current situation/make things generally less stressful/otherwise contribute to the cost?

106,"So I’m a freshman at college, and I haven’t made a ton of guy friends. I had no idea what I was going to do for rooming next year, until  a few options came up. One of them was a community where people with similar interests in a certain broad topic like business or arts could room. You room in a house near campus and it’s treated like regular dorms. My other option was on campus apartments. There’s a guy who I’m friends with and involved in a lot of groups with, and he’s dorming instead of commuting next year. I asked if he wanted to possibly room while saying my mind wasn’t totally made up, and he said yes.

I was slightly wary because there’s a chance I might be transferring next year, so I let him know in case I ended up leaving so he wouldn’t be ditched. Right after this I caught a nasty flu, and I hadn’t been able to really look into the housing options. I finally got around to it and the apartment we’d be living in looked awesome. I texted him to let him know I was in, only to be met with the response that he had decided to go with someone else who was interested. It turns out they were another person in our group, who I’ve actually been hitting it off with and was considering rooming with. 

Once I really looked into the house I’d be living in with the community (they didn’t announce the house until a few days ago), I wasn’t super happy. The house is really old, and I have heard of people having bad experiences. I’m thinking I’d rather live in an apartment-style dorm now. That means I have to go random, and that seriously makes me feel shitty. It worked out fine this year, but it makes it seem like I have zero friends, and I could get someone horrible. It feels embarrassing. This has been a rough year, I’ve been extremely indecisive, and now I’m paying the price for it.


TL;DR: Planned on rooming with a friend for sophomore year, but was too indecisive and waited too long. Now I’m stuck with less-than-stellar options and feel embarrassed",14Feb2019,1

Background- he signed me up for something using his own email address and couldn’t figure out forwarding, so he just gave me his email password to get the emails myself. 
So I was checking his email for my subscription and I notice that he had recent emails for a dating app. Not just ads but things titled “thank you for updating your profile” and “ You have New matches”. I confess I clicked one of them to check the profile and it seems recent.(he’s lost weight so that’s my reference)

117,"He is a 25/m and I’m a 25/f. My ex recently asked me to go out to eat with him. We have been broken up for almost two years. We dated for six years prior to that. We have shared a lot of our growing up together. He recently told me that he is generally really happy with his life except for his relationship with his gf as he doesn’t think they’re compatible. 

So we basically talked for six hours until five am the other night about life, our goals, how we have matured, and what our ever changing perspectives of life are. 

So he told me that he has been thinking about past good times a lot because he tends to do that when he is sad. I inquired further and he said he was thinking about what positive things have lead him to where he is now and how I influenced him a lot. He said that he is sad because of his girlfriend situation and how they’re so different and that he thought they could grow together over time but it isn’t happening. He told me he had the crazy obsessive butterfly feeling with me that he didn’t have with her. I reminded him we met as teenagers and hormones probably
Played a role in that and also we have jobs and lives now. 

I also said people are so different and I’ve always wondered if we got along so well because we knew each other for so long and were so similar and saw the world the same or if that kind of grew over time. I said I wondered this with other people who I dated who were up to par but I wasn’t crazy about them. He agreed. 

We couldn’t stop talking for hours and he gave me a very extended hug after our talk and we left and haven’t spoken since. He said it was amazing to talk to me and that he may want to catch up again in the future. 

He is still with him girlfriend and has never said anything well about her ever. 

I am worried I am a rebound for him as he is having these discussions with me while still having a gf. He hasn’t been single since we broke up and am wondering if he just is afraid of being alone. Meanwhile I’ve had multiple short relationships but ended it when I realized it wouldn’t work and spent a lot of time working on myself, my career, and my friends and family, and goals.

Hints: I'll be on my phone looking down most of the time and I look up occasionally. I look up and I see her looking at me. Instinctively, she doesn't look away but just smile.

She always tries to start small talk instead of just saying ""Hi"" or ""How are you"" and thats it. 
For an example, I was eating gummy worms one day and I was minding my business and she said, ""so what you aren't gonna share some?"" And started moving around like she was trying to shake her breast. (Well thats the intention she gave off to me)

I’m a minor living with my grandmother and aunt. Just came to Chicago to stay with them a little while. My grandmother is a very neurotic person. Very irritable. My aunt isn’t neurotic but just as irritable and very OCD. Now I could go on about all the little stupid quirks they get on me for, but I’ll go to what I’m writing about: the toilet. 

For some reason, my grandmother’s toilet doesn’t flush unless you consciously hold the handle down. It’s annoying. Usually, I don’t think about flushing since it’s like a 2 second task. And I’m sure it doesn’t require much thought from you guys either. But here I have to hold it down for a solid minute. 

Sometimes, however I forget to do that and it leads to a lecture. It’s annoying and embarrassing but like, I’m a big boy and I guess I can deal with it. My aunt is threatening to punish me over it though and it’s just getting really annoying to deal with myself. I should also mention I’m severely ADHD so my mind is often elsewhere. I’m tired and angry cuz of the stuff that’s happened to me, and my grandma and aunt are trying to say its some dumb subconscious thing like me “wanting attention” or my mom neglecting me. The simple fact is that I just don’t think about holding down a toilet handle.

141,"After graduating High School I took a year off to lose weight, work, and make enough money to pay for school.
I lost 150 lbs, saved enough money to buy myself a car to go to school, and paid for all of my classes for an associates degree.

I worked two jobs the entire time I was there. I wasn’t good at math or chemistry at first, but after taking a few classes and working hard I eventually got offered a job to be a tutor for organic chemistry, I was so happy I could finally quit washing dishes and finally do something I liked. After that, I budgeted every cent I had and worked my butt off so that I could make just enough to get by for my classes. 

If you want an idea... I would wake up at 6 am and won’t be home until 9 at night monday through friday.

I’ve spent hours every day studying, working, and I’ve made more friends and grown up more in two years than I’ve ever had in my entire life.

I worked so hard to get my degree. I’ve gotten straight A’s (except my first semester, I needed to learn how to study), and I’ve never missed a single day of class.

I’m graduating this summer. I’m walking down the isle with all the friends I’ve made, all the kids that kept me sane through all of this.

And with these grades... I could get a really good scholarship at a university, just... somewhere away from here. Where I can meet new friends and just... learn, Finally be my own man and study something that I like.

But my parents have been pushing me to go to this school downtown, and constantly telling me that I should be an X-Ray tech and quit trying to be an Engineer and this is the only choice I have. Anytime I try to talk to them or convince them about what I want to do... they shut me down.

I feel like they don’t care about how I feel. They just keep telling me to do this... and that it’s the only path I can go. 

It’s soul crushing.
I’m so depressed and scared. Everyone is telling me that I should be listening to my parents, that going to xray is “safe” and that I’d be making good money.

The program deadline is coming, and everyone is pressuring me. And I’ve been breaking down, I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to get accepted there, I don’t want to spend two years of my life studying for something I don’t want and going to a school I don’t want to go to.

And if I start going to school there... I won’t graduate. I won’t have my associates, and all of this would be for nothing.
On one hand my parents are pushing me and telling me I have to do this or else, on the other hand I lose... everything I worked for.

I want to get out of here. I need to escape somewhere, I just want to go somewhere and see what I can really do. See if I really can be an engineer, and prove them all wrong.

I love this. I love going to school. I love being around these people. I learned so many life lessons from these old professors and they all told me that I could do this.

Any time I talk to someone enough that we're on friendly terms it almost never goes anywhere else, we just stay acquaintances.

It's not that I don't try. I think I just come of as rude unintentionally.",14Feb2019,1
143,"Ive been talking to a girl for almost a year now and have been interested in her almost the entire time. I would find myself talking to her throughout almost everyday before i got fed up because at the time she didn't give me any signals to show that she was into me. So a Few months ago i befriended someone and built an intimate relationship with and a few  weeks after so did the girl i originally had feelings for. But recently she broke up with her boyfriend and told me that she had liked me the whole time but was too ""shy"" to say anything. What do i do haha?",14Feb2019,1
144,"Im gonna preface this by saying my mom never really liked me lifting or going to the gym.

I've finally, after months of trying to join the club have gotten enough connections to know how to join, and now it only takes a payment and I'll be in. But my parents think that I shouldn't so I could focus more on schoolwork (although I'm having absolutely no problems) yet my mom is guilt tripping me into joining band again (which i'm actually sick of and takes MORE time than the club). And since I did outdoor soccer they say I should join that as well, they'll even pay for the shoes I'll need to play. I have the money required for the club on hand, should just go for it? I want to join to challenge myself and because I want to be with like-minded people cause I've yet to find my own group of friends (I lived in a different state before coming to this one).

Band takes up 3 days a week for around 2-3 hours and all day Saturday (during football season)

Soccer is sporadic and if you don't go to practice or do well in the practice you aren't put in, and you have to go to each game.

Powerlifting is go to 3 practices a week for 3 hours and competing in meets (I don't know the schedule for them)",14Feb2019,1
145,"So about a week ago, I (19F) made a post expressing my distress over not being able to afford college this semester, and was debating selling my panties to afford it. A really sweet guy (42M) hit me up and offered advice and help. Now, i may be young, but i’m not naive enough to think that “offering advice” would not provide him benefits of having naked pics of me. but at that point i didn’t care, and sent him what i planned to post, all w out my face, being careful to exclude identifying pieces of jewelry or scenery in my house, and not telling him my real name, which he didn’t mind. 

A few days passed, and he sent me a pic of his face, opened up a bit about his personal life, and things got pretty sexual pretty quick. We began sexting, he would send masterbation photos, and i would return with pics of my soaked panties or my own masterbation vids. i’ve never done this kinda stuff with anyone, and somehow i felt very comfortable and safe with this kind stranger. I know what everyone must be thinking, about how silly i am to feel close with someone i’ve known for 7 days over the internet. but i am a very logical person and never believed it to be love or anything special, especially since he’s married and screws another girl on the side. though we discussed where each of us are located and the possibility of meeting up for sex, we are too far away for that to happen. 

however, there is something about having a man tell you how amazing you look and giving you attention you’ve never recieved that made it so that i got excited (both sexually and emotionally) just seeing his texts. He was also just all around sweet, and when he wanted pics of me, he would make sure i wasn’t busy studying. and if i was, he would tell me to prioritize that, and that his boner could wait. 

anyway, this morning i sent him a bunch of sexual videos of myself , and i noticed that he read them but never responded which was unusual. then i noticed that he deleted his snapchat and reddit too. 

to be clear: i am well aware that i do not know this man, and that it is pretty silly to be concerned with someone who i’ve known for a week. but keep in mind, the heart is a very fragile thing sometimes, especially when you consider that i showed him things that nobody has ever seen, and he spoke to me in a way nobody ever has. emotionally, i feel terrible that maybe his wife found something, and just in general it sucks because i liked him as a person too. i have essentially lost a friend with no closure. I can’t stop checking my phone to see if he’s responded , and it’s beginning to affect my attention in school. my last text just expresses that if he no longer doesn’t talk i understand completely, and just want to be sure he is okay.  i’m not a clingy person at all in relationships, but i think it’s the not knowing that has me going crazy. 

What do you think? Am i crazy for even caring? Do you think his wife found something? what would you do in his situation? ever faced anything similar?

148,"So Ive been a loner for most of my life, but up until high school I had a group of friends. When high school came I sort of lost contact with them because I didn’t think I was fun enough for them to hang out with me, so my first few high school years were fairly lonely.

I like being alone most of the time, but I will admit that sometimes I wish I had some friends or a partner to hang out with. I’ve never had a girlfriend but it’s not because I’m unattractive, as I’ve had plenty of girls hit on me, but it’s because I don’t know what people who date do for fun and I think I would be a burden to anyone who tries to date me, so I just avoid it.

I also don’t know what friends do when they get together, which is why I don’t hang out with anyone outside of school. I would appreciate some advice on what people my age do for fun besides drugs, since I’m not really into stuff like that.",14Feb2019,1

However, apparently she hasn't got a lock on her phone. As soon as I tapped ""stop,"" her Messenger pops up and the first name I see at the top is from some guy I've never heard of, along with the first few words of his message calling her ""babe.""

Now, I normally don't snoop around on people's phones, but I couldn't resist. I open the conversation to find messages of affection between both of them, as well as some sexually explicit ones which indicated that they've even had sex.

What do I do? If I tell anyone about this they'll think I'm a shit person for peeking. But then, she *is* cheating. ",14Feb2019,1
150,"My ""father"" died when I was about 11 years old. Still had my mother and quickly enough, a step father that I didn't/Don't get along with. 

The other day my ""Half Sister"" calls me saying she wanted to talk about something. Naturally I call back but no answer so I become concerned as my grandparent's haven't been doing too well lately. So I call my ""Half Brother"" trying to see if he knew anything at all and he reveals to me that:

**My ""Father"" is my grandfather**

**My ""Half sister"" is my Aunt**

**And he, my ""Half Brother"", is my biological dad...** 

Short version of that is ""Father"" (Grandfather) had a vasectomy after he had my ""Half Sister"" and my ""Half Brother"" but wanted another kid with his new wife, My Mother, so had my ""Half Brother"" donate sperm.

At first i'm waiting for the laughter or the punchline thinking it was a joke. I get neither. In disbelief I contact my mother and she confirms the truth.

Now I'm all for a father can be the person who raised you and taught you to be who you are but (insert self pity) that person died when I was 11. Since then it's been me, my mother and a distant step father (We barely speak the same language). I've always been a bit hurt that I didn't get that connection and always felt I've been missing something crucial in my life. 

I know other people have it worse (Someone always has it worse) but it still sucks from my perspective.

Naturally I don't know how to feel. I'm 26, maybe I'm not suppose to feel much about it and just accept it was a thing that is and move on. But in my mind I can't help but feel pain/hurt/anger/something...? It's there but I don't know what it is yet as I only learned this yesterday.

I talked to my ""Half Brother (Biological Dad) with the normal questions like:

Did you not want to step in?

Why did you tell me now and not sooner?

What does this mean going forward?

The conversation went well enough I suppose but I still can't get the words out of my head... ""I'm your dad."" Every time I think about that statement it just doesn't feel real...

153,"I just recently moved in with my Dad and its all good. Only slightly annoying part is he repeats himself quite often. He's always been like this. Usually when its pertaining to food or decision making.

Example: If he asks me what i want to eat for dinner i might say something like ""Lamb Chop, Potatoes, and greens"". There done, its over...or it should be.

He'll keep repeating it, going over every possible scenario for the dinner or how we could cook it. He'll bring up different types of greens or sides, or potatoes, or different ways to cook the lamb chop. None of this really matters to me, it could be any side for the most part and i'd eat it.

Tonight he came back home and talking about cooking Salmon for work tomorrow...cool. He's going to use onion powder, peppers, and something  else. He's already repeated when and how he'll cook it twice, most likely a third time coming in..",14Feb2019,1
154,"So there are these two guys that I have known since kindergarten. Lets call one of them J and the other G. In elementary school J was my “friend” but in reality he was basically my bully who pretended to be my friend. He would make fun of me for being weak and scrawny and push me around and hurt me. G was pretty chill in elementary school and I liked to hang around him. In 7th grade I didnt see G or J that much, but I did see the people that G, J, and I always hung out with in elementary school. In 8th grade my group of friends were introduced to this guy who we will call S who was an extremely toxic person that would hang around us and do stuff like spit at us, throw food at us, and other extremely toxic things. So J and everybody else in our group except for G ended up hating him with a passion and in 8th grade we decided the only way to get him to go away was to treat him the same way he treated us. So he finally stopped talking to us. Now Im in 9th grade and I always hang out with the same group of 6 people that I have talked to since elementary school. G and J included. J is definitely a lot better than he was in elementary school, but he is annoying as hell and tries hard for attention and can be a dick sometimes. G has gotten way way worse. He became what S used to be because he thought what S did was funny. He has 0 boundaries. Every lunch I meet up with my friends and all G does it find a way to fuck with us. He throws food. He steps on shoes. He kicks us in the legs. And he literally has admitted to not even knowing why he does it anymore because he doesnt even think its funny. Just yesterday he got a ketchup packet and sprayed it all over the back of my pants. I was obviously pissed off, but he didnt care. I washed the pants today and they are ruined. Im really pissed off and I have to find a way out of this. The other 4 people in my friend group are all really cool guys and fun to be around, but whenever we are actually having a good time, G or J have to ruin it. I dont know what to do anymore. I have really bad social anxiety and I am nervous just thinking about telling my friends that I dont want to hang out or talk to them anymore because of G and J. What should I do?

157,"I’ve always been. Ever since my messed up childhood with my drug addict mom, her drug addict boyfriend, my abusive brother, my dad who went crazy and who I don’t even know anymore, and getting raised into foster care and being put in a home where my foster mom despised me and treated me like I wasn’t even human. 
I had a poor choice of friends who didn’t truly care about me; who no longer even talk to me and are now alcoholics.
I was addicted to video games in my teens.. it was my only escape to life and reality. I wanted to be normal and fit in but I couldn’t deal with it. I was doing amazing in school until depression and social anxiety got bad. 
My video games were always there for me, as weird as it sounds... even as a child. I remember being 8 years old addicted to all the Zelda games.
Art was also therapeutic for me.. I now sell my art and have been recently making over 1 thousand a month.. which I know isn’t a liveable amount in the city I’m in.. but it’s something right now.
But yea.. I was always a loner. Always alone. Always lonely. I made bad choices in life. I dropped out of high school cause I hated it. And I got pregnant at 18 years old..
My son is precious to me. He’s my bestest friend ever. He gave me a big reason to live and become better. He’s the love of my life. 
But it’s also scary.. he’s now 3 and I just feel like I am not good enough for him. Like i am not normal. I love him but I have days where depression hits me hard.. where I feel alone and scared. He deserves a happy healthy mom and I desperately wish I could be that for him. 
His dad and I had such a rough relationship. It’s been hard. It’s been extra lonely with him sometimes. I hold onto him so tightly because I’m scared of being alone and I desperately want a family. I also get jealous and insecure and obsessive over things.. I feel like I’m pushing him away with my problems. He used to love me, he says he still does, but it’s hard to accept something idk is true. Nobody ever loved me in the past so why should I believe to now. 
I’ve just been feeling abnormal and depressed. I want to be a good mom and a good person. I’m just feeling lost and tired..",14Feb2019,1
158,"My roommate is in an abusive relationship. 

She has been dating this guy for about seven months. They've broken up twice but inevitably she goes back to him. I know leaving abusive situations is hard and complicated; I've been on the receiving end myself. But it baffles me the level of outright abuse she will tolerate. 

At the beginning of their relationship the guy would comment on her clothes and ask her to wear more modest outfits. Not that it matters, but she doesn't dress in a revealing way to begin with. She asked for my opinion at the time and I told her from the start that it was a red flag. I wish she'd just gotten out then, but...

So it gradually escalated to the point where this guy won't let her see her friends. She has to send selfies to him multiple times a day so he knows what she's wearing when they're not together, and he can check the background to make sure she is where she says she is. He tells her she's ""grounded"" as if she's a child, which means she's not allowed to go anywhere but school (college), work, or home. When she's grounded she's also not allowed to text anybody that's not him or use social media. He checks her phone later to make sure.

If he finds out she broke any of his rules he'll beat the shit out of her, and chokes her sometimes. Usually he'll beat her arms or legs so she can hide it, and then tells her to wear long sleeves and pants. Once he gave her a black eye and everyone found out, which led to their first breakup. He also threatens to kill her, especially if she says she wants to break up with him. Sometimes he threatens to kill himself too. 

After we (husband and I) found out he hit her the first time we tried to get her to leave him and decided he would no longer be allowed in our home. Since then he has showed up to ""kidnap"" her a couple of times, which includes him calling and texting her, blaring his car horn in the street, and on one occasion knocking on her window until she agrees to go outside for fear of him making a scene or trying to break in. When it escalated I told her that the next time he showed up and/or entered our property the police would be called. 

I've tried dozens of times to encourage her to make the right decision to leave this guy, and told her that I'll be there supportively through the entire process if and when she wants to file a police report/ restraining order, etc. Or just to have her back if he shows up here again. I've encouraged her to speak to a professional, go to therapy just so she has someone qualified to help her work through it. She won't. 

It just blows my mind that she keeps going back. The last time she left him, she felt happy and free, and told me about how huge of a relief it was. But within a week she felt guilty because he kept texting her about how sad and sorry he was. She told me she wasn't even in love with him anymore, but changed her mind once he won her over again. 

I wish there was something I could do. I am truly afraid for her safety every time she goes to his house, but without her cooperation the police will do nothing. If he ever does something in my presence I'll call the police myself, but so far he's learned to stay away from me. The time he came around to her window was the middle of the night and I was sleeping, and didn't find out until morning or I would have called then. 

Any advice is appreciated. 

I love her and she's one of my best friends, not just a roommate. But it's really hard on me and my husband emotionally to watch her stay like this. ",14Feb2019,1

Sometimes whenever I see writing platforms like Reddit, Quora etc, I want to write on them and share my words but after writing a few words, my mind seems to get bored very quickly and I find very disinterested at that moment to write anything.

173,"Hey

So, I (F22) live in a fourplex apartment. I’m on the second floor, the floor mirroring mine apparently has a lofted area that goes above my place too (lucky him he pays the same damn rent and gets more square footage). 

He’s done some wild damage to my sanity. I’ve seen him once I THINK (?) he’s a white male that’s older than me. 

First Issue: His fire escape passes my  kitchen window. He has had multiple people in and out of his place at quick pace times. I was starting to get suspicious about drug dealing. I started writing down plates as cautionary. People kept trying to open or knock on MY door because of course it looks like his stair case leads to my apartment since it passes my window. I always have my door locked thank god.

Second Issue: his ex wife came thrashing about on his fire escape door. Yelling about being a cheater and how she was going to beat up “that little white b*tch.” (PS I am a young tiny white woman, my lucky day to be cooking Mac and cheese in my kitchen). This goes on for a while. I called non emergency twice (there was a bigger issue elsewhere so it took longer) and then 911 as soon as she ripped the screen off my window and stated crawling into my kitchen!! Bless my downstairs neighbor who took me to his place and she ripped HIS screen window off too. She was later arrested.  He was not home. He did not get questioned. They filed it as vandalism. I have panic attacks when I hear loud knocking now (it’s been since October).

Third Issue: About a month ago, I was gone on vacation. Day I come back I hear a bunch of yelling upstairs. I ask my roommate if anything fishy went on when I left. He said he heard someone yell “you have 24 hours”. Awesome way to come back home is to listen to two grown ass men brawl above my head. Turns out the guy had someone living there that wasn’t supposed to be and he had narcotics on them.

Today I see a car I don’t recognize and hear noice coming from upstairs. Other guys (person who is leased to) car isn’t outside. I’m suspecting that the guy got out of his bailtime and is now up there again. 

I feel completely and totally helpless and scared constantly.

My leasing company says since I have no been physically harmed and have no restraining order that I can’t break my lease. I’m shocked that he can get away with not one but three accounts of breaking the lease and not getting kicked out (destruction of property via someone else, narcs on premises, and having an unclaimed roommate)

I asked to get out of here. My only options are I sublease and they sign over (I have no clue if that’d even work or if anyone would want my apartment in the first place) or two pay three months worth of rent (I can absolutely not). I have my lease until August.

What do I do? What’s my argument? How the hell do I get out of here?

TLDR; neighbor makes me feel uncomfortable and unsafe for very justified reasons. I need an option to get the hell out of here.",14Feb2019,1

I thought It was really heartless of him, but maybe I deserved it... Another thing I'm stressed about is the whole school friend group situation. I know this is going to sound very stupid but It's a genuine concern of mine. We share the same friend group, and by the sound of it, I don't really think he wants anything to do with me anymore. I wanted to be friends still but he seemed very opposed to it. But anyways, since we share the same friend group, I'm worried they'll take his side and kick me out of this friend group. I have a feeling I'll still be able to sit with them at lunch but what I'm really worried about is gym. We are often asked to get into groups so I usually go with him and a few of his other friends, but I'm worried that he'll tell them to hate me or something. And these friends in gym are like two of his best friends so I'm worried I'll be stranded by myself... If you have any advice on my situation I would really appreciate it.

175,"I am going to try to be vague. My partner and I both work from home for two different companies and our shifts overlap. We both work for online companies in customer service type positions and use Slack to communicate with our coworkers and team. (If you don't know what Slack is, it's basically a messaging service like Discord for companies.) My partner was complaining about someone at work, and I realized that person had the same very distinct name as a person I work with. We compared their Slack photos and they are the same person. So now I have the weird knowledge that my coworker is working at least two jobs at the exact same time. I'm not sure if I should bring this up to management. It's not any of my business... except that because she's earning two paychecks, she's slacking off at both jobs while I work harder to pick up her slack so she can make two incomes and I make one. We make a good amount of money at my company but I understand it may not be enough... but like... if you're going to have two jobs, shouldn't they be at two different times? I just don't know what to think. If it wasn't impacting her performance it would be fine, but I don't know. At my company we have a huge policy regarding honesty, transparency, and basically not doing this kind of crap to make things harder for your coworkers. At the same time, I have no idea how I'd say anything that didn't sound like I was being a huge narc. What would you do? Maybe I should just laugh it off and live and let live. ",14Feb2019,1
177,"Okay, so. 
Tomorrow, I am planning on telling my new partner about my struggles with severe depression. I’ve only opened up to one person (my best friend) about this, but I feel this is something that he needs and deserves to know. 
I was being treated with meds a couple years back, off and on but ended treatment suddenly each time. I’m not being treated currently, though I know I should be, (and plan on at some point haha a+ for procrastination)

I am absolutely terrified. I don’t know how he’s going to react, (I don’t have any doubts but you really truly never know). This is big for me, and I believe he will support me, but I feel like this is a massive step forward. 

Any tips would be greatly appreciated!",14Feb2019,1
179,"I'm 23 (f) and when I lost my virginity I kept if from my parents because they are extremely conservative in that subject and I knew they would freak out. Everything was fine until about 6 months ago, they found out I had sex (details about how they found out aren't really that important). But they lost it. They beat me and left me marks and bruises that didn't go away for a month, they kicked me out for a week and then forced me to go back home. I'm torn because I recently graduated college and I've been looking for a job but I haven't found a good one and I really want to move out, but I have no money to do it, not a single cent.

&amp;#x200B;

Getting permission to go out anywhere is a full-on drama and I usually have to send picture/location evidence to my mother. I have a boyfriend and he's amazing, he's been really supportive about this whole situation but he hates the fact that he can't do much because he's scared my parents will turn on him, me and our relationship. Since tomorrow's Valentine's Day we have plans with my boyfriend which include having dinner first and then some...alone time if you know what I mean. However my mother said I had to be home at 10pm and when I said I wanted to stay out longer she threatened me by saying that if she found out I was having sex again she would disown me for good. I'm so scared of what she or my dad might do if they find out what my real plans for tomorrow are. I know they are capable of anything, even calling my boyfriend and telling him something to cause a break-up, or beating me up again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Living in this house has really become torture and I don't know how to make it more bearable...even after I find a job I would have to wait a couple of months to save up enough money to rent an apartment. I don't know what to do, talking to them is absolutely no good (trust me I've tried), telling them I'm old enough would do more damage than good and rebelling right now that I have no money and no way to move out is not a smart idea. I know I'm an adult, but I'm extremely scared of them, they are not \*bad\* parents, they're just so close-minded. What can I really do here? Not only about tomorrow, but in general?

My parents have been divorced since I was a child and around when I was 15 my mom began dating someone new. We all liked him 
 and my mom and him were even talking about marriage. About two years later when I was 17 he killed himself. It was very unexpected and I even told my mom not to worry when she went to his house to check on him. Sadly she was the one that found him. 
I’ll never understand the pain and trauma she has endeared but soon after she began to mentally lose it and slip into psychosis. She began wearing all his clothes and signing her name as his, started to have a jesus complex, and would spend hours a day driving around taking pictures of random stuff. As well as pouring coffee grounds all over our floor to see footprints because he was coming “back”. I didn’t realize she had gotten so bad until I came back from school one day and she wouldn’t let me in the house she kept us all outside and then took us to a weird barn nearby. I was terrified she was going to kill me and my sister. She got help and would occasionally slip back into it. I was always worried she would one day crack and kill us. 

She’s Better now and on the right medication but I still have lasting impacts from this. I can’t help but think about it and I keep wishing something else traumatic would happen to me so I could at least explain to people why I act sometimes because I can’t tell people  I get intrusive thoughts and bouts of panic and still get uncomfortable brining people over. I don’t know what to do I don’t want to talk to anyone because I feel so ashamed of all this.

185,"So a friend of mine texted me today about watching a film in my house (which I share with my SO). We've been meaning to watch a film since we bought a projector last year and her kid loves geeky movies. She's a single mum and has been dating a pretty unstable guy (her words not mine). Since I have nothing against him, when she asked last minute if she could bring him along, I said ""No problem"".
According to her, this guy comes from a pretty well off family that has recently come by some money problems due to some really bad investments and is currently struggling to make ends meet.
My SO and I are very private people, but we are welcoming to people as long as they are somewhat part of our close circle of friends.
Anyhow, they arrived somewhere around 11 with fresh popcorn and beer (my SO and I rarely drink alcohol). 
This guy kept asking questions about the house, how many rooms the house had, whether we lived with more people, etc, etc. We both felt those where significant red flags, almost burglary type questions, but decided it we were being paranoid.
We started watching the film, and he kept going downstairs by himself. At first, I thought he was feeling sick and needed the restroom but then realized he was going outside leaving my front door open in order to smoke. 
What is more, he opened my fridge as if it was his house without our permission.
I found all of it pretty rude behaviour for a guest and specially for one that a) we had never met and b) was the first time coming to our house.
My SO and I, just happen to travel tomorrow for 4 days and all we can think about is that our house might be broken into.

Other things are like riddles directing her towards a bar where she orders a special drink and is brought a riddle or something (I would have to speak to the manager beforehand to set up up).

189,"Hi thanks for reading, wanting opinions on my friends an what i should do that beneficial. I have two friends who are in a relationship together (and always have been, since way before I came around). We've grown increasingly closer over the last year and until a week or so ago. I went away to families for a few days and came back to them seeming very passive aggressive and unusual. Since coming back I've hardly seen them unless hanging out with the same group at the same time, when we used to see each other every other day then head out together if we felt like it. When I've talked about hanging out with them I get told see you there when before we would've went together. People get busy so it's not just that, they'll message to see what I'm up to only to tell me there hanging out with someone else when I return the question. When together I just feel a vibe that somethings off also. Small comments here or there which aren't bantery they're small quick stabs. 
I left it at first as I know them to be a bit moody but it still hasn't blown over which makes me think somethings actually wrong, although I can't say what. The only thing which comes to mind is when I first saw them from returning from my families they said to me I didn't tell them I was going, which I had two days before I left on the day I booked my ticket up there. We were drinking and they had been drinking for longer then me and I didn't make a fuss over it just a small 'I booked at ticket to X today' although they seemed strung up on the accusation of me not telling them. I had went and visited my sick grandma for four days do I didn't think I needed to say more then a small 'I've got this planned' while we were sitting around talking. That seems silly to act like this over but I'm so confused. I want to ask them what's up without being confrontational as I care about them, they do like to argue sometimes though. And everything they are doing to make me sense this is so passive aggressive that I can't really call it out without looking silly but it's the build up and difference from how they were to suddenly how they are now.

192,"This might be a long one so buckle up. Also repost because it wasn't showing up in New

My ex and I are still friends since when we broke up a few months ago there wasn't a big argument or something to make us hate each other just we didn't feel  like we were happy together as a couple. We're pretty close friends since we dated for two years and you get to know someone pretty well in that time and idk we just get along really well. Fast forward to a week or two ago and she tells me that her and the person she likes are going to get together. I haven't had a single thought in my mind about her dating someone until now and I don't know why it makes me feel sad. I never was the jealous type in our relationship but that could just because I trusted she was faithful to me. none of that matters when youre not in a relationship with the person, it's messing with my head and was the kick that's kind of put me into a spiral of sadness. 

Me being sad about that stuff and feeling weird pushed my mind into thoughts of am I going to be able to find someone to love me. I remember how hard it had been to find someone that liked me as well. 

I started worrying about the person I have a crush on and how poorly I feel it's going. That leads me to stress about whether to keep trying with that person or try to salvage a friendship from it only and disconnect my feelings. 

I think about how my crush on my ex went and how sweet and innocent it all was then but now that we are older I don't feel I'm going to get to have all those sweet moments that make your heart jump cause you don't know if they like you or not. I worry that that is all gone now because we are older. 

I start worrying about college but more so the fact that all of my friends are moving away and I'm not going to have anyone to lean on or talk to.

I've for the last few years been really happy I think and I've done what I can to be optimistic and happy. I'm not saying there haven't been days I've been sad but when I did get sad it never stuck around for more than a day. So when all of this happens and I'm on week two of the sad train I'm sad that I've lost one of my favorite parts about myself and the spiral continues. 

I'm not getting enough sleep at night now because I'm stressing about all of this. Which makes me tired in the day and I'm starting to get a little angry at things but I am really calm normally and it takes a lot to upset me and that's one thing I like about myself but now that's going away and is stressing me out and making me sad. 

I asked my ex right before she told me she was getting into a relationship what I was bad at in our relationship because I wanted to improve myself. I thought I was ready for whatever and it wouldn't hurt at all but I found out I am terrible and actually helping when someone is dealing with emotional stuff because I just try to fix the issue instead of actually helping the person through their emotions and trying to understand how they are feeling. I know I can get better at that and I already have but lots of the issues in my relationship with my ex were that she dealt with lots of emotional issues and while I was patient and the start of our relationship towards the end I had no patience because I got sick of things never getting better. I know that's a bad view to have on it and I regret that view and wish I had known about how bad I was at helping her and how to actually help because its much easier for me to just listen and help them emotionally than trying to figure out where the root of the problem is and how to get rid of that. Knowing all of this know I worry that if I had just known then would her and I worked out and been happy together? Which is garbage to have to think about when you can't exactly find out or know. But is even more garbage thinking about if it did fix things and make us happier I don't think I would be have a fourth of the problems I'm having right now.

Another thing I like about myself is how good of a driver I am but with me being tired I'm not being as vigilant and I keep making small but dumb mistakes that shouldn't happen. Like drifting in the lane too much because I am to busy checking a mirror. And again im said that I have lost a part of me I like.

I can't find anything that makes me happy right now. The one thing that was making me happy for sure was playing hacky sack with friends at school but one friend is getting sick of doing it and I feel bad about it. I don't have any hobbies I enjoy right now. 

I'm sure there lots of other issues right now but my mind is very jumbled and isnt remembering things well.

I keep talking to people about this stuff and I'm not finding a real solution or fix to these problems and I sort of expect the same here. ",14Feb2019,1

It can either be anonymous or you could say: tell em it’s from me. I have the temptation of buying one but at the same time I’m super shy and I grew up with severe anxiety. I know I should break out of my bubble and take more risks, but at the same time what if this goes wrong. ",14Feb2019,1
209,"I have been trying to figure put why my dad and brother manipulate and antagonize me so badly these past years because i am being treated horrible worse than ever.
My dad was always abusive verbally, mentally, and physically. i just remember the grin on his face like a grin someone has when they like seeing you on pain and he has that grin everytime he destroys me.

When i was about in elementary school my brother was going through some problems and lived at home. I remember him working nights and sleeping during the day. It was summer and i had my friends over and  remember we kept waking him up but he would never tell me to stop it and i wont ever understand why.

he took to many sleeping pills and over dosed and was taken to the hospital. He would not let us see him but i know whay happened now i didnt then but i do now. I cant say  its my fault for sure because they wont tell me. My father and brother wont even tell me they are mad at me.

My brother necame my role model and i know now its just to get me back. An entire life long vendetta and they wont stop it.

I know they have it out for me because of all the things thats happening, they are driving me to kill myself but i dont have that strength. I cant bring myself to do it. I know i want to because it would stop their power over me and give them what they want they want me gone.

My brother found out the things i wanted to be in life and hes accomplished everything i wanted to do while my father made sure i stayed unhappy. At that time I didnt even know he was actually angry at me. I thought it was my mom he was angry with. I started repressing my emotions at a young age to cope with him. 

My would follow me around and yell at me i remember his shadow looming over me and backing me into the closet, when i was trying to do my homework he would yell at the tv for hours and hours i could never focus. I saw a school therapist because i wasent learning anything and it didnt help. No one ever found out what he did because i was happy about getting attention from this therapist. They just chalked it up to me being ""developmentally delayed"" 

They are not going to let me live at all. All these years they still have this vendetta. Im so beaten down now i am practically dead anyways i dont live at all. my dad watches me very closely now.

 He has locks on all doors that tell him when i leave for work, he has done some things to manipulate me into spending money. Upsetting me so i numb myself with alcohol or drugs most of the time. He wanted to put cameras in the area i live and i am grateful the tech realized i was uncomfortable and he didnt put one up. 

I dont know how to proceed reddit, they wont let me in they fought this long they wont give up. And now im getting it from the world because my brain just doesent work anymore.

210,"Throwaway because some friends know my online handle and I don't want them to know I'm a mess.

I've recently moved out of home to study, but the problems I've been facing predate that. Before I was an adult, in high school, I'd never actually get any work done outside of class. Teachers eventually gave up chasing me up for homeworks. By some stroke of luck, I scraped through my exams and got in to a reasonable university on a course with solid career opportunities.

I was pretty excited to move out as I was hoping, with a different circle of friends around me, no behavoural expectations from them, and responsibilities, I would reform and be a better person in general.

Turns out, a change of scenery doesn't give you a new personality.

Now I'm an adult and not only do I have to manage my own studies, I have to do boring adult things like laundry and shopping. And... I'm just not. I don't have the motivation to do any of this. It feels like there's some sort of mental disconnect between the 'me' that has rational thoughts and is typing this now, and the 'me' that actually manages my actions. No matter how much I think about what things I need to do, it just doesn't translate to actions, and I'm at a loss for what to do about it.

This isn't even my only problem. I have an awful diet (because I'm unmotivated to cook real meals and routinely go shopping), terrible social skills due to a mental illness (don't want to talk about it unless it's explicitly relevant but yeah), bad hygeine (becuse I'm unmotivated to care for myself), besides gaming I have no real hobbies or interests and have the most bland personality you can imagine, just to name a few. My life is slowly but surely falling apart.

Sorry for the bad formatting, it's 4am as I type this and I just want to get this off my chest for now.

Back to the work stuff:

In 4-5 years time, I don't realistically see myself working a job in the field of my course even though I find the stuff I study interesting. That certainly doesn't help my motivation, I've even considered dropping out, but I have no backup plan. Who would support my leech lifestyle, my mother? That's not fair on her, and she won't be around forever (that was harder to type than I expected). Sometimes I just want to exist passively, not having to interact with the world but just observe. But I need a life plan before I end up with no job and noone to help me.

By far the biggest problem is the lack of work that is taking place. I've managed to survive 18 years only doing what was expected of me when someone was directly watching me. ""Compulsory"". Never any more. That's nowhere near enough at this stage.

Plus, I hate to change my external habits towards other people, I don't want to attract any attention to myself. So... I have that as a mental block stopping me from changing anything. It's the main reason I was excited to move, because I wouldn't have that. But then I didn't change anything anyway. Ffs.

This probably sounds really petty and stupid but I have noone but good ol' reddit to turn to. Sorry if I missed any key details, I'll try and update you if you have any questions (if I even remember the login for this account).

Most of the info I find about self motivation and self discipline (which I also lack) gives me a r/wowthanksimcured vibe.

I started dating this woman/""May"" (28)3 months ago. She's beautiful, smart, and funny, but she was moving at a snail's pace in the putting out department. I liked her, don't get me wrong but a man has needs. I had been going through a dry spell really bad.

 One night when we went out, we ran into her sister 24? (we will call her June because her sister was smoking hott). May is a 7/10 and June is a solid 9. I could tell May was hesitant to introduce us for what I imagine being because she knows June has got it going on.  Shes mentioned before she doesn't have that much of a relationship with her because they had a big age gap and that her sister was really spoiled growing up, and never learned the word no,  still living with her parents off their dime. I thought she was just hating on her. June and I talked all night and even flirted. I was drinking so I get it, it was an asshole thing to do. May acknowledged that I was feeling her sister more so she left. Immediately after she left. June took me into the bathroom and blew me. 2nd best head I've ever recieved. 


I started seeing June more(more bjs) and we were hitting it off...until the night I asked her back to my place. She said she couldnt stay past 10 and when i asked why, she showed me her ankle monitor. She refused to go into detail and went into a full blown melt down resulting in her trashing my apartment when I asked her to explain. I broke up with her on the spot.

The last few weeks I've been getting texts from her that range from sweetheart to complete psychopath.

""Why havent you called?""

""I'm falling for you""

""You're still seeing May, arent you?""

Even going as far as threatening suicide.


To be honest, I'm kind of pissed May never gave me the full details on her sister prior to us meeting. I confronted her about it and  the answer she gave sounded rehearsed. Apparently this has happened before. Copy and pasted:

 ""Like you would've believed me if I told you? I've said something in the past and it made me sound catty and jealous.""

I was looking into breaking my lease and moving because of this chick until I learned that she was finally taken in because she broke curfew after she passed out at another dudes place. Shes gonna be gone for a few years.  Needless to say, yeah I'm aware I chose the wrong sister because I let my d do the thinking on this one. Would it be completely shitty of me to hit up May again and try to start things over?

214,"I'm 28 years old and I have been working solely online since December 2015. This means that I have zero colleagues. I spend my working day alone on my laptop, sometimes at home, sometimes at the library, but most often in coffee shops.

While working from home offers incredible flexibility and the chance to be my own boss, there are obvious downsides. The one that grates most is the lack of colleagues. I am highly introverted but the truth is that for most people, coworkers present opportunities for both friendship and general improvement in social skills. 

I worked in an office for a year back in 2014 and I enjoyed the after-work drinks. Sometimes the small talk at desks was a pain to listen to and sometimes just being around people exhausted me to the point that I'd go out for lunch alone or eat alone at my desk.

The caveat is that even though my former job paid well, the work itself was very uncreative and unfulfilling. It was pretty much playing around with spreadsheets and databases. However, I can't help but feel a huge sense of missing out by not having colleagues with whom I work towards achieving shared goals.

Is this a case of the grass is always greener? i know there is no guarantee that every office will have coworkers I get along with but I've a better chance of being social in traditional office jobs than being alone with a laptop. I sometimes feel like it's a waste of life. Thanks for any advice. ",14Feb2019,1
215,"For a little bit of context, I have been working part-time at this store for just a little under three years and I have always strive to put in a great effort into my work. I have had made mistakes in the past, but I made sure to never repeat such mistakes ever again. I rarely show up to work late, if at all. I also rarely do the bullshit 'call in sick' move just so I can go through with some plans (I ever only done it twice). I never had any conflict with any of my co-workers or the customers. I am neat, tidy, good with people, efficient with my time, and always consistent with my work. I was never one to complain or to turn down new tasks or challenges. The manager I am talking about is actually a newer manager who came in when I have already been an employee for a little over a year. He was nice and fair for the longest time up until this point.   


Now here's the deal. I started noticing this about a month ago. I became the footwear guy sometime during May of 2018 alongside another person who became an employee a little later on. This person, let's call him Dave, has only worked 8 months since the time of posting this. He also works part-time. For the longest time, Dave and I had similar work hours in a week. My availability was between 11 AM to 10 PM for almost everyday of the week so that should've allowed for more hours. Sometimes I would have more shifts and sometimes he would get that blessing of more shifts. I thought it was just a bit unfair whenever he had more hours since I had seniority over him and I had plenty of experience. Recently, Dave has been receiving more hours; and I mean MORE hours. I am only receiving 15 hours a week at best while Dave is getting upwards of 30 hours. This is bullshit because I have always caught Dave slacking, standing around, or talking with his coworker for a little longer than necessary without doing work whenever I worked the same shift as him.  


Alongside this, I have been scheduled in such a way that I never get to work with my colleagues. Let's call my colleagues K and G. I would to talk G while working and sometimes it may get a little out of hand, but G, being the responsible shift leader that he is, would tell me to do focus on my tasks at least while talking. K and I have been doing much of the same and even hung out after work a few times. Now I never get to work with them as I've noticed. Despite me having conversations with them sometimes, I would always put in effort while working and we would always team up to handle the busier days. Another one of my colleagues is a friend of mine whom we shall call R. R was actually recommended by me to work at the store and has since then been a great addition to the team. R is cheerful, good with customers, diligent, and always wears a smile.  


Another example is when I was tasked to put the new security tags through the tongue of every shoe or through the eyelets to reduce theft activity since shoplifters have always found a way to cut off the old ones. To do this, I would have to push a pin into a gray tag (the other reason for this is because the footwear section was super close to the entrance/exit and we aren't allowed to apprehend shoplifters in the act for safety reasons) ""This could potentially ruin the product and inconvenience customers"" I thought. For a few days, I put the new tags through the bottom lace of every shoe as to prevent this. My boss caught me doing this and asked why I didn't do it as he asked and I explained about how I was concerned about the product and customer inconvenience. He understood my thought process and warned me to never do it again lest I get a violation. An hour later, he still writes me up anyways because it was a breach in company policy and that it was ""nothing personal"". He needed to do it because it's just what the company wants him to do in such a situation. I admit, it was my mistake for now following orders, but a stern warning should've sufficed.  


So there it is, guys. What do I do in this situation. And before you say anything, yes I am considering getting a new job but securing one is painfully difficult because every immigrant and their mother (literally, in some cases) are getting these positions rather quickly. Good on them actually for finding a source of income so fast! I am not so lucky in this case despite being an immigrant with a PR myself haha. ",14Feb2019,1

219," So in April 2017, I was in a dark time of my life. I made many reckless and careless choices. One of which was having sex with a girl I barely knew. I didn’t use any protection and I pulled out before finishing. This was when I lost my virginity, and I haven’t had any sexual encounters since. The girl was bisexual and a stoner who has had a lot of sexual experience. 

Everything felt normal, up until August 2017, when I started to feel a little bit of pain in my left testicle. The pain is not that bad but enough for me to know it’s there. It comes and goes every day, so I think there’s a good chance I have it. 

I haven’t yet been tested, but I’m really afraid that I have an STI. I’m scared because I want to have kids and it could possibly make me infertile. I want to go next week but hopefully, I don’t coward out.

Recently the majority of the time I smoke I end up regretting it, spend a part of that next day convincing myself that I have to stop smoking, then when it gets to the evening I end up smoking again. The reasons I regret smoking are that I get the munchies super bad, I usually wake up super groggy the next day, and most importantly I’m consciously aware that I have other stuff that I most likely should be doing with my time. Overall the majority of the time I’m high feels like a waste, not even relaxing anymore. 

I’ve always been a marijuana proponent as well as a fan and user but lately it’s like something has changed. I don’t know if it’s that I’m getting older or what it might be. I’ve accepted the fact that if I want to succeed with my particular goals in life that I need to cut back or quit altogether, at least in the short term.

We have been told no final decisions have been made and that they are in the process of accessing which teams will continue to be where. I have been with this employer for over 10 years and I honestly I love the type of work I do and have stayed here because of it, not so much for the company. I also have never  been in the situation of the possibility of being laid, thankfully, until now and am just unsure of what the best course of action is. 

Anyone have suggestions on looking for work immediately or whether it’s better to hold off on looking for a new job until the final decisions are made and working with an employer through the movement of the position. I am pretty good at my job and love the analytical work I do, however, it’s a pretty small field I specialize in and I am still only working on my bachelors.

224,"My husband and I adopted a dog today, an adult female 25 pound Australian cattle dog-ish mix from a local shelter.

We've had a wonderful cat, an only child, for 4 years. We had talked about getting a dog as well for ages (our cat thinks he's a dog) and recently we met an older rescue dog that really got into our hearts. 

It all happened a bit fast. We met her three days ago and now she's here.

The introduction between our cat and the new dog today (we carefully researched how to do introductions) went pretty poorly. She later barked at our cat from across the room while crated, and also lunged at him once when we were taking her past his space to go out for a walk.

The dog has also been freaking out in her crate, whining and scratching and acting out. She pooped on the floor once. 

We've been doing our best to be authoritative, to set boundaries, to reward good behavior, etc.

It hasn't even been 12 hours but my anxiety is through the roof. My husband doesn't share emotions much but I can tell he's overwhelmed too.

We live in a two bedroom apartment that's pretty spacious but currently, we have the dog crated in my husband's office and my husband is sleeping on the floor there to keep her company. The door is closed. I'm in the bedroom with the cat.

I'm terrified that they will never get along and that my husband and I have royally fucked up.

The dog's foster said that she was fine with a cat in their house. We saw her interact with cats at the shelter and all she did was sniff, and then back down if swatted at. We weren't allowed to do a meet and greet with the dog at our place  (which we requested) due to shelter policy.

I'm trying my hardest to focus on the fact that it's been a stressful day for everyone, that it takes time to build relationships, that the dog has been through a lot, that my husband (a lifelong dog owner) and I (a lifelong cat owner) are capable and cut out for this.

But I can't help thinking that maybe we screwed up. 

Maybe we rushed into it. Maybe our cat would be happier alone and maybe the dog would be happier in a home without a cat. Maybe we aren't cut out for this. Maybe the cat and dog aren't the right fit together.

The shelter said that if we ever had to return her, it would be okay because we'd essentially have fostered her and they can adopt her out next time with more information. So if worst comes to worst... which I don't want to do... we can return her and she will have an opportunity for a better life.

I'd feel like such a failure. I'd be devastated to say goodbye. My heart aches just thinking of putting her back there. I want to try and fight and make this work. I'm also terrified that our cat is going to be attacked or have to hide all day.

I have been meaning to write her and apologise for my behavior, and that I miss her and our friendship, I just don't know if it's the right thing to do. I know it too her a long time to get over me (she was deeply in love with me) so I don't want to open up those wounds again. But that doesn't change the fact I want to apologise and make things right. Any advice? ",14Feb2019,1
231,"One of my cousins who grew up in the U.S. is having a hard time there and she wants to go to high school ""back home"" meaning the country of her father where I also live. She never lived here before but she believes her ""home"" side is her true side and says she was born in a wrong country, that she has stronger ties here than there, that her soul is truly home country and that she wants to go to college and get a job here. 

Her parents think it may do her well and want to enroll her to my high school. I'm pushing them to send her to an international school. The biggest reason she and her mother just don't get is her weight is a problem. She is obese.

Our school tends to be competitive in everything and half of my class is underweight. There is no way she can have a comfortable year here. I brought it up privately to her mother but she is American and doesn't understand the gravity of her daughter's situation. Also neither she or her daughter understand that competitive companies don't hire fat girls.  

She has to go to an international school where her weight will be less of a problem and go back to the US where her condition is better accepted. 

I would have my parents talk to her parents if they were alive but unfortunately they have passed when I was a child. Grandmother just says she will just make sure the cousin wouldn't eat too much but would cousin listen? 

I'm at a loss. Should I just let them crash into the wall and suffer or should I try harder? ",14Feb2019,1
232,"I basically just need to know if I’m being a wuss or not.
Situation (in a very long story short way):
- worked at a job that I kind of liked for 5.5 years until I hurt my back and couldn’t work standing up/cooking/preparing food
- got an admin job in a field that I didn’t mind, but hated the place. Everyone was so nasty and I was going through personal things that I didn’t feel comfortable disclosing to anyone at the workplace (dad in hospital, mum nearly losing the house, etc etc). I left after 9 months.
- got a job that I loved at first. Managers started to dislike me and would pick on absolutely anything they could while their favourites got away with murder. I started to not care after about a year being there, so much so that by me not caring that when I made a mistake and they fired me, I didn’t care. I was there for just over a year.
- because of me being fired, I got any job in admin that I could. I started there a month ago. I kind of don’t mind the admin job but it’s in a field that I can’t care less about (financial planning). Everyone is nice enough, but are forever putting pressure saying that if I make a mistake that is unacceptable and I’ll be fired. I’m forever second guessing myself and triple checking my work which means that I am taking a little longer than the girl that’s been there for years. Now they’re saying that they’re keeping an eye on me because I’m slow. Kind of fair enough, but what has tipped me over the almost edge is that today I took a whole 30 seconds going up to a girl to show her a photo of my dog (who is really cute by the way). The manager walks past and says that I should only do that on lunch breaks, then proceeds to go out for a cigarette. The manager went home at 4:50, and at 4:53 I got notified that my train had been cancelled, which means that I need to take the 5:01 or the 5:41. I asked the admin girl if I could leave at 4:58 to get to the 5:01 and she said that I would have to call the manager to ask for permission??? To leave 2 minutes early...... even though I get to work (and start work) sometimes 20 mins early.

233,"Good day y’all,

As the title suggests, I need some advice on a matter. Here is the setup to my question:

 An old college buddy of mine (graduated 5yrs ago for the curious) got married during the holiday season of last year. His wedding was a destination wedding that I wasn’t able to attend due to financial reasons (hefty payment to pay off student loans, thankfully *ayyyye*,and financially assisting foreign family members who just arrived stateside after obtaining citizenship).  As I wasn’t able to attend, I would like to send the newlyweds a gift that won’t break the bank while also expressing  my regret at not attending. My idea is to give them an amazon gift card ($100 or more potentially)so they can spend it on, at least, some new married life needs, and give my homie a personal phone call  expressing my regret at not going.  With all that info dropped, here is my question: 

Is an amazon gift card (I’m thinking $150-$200) a “tacky” gift?  Or conversely,is that too exuberant?? Should I get a different gift??? TBH I’ve only ever gone to two weddings for close friends of mine. Both were within a 30 minute driving distance, and I was obviously able to attend. 

.......Advise me, knowledgeable homies. What do you think I should do?",14Feb2019,1
235,"I realize my question is pretty vague, but I'm basically asking how stressful jobs like retail, fast food and cashiering are.
For some personal context, I am 22 years old, don't know how to drive, and am living with my parents (cuz local community College). I am incredibly nervous about getting because I have severe social anxiety, generalized anxiety, I can't deal with negative things, and am currently coping with stress from school and life. As an example, whenever I get a comment on an essay I wrote or just any assignment in general, my anxiety kicks in and I get extremely nervous and my heart starts beating really quickly and I almost always refuse to see whatever criticism I got. Or even getting an email or phone call from school. I  stutter immensely and have really dry lips when I'm anxious, making talking really difficult, and to top it all off, all the stress and anxiety I deal with has given me an incredibly weak stomache and I end spending around half an hour in the bathroom because of it. However, I _*have*_ been learning to cope and deal with all this of course thanks to my physical therapy, which is why I'm now looking to find a job and finally be able to afford the things that I want, also help better myself by forcing myself to do this and potentially even fix my anxiety and even my severe stuttering under anxiety.

With that being said, I've _time and time_ again about how much people fucking hate their jobs, and all the shit they deal with, and they scare the shit out of me. Like, Im already going through a lot, and don't know if I want to make it worse for myself, and just want to know what working is/was really like for you guys. Also, there's a local dollar tree hiring and it's a 10 minute walk from where I live which is ridiculously convenient and am considering applying there, but again, idk. So again, what's it like working part time at places like walmart/target/any retail, working as a cashier, or working as a cook in fast food. Fast food scares me the most because I've heard horror stories from people online and people I know/meet, whether it be dealing with customers or hurting themselves in the kitchen. Also, if any of you can think of a specific type of job (place or position) then feel free to suggest them, because this is kind of all I have. Far be it from my parents to understand what I'm going through or even acknowledge that my issues are actual issues and giving me lectures about how pathetic I am, effectively making my life worse. 

TL;DR I'm a social mess but have learned coping techniques and want to start working for money and self improvement and want to know what it's like working part time in just about any job. ",14Feb2019,1
237,"So I'm a 27f living on the other side of the world (France) with my partner (who is from this country originally). I've overcome a lot with visas and the language barriers until finally I have gotten myself into stability. I am renting an apartment in a little village south of Paris with partner abs working full time in Paris. My original job in my home country was an early childhood teacher as I have studied three years to be there. Here the qualification doesn't work the same and so I earn half the amount of money and in the lowest position in my field -_-  

I have been working there for a year so far but it's taking its toll on me. I feel completely under appreciated, I get paid minimum wage and have to travel 1.5 - 2 hours each way every day. There are some people there with half the qualifications and experience, who tell me what to do and criticize me. It's so difficult backing your actions in a language which you barely know how to speak, I think I would have definitely been able to stay my ground if everyone spoke English. After work and travel time I have no time for myself. I get home at 7 pm eat, shower, prepare for the next day then in bed at 9.30pm to wake up at 6 am and start over. It's draining my soul out of me, really. 

I thought I could hang in there until I learn enough french to get a better job with nicer hours closer to my home, but I don't know if I can any more.

My partner is studying full time and has no time for a job as part of his studies he needs to work full time for weeks on end (for free). That means I'm paying all the rent and most of the groceries, he had some savings which are decreasing which he pays the electricity, phones, sometimes other things and gas. 

Also finding another job is very difficult, I've been in the process for a long time, there's only so many jobs for English speakers who work with young children.

What should I do? Should I risk taking one day off a week as a mental break and work on my french?  Doing that I would just make enough money to get by, or are there any other suggestions/advice? ",14Feb2019,1
238,"So there was this girl, lets call her Connie, that I met on tinder around Octoberish. 

We found out we were from the same hometown and started texting a lot and we flirted a bit over text and cuddled (nothing more) one time. A couple weeks after we met I had a medical emergency so I left school for a few weeks and we stopped talking. 

I tried texting her again when I got back and got no response (after that I thought I got ghosted like most people do after a while from tinder and forgot about her). Then right before winter break (a couple months later) she texted me and wanted to hang out back in our hometown. I said yes but I never followed through with it because I didn’t know what to think of it. When we got back to school I texted her asking if she still wanted to hang and she said yes. 

We agreed to meet up and get dinner but up to this point I had no idea if it was a date or just friends meeting up. We ended up just talking about what we’ve been up to and it was pretty nice but then her screensaver goes on and it’s her and what I assume is her boyfriend. We finished eating and she had to go meet one of her friends so I walked with her and I left. 

I got home and saw on her snapchat story that there was the same guy opening his valentines day present (from her). 

I’m just kind of confused on why she would agree to hang out with me all of the sudden and be friendly again, especially considering she has a boyfriend now and we met on tinder and cuddled with each other before. 

I’m honestly just confused do I text her? Do I not text her? 

also, is this weird that she agreed to meet up with me or is it just two friends getting food?",14Feb2019,1
239,"Hi I'm a 16 year old male and I need some help.
Little back story first, all my life I've been an introvert and have had a lot of trouble socialising with normal people I'm also Dyslexic, and it's taken it's toll on my ability to make new friends and I believe a lot of people dislike me for reasons unknown.
I am now in year 11 but last year I was in year 10 at a different school, that being the school the people I'm talking about also came from.

I believe in being honest and straightforward though.

So recently I've been hanging out with a group of girls at school that are in the same year as me, one of which I liked last year but it didn't take long for everyone to find out which caused issues but I digress, over the past week I have gained a massive amount of confidence with talking to people and I thought I was becoming better friend with this group until I got a message from a seemingly trustworthy friend of mine, stating that the group of girls I was hanging felt uncomfortable with my presence.
He said they wanted a few days to themselves which is fine.
But one of the girls in the group has blocked me on Facebook, the one I liked last year...

Being confused and being that the information hit me so hard I decided to get drunk and I ended up blocking around 50% of the people I knew that came from the old school we were all at last year.

Still I'm confused and don't know what to do...

Do I completely separate myself from them and press the restart button on that chapter of friendship groups?

Or do I give them a couple of days and then see if they will let me Hangout with them.",14Feb2019,1

245,"Hello all. I am new to Reddit so I apologize if I do anything wrong or use a wrong format or whatever.  I am also Canadian  but I was forced to take French all my life so spelling mistakes are possible in this. 

So let me give you some backstory. This may be long, so tl;dr at the bottom. :)

&amp;#x200B;

I am a young adult, who had to go to a mental institution for help with my anxiety, dermatillomania, PTSD and some other disorders that I would not like to mention if that is alright. I am there to help with my dislike of loud noises \[lots of noises can be close to pitch to me, which they wanted to work with\] as well as being social. But let me be honest,

my mental health has improved a lot over the years, and keep in mind, I was supposed to go there when I was 13. I am a lot older than that now. Under 20 but over 15. Not sure if I'm allowed to give away my age so I'll just give you that.

&amp;#x200B;

When I first arrived, my mum and I were decorating my room. I had to stay for 3 months, which was the default stay time. I was going to be discharged in April. I went there January 23rd. But I will explain why I'm not there by the end.

&amp;#x200B;

When we were done, we were walking to the managers office to ask him questions about my stay when this girl, who is around my age but younger, screamed ""OH MY JESUS"" at one of the staff and stomped down the hall. Stomping or just anything that included heavy footsteps was heavily discouraged, as there was infants below us that needed oxygen. Please don't ask me why - I have no idea why there was ill infants. But back to my problem. Let us call the ""oh my jesus"" girl Pest. That is what she is.

&amp;#x200B;

My mum and I gave eachother looks but just shrugged it off. Fast foward to an hour, I made friends with all of the girls \[there is female units and male units, I am female. :)\] and were playing a card game. One girl was helping me against a staff member until the Pest waltzed into the room with a staff and introduced herself. She was there for 2 weeks before me but acted as if she knew everything. I could tell the girls hated her but couldn't do much.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me give you a very short description on the pest, ladies and gents.

She was expressing signs of autism, which is completely fine with me, I got awards for working with kids like that in my old school \[it was catholic, you're given awards each month, you'll get it\] but she couldn't take jokes. That is how I bond - I joke around and make people laugh. I make the staff laugh, I make the other girls laugh, whatever. But she just did not get a single thing. That was one thing that got on my nerves but I couldn't let it bother me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Every day, we are given chores, and when we are done we get a dollar. Mine was to set the tables for lunch, so after my chore I told everyone to wash up and get ready. I was walking to the kitchen because I already washed up, when Pest runs to the kitchen excitedly saying ""FOOD"" like a dumbass, and in the process she pushed me over. I get very angry very easily which I'm trying to work on, so I just took a deep breath and said ""could you please be patient?""

She gave me the most dirty look and screamed ""YOU'RE NOT MY MOTHER, I DON'T HAVE TO BE PATIENT"". Please note, I take manners and stuff very seriously because that's how I was raised. This instantly pissed me off and I whispered vulgarities under my breath so staff couldn't hear, but she could. I said stuff like ""fucking idiot"" and ""stupid connard \[asshole\]"". She obviously heard so she ran out and stomped to her room, which is right beside mine.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't get in trouble, but she did. She wasn't allowed to have lunch until the girls and I were done so we could go have independent time. \[Time by ourselves for half an hour.\]

In this place, you cannot have phones or anything to contact your parents/guardians, and I have severe seperation anxiety. My mum and I have been through abuse, assault, and a lot together. We are attached by the hip, so naturally I'm going to want to contact her. This dumbass Pest looks at my phone, screams ""IS THAT A PHONE"" and acts like I just threw someone out the window. I shushed her and luckily nobody heard her. I hid my phone for the three days I was there, I was not letting this pest ruin my time.

&amp;#x200B;

This place was heaven for people that didn't miss home or their guardians. They had movie players, ds's, tablets and more for us. Plus a wii in the longue room. So this place was awesome.

But the pest even ruined the wii for everybody.

&amp;#x200B;

There is a half an hour limit for everyone on it so all the girls can have a turn, but the pest will throw a tantrum if you try to take it away from her. If she wants to play with you, you have to let her win at Mario Kart or Wii Fit or else you're a villain. She is like a very, very spiteful little sibling that everyone hates.

&amp;#x200B;

We have this thing where we sit in a circle with some staff and ask eachother what our goals are for the day. During the pests turn, a staff member had to interrupt \[the pest hasn't even started her turn yet at this point\] and inform us that if we needed to talk to someone and if you felt like your voice wasn't heard you could submit a help sheet, but the pest screamed before the staff member was done and yelled about her turn not being done. Then she ran to her room.

&amp;#x200B;

Last but not least, she has to throw a ball against the wall in her room, which is the wall that connects our rooms together. I have terrible nights,because of  waking up due to paranoia and yeah. Like I mentioned before, I had went through abuse with my mother and we don't sleep properly. She throws the ball at the wall very late at night so I never get any sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

You get to go home on the weekends, and when I went home I stayed tf home. I'm still here, and in a couple hours I have a teleconefrence with them to decide if I go back or not. But I can't go back because I will get more anger issues and lose my progress due to the pest. They can't seperate us either due to ""wanting us to be included in everything"" and seperating us from other girls due to one isn't fair. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you have read this far, kudos! If you needed to the read the tl;dr, fine too! :)

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR - I'm at institution to help with my mental health, some girl ruins absolutely everything for me, I left weeks ago and I haven't been back there since. If I don't go back I'm throwing a lot of opportunities away. 

I need help. What would you guys do in this situation? :S I feel absolutely stuck and it is VERY hard to get into this place !!

My mum's friends are jealous because their children aren't able to get it, and they have very bad aspergers, autism, whatever. I don't find it fair that I got in when my mental health wasn't even that bad, but these things happen I suppose.

Help.

We sit down at a table that had a perfect view of the television and I stared at this soccer game that was going on. Meanwhile, my girl is filling out the application. Once we’re done and we leave my girl says that if I noticed that the girl inside was interested in me. I was laughing, because I literally did not take my eyes off the television the whole time. 

Fast forward to today (Wednesday) and it’s my girls first day on the job. We agreed I would pick her up after my job ended. I got there early and just sat there in the waiting section after I saw her finishing up. There was another girl there and apparently she was the same one that was “checking me out” from last week. 

Apparently this coworker of hers asked her if I was with her. Of course she said I was her bf. Then she goes and tells her that “oh wow well he’s cute and he’s with you?” Almost trying to insinuate that she was not fit for a man like myself. Then more details came out that just made me believe that this coworker just doesn’t like my girlfriend because she’s new at this job. 

One thing that leads me to believe this is just petty jealousy is how this coworker has only been working there for a month. Now that my younger and more innocent looking girlfriend is getting all this attention from guys, she feels envy. 

My girlfriend doesn’t believe me though and I wish I knew what advice to give her other than “ignore her”.

I had to take out a loan because I couldn't pay my rent. I finally got a new job in November only to loose it in December right before Christmas. I've been looking for work since. I'm out of money, rent was due on the 5th. I'm trying to stave off my landlord until my tax return comes in and hope I can get worked before next months rent is due. I've been at my parents house for the last week because I had no money to buy food and they have been extremely supportive. But I'm running out of options. They gave me the option to move back in with them until I can get myself sorted, but my younger brother has also given me the same offer. However, he lives halfway across the state from our hometown. At this point I'm fairly sure I'm going to have to give up my apartment, but I'm not sure which offer is better for me. On one hand, my parents are already struggling financially and I'm afraid I would just make things worse and when I do eventually find work again I know more of my money is going  to end up helping them rather than fixing my situation, but they are my parents in a familiar place. But on the other my brother lives in a town I'm not familiar with, but would offer me a fresh start. I would be living with him, his girlfriend, and a friend of theirs from college, all of which are 100% onboard for helping me out.

She didn't even listen to me and my brother stood there with a smirk while I was on the verge of tears. I'm just so over it. I dont understand why my mum hates me so much.

259,"So I’m a 28 year old male and I have a very large appartement with three bedrooms, it’s pricey but not much more than the bachelor I was renting before (it’s all inclusive) and it’s much nicer. It’s 850$ a month. 
I have been living alone for about 6 months now since I broke up with my ex. It’s the first time I have lived alone and I really enjoy it even though the rent is a bit more than I want to spend. 

This guy I used to work with needs a place for the next 4 months and he has 2 dogs, I have a cat. My parents think I should rent him a room to save some money but I really don’t want to have to worry about my cat when I’m at work and not making too much noise when I’m home.

260,"When I graduated high school I invited all my friends (they were a year younger than me) to my graduation party it was going to be a fully friend based event so I couldn't exactly do it without them. They all said ""Of course we'll go"" the day of the event I wake up to find a text from everyone of them with an excuse as to why they couldn't go. I had to cancel the event and was bummed the entire day. 

A year later I invited them all to my birthday party and again I get a general ""of course I'll go!"" or ""I can't go but we'll go out together sometime to celebrate it!' which I thought was great. And again as the days led up to the event everyone canceled except one person. My family was with this event too so I didn't really have to cancel but again it stung. Like they can't make time for me. I just assume that they're all busy and have strict parents etc. 


Then my friends birthday comes up a couple months later and with like less than a week's notice from him they're all able to make it to his birthday party.

261,"I was reading through his post history and I don't know what to do. For some context, I'm 20 and he's 15. We both live at home with our parents and were brought up in a safe and loving environment. None of what I saw reflects that.

The subreddits he frequents include Meninism, MensRights and Feminism. He talks about his hatred for extreme feminism and people who promote equal rights. He goes on in several posts how women are ""cunts  and how they all accuse men of being rapists. The worst ones talk about how a girl showing cleavage in her profile picture is ""asking for it"" and how feminists deserve their own holocaust. It's just terrible stuff. He doesn't act like this irl at all, he has friends and hobbies just like anyone else.

I don't know what to do. I can't talk to anyone about this, if I tell our parents they'll kill him and I think he'll hate me for the rest of his life.

263,"Idk if this is the right place to post this

I wouldnt say I'm an emotionally irrational person, but I am sensitive and feel as though I am very vulnerable to how bad things can get. Seeing people in pain, seeing loved ones struggling, comprehending death and tragedy, etc make functioning hard as hell for me. Mostly, it is EXTREME unasked for empathy that *never* shuts off. You know how psychopaths have no empathy and can never turn it on, so it damages them? I'm the opposite. Empathy never shuts off.

I feel as though I take way too much raw, candid reality in without necessarily trying to. Others' emotions really get to me, I absorb them, carry their weight on my shoulders, and I have a hard time letting go. I see sadness, heavy contemplation, fear on others and it all gets plopped on my shoulders when I dont want it to and when no one even asked me to hold it.

I would say most of my brain rests in this place that is seriously morbid and sad, and I have the hardest time getting out of it. Metaphorically, I feel as though I am always living in a coroner's morgue with all of these dissected, splayed out bodies. They're open, real, tangible, and there are so many of them. Every detail of the naked, dead bodies just blazoned in this unflattering white light. And theres no door to get out of the room. I feel as though I see and feel way too much- more than most would- and there is no stop to it. I'm stuck there. I see it all. All the time. It's my autopilot.

That's the best I can get into it without writing too much. Questions are welcome.

Anyway, it can get so hard to cope with that I fall back into drinking or other unhealthy or obsessive coping mechanisms. The only thing that releases me is very unhealthy coping mechanisms.

I kid you not, this ""morbid autopilot"" takes so much control of my life (Note: I have OCD so that's part of it) that i'm literally basing my career and schooling choice on it. I want to be a mortician for a plethora of reasons, but I realize I am so used to morbid autopilot that it's all I know. I realize I practically wrap myself in it from my hobbies, to my college choices. I dont know anything else, and I dont know what to do.

I don't even have a reason to feel this way! None of it has to do with me. I'm concerned for others and carry this weight I dont need to carry. I wish I could let go. I don't know what to do.

I attend Uni, study and do whatever else I need to do, thanks to my trusty planner. However whenever I have free-time, I’ll most likely turn on my computer find a game and do that and spend whatever time I have doing that.

268,"Tl;dr: some lady stole my stepdad’s pixel from his driveway when he stepped away and I’m pissed at her but we can’t do anything because she disappeared. Fuck that bitch. I just had to vent and any advice on how to feel would be great. 

Hey as the title says my stepdad’s phone was stolen today from his driveway. He lives on a busy street and was working on bricking it today as it was lightly raining. I feel like he had been kind of frustrated lately so he took off today from the office and didn’t say bye or where he was going but just went to work on the house. Anyways, as he was there, he walked away for a moment after interacting with this woman who we think was homeless. She was talking to him and he went into the side yard and into the house for a minute, she took his phone that under the tarp in the driveway where he was working. 

We the video proof as evidence, from multiple driveway cams, that show she had walked over to one side to look at the garage and make sure he was out of visual distance, then she walked over to where he was working, stopped, stood there for a moment and then bent down to steal his phone and walked away putting it in her handbag as she did. He showed up to our office a few minutes later saying it was stolen and gave a description of who took it so we checked the cameras and sure enough we can plainly see the person he’s described stealing his phone off the ground.

For me, i get he shouldn’t have left it there, but i struggle deeply to tell him things because he gets easily offended and said himself he can’t stand other people telling him to do something. He has had multiple issues i can think of where he can’t find his wallet, keys or phone and i just want to say to him now that i always keep my wallet and keys and phone in my front pocket so i have them safe at all times, but i feel it’s too late now without him getting upset or annoyed for me to tell him.
 
He was upset about the phone, but didn’t file a report as far as i know just immediately went to order another phone. 

I mean we looked all around, up and down the streets, but by the time we started to really search it was too late and she was gone. 

Don’t know where she went but she could be anywhere locally. She must have turned off the phone too because the tracking was the last place it was stolen from, making me think it’s not the first time this person has taken someone else’s property.

She may well be homeless, and this was harmless theft, but the principle of stealing someone else’s personal item from their personal property makes me so fucking disgusted and furious i can’t stand that bitch for what she did. I wish there was a way to broadcast her description and find her to get her arrested because that shit is so dumb. Like what the fuck.

I just want advice on how to feel and what to do. I feel like I’m just going to be constantly looking hard at everyone i see waking nearby in the area to see if it’s the person we have on camera so i can confront her, but i know the odds of that are slim to none and i don’t want  to spend so much of my attention on that. I don’t want to, i wish i could let it could and ill probably stop thinking about it soon, but it’s one of those things i wish didn’t happen and sucks that it did and is best t just move on. 

Despite what i just said, in terms of effort and attention, a part of me also wants to plaster pictures of the thief up and down our neighborhoods, this just shirt if knocking on everyone’s door and showing them what she looks like from our cameras and asking if anyone remembers seeing anything. It’s too late and nobody’s going to remember anything, maybe someone might but just such slim odds.

Just to give a little background and I’m not trying to boast but at our company we hire some pretty talented people and during review time they urge us to be very careful with selecting “exceeds expectations” because even “meets expectations” is a good score. I work very hard at my job and it also just happens to be my passion / hobby, I am a maker and entrepreneur when I’m not at my 9 to 5.

Alright for the main event, every Monday we have an all hands engineering meeting where our SVP wastes an hour of our time.

He then passively told his direct reports (my boss and others) that they should change their employees reviews to all reflect “meets expectations” he said this in a room of 30 engineers who’s promotions and bonuses depend on this review.

i know it being night is not a good excuse for a lot of things but i live with my family that would kill me if i make a noise at night. also duh everything is closed.

so i literally pace my room thinking and pumping myself up for all the great things to get moving and forward in my life at 2 am. i am awake i am excited. i feel like i can accomplish all my goals. i feel nothing but positivity. i make a complete list of all the things ill get done tomorrow! but when i wake up in the morning i feel exhausted. all my anxiety hits me like a ton of bricks and all my motivation disappears. i usually spend 3 hours in bed or sleep an extra 5 hours... which yes is very concerning. and when i finally get up i cant bring myself to leave the house and usually its already to late in the day to really do any of the things i want to do.

its definitely my anxiety. 

i spend a lot of time by myself. i keep my family arms length away because they are toxic and i dont have friends. ill just be blunt lol. and the reason i bring that up is because no i dont have people to help me with this. no one to motivate me during the day. 

an also i sleep through my 100s of alarms or even people coming to wake me up. someone could tell me the house is on fire and id probably be like ""k cool"" ill be awake for a second and ill remember opening my eyes but ill instantly be asleep again. NOT actually claiming i have any disorder but does anyone else struggle with that? its VERY annoying. i miss out on a lot because i just wont wake up when someone is trying to wake me. familys going to breakfast and invite me? of course i wanna go! but i cant physically get up.

ive been to therapist in the past and yes they say i suffer from anxiety. shit i already know. i know what bothers me, i know what and why im scared of this and that. and honestly im tired of letting this mental anxiety ruin my life. i know i can be better. i know i can over come and face whatever these fears are of mine but i physically cant do it. is it something i should see a psychiatrist for and get medicated or is it peer laziness? am i so accustomed to how my life is that my body/sub conscious just wont physically let me do the things i need to do?  but shouldnt i, my whole being, my fire filled passion for wanting and needing more in life be enough to over come whatever the bullshit my anxiety or sub conscious is?

279,"My roommate is really starting to get on my nerves and I wanna hear some opinions of if I'm overreacting to things or if he's the one being insensitive. 

If he were just my roommate (for university double room dorms, so we literally sleep 2 feet away from each other), I'd be able to just like filea complaint or like tell him off, because I don't care what he thinks.... but the thing is he is also my pal and he hangs out in the same friend group as me and I like him outside of being a roommate so idk. Even if he wasn't my friend though, I'd still like to know what you guys think.

So here are the things that he does that annoys me:

- Gets mad when I do homework late in our room (preventing sleep), and so I changed my schedule so I study late in the library. But when he has an assignment due, he pulls an overnighter in our room. To be fair (and these little ""to be fairs"" are why I'm posting these) it is easy for him to say that he isn't being loud, which he isn't I guess, but I am a sensitive sleeper, and I can't deal with the loud click-clack of a keyboard, or him slamming his metal water bottle on the wooden desk every 5 minutes. And I also wake up every time he slams the door coming back from finally washing up.

- He always throws out food in our trash instead of throwing it out in the floor kitchen. Really stinks up our room. Am I being too picky?

- Just has a really messy room. Never does his laundry so his clothes start to reek after a while.

- When I take a nap, even if I tell him that I am going to take a nap before, he howls at funny things he sees on his phone, slams his water bottle down like I mentioned, shakes his protein shaker, etc.

- And then just little things that bug me that I'm not sure is an effect of the other things he does or if they're annoying themselves but just things like plucking on the guitar in the half hour I want to read a textbook before I leave for campus, drying his hair like 15 minutes before I'm supposed to wake up, etc.

I don't think I can explode at hime because we're in the same friend group, plus I'm actually living with him with our friends next year (separate rooms though so it'll be fine then), and I've told him so many times about the things I don't like but he just literally seems to not have the capacity to understand.

I would get an interview from time to time, but I would end up sabotaging myself by not preparing for them. I completely stopped sending any apps after my last interview, which was in December.

There really is no excuse for what I've done. I don't believe I have depression, I was simply unmotivated and kept procrastinating on my applications. 

Only fairly recently have I regained any motivation and started sending out applications again. In the unlikely case I get any interviews, I would like to know how to explain why I have no work history after college. 

Should I even waste my time applying for relevant positions, or should I just go into retail so I have some work experience?",14Feb2019,1

290,"tldr: I have a lot of passions and things I want to do for myself and I live in an abusive environment wich led me to not know how to take care of myself or keep healthy habits but I want to get started in life somewhere and need advice.

Background:
(23M) from Brazil

Have an abusive family that consists of 4 women that are extremely pushy to be around (mom sister grandmother and Aunt). Only man in the family so I'm expected to do all the physical work/ everyone has extremely high expectations hoping I'll get into a career that can support everyone. Denying said abuses results in manipulation/ damage of anything I might own/physical violence. We pay the bills mostly using their retirement money and sometimes I have to come up with money  because they make extra expenses ie purses clothing expensive food.

I have a really heavy chronic depression Wich has been diagnosed 6 years ago. Tried to commit suicide twice. Have been to psychologists and psychiatrists alike several  times. 8 professionals that I have started going to and eventually stopped for financial and emotional reasons ( last one literally cried in front of me saying my life was too sad  and extremely heavy for me to deal with  because my family was not willing to change or stop trying to control my life even with a professional telling them to try)

Depression started 6 years Ago with a lot of burdens being thrown at me when I finished high school because my family really pushed me to have a good paying job and stay around to support everyone. Reason that kept me from being physically/mentally healthy to try to work and despite all that managed to get in and dropped out of college/University twice. And sometimes I feel like this routine I'm in and a job would be too much stress for me to handle,yet I'm willing to try.

Going through this sort of problems made me want to live  on the streets twice. I was never able to go through with it because I can't take care of myself  (as in I wouldn't be able to beg people for food and things or make anyone feel sorry for me) so i know that I would most likely let myself starve to death.

Most tests I did with psychologists labeled me as an INTJ. I don't have Friends because I have a really hard time trusting and keeping in touch. Even though I know most people around are really nice and willing to help.
. Most friends or girlfriends I have left me (mostly cheating or using me in some shape or form , wich really made me have a need for trust and safety). Feel like I'm a burden for everyone even tho every person I meet tells me it's not the case (probably due to how I'm treated in my house).

Recently my grandmother had an accident and is on a wheelchair. My family members usually like to keep her around  but when it comes to taking care of her or taking her places it's up to me (not that they aren't able to, just that they expect me to because I'm the only person around that my grandmother doesn't hate and again.. I'm the ""man of the house"" so I should do all that).

My biggest issue is that due to all mentioned above I really struggle to feel like I'm worth something . Taking care of myself is one of my biggest problems  and living in general, but I didn't give up yet.

Sometimes I get sensitive about myself because I Know I need and deserve to take care of myself better. It's gotten to a point where every single piece of clothing I own is 3+ years old and worn out/full of holes, and I know I need new stuff I have savings to get something but I just can't feel I'm worth enough to spend my own money or go out to look for stuff. In fact, only in the last 5-6 months I started feeling like this basic need was something I deserved.

I have a normal body type and i have heard compliments a few times I know I'm able to live a normal life.I just really can't feel that when I look at myself because of how my daily life is.

I have some savings but it isn't enough to live by myself until I get a job.Don't have a say on how money is spent around here so I usually just have to deal with whatever is decided out of panic.

Usually spend free time trying to cope and sometimes i play games on my PC/ learning something I probably won't be able to apply/ watch movies animes or whatever

As for good things:

I like making content (used to be active on YouTube/twitch)

I like helping people in general. I feel like even though my life sucks others don't have to go through the same so whenever i meet someone that needs help getting their sh*t together i do whatever I can to help. ( My ex gf for example, helped her deal with family issues and get into a University/feeling better for herself)

 I think I'm funny... Sometimes? 

 I love learning specially languages, really like to get deep into whatever I decide to learn. I have patience ( I mean it took me all this to really feel hopeless and try to get help anywhere and everywhere I can) . 

I have some interests in psychology and literally everything computer related. I think Making myself better is the best thing I can do when Im in a good mood.
 
I also like cooking sometimes. Usually doesn't work at home because I don't have the chance to go grocery shopping for everyone.

***So any of you have advice on how I can start taking better care of myself in this environment and what can I do to break out of it? I would really like to be able to learn more and work, have my own place and not having to deal with all this. I have trouble knowing where or how to start since every day  I go through the same stress.

Ps.: Holy sh*t this post is huge. If you read all this and you're still willing to type something on the comments pay yourself on the back. Thanks. Also I'm not sure if this post is better suited here or somewhere else so let me know.

291,"
Ok, so half a year ago I got the job that I always wanted. When I was being interviewed my now-boss kept talking about how great it is that I don't just stand by when co-workers are having problems with each other. I knew this was a red flag. But this was my dream job we are talking about, so I thought to myself it couldn't be that bad.
 
 

Team consists of 5 people. M30, M32, M45, M55 (not their exact ages, but you kinda get the idea) and me. The two younger ones are geeky and they are the ones that I met first. We got along great. On behalf of the older coworkers they just told me that I shouldn't always listen to them. That I should try to get my own experience. I didn't know what they meant by that and they just switched the topic. But I learned it on my third day. The oldest guy comes in. Boss asks me to stick with him as he is the one who has worked here for the longest time. Right in the first 30 minutes of talking and getting to know each other he starts to talk about the younger co-workers. That they are too stupid to do their job. And too lazy to get their asses up. That they never help and show no motivation to learn something new.
 
 
I was shocked. My motivation dropped hard. The other senior co-worker got back to work as well. He was even worse. I hated working with them as they would both go on about how terrible the younger coworkers are. But my boss wanted me to stick with the seniors... After 6 weeks my boss got back to work from vacation. I talked to him about this situation. He went like ""I don't care"" and just left. I was... stunned, shocked and pissed.
 
 
 
The next day he approached me, apologized for his behavior and said he wanted to talk. Well, turns out that this situation was kind of the main reason why he hired me. He was hoping a woman in the team might help. As I added in my application that I can't stand squabbles and will try to fix those... well he thought I was a perfect fit. Mind you, we are working in development department and my job description is long enough. Dealing with conflicts with my co-workers because my boss doesn't care enough... I could handle that, if it were small disputes, but not something this huge. This was a generational conflict.
 
 
 
The seniors thought the juniors are lazy because the juniors were trying to be as efficient as possible. They rearranged several processes which made work for all of us much easier. But the seniors didn't like the changes... because it was new and the juniors were the ones who created it. So in their eyes this couldn't be good, right?
 
 
 
I had a few more talks with my boss about this. And he eventually got all of us on a table so we could talk things through. One of the juniors and me had written down some stuff that we wanted to talk about... We didn't even get that far. The seniors kept talking all over us. Our boss didn't care and didn't stop them. All he did was make some BS new rules that didn't have anything to do with the dispute.
 
 
 
Things still got better. Not because of this meeting - it actually got worse after that. But because we got a new project and the guy who was in charge for this project was an utter disaster. He lied to our faces, never took advice and so on. Our team finally got together and the guys started talking to each other. Because we had a common enemy. Since that project started the team grew closer and I am really happy about that. It's so nice to hear that one of the juniors sat down with the seniors to teach them about using OneNote. I am so proud of them!
 
 
 
But there is still one big problem: Our boss and his style/lack of leadership. You got a problem that requires more from him then just making one(1) phone call? He'll most likely try to change the topic, he'll have a ""very important meeting"" or he will try to make you do all the work yourself. There are news to tell? If it's good news he'll be right there and tell you about it - in a way that makes it seem like you have to be thankful. If it's bad news he will send someone else to tell you.. or maybe he'll completely forget about informing you. And he shows almost no interest in the work of our team. He also doesn't care about or health. (have been working with some experimental operating materials without any work clothes that would protect us. I asked him for working trousers, just plain and simple trousers that wouldn't even keep me safe from that stuff but at least I would stop ruining my jeans... He answered with a strict ""no"" and left right away.)
 
 
I know I can go to several higher instances. And I do have some good connections. If I wanted to I could raise hell. But that's not who I am. He wanted me in his team so I'd try to fix problems that the co-workers have? Well I can do that. Three of my co-workers already talked about leaving this team because they can't stand it for much longer. I think we would be a great team now that the seniors understood that the juniors are not lazy nor stupid.



All we need is a better boss who cares about us and won't run from work and responsibility. If he'd care more for us he might finally take some time to actually listen and act. We have an idea that would save is a lot of time and work. We talked to him about it, but he didn't listen. So one of the juniors sat down, wrote it all down and made it an official improvement proposal. Now it is in our companies system and our boss has to deal with it in some way. But it is so sad to see that he cares so little about this team. He has a department with about 25 workers, our team has a special task and that might be the reason why he cares so little. Because theoretically we work in a similar field... but practically it is very different from what the rest of the department is doing.
 
 
TLDR: Boss hired me to fix discourse between co-workers. Everything is better now. But we are very unhappy with our boss. He doesn't listen and doesn't care about our work, our health, our ideas. He hired me to fix discourse? Well that's what I'm gonna do. I wanna talk to him about this.
 
 
So how can I talk to this guy? Is there anything that I could say to shake him enough for him actually start thinking about his actions? If all of this will have no effect I am willing to go for one of my other options. But for now I just want to talk to him and give him a chance to change his ways. As a person he is easy to talk to but having him as your boss is so frustrating.

292,"I have been framed of theft at my university dorms by one of my psychotic roommate. 

Roommate (2) lost something of value and it was found in my room in the most revealing area ever. After asking around, it was obvious someone planted there when I left for my lectures. It also became apparent that my roommate (1) did it. I know this because: 1. he is convinced I stole it (even though it’s not his item and supposedly he knows nothing of the circumstance), 2. he conveniently mentioned to the dean that his stuff is missing, and escalated the issue, 3. We had a significant conflict earlier the day, 4. He confronted me about it, which later ends up him saying no one will suspect him, and I am the key suspect to the “theft” going around, 5. He’s the only one very agitated about this situation, even hostile towards me.

295,"(*Throwaway for the sake of protecting the recommenders identity*)

I’m currently going through the process of applying to transfer from my current university to a conservatory, and as the title says, I just found out yesterday that one of my recommenders didn’t submit the letter that was due January 15th. I first asked them for it in mid October, they confirmed, I reminded them several times, and followed up on the due date. 

On January 8th, I got two emails from the conservatory saying that my recommender submitted their letter. Naturally, I assumed that both letters had been submitted (as two were required). However, last night I was glancing over my application and saw that one was never submitted. 

I went through my email to check for the confirmation, and found that I had just gotten the same email twice, for some reason. 

So at this point, I’m panicking. I don’t even know how to bring this up with the admissions office, and my audition is in a couple of days. I was so excited to get past prescreening, and I really don’t want it to go to waste because of an incompetent professor.

299,"I feel like a terrible person.

For some context this time last year I moved in with my boy friend at the time. (I've ranted about him before and I'll make it quick this time). He was sweet, kind and a hard worker, but that changed when I moved in with him.

He would control my money even though I worked more hours and made a bit more. He wouldn't enough clean, if he thought he was doing enough cleaning. The amount I did must have been godly to him and he never thanked me or anything. Eventually I did the same amount as him. Then the house went down hill. And so did the relationship. 

Also him and my fam got in a fight a couple of times. He kept telling me to defend him coz he my bf. Even though he was in the wrong. Or atleast 6 other people saw so lol There were alot of other issues. I'm just keeping this short.

Basically when we broke up I got the house. My sis moved in. I was still so distraught by what the man did to me. Beforr this I thought I was falling for him (I'm a naturally careful person and relationships take me a long time to get into) and then he changes. I don't trust people the same now. 

I've been so horrible to people. Snapping and yelling At my sister. She has autism and eplysepy  so she get money from the government and has helped with the rent. But due to her disabilities and medication she can get quite weak.

I only realised this now, I've been told but haven't rly believed it. She looks and acts normal alot, but she's not. I'm not her friend or anything, I'm a carer it seems. She needs looked after, not what I'm doing. 

I yell at her coz house work isn't done. In my defence the one thing I ask is the kitchen is clean to cook in. I'm lucky if that is done. But my mum keeps telling me sometimes it's too much for her. 

According to my sister people are saying I've changed. I'm so nasty and quick to angry. Before I was timid and barely said a word. They tell me I'm strong for not letting people walk over me anymore. But I only act like thus with people I care about people who are dickhead at work ect I let walk all over me coz I'm still the timid child deep down. I'm just worse than before coz I'm still chicken shit  but I'll tell and try to get my own way with people I know I can get away with. I think.

I dunno if I'm horrible and I expect alot. Maybe I do. I feel like that right now. My mum says we are both depressed ( I was diagnosed with it when I was about 16 but thought I got over it, and then I was diagnosed with anxiety at about 19 or 20? I think). Because we might both depressed we are lazy and nasty. 

So I am moving back to my parents house. I feel terrible. My parents want me back home, so I've made so many people including myself miserable. The constant fights with my sister, talking to my mum about it, worrying people. Me and my sis being scared some nights coz we are two young women on your own. I've put everyone through hell coz I'm going through hell. And that's unfair. 

I feel horrible for what I've done. I just don't wanna go back home. I fell like going home is saying u can't do this, that I'm not the perfect daughter I need to be. I wanna go back to the time I was home and never met that horrible man. I dunno how to move forward. I'm not heartbroken by the break up, I'm so effected by the fact I was with him... I dunno what to do. 

Sorry this is long. I tried keeping this short. There's alot going on and I dunno what to do. I've talked about this man alot to people and I can't get over this. And when I try to get help my doctor told me off and said we only and 10 mins you have too many issues to help you today. I don't wanna go back. I don't like talking to people coz I instantly cry lol I can't stop it. Also I don't wanna seem weak. I wanna stay strong and angry and weak and sad looking. 

They small amount of times I thought about getting help again or talking to lifeline or something. But I feel like there's glass in the way and my body is heavy. Like a literal weight is holding me down. I just don't know what's my issue.",14Feb2019,1

303,"So a friend of mine texted me today about watching a film in my house (which I share with my SO). We've been meaning to watch a film since we bought a projector last year and her kid loves geeky movies. She's a single mum and has been dating a pretty unstable guy (her words not mine). Since I have nothing against him, when she asked last minute if she could bring him along, I said ""No problem"".


According to her, this guy comes from a pretty well off family that has recently come by some money problems due to some really bad investments and is currently struggling to make ends meet.


My SO and I are very private people, but we are welcoming to people as long as they are somewhat part of our close circle of friends.
Anyhow, they arrived somewhere around 11 with fresh popcorn and beer (my SO and I rarely drink alcohol).


This guy kept asking questions about the house, how many rooms the house had, whether we lived with more people, etc, etc. We both felt those where significant red flags, almost burglary type questions, but decided it we were being paranoid.


We started watching the film, and he kept going downstairs by himself. At first, I thought he was feeling sick and needed the restroom but then realized he was going outside leaving my front door open in order to smoke. 
What is more, he opened my fridge as if it was his house without our permission.
I found all of it pretty rude behaviour for a guest and specially for one that a) we had never met and b) was the first time coming to our house.


My SO and I, just happen to travel tomorrow for 4 days and all we can think about is that our house might be broken into.

306,"Hi, this is my first time asking for advice on Reddit. Thanks, for viewing my post and giving your advice. A little background on me, I am in my final two years of high school and have Aspergers, as a result, I am a very socially awkward kid. A lot of friends would describe me as socially naive, a pushover and weird often times. I am a pretty nerdy kid but I look like one of the jocks, so people tend to think that I am one of the popular kids upon their first impression, although I am not. However, my best friend, Mike is extremely popular, and he is extremely charming and handsome and is well liked by everyone. We have nothing in common, except that I help tutor him in his subjects, and because I don't have many friends, I am always free to help him whenever he needs me. In return, he always has my back, and would never let anyone bully me.

The problem I faced started when I invited this new kid to join me and my friend. He seemed so scared and shy, and I felt sorry for him. So I invited him over to sit with me. We will name him Jake, not his real name. My best friend, didn't want to talk to him, Mike sometimes does that, he gets tired of having to talk to everyone now and then due to his popularity and just wants to zone out. He calls it putting on his best face when meeting new people, he just wasn't in the mood for that. So Mike asked me to sit in between him and the new guy, so that he won't have to introduce himself to him. Jake, on the other hand, overheard our conversation, and he was so angry. During class, when I sat in between them, Jake cast angry glances at us both, I am guessing he was jealous at my best friend and me. We did laugh the whole time in class. It should be important to note, that Mike and I had a disagreement over a mutual friend and had been cold to each other the whole week. During class, he tried his best to cheer me up with jokes, to make amends. I have only met Jake for less than an hour, and I felt something off about him, almost as if he had sworn vengeance over this minor incident.

I was right, the next day, Jake took it upon himself to sit right smack between me and Mike. I was quite shocked by this disruption of social norms and I thought he was being so rude. He didn't even say hi to me, but immediately started talking to Mike, about jokes he read online. He went on and on even during the lecture, to Mike's consternation. He tried to sit in between us in every class, but Mike stopped him, but allowed him to sit between us during the first class on Monday. It should be important, to note, that both Mike and Jake are Chinese, I am not, and they spoke Chinese. One way Jake tried to leave me out of the conversation was by always talking in Chinese. Whenever I talked in English with Mike, Jake would hijack the conversation and switch to Chinese. I have no idea why he does these, to be honest.

Mike hated Jake a lot, and was furious at his attempts to come between us, but something happened that changed the whole dynamic of our group. Mike found his first love and they became one of those lovey-dovey couples. All Mike could think about was his girlfriend, he really didn't care about anything else. With his new rosy-tinted world view, he felt like giving Jake a chance. Jake seized the opportunity without fail, he soon started sitting between me and Mike in almost every class. At its worst, when Mike and I were walking down a corridor talking, Jake saw us, and ran towards us and push me aside to squeeze right between us. I was shocked by his sheer audacity. Mike was very angry but he did nothing. Mike said that Jake was strange and we should just let him be, Mike didn't want to escalate the situation any worse, he did hate confrontation and drama a lot. He also felt that Jake wasn't worth arguing with. Mike always tried to maintain his neutrality on any sides. 

When Jake found out that I tutored Mike, he tried to position himself as being a better student than me, he was not. I admit the ensuing drama, caused a lot of stress on me, and my grades fell. Jake quickly took to pointing out to Mike that he had better results and would be a better tutor. I cried a lot, I have never felt so hurt by the utter betrayal. I can't believe someone would be jealous of my friendship with Mike, that he would try to destroy it. I don't have many friends as someone who suffers from Autism, I can't believe what I was facing. Mike ignored him and said nothing, but it didn't stop Jake from continuously hounding Mike for the chance to be his tutor. Jake even tried to organize gatherings and leave me out with the help of his friends. It never succeeded, because Mike knew what they were planning from the start and refused to have any part in it.

Overall, I tried to convince Mike to leave Jake, and stopped being friends with him for all his troubles. I wanted things to go back the way they used too. Mike refused, saying he didn't want to start a war. The problem, is Jake keeps on encroaching every day, trying to get closer and closer to Mike. I admit, Mike eventually became friendlier to Jake and they even had genuine moments of friendships. What really bugs me, is that Jake keeps on sitting between me and Mike, every single day!!! It is driving me nuts, what he is doing to me. There is no point talking to Jake, Mike and I tried to reason with him, that his behavior is unacceptable, and that he should stop sitting and coming in between us. But it fell on deaf ears, Jake was only interested in becoming best friends with Mike. He ignored us, and continued sitting between us in most classes throughout the week.

As I write this, I have become completely devastated by this turn of events. I have become very depressed, I can't sleep or eat that much, knowing that every single day of school is going to be filled with hurt and betrayal. Mike and Jake are getting closer while I am drifting apart from Mike. I know Mike and I are still best friends, but I am very disappointed that he won't take a more serious stance against Jake. I can't hang out with my other friends, because I don't have any other friends who will tolerate my Autism, the way Mike does. I don't know what to do anymore, I am such a loss, on how to handle Jake. ",14Feb2019,1

309,"Hello redditers!

Today I have quit my job, from Monday I will be registered as unemployed. I got enough bullshit for working and being commanded by boses. I told myself that me as a music producer can make music and start selling it.

My plan:

1. Find a part time job to fulfill my basic needs such as food and rent.

2. In free time I want to write a website and finish my own brand design.

3. Start uploading my music as well as selling mine music production for vocalists.

4. Also I want occasionally to buy and sell things to get few bucks if I won't be in mood to make music.

5. I have detailed plan, and I know it won't work probably as I planned, but at least I have few points I have hold onto.

I feel pretty confident as I know my music production isn't that bad, I know it is not the best either. I have everything I need to sell and produce my music so I think I will reach my goals and in the end of the year I will be able to sell only beats and live from money I will make from music. 

I know it will be hard but I only hope for the best as life fucked me in the ass multiple times. Hopefully it won't in this case :D

310,"All my life I’ve always had shitty school attendance. It’s been because of my horrible anxiety and laziness.

This year because of my disabilities (anxiety) the school has been nice enough to give me the chance of free driving lessons, and a program to help me get a job. I already have a job and my permit. I was going to go to driving school anyways to help me get my license, but it’s very very expensive and I honestly don’t think I can afford it, so free lessons would be nice.

Last night I didn’t sleep at all. I want to stay home today because of that. I also look like actual garbage and I don’t want people to see me this way. (Despite spending 40 minutes getting ready)

Yesterday I missed school because I had a dentist appointment, which is pretty far away, and the complete opposite direction of my school. Monday I missed school because? I forgot honestly lol.

Last quarter I missed 20 days and still made honor roll. I am great at school academic wise and great at catching up on work. I just can’t seem to get myself there.

I’m on meds, been to therapy, been homeschooled, been to alternative schools, been to a mental hospital, and nothing’s worked.

My mom said if I stay home today then I’ll have to quit my job, even though I haven’t got hours in weeks so that literally doesn’t correlate whatsoever. I’m staying home anyways because of how horrible I look, I just can’t bear for people to see me.

Anyways, how do I go to school before I get kicked out and fail? ",14Feb2019,1
311,"Maybe not in the conventional sense, I have a full time job— I work about 50 hours a week— and a car. I live with my folks, however... though that is probably more normal for people my age (I’m 22) when I look at my small friend group, pretty much all of them have moved out. 

Furthermore, most of them are in relationships. If not, then they are surely talking to someone. I’m not. Its been two years since I last got laid. I’ve had opportunities in the mean time, but for one reason or another I fuck it all up. 

My hobbies include: video games, smoking a lot of weed and building stupid little gundam models for kids. I hate that I enjoy building them.... but I do. Thats pretty much it. 

I do have depression thats gone untreated other than my excessive smoking. I smoke at least once a day, usually after work. If its the weekend, 2, 3, 4, sometimes as much as 7 or 8 times a day. When I sit in my basement alone, I get in my head really bad so I just do my best to blast my sobriety into orbit and distract myself.

I do go out, actually. I have one friend who lives near me that I meet up with on weekends and we go out together.... but we don’t really do anything. We’ll hit a bar, grab two drinks, and leave within an hour or two. If I see a girl or a group of people that I would like to talk to, I will immediately start over-thinking everything and quietly claim to myself that I shouldn’t bother trying because there’s really nothing good about me anyways. That is to say, I’ve got nothing to offer her and she will just lose interest anyways.

312,"I am 26, coming from a family of 5 kids.

My parents are a financial mess and unless they win a lottery or something similar, it will only get worst for them. In a couple of years they will be totally dependent on their kids (most probably me). On the health sector things don't look any better.

My older sister (I'm a second child) married in another country and has been less present since then in our family (problems). I don't blame her, but that's a fact.

My other sister has made a mess out of her education, finances and generally her life. It's nothing appalling but she won't be able to walk on her own feet for a while, metaphorically speaking. She has a boyfriend who supports her but he isn't much better.

My oldest brother is 19, very responsible and applying for universities. However he is partly  dependent on me financially and oftentimes emotionally and in decision-taking. Also he is quite ambitious. Therefore he has turned the idea of his educational plans not going as he wants to in some kind of daily tragedy. His worst case is not that bad tbh.

My youngest brother is a good kid (doesn't get into trouble and is caring), but I am uncertain of his future.

I was never the most promising child. Compared to my oldest sister and oldest brother who are excellent students, hardworking, competitive and ambitious, dutiful and responsible, conventional and traditional, I looked like a tramp. However I led a generally responsible life, made few stupid things (which I hid from the others and solved by myself) and a few smart choices. Right now I am the most stable of the kids, or at least that is what it looks like.

However, the thing is I only finished my bachelor's degree and, despite my desire, the chances of having a master's degree seem really slim. I am an emotional mess ( always been extra sensitive, a bit needy and maybe even irrational and unstable). I am socially inhibited, filled of mistrust towards others, self doubt and self-loathing. Career-wise I am stable, but very dissatisfied and feeling stuck. Romantically, the most experience I have had was a forced date with a friend's friend, which I ended as soon as I could.

When I think of the future I only see problems, hardships and a mess. When I look at the present I see a bunch of people unable to get a grip of their lives, with me in the center - the queen of incapables. I think my whole life is going to be like this, all alone and taking care of my and my family's problems. All the while they will keep saying how good I have it.

The worst part is that I know there are so many people with much bigger hardships and worst odds, that thoughen up and get things done. Me, instead, I am just an irresponsible, whinny disgrace that can't pull her shit together while judging everybody else.

316,"Tldr: Am I fucking weird?!

This is my first ever post and also on mobile. (Do with this information as you will.)

I normally wouldn't ever feel subjected enough to ask Internet strangers for advice but here we are. Because last night this same inquiry became my raison d'etre for the forth coming time being. 

Im having a deep Devils Advocating style conversation with a friend in distress in a local bar near to us towards the end of the night where in the convo (to deter from the seriousness) I just mention my philosophy that ""one can't have it all, we aren't built to house a full deck of cards"" and just in exasperation ""why can't I find someone??"" with no genuine expectations of an actual answer as we are just tossing grievances back and forth. To my surprise, I received an answer of ""you haven't met someone with (my) your similar eccentricities."" This took me aback and I asked ""what does that mean?"" To them rephrasing it as ""you're not normally what people expect."" I then proceeded to ask the fellow bartenders the same inquiry (bc this is a home bar that I very much so know these people for years and we are friends) and the first response was ""well you aren't normal! I mean, I wouldn't call you a basic bitch."" To my more prodding ""would you call me eccentric?""  And to my chagrin they replied ""I wouldn't call eccentricity a bad thing."" And I became therefore stunned because I haven't in my thrice decades ever been phrased this and to my perception it's not what one would consider a compliment. I find it a form of an old fashioned way of calling someone weird and off putting and peculiar, and not even complimentary. Now, I'm willing to understand that I have taken this the wrong way or have thought too deeply about it, but the matter still stands. (I recognize I don't have a lot of personal info specifically but now I don't know how one could describe themselves personally.)

320,"- To correct the title, my housemate’s girlfriends pants were found under another housemates bed.

We have been living with a slob (Lets call him Ben) for around 3 months now. After meeting him at uni we decided to take him in and his room is a pigsty (lately cleaned a bit for his parents coming around). He almost never helps with housework, misses university constantly and have just generally carried a creepy vibe. At parties he has jokingly asked couples to masturbate in front of him ‘I wont watch, i’ll just listen.’ And also upfront stated ‘How can you not want to motorboat that girl all day every day?’ I also caught him with a list of a group of friends phone passwords, when I confronted him and made him delete the page he got upset and cried and I felt guilty. This is a constant, he resorts to a weak state and you forget the person he really is.

He has no barrier, his social norms are wack and  quite frankly he’s a creep. We wanted him out. Moreso now.

Yesterday the girlfriend was grabbing bedding from upstairs and caught a glimpse of something in Ben’s room. She told me and I brushed it off saying there was no way. We devised schemes to get him out of his room to check and it became almost banter, forgetting the real creepiness of the situation. The next day he left his room and i went in to grab the item and low and behold she was right, her underwear was under the bed. Right at the tip of it. 

We confronted him about it and he put on a good show, he said he has no idea how they got there. If he was going to hide them, ‘why would I put them in such an obvious place?’ ‘You dont have to believe me but Im telling the truth, im not that kind of guy.’

I have no idea what to think. Logically, he could have picked up these pants in the washing as we all dry our clothes on two racks, but what are the chances that the piece of clothing he accidentally dropped was the girlfriends, and this piece of clothing accidentally went under the bed. The probability gets less and less.

I’d like you guys to help me come to a conclusion. Do you think he willingly took her underwear? Do you think we are horrible people for jumping to conclusions about such a creep?

321,"I think it’s insecurity along with trust issues but I’m not sure. I’ve been talking to the guy (along with seeing each other on the weekends) and we really get along well. We’re always talking to each other when we can and we always have a great time when we’re together. 

The only thing is, we haven’t established what we want from the relationship, I know that I like him and I want to be with him but I don’t know if he feels the same. I’m too scared to bring up the conversation, because I don’t want to ruin what we have. 

My issue is when he hasn’t replied to me for several hours I assume he’s with another girl and get myself worked up for nothing. Most of the time it’s because he fell asleep or was having dinner with his brother. 

Or another instance, last night, we were taking for hours and then he randomly said he was “going to fall asleep soon but will keep his phone on loud haha” I replied within 3 minutes and didn’t get a response. That was early in the night and I’ve had these irrational thoughts that he is definitely with another girl. 

I don’t get obsessive where I write him multiple times to see what he’s doing, I just start mentally torturing myself with these ideas that he’s going to play me so I should end it before he has the chance to hurt me or other ridiculous things along those lines.

326,"So this been on-going for the past three years, and I feel like that I am burning out myself trying to constantly improve myself. I have a lot of things that I want to do with, and simply don't have time due to my long hours of shift.

  
**There are three major things that is killing me in achieving my hobbies / career progression:**

1. My current workplace, I get a minimum wage which is survivable; but not something that I would like to be living off with. I am currently spend about 8-12 hours/day working a place that I ""semi"" enjoy it. I love the people, however the work is simply not for me anymore.
2. Due to stressful life, I spent most of my time binge playing games and end up feeling frustrated that I am not good at the game. I mainly play competitive games (League of Legends). 
3. I am spending money on unnecessary things: I am fully capable at cooking my own food, however I decide to order food from Uber Eats. Or buying random Udemy courses that I will go through only half of it. And paying a bunch of subscriptions, that I only use 20%; the only subscription that I use wisely is Spotify. Meanwhile, some games, Netflix and miscellaneous stuffs is just sucking up 20% of my salary monthly basis.

**More personal things:**

1. I am very unorganized person and untidy. I have about 14 Coke bottles of 1.25L sitting around my room. I have a terrible eating / drinking habit. And got a mild addiction for Coke, that I need to have a small portion of day. I am worried about my health, since I might have early stages of pre-diabetes due to large consumption of drinks. To make things worse, I have 5 bags of MacDonalds laying around my room, while I look at myself ashamed and hoping that I might clean afterwards. 
2. I've been extremely burnout from setting goals / projects that I tend never to finish them. The whole point of goals and projects that I am doing on the side, is hoping for a career change, and get myself a better life style. Yet somehow, I just feel unmotivated and uninterested.
3. I have a terrible sleeping schedule. Even though I work 5 days a week (12pm - 11pm) or sometimes even (9am - 11pm), I tend to average during workdays 4-5 hours of sleep, while on my day-offs 9-10 hours. I want to balance out, and have an average of 7 hours of sleep. I feel like the caffeine from Coke is what keeping me awake.
4. I want to go to College or even University to get a Masters' degree at Comp Science. But my fear is, how can I even pay back a student debt (my family is not willing to support me financially, so I am on my own.)? I am currently a permanent resident in Australia, and not even sure how does the student loan works. And to shame myself, I have a GPA 2.0 and graduated back in 2014.

340,"I just turned 32. Im a woman thats been in a relationship with a man since i was 19. 

Its toxic. It has had many ups and downs.
I moved away from anyone i knew, family or aquaintances when i met him. 
I have struggled to keep this relationship, and any other possible friendship, i have ruined. 
My family has all blocked me from social media, but a few. Literallly my dad, sister and one neice still talk to me.

Any relation i have had with inlaws i have ruined. 
I was the type to believe i was right. They were wrong. I believed holding high standards for people to ""act right around me"" was self love. I was incredibly judgemental and cold believing and convincing myself that it was a good thing to be that way. 
Until i looked around, no one came to my house. People stopped engaging and in fact avoided me. Would only stop in when i wasnt home. And leave when i got home.

Any coworkers i had would give each other side eyes and i just thought they were the ones with the problem.

To be honest, ive never had high self esteem. I realize the ways i was wrong. But i do not know how to just be. I believe when i try to be comfortable with myself my husband judges me. He use to say ""i cant wait for people to see how you really are""
And it made me think there was somwthing wrong with me but i didnt know what.  

I fear its too late. I feel like the relationships i have ruined.. I cant get back. 
It makes me feel so alone and sometimes i just want to hide. Disappear. 

My question or advice i am asking for, How can i turn this around?

350,"TL;DR:
I love money and want to work, but it's getting in the way of school and I don't want to just up and quit because my mom helped me get the job.

So I'm in college and I live off campus with a roommate who is my gf so I have bills and stuff. I specifically engineered my refund check from school (through scholarships and grants) to be able to cover literally ALL my half of the bills and basically most if not all other expenses. 

So during the fall everything went according to plan except I gave my mother basically 2 months worth of bills to help her out. It completely backfired because I had no income to recuperate what I gave her and so for the month of January I couldn't pay my  bills without parental loans.

I decided then I would get a job so that could never happen again. So I went and applied to almost every job I saw was hiring and was getting nothing even though the hiring managers seemed to like me.

So I complained to my mom and she talked to a friend and immediately found me a factory job that pays $12.50/hour which is awesome right? However, the hours were 5am to  5:30pm fri-sun. 

At first I'm like whatever I only have 15 hours this semester and 3 of them are labs so it should be fine. All of a sudden my advisor finds out a class(intensive writing class) I bombed my sophomore year is available again and if I got a an A or B it would really boost my gpa so I jump on the opportunity.

So I have worked the weekends a couple times and it completely wipes me out everyone kept telling me ""oh your young you won't be that tired"". I get no school work done except on Sunday. So now during the week I have been extremely anxious during the week because I need to finish all my work because sunday isn't enough for 18 hours worth of work. In the back of my mind I know the semester hasn't even picked up as far as workload. I'm worried how I will get it done then especially when I get 75% of my work on Thursday, but I can't really work Thursday night because i have to go to bed early for work.

I've gotten the suggestion for not working sundays which is what I'm trying this week. I just don't want to waste too much time figuring out work and get further behind when school is my priority. I do love money though.

Also for context my bills all together are about 500. In 1 weekend I pay make 350ish.",14Feb2019,1

She said she thinks we should just be friends but I said I didn’t want that so won’t talk to her for a while so that I can let go.
The thing is I really don’t want to stop talking to her. I really don’t want to stop hanging out and I really don’t want to stop having sex. It’s only been 6 days since I said we shouldn’t talk and I just want to go and give her a hug after work. Another idea that I’d like to do is to drop some flowers off at her door while I’m on my lunch and then just not see her after work. She’d probably know it was me though and that would just be cringey.
I know she’s been talking to some other boys, nothing serious just having fun, but it would really devastate and embarrass me if she were to go home and find those flowers and then be going out to meet another boy.

Knowing all this I woke up this morning to yelling I went down my mom and dad ware yelling the thing that hit me the most was my mom asking for Divorce papers I asked mom to sit and asked what was wrong she told me that dad was a horrible parson he demoted her self-esteem he always threatened for a divorce or to marry other women ( we are Muslims and our religion states we can marry up to 4 women ) and she said he made her fill like nothing that she was garbage I asked dad if I was true he said no  he left to take my brother to school

I've been studying Arts History in university for 3 years now and I've been feeling less and less motivated, to the point that I realized I don't like or enjoy this degree anymore. So I've been looking for other degrees that I know I'd enjoy a lot but there's one ""problem"": my parents.

It all started when I finished my first year in university. I saw what that degree was all about and told to my parents that I wanted to quit and change what I was studying because I really wasn't enjoying it that much. I gathered all the courage and told my parents that I wanted to change. I thought they would understand me but I was wrong. So to keep things short, they were mad at me, yelled, etc...
I thought I was the one who was wrong in this so I forced myself to keep on going in order to not fuck things up again at home. Then in the middle of my 2nd year I realized (again) I wasn't enjoying that degree anymore but decided to keep going rather than trying to explain the same situation and probably get yelled again.

So now, being at my 3rd year I decided enough is enough and I want to change. I tried talking to my parents about it but I don't trust them anymore about this...

We returned home from work yesterday and her friend come by to pick up a dress for her daughter who is 13, she was there for a little while and was talking and it got to the discussion of her oldest daughter, she mentioned hat her daughter doesn’t have much self esteem or self confidence, that she finds her self to not be pretty, and wishes to look like other people because they are pretty, but she isn’t, which isn’t true she’s a lovely young lady and has zero reason to even feel this way. As she was talking she mentioned about how her daughter cuts herself, that she’s been taking her to a therapist and acknowledges the situation and has seemed professional help. I know in most case the problem is believed to be internal, but I want to know if there is anything me or my wife could possibly do without it being obvious that we are aware of the situation to help, her mother is a great person, very genuine and sincere, down to earth and could talk to her about anything, and she has been a tremendous help to my wife and myself when we became first time parents and has continued to do so.

TL;DR will be at the bottom for you short readers

&amp;#x200B;

Me and two mates (lets call them jake and turner) have recently moved into a new share house living away from our parents about a month or so ago

&amp;#x200B;

Turner, whom i consider my best friend has been avoiding the house for a few weeks now and hasn't really given anyone here good reason for doing so

&amp;#x200B;

Today he finally snapped for a reason me nor jake can figure out and has left to stay with some other friends for a couple days

&amp;#x200B;

We've both tried contacting him to try and talk to him about whatever it is we've done to make him unhappy about the living situation but he won't return our calls and is totally evading the situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I've talk to a mate over at the house he's supposedly staying at and he avoided giving us reason for it too and has said that he's going to talk to us when he's ready. Which both Jake and I consider reasonable but it's also unfair on his behalf to not tell us and be petty about the entire situation by not being upfront and telling us whatever the problem may be

&amp;#x200B;

All we want to do is be nice and fix whatever problem he may have

&amp;#x200B;

Me and Jake are both at a loss for what the problem could be as we consider ourselves both quite balanced and easy to live with (clean and cook often, regular living stuff gets done regularly)

&amp;#x200B;

We usually go out of our way to make living easier with other people.. we hung out his washing and such today so it surely cannot be that we're bad flatmates.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated as long as its not ""give him time, he'll talk to you when he's comfortable"" because its ridiculous that he's staying at our friends' house talking shit about us and not to us.

378,"TL;DR at the bottom
For a little bit of context, I have been working part-time at this store for just a little under three years and I have always strive to put in a great effort into my work. I have had made mistakes in the past, but I made sure to never repeat such mistakes ever again. I rarely show up to work late, if at all. I also rarely do the bullshit 'call in sick' move just so I can go through with some plans (I ever only done it twice). I never had any conflict with any of my co-workers or the customers. I am neat, tidy, good with people, efficient with my time, and always consistent with my work. I was never one to complain or to turn down new tasks or challenges. The manager I am talking about is actually a newer manager who came in when I have already been an employee for a little over a year. He was nice and fair for the longest time up until this point.   


Now here's the deal. I started noticing this about a month ago. I became the footwear guy sometime during May of 2018 alongside another person who became an employee a little later on. This person, let's call him Dave, has only worked 8 months since the time of posting this. He also works part-time. For the longest time, Dave and I had similar work hours in a week. My availability was between 11 AM to 10 PM for almost everyday of the week so that should've allowed for more hours. Sometimes I would have more shifts and sometimes he would get that blessing of more shifts. I thought it was just a bit unfair whenever he had more hours since I had seniority over him and I had plenty of experience. Recently, Dave has been receiving more hours; and I mean MORE hours. I am only receiving 15 hours a week at best while Dave is getting upwards of 30 hours. This is bullshit because I have always caught Dave slacking, standing around, or talking with his coworker for a little longer than necessary without doing work whenever I worked the same shift as him.  


Alongside this, I have been scheduled in such a way that I never get to work with my colleagues. Let's call my colleagues K and G. I would to talk G while working and sometimes it may get a little out of hand, but G, being the responsible shift leader that he is, would tell me to do focus on my tasks at least while talking. K and I have been doing much of the same and even hung out after work a few times. Now I never get to work with them as I've noticed. Despite me having conversations with them sometimes, I would always put in effort while working and we would always team up to handle the busier days. Another one of my colleagues is a friend of mine whom we shall call R. R was actually recommended by me to work at the store and has since then been a great addition to the team. R is cheerful, good with customers, diligent, and always wears a smile.  


Another example is when I was tasked to put the new security tags through the tongue of every shoe or through the eyelets to reduce theft activity since shoplifters have always found a way to cut off the old ones. To do this, I would have to push a pin into a gray tag (the other reason for this is because the footwear section was super close to the entrance/exit and we aren't allowed to apprehend shoplifters in the act for safety reasons) ""This could potentially ruin the product and inconvenience customers"" I thought. For a few days, I put the new tags through the bottom lace of every shoe as to prevent this. My boss caught me doing this and asked why I didn't do it as he asked and I explained about how I was concerned about the product and customer inconvenience. He understood my thought process and warned me to never do it again lest I get a violation. An hour later, he still writes me up anyways because it was a breach in company policy and that it was ""nothing personal"". He needed to do it because it's just what the company wants him to do in such a situation. I admit, it was my mistake for now following orders, but a stern warning should've sufficed.  


So there it is, guys. What do I do in this situation. And before you say anything, yes I am considering getting a new job but securing one is painfully difficult because every immigrant and their mother (literally, in some cases) are getting these positions rather quickly. Good on them actually for finding a source of income so fast! I am not so lucky in this case despite being an immigrant with a PR myself haha. 

TL;DR
My boss used to be nice but then he kinda changed. I started to receive less hours while a guy who has worked a whole year and half less than me is getting more hours. I am scheduled in a way that I dont get to ever work with any of the coworkers I liked. This is all happening despite the fact that I have never had any conflicts with anyone at the store nor am I repeating any bad working habits.",14Feb2019,1

I have also completed a btech in a creative media games course which I enjoyed (it covered a wide range of different parts of the industry) I’m also unsure about what area I would want to specialise in.

The other route is becoming a counsellor/physiotherapist, preferably focusing on students/young adults, It feels like it would be a much more secure route and its something I’m interested in and I love the idea of helping people who are struggling with mental health issues, as someone who has also seriously struggled in the past. I do however have no educational experience in this field yet.

They have treated me so poorly to the point where my anxiety is so high I can’t eat or sleep. It’s my first hospitality job and they knew I didn’t have any experience. 

One of the managers has bullied me relentlessly and has told my coworkers that she hopes that I quit. So I do want to quit I can’t stand being here. 

Now what? It took me two months to find this job and now I can’t even do that right. It’s so hard finding a job in Australia as a backpacker, but I can’t go home because I will be so embarrassed. Everyone will know that I failed.

This guy, on the other hand, got the wrong idea. Keep in mind this is pretty much the first time we’ve spoken. He’s texting me the next day, offering to buy me a fake ID so I can go out with him, telling me he wants to spend a lot of money on me, even hinting at a long term relationship. 

I decided to take a look at his Facebook just to get some more context. He has some views that I consider pretty misogynistic and is very very pro 2nd amendment and seems anti Muslim (I’m South Asian). I’m kind of afraid to tell this guy no because 1. We have a class together all semester and 2. I’m not sure how he’ll react because of all of those things.

Okay so first of all, I al using an alt account because I am quite unconfident about this.

So for the past months I've been fealing like a total failure. I don't know why, but i just feel so miserable all the time.

I can't do the things I liked to do, and I'm not even passionate about them.

My  grades have gone down hill, I can't study because I find it imposible  to conentrate on anything. An this frustates me because I always had  good grades and now I am continuously failing over and over again.

I just don't now how did I end this way, I didn't experience any major changes in my life, and everything should be fine.

I  am actually scared that I might suffer from depression,or any type of  mental illnes. Also i find it impossible to talk to anyone in my family,  because I don't want to be a burden, and if I do manage to start this  conversation they just say that it's stressed, but I don't think so.

400,"Going on vacation this summer with another couple. Have been planning this trip for several months and finally set the dates and purchased tickets. I mentioned to another friend of mine the possibility of going on vacation and they were all for it. I've been friends with them for much longer than the couple already going on vacation. I think we would all have a great time, but i have some reservations...

The 2nd couple have some quirks which i can see making the vacation stressful or all together miserable. This is their first time traveling to an international country and first time on a flight. This couple does have social anxiety and i don't want them to freak out being stuck on a plane for 7 hours or in a country so far from home. The furthest they've been away from home is about 6 hours driving. They're homebodies by nature.

Whenever we go out around here, and it comes time to eat, they'll constantly argue about the place to eat because they don't like the food or the atmosphere, but we all know it's because they are cheap. And we all know they have money because they constantly brag about it. I'm not looking to spend $50 on an entree when we go out, but when entrees are $20-$25 and they would prefer to order food from the pizza place down the street for $10-12 and eat at home, that's when i get frustrated. When they don't get their way, it's usually followed by some pouting and awkward silence. 

They constantly argue with the group if there is a faster route to this place, or it's cheaper if we do this. Often times, the argument will continue even later because they have to prove the point that they are right and they're the brightest person in the room.

I don't want to go on vacation to argue over which hotel we are going to stay in because this one is cheaper and closer to 'this' or 'that'. I don't want to walk around in circles in the city to find them the cheapest food options everyday. I don't want to argue about going to a destination one day to have them fight and say they'd rather do something else.

I'm willing to hear them out if there is something they really want to see or do, but they tend to be selfish and only think of themselves. At the same time, i'm worried the 1st couple that I planned this trip with will get frustrated and despise their trip as well.

Do i tell them that i think it's best they don't go? Do i set some ground rules for them to follow? Do I warn the first couple? Am i being too controlling or insensitive to their anxieties? I just want everyone to have a nice vacation. I don't want any resentment at the end or people to walk away frustrated.

I work a 9-5 and he works at a restaurant, so usually when he gets home he will stay up for a couple of hours playing video games and then come to bed after me. I get up around 6:30 to have time to get ready etc. and make it to work (technically get there at 8:30).

I try to go to bed around 11 and he usually will come to bed around 12-1. When he comes into the room it wakes me up and I have a lot of trouble going back to sleep, and if I do fall back asleep quickly I end up waking up sporadically throughout the night. 

If he goes to the bathroom or goes to get water it wakes me up. Some nights I won’t even remember waking up but he’s told me when he comes back into the room I’ll shoot up and panic or scream or freak out and then just go back to bed. Some nights it will just be weirdly vivid or disturbing dreams that will wake me up and make me have a hard time falling back asleep.

I’m exhausted almost every day. I feel like shit at work and can barely keep my eyes open at certain points in the day. I don’t drink caffeine except for the morning, I have no idea why I get woken up so easily.

410,"So I cut out contact with my friend (Anne) because of how she treated me and my bf on holiday, and I've been wracking my brain about if I was wrong about this all...

A few months ago, Anne invited myself and my boyfriend on holiday to her home in Japan. It's a beautiful place in the countryside, and my BF and I were really excited to go. Before we were due to go, Anne told me that another couple, who are close friends with Anne and her husband (closer than us, as they have been friends for over 2 decades) accidentally invited themselves over. Bear in mind this happened AFTER we were invited.

Anne's home has 2 double rooms bedrooms, and a sofa in the living room. My BF and I were due to arrive on Tuesday leaving on Saturday, and the other couple were due to arrive on Thursday, leaving on Sunday. 

Shortly before the trip, and during the first few days, Anne dropped about 2 or 3 times, the words that someone would have to stay in the living room because of the lack of room.

Now, I was always taught that in situations like this, the host has the absolute priority to make sure their guests are comfortable. I was also taught that the guest has the role of make the host's role as easy as possible. As such, I said to her ""I don't mind sleeping in the living room if needs be..."" as a matter of courtesy, since she invited us to her beautiful home, and I didn't want to feel like a stubborn guest.

She jumped at this chance, and asked me to leave my bedroom and sleep in the living room. I talked it over with my BF, who was quite ill at the time with a chest infection. He told me that he really didn't want to sleep in the living room (a public space). I talked to Anne, and she said that my BF could sleep in the same room as her and her husband... and said this to my BF, and he said that he really wanted to be in the same place as me. 

I told this to Anne, and she said that she didn't know what else to do. At this point, her husband asked why the other couple couldn't sleep in the living room. Anne said ""Because I don't really want to invite people and have them sleep in the living room."" Which was a bit....disappointing....since I thought I was a guest as well, but clearly not on the same level as the other friends. Also, Anne's husband really didn't want to sleep in the living room.

I talked it over further with my BF, and he eventually agreed to sleep with me in the living room, since he really would have felt uncomfortable without me, and we were sure Anne's husband would be uncomfortable without her (if we made Anne sleep in the living room, which, again, we didn't want to do, because we didn't want to be ""bad"" guests).

This was on Wednesday night. On Thursday night, a few hours before the other couple were to arrive, Anne got us to go to our room, take off our bed sheets, and change the fucking bed sheets for the new guests to arrive to a clean bed....my BF really didn't like that, but he's too shy to say anything, and I didn't want to rock the boat...

Anne could see something was wrong though, so she asked us if anything was wrong, and asked us to be honest about it. At this point, we bit our tongue, because:

1) Anne clearly had already made her choice and prioritized the other guests' comfort over ours.

2) Anne had failed her role as a host.

3) We didn't want to rock the boat at this point - we were pissed off enough already.

Anne then said that if anything is wrong, feel free to say, because ""you guys are guests too"", and she then said that she didn't want us to feel like we'd been cheated.

First of all, she had already made her feelings abundantly clear from the night before. Moreover, the only solution to this would be making Anne and her husband sleep in the living room - and her husband is an absolute sweetheart, who has outrightly said he didn't want to stay in the living room, and we didn't want to penalize him for Anne's mistakes... So we said things were okay...

The living room was awful. The bedrooms seem to be soundproofed, but the living room isn't. Animals constantly wander around at night around the house, and we were kept up with all manners of snorting, howling, meowing, scratching, tapping on the windows, banging, etc. We didn't sleep.

The next day, Anne said how terrible she felt, and said that we could switch, and that it was the ""least we could do, since you're guests too!"" 

I told her that anyone who was in the living room couldn't sleep and I didn't want to subject that to her or her husband, so I'd rather get an earlier flight home. Anne was insistent on that not happening, since she said she didn't want us wasting money. So I told her the only other option was for all 4 of us to sleep in her tiny double bedroom. She agreed...

I spent the night on the floor with my BF in true discomfort. I, again, didn't sleep. Partly out of anger, partly because of the sleep talking from Anne at night, which happened every 30 minutes. My BF's condition became worse, and he was bed bound for a week after we returned home. 

Since then, Anne thanked me for coming, and apologized for the trip being bad. She blamed her other friends for inviting themselves, as opposed to her own actions, or lackthereof. 

I've pretty much ghosted her, as I don't feel like talking to her after how she treated me and my BF (now husband). 

She recently sent me a message asking me if I was okay, and that she missed talking to me... I've had a while to calm down, so I'm thinking perhaps I overreacted a bit?

421,"Hi, I'm an 18 year old guy from California, and I need lots of advice/help. To bear you from all of the details, I'll summarize the last 7 months of my life. Over 7 months ago I got kicked out of my mothers home for possessing weed, I had nowhere to go--so I ended up driving 2 hours North, to where all of my old friends live. I lived at my girlfriends (we were long-distance at the time) for a few months, followed by living at a friend's house (who eventually kicked me out as their family didn't like the idea of an 18 year old living at their house for long) and now I live at a relatives house for the time being while I figure out my life. I never finished high school, even though at the time I was actually one of the top students. As of now, I managed to find a job as a web developer (I've been programming since 8th grade), and fortunately have been making a good amount of money (a worlds better than the previous fast-food job I had to get when I first moved here). However, I'm just not sure what I'm doing, at a time in my life I was a super ambitious, hyper-motivated kid. I had a 4.7 GPA, I'd go to the gym everyday, I was heavily interested in nutrition and programming and always striving to make myself better. Now, I'm more depressed than ever before. I used to go to the gym everyday, now I'm lucky if I go twice a week. I'm always having to turn towards weed just to make myself not suicidal. I'm constantly questioning my sanity, my interests have become less interesting, I've become super attached to my girlfriend (mainly because I have no one else in my life to support me), and overall I'm essentially dying a slow death. I'm an ultra-hard worker, I've always been that way, which is why I feel like I've managed to survive on my own as well as I have, but how much longer can I be doing this? My bosses love me, I'm always working above and beyond for them (mostly because I'm so afraid of losing of my job), and fortunately they reward me for my hard work instead of taking advantage. I'm just completely lost now, I essentially have no family, no friends, just my girlfriend. I feel like I'm living my worst nightmare, I wish none of this ever happened to me. What do I do? Ever since getting my current job (which I've been doing for about 4 months now), I've gotten really good at programming, and my boss is actually looking to mentor me on ruby on rails so that I could help create programs that help run his business (my boss is a programming freak :p). I feel like the situation I'm in is a lot better than what I could be, but I still feel lost, I feel like I still haven't fully realized the situation I'm in. What do you guys think? What do you guys think I should do? I've never felt so lost before in my life, I feel I'm not even remotely the same as I was less than a year ago. How do I help myself? P.S (Sorry for any shitty grammatical errors or sentence flow, this is purely me just ranting). Thanks.",14Feb2019,1
422,"My boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year. We’ve been pretty much happy but there’s a reoccurring issue. He’s a home body and needs more time alone than I do. I’m more extroverted and I do enjoy going out and need more time with him. Ive given up the going out aspect of dating and we mostly just stay in. We run errands and occasionally get food. I can count how many times we’ve gone on a date on both hand in the last year or so. I see him two days a week, usually one full day and one evening. My bf gets three days off a week. I work and do school at home so my schedule is super flexible so I plan my schedule based on when I see him and deadlines. Honestly, I work my ass off during the days I don’t see him so I can spare a day of not working. So I really enjoy those days. 

Recently, he’s been asking me to go home much earlier than usual. It’s usually only an hour or so earlier than typical but it makes me upset. I already had to be okay with only seeing him twice a week. HOW he sends me home and just the fact that he’s actually asking me to leave is bumming me out specifically. We use to see each other practically everyday when we first started dating. He use to never want me to leave. Eventually, we went from 7 days to 4 days and now it’s 2 days. Now he wants me to leave earlier. I feel like it’s a slippery slope and just indicates that he’s just not into me. 

I know I’m the asshole for this part, I tend to drag out the time when he asks me to leave. In my defence, he usually springs it on me 20 minutes for when he wants me out of there. I need to change, pack my things and clean up my mess. The fact that I don’t want to leave makes it harder for me to NOT drag out the time. His roommates also strike up convos with me when I’m getting ready. So I usually take 30 to 45 minutes to get ready to go home. This really pisses him off. He becomes cold and distant. We usually have a “send off.” He would walk me to my car, kiss me good night and tell me he loves me. He also asks to schedule the next time I’ll see him. Last few times, it’s been different. He refused to hold my hand and he doesn’t ask when he can see me next. His demeanour is just cold and it carries on through the text messages for the next few days. The hurt always carries on too. I feel like an absolute baby for being upset about this but it really does upset me. I’m honestly embarrassed that I’m this upset about seeing my boyfriend for only 1-2 less than I typically do so I don’t even want to express this to him. But I know that I should. ",14Feb2019,1

428,"When my sister (23) graduated college last year. her best job opportunity is back in her hometown, where our father (43) lives. 

(Now my sister already has kind of a rocky relationship with dad because they're both hot headed and verbally abusive towards each other and me, with both saying mean things that they don't mean, it just feels good for them to say it.)

My sister agrees to live with me and dad, and long story short they come up with a deal. dad will cover all the bills and rent and my sister pays for the WIFI, and everything needed for the cats, and I'm left with chores (I'm still in high school)

My sister is the only one in the house with a stable job. My dad does has been unemployed for a long time but does odd jobs every now and then and sometimes helps with construction stuff nearby. I honestly have no idea where he gets his money but he's been able to feed us both and pay all the bills. The ONLY issue these two seem to have is with the food. Dad usually feeds us but more often than my sister would like, dad asks her to at least buy food for ME, and if she has extra, him. This upsets my sister as she believes that it is not her responsibility to feed everyone and that it is Dad's responsibility, as he's the father of the household. She's not really thrilled about spending more than her part. Most of the time she doesn't oblige, or when she does she does so begrudgingly.

This all came to a head today when Dad asked sister to buy me something to eat as some of our appliances weren't working due to a brownout. She does so and is grumpy about it, but then Dad asked her if she got anything for HIM. This really sets her off and she says ""I'M NOT YOUR MOM! I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO PAY FOR EVERYTHING!"" Dad is appalled by the rudeness and tells her off, saying that it's not unreasonable for her to feed us every now and then because SHE is the one with the job in the household. (Filipino way of thinking) Then Dad proceeds to call her selfish and a whole bunch of other mean things (that he won't mean 2 hours later, I guarantee). Instead of acting like the adult that she is, my sister cries, screams her head off, and locks herself in her room, still screaming, (thus disturbing the boarders that live in our compound, another source of income). That's just how she deals with her anger. Now she wants to move out.

Some points:

* My sister never asks US for food as she feeds herself.
* When me and dad have food though, dad almost always shares some with her, and she sometimes does eat some.

My take on this:

They are both acting like children. It's like they never grew up. My sister says that Dad goes overboard with his insults and put downs, but she does the same things with me, lashing out and hurting others when they're upset is just a trait they both share. Doesn't make it okay though. I honestly don't think that feeding us every now and then would be too hard on my sister, but she's just afraid that if she does it too often dad will start to abuse it, which is a perfectly valid fear. I also have no idea why Dad requested something for himself from my sister when I know for a FACT that he is currently loaded. Please tell me, who is wrong here? How can I keep my home life together? Sorry for the long post. If you would like to know more details do not hesitate to ask.",14Feb2019,1
429,"I’ve worked in the food service industry for over 10 years, an in the past 6 years I’ve felt very lonely in the last four places I worked at. I act professional, but I joke around too. I don’t like to slack off, but I don’t tell other people what to do/how to do their job. I just want to do what I do well, without worrying about what others are doing. I don’t have poor hygiene, and I don’t talk too much.

Examples include not being invited to stuff while they make plans in front of me, or customers starting conversations with my co-workers while the same customers don’t smile/are cold towards me. 

I’m thinking I seem like a very boring/dumb person, or (I know this sounds stupid) they don’t like how I look.

Would this be a deal breaker if you found out your spouse was a trolling psycho on the Internet? She spent the past 7+ years harassing a poor young girl on the Internet. My wife made an anonymous Twitter pretending to be a young girl's dog that died calling the young girl a ""dog killer."" -- just psycho stuff. My wife thinks because she posted that stuff on anonymous names, that people shouldn't make a big deal out of it because we know she's ""just all words."" The fact that she's even doing this at all is pure psycho to me.

Even on her main name, she's been airing our relationship/marriage, posting photos of our kids and pets as a way to claim she has a better life than this young girl she is attacking. She's not sharing our family photos out of love - she's sharing her ""good life"" to spite this young girl.

My wife's an author and has been writing for 20 years. None of her books ever got famous despite her putting a lot of efforts into promoting them. So when she saw a younger writer become more famous than her in a shorter time and the young girl didn't even promote herself, my wife started obsessing over the young girl all day long and she started attacking everything in the young girl's life.

Every time we go out - she's always on her phone or laptop and she doesn't give her full attention to me because she's always making posts about this young girl and looking at her page all the time.

When I first met my wife, she was this put together woman - a future nurse graduating college. We have 3 lovely young boys, bought our house together. I don't have social media. I'm a private kind of guy. I had no idea she had this whole other persona on the Internet. If I had met her when she acted like how she acts on the Internet, I definitely wouldn't have married her. She treats me nicely so I have no problem with her.

But she treats other people terribly and she thinks I should just get over it and stay with her.

Why? So she can use our marriage to say what a good husband she has even though she doesn't deserve me for treating that young girl so horribly?

tl;dr Moral of the story - if you don't have social media - should get one just to check and see what your spouse is posting. I found out too late what kind of person my wife was after we had 3 kids and a house so I can't easily leave her because of all the baggage I have with her.

I would usually just let any person come if asked, but it really is very unpleasant. I'm honestly surprised I'm even asking for advice on this. I'm not confrontational at all.

443,"Hey y’all. I work in an office setting for a small construction company that builds decks, fences, pools, landscaping etc. I was hired as the receptionist but through luck and the ability to do more than answer a phone and forward emails I quickly became a purchaser, and now basically the general office admin.

I’m the youngest person in my workplace and I work with no other females. Mostly middle aged men. I’ve gotten used to the way they handle their frustration quite a bit. I used to work in an all female environment and it was a lot of gossip and petty shit talking. With men I’ve found it to be more “yelly” and they don’t hold back when they have a problem, but they get over it quickly.

The girl before me who was doing admin would often get so stressed in the busy season she would literally breakout in hives. This is my first year doing her job in the busy season and I am so anxious about it. 

Something relatively small and insignificant happened today where one of the guys got frustrated with me and I’ve stressed myself over it to the point where I get that “stress tingle” you can feel in your brain and hair follicles. 

Anyways. I figured maybe giving you guys some background info there might be better advice based on my type of job, age group I work with etc. 

Just looking for some general tips, or tips from people who also suffer from severe anxiety to handle work stress.. currently I have 0 coping mechanisms.

I am not going to share the video as it is quite embarrassing to me, haha. I will explain in detail what I did and hopefully you guys can advise me on the best course of action.

In this video, I've recorded myself singing the song ""Falling in love with you"" and added in the acoustic instrumental. I think it sounds alright, but I'm definitely not a professional so I'm wondering if maybe I should omit my voice and instead simply put in the recording from a real singer.

I also put some simple stock video clips to match the lyrics of the song and a few simple transitions/effects with parts of something I wrote in between each clip (Every line break is a different clip basically):

\--------

I was taught that the love portrayed in fairy tales was a sham, a complete and utter scam.A gloomy vision of love clouded my trustless eyes and I believed for so long that all the beautiful promises of happiness were lies.

But… My worn and bruised heart felt a sudden electrical change the moment that our paths crossed. You picked it up and carried it across the earth, far away from the darkness, to find what once was lost.

Your magnetic light helped mend the broken pieces of me that I could no longer even see. I learned our obstacles were just a mere material concept we had to face; the truth in our divine love would set us free.

The belief of unconditional love became deeply engraved in me as time flew by. You awakened my heart to its strength, now unafraid to feel these emotions that reached the surface and to cry.

Crying tears of joy amongst the sadness, loving endlessly without a single regret, we held onto each other’s hands and dove in to explore the universe’s mysterious secret.

Our souls bound together, every aspect of us grew stronger and filled our worlds with new possibility. This wasn’t a childhood dream but a reality teaching us love’s fragility.

During all these moments shared, of tears, laughter and lame inside jokes, there isn’t a single instant that I would leave behind; even the bad times don’t have me scared.

As we get older, my memory grows shorter and the passing time changes my perspective on life but will never change my love for you. My heart will keep growing fonder of all that we are together and remain true.

I love you more than the infinite galaxies that paint the sky and I will love you until it is both our time to fly.

My dear binary star, when our time has finally ticked away, I will find you again in this world. No matter where you are, I will never be far; this love has left a timeless imprint on my heart.

Well, what do you think? Send or no send? Thanks!

458,"So posting here has helped me A LOT in the past, I've had a few problems that I had a hard time wrapping my head around how to feel about them and the best strategy to get the best result. I've moved into an awesome huge apartment that I love, I have a job that I'm really good at but challenges me and my coworkers and I respect each other. I have amazing and incredibly cool friends. I feel like advice I've gotten here has been a small part of getting things going in the direction I need! So thanks for that!

But with all these great new things come great new challenges. I have a particularly annoying form of syncope so I don't drive because of a fear of loss of consciousness. Also, according to a lot of others and my life before I got my act together, I'm ""corny"" and my social skills aren't bad, but because of some really bad stuff in my past, I've gained a few bad habits that turn people off in social settings and sometimes make me seem a way I'm not. Despite all of this I've been insanely successful in the things I can control ...(the friends, sweet pad, professional life, and fun I talked about earlier)... But I've reached a new milestone and haven't fainted in so long that I am eligible to get a driver's license! 

I know I should be happy but I am feeling more afraid. I am at an age where it's not normal to never have had a girlfriend (34) and I'd really like to. I've been using my condition as an excuse to not drive, and the medicine I take as an excuse for my weight gain (really I just got chubby because I'm in my 30s and hate exercise). I am terrified of driving and kind of hoped I'd never have to... and because I'm unattractive due to gaining like 30 pounds VERY quickly and because I am socially a little off and corny and I didn't drive I would always be able to convince myself dating wasn't going to happen so when I got rejected it never really stung because I'd just think ""obviously no one is interested in me, that's just how things are, but look at all the other awesome things in my life"". But my excuses are gone now and it's terrifying. What if I'm too fat and corny and awkward to get a girlfriend? What if even though I'm allowed to drive now, I just fail the driving test forever until I die? Or what if no one is ever attracted to me (Because I'm really friendly women often give me the ""I don't like you that way"" talk, when really I'm just awkward and trying to be polite and nice to everyone, I also get the same talk from men sometimes.)? Sorry, this is so long, but I'm pretty scared that as hard as it's been to get to the level I'm proud to be at now, what if now that it's time for the next level I find out I'm not good enough?",14Feb2019,1

It rang again a couple minutes after. I opened the door a couple minutes afterwards to see if anyone was there. Nothing. Normally if it’s a package, they will just leave it at the door, or in the mailbox.

It rang again just a couple minutes ago (It has been two hours since the last ring). 

Both my roommate and I looked outside the apartment to see if it was a kid or something. As far as I know, there isnt any kids living in our building. I don’t think anyone would ding dong ditch around here.

462,"Just to put it out, I am really bad with grammar and sentence structure. Sorry!

Anyways. Here is a preface to this whole drama: My boyfriend, Steven, has a close close friend called Max. My boyfriend and Max had both slept with the same girl - Marie - in their friendship group. This is also my boyfriends ex from when they were 16, and Max slept with her when he was like... 18? Everyone is around 26 now. Max recently got into a relationship with a girl called Hellen. They have been dating for a while, but never really made it a thing until a couple of months ago. He was very unsure about being with her, but decided to give it a go.

On NYE, Max and Hellen hosted a dinner party, and Marie was pretty much invited last minute. Well... I was told she was coming the night of, and needed time to gather myself, and just prepare - this is my first boyfriend, and I just get anxious in general. Marie turns up, and at this point I am really drunk, and keep losing my boyfriend at the party. This creates a mild panic attack by just assuming that he is with Marie doing something. I wanted to talk to Hellen about it, since she might understand how I feel about the entire situation of them being friends - Marie and my boyfriend being such close friends- and how I really want to be friends with Marie, but I just can't bring myself to do it because I keep thinking about the past, and what my boyfriend might do etc.

Fast forward to a week ago, Max and Helen have split up, and are still friends. Me and Helen go out for a few drinks, and just have some fun together. During this time, I am pretty drunk, and because this is my first time drunk since NYE, I bring up the whole ex situation, and ask her why she is so fine with Marie and Max being friends, despite their past... turns out she didn't know. She seemed fine, we went home.. that was it. We met up a few times after, nothing was said, until one night Max called my boyfriend and had a go about who told Helen about his past with Marie. Stating that Helen was crying, and was really mad at me for telling her, and now he is really disappointed in me, and doesn't want to talk to me. 

I have apologised profusely, and yet, the other day - even though he NEVER asked us before - if just my boyfriend wants to come over for dinner that night, and just being plain manipulative. We have a party in a few days, which myself and Max are going to, but I want everything to be cleared before we go, but he literally just refuses to talk to me, making me out to be such a villain. I understand where I am wrong, and I apologised, but the way he is acting is just annoying me more and more.

What do I do? Max is someone to hold grudges about everything :/ I am at a wall with everything. My boyfriend seems to favour him more than me, and it is creating a serious rift in our relationship :/ Typing this out makes it seem so insignificant, but it is a lot more intense.",14Feb2019,1
463,"Hey guys,

I’ve never been very lucky in love. After ending a terrible 5 year relationship, I found myself feeling very hopeless, like I would never find anyone for me.

About a year after the breakup, I met this amazing guy. He’s so sweet, caring, very intelligent and just so lovely always. 

He’s told me he’s struggled with anxiety and depression in the past, but I am ok with that especially because so have I.

We’ve been seeing each other regularly for the past 4 months. I’ve been introduced to his family and friends. He knows some of my friends as well, but not my family (narcs). 

So today I was fooling around online, looking through his insta pics and it just came to me that I’d never googled his name before, so I did.

And, well,  you know what I found out. He was charged with domestic violence, apparently nothing was proven but “threats” so they gave him a restraining order and social work for 5 months. That was 4 years ago. 

I spoke to some of my friends who are lawyers and I have been advised to step back and break things off, but I know myself so well and I know it’ll be really hard and part of me wants to just be straightforward with him and see what he says. 

I don’t want to lose him, but I understand the man I think I love might not be this guy that I think I know.

What should I do? He’s been nothing but graceful with me and open to talk about anything, 

should I talk to him? Should I keep seeing him? 

Do guys that commit these sort of atrocities ever change? What if I stick with him and maybe in 10 years, married with kids, he turns out to really be a monster?

Please be kind, I know I’m probably being really stupid but he is the only good part of my life right now.

464,"Hello all,

First I would like to thank you for reading my post. I’ll try to keep it short and give you some background information.

I just turned 30 and lost my job in December  I do not have a degree, but I completed one semester in community college when I was 20. Due to my lack of education it has been difficult to find a job. I recently accepted an offer for a fast food restaurant as an assistant manager, which is not something I wanted to do at my age, but they do offer tuition reimbursement which would cover the cost of community college. 

I’m at a point in my life where I’m scared. Most people my age have established careers and I’m starting over again after losing my job in December. I’m not 18-22 like most students, it’s been ten years since I’ve had any schooling, and I don’t even j is what areas I want to study. I know it’s not logical to go for anything that requires a doctorate, as I would be in my 40s before I’d be able to start a career. 


I think I’m mostly looking for advice on where to even start, what some sensible programs would be, possibly programs that can be completed in ~4 years that have a decent demand and pay, and I wouldn’t be upset if I got a few stories of people who have found themselves in my position before and are doing well now.

27M here, my wife 28F and Daughter 20mo

My wife doesn’t work and stays at home with our daughter.
I am the sole provider.
We have $30K in savings and currently break even each month, even living very frugally.
We own a $250K home that I owe $190K on b/c I put $50K down after flipping a previous home I remodeled.

Ok so I hate 75% of my job but am afraid to make a move and subsequently go down in pay. I just got another promotion and an increase in work that gives me zero time to job hunt even if I wanted to.

I am the youngest project manager in my company; a renowned general contractor that builds hospitals and universities. I am currently PM in charge of a $100M cancer center. 

I feel a level of pride in what I’ve accomplished career wise in such a short time. I’m paid well but i typically work from 4am - 7pm, 5 days a week. I even work from home on Sundays for about 6hrs. The mental stress is unreal. I barely see my daughter and wife. I have no time for a life at all.I am stressed out constantly. I do yoga to decompress and beat the fuck out of a tire with a sledge hammer after work to exhaust myself physically and take out my frustrations. 

The guys I work for are the type you don’t say “I am overwhelmed” to, or “I need help to”. They’re A-typical construction guys who eat fuckin nails for breakfast. No sympathy, no excuses. It’s just get the fucking job done. For example, when the president promoted me, he said this “We don’t promote pussies to this position and by all accounts you are not a pussy, you’ve proven yourself in every aspect and we think you’re ready for this role.”

A side note - I was supposed to take over my grandpas company but for idiotic reasons, he doesn’t want me there now. (Didn’t have his son (my uncle) as a groomsman in my wedding but had my other uncle in it. Showing him how well I can do without his company is part of what keeps me going.

Bottom line is, I’m overworked to the point that it is affecting me and my personal life in every way. I’m proud of what I do but I a burnt the fuck out. I can’t make less money because my wife and I love our home and my wife isn’t going back to work anytime soon bc she loves being home with our daughter and so do I. I’m proud that I can provide for her.

So I guess my question is, do I tough it out and hope it gets easier, or do I try to find another position in what little spare time I have? Or is there an option I’m not even considering? Anyone who has been in my shoes, please weigh in here.",14Feb2019,1

I have secretly timed her once and probably  in a day, she would have used 45 mins to 1 hr(that includes chatting on phone plus whatsapp) 
I would have loved a heart to heart talk with her, but knowing her character, she would leave.. as I have on another occasion asked her if I have done something to offend her as she was sullen and snarky. She just said she does not do small talk
Just after New Year ,  I dragged up an old dress sample and pattern for her to make. She went into a big strop as I can hear things being thrown about. I initiated a discussion whereby she claimed she have forgotten how, her back pain etc and reiterating she does not like talking.
After so many years, I might not be the perfect boss but I do everything by the book like paying her a fair wage, pension etc. I even cook her lunch for f**ks sake.

-If I listen to girl groups or watch TV with skimpy-clothed women, she'll get angry and lecture me about ""trash"", ""sluts"", things like that

I have a small circle of friends that I'd like to hang out with in person. According to her, they're perfectly welcome to hang out here, but I ""can't"" bus out to their house and stay over. For context, they're boys, and their parents aren't as strict on substance use as mine... but they respect that I'm not into alcohol or weed. We would literally just be playing video games. She said no, that she has a say because I'm still ""living under this roof"" , and I can do what I want when I move out (in this economy (lol), it's gonna be several years until that happens)

I respect my mom's opinion on a lot of things, of course. I am a legal adult AND tenant though; I'd like to be able to leave the house without paying consequences like having my belongings or privileges taken away...

How can I approach her with this? I just want the freedom I legally deserve, and I don't know how to have a two-sided conversation with her about it.",14Feb2019,1
475,"Well, I’ve been through so much shit I don’t know where to turn anymore. 

I’m a junior in high school. Ive been diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder. I was always a decent student. Turned in most work and passed classes with A’s and B’s. This year I barely passed my classes last semester and ended up failing 3 classes. Bringing my GPA all the way down to about a 2.4-2.5. I’m not even meeting the requirements for the college I wish to attend anymore. My mother puts a lot of stress of me. We’re always in and out of arguing and she always takes my stuff like my car and other items. Which just seems to make everything worse on me. I also work as a Supervisor which requires me to do above 30 hours a week. But in spite of everything lately, I’m only doing 20. The owner says I have to up my hours again soon or else I’m not sure if I’ll maintain the position. My girlfriend and I have been together for 7 months, with a 1 month break around the 3rd month. She was the one who motivated me and I was really trying for her. My mom ended up texting her and she really cares about my education and she was very disappointed. She was also a little sappy cause of an argument the previous day. She said we needed to “talk”. She took me to some frozen yogurt place and proceeded to ignore me and play some game on her phone. She also asked me trick questions that I understood the wrong way and it made me sound bad. I couldn’t take it and I ended up going to the bathroom to cry. We then left and she drove me home, she came in because she didn’t trust leaving me alone with my past of attempting to take my life. She soon realized what she did to me and tried to apologize. This only ended up with her crying and me trying to comfort her. So we started discussing the future, she’s always been more attracted to woman. And considered herself bisexual. Which wasn’t an issue for me. But she told me that she feels that she no longer feeling very heterosexual. And she told me because of that she can’t give me 110% and that she just can’t. But she has really bad auto phobia so she can’t be alone. And I told her I won’t leave her alone. But she doesn’t want to use me. But I’m so scared to lose her as well. We’re still together but it’s ending soon. She’s okay now but I’m dreading everything. Knowing the ending is near. I want to stay with her as she seeks for another, then when she finds that new safety or someone that can keep her safe, then I will leave. Leaving her in the arms of someone else. 

Life is just crazy right now, and I’m losing all motivation. Therapy isn’t helping me that much. Everyone seems against me. And there’s no where to turn, not even my girlfriend anymore. 

Any tips/advice for staying on top? 
Any ideas for my failing relationship lmao. 

Idk, I’m just lost atm. 

Thanks. ",14Feb2019,1
476,"Ok, so a decent amount of back story here. I am the manager of a small Brew pub in a small town. We've only been open about a year and 9 months, so business is still hit or miss. So, on shifts that we have multiple servers, we work on a rotation system. We're too small to have a hostess and the restaurant is set up in a way that doing sections always ends up screwing someone over. So, the rotation has always worked well...until recently. In the past, we've been very teamwork oriented and have all had open communication so everyone felt the system was fair. 

Until a couple weeks ago. It was a Saturday night shift and I had two servers on. One of them has been there for a year (let's call her Daisy), the other only a few months (let's call her Jane). I was actually hosting my boyfriend's birthday party there that night, so I was there, but not ""working."" Jane took my party. In the past, that would normally mean that she'd hold off on taking more tables bc a party of 20+ demands a lot of attention and energy. But Jane sees everything in black and white and insisted on maintaining the rotation. So, ultimately, and hour later, she had my party, a 6 top, and a 10 top while the Daisy had three two tops. That means Daisy was running all the big tables' food, prebussing, refilling drinks, etc bc the Jane was overwhelmed. So, at the end of the shift, Jane made probably 3 or 4 times the tips than Daisy, who worked just as hard.

And this is just the beginning. Daisy wasn't happy about the situation, and she wanted to talk to Jane to figure out how to prevent this  situation in the future. Jane wasn't  having it.  Jane is the one who's upset, bc she thinks the rotation is luck of the draw and she just got lucky that night. When I mentioned that Daisy was running her food etc., Her response was, well, she just shouldn't do that then. We've always been big on teamwork and that response was unacceptable to me. I tried to come up with a system to help balance things out.

So, I decided on a tally system, with weights for larger tables. 1-5 top counts as 1, 6-10 tops count as 2, and 11+ tops count as 3. I was so proud of myself. But it didn't even work for an hour into the following shift. This is because Daisy is a well liked server, and often has tables request her. We have always just shifted the rotation (if she was #2, but it was #1's turn, she'd just shift to the #1 position in the rotation). That way everyone stays balanced. But Jane disagrees and says that when that happens, Daisy should keep the same position and just be skipped on her next turn. Daisy disagrees, words are exchanged.

So...here's my thing...how do I resolve this in a fair way? I feel like at this point both Jane and Daisy (who is extremely hard headed and full of conviction herself) have made up their minds about the situation and nothing I can do will make it better. Jane is talking about quitting. Daisy has asked not to be scheduled with Jane (I only have 9 employees including myself, so the scheduling of that wouldn't be super easy). I'm looking for any ideas on how to make this better without losing a server.

TL;DR I have two servers who disagree on the system we use for rotating tables and I need advice on how to peacefully resolve the disagreement.",14Feb2019,1

478,"A little background: About 3 years ago, my fiancee and I purchased a home and unbeknownst to us, it was near a small college's baseball stadium. I played baseball for many years growing up and love the sport, so upon hearing a PA system on spring nights, walked over and watched a game. The fans are a small group of primarily former players and they immediately welcomed me with open arms. I started bringing my dog, and then eventually my fiancee. She's always hated baseball, but also has grown to love the games and camaraderie and it's become maybe our favorite hobby to do together. We purchased season tickets and along with another couple we're friends with, attend pretty much every game - we love it. Anyway, their first baseball game is tomorrow night and I couldn't be more excited - I've waited for this for 8 months and anyone that knows us, knows how pumped we are for these games. We're in a text thread with the other couple and have counted down the days - I've been like a kid at Christmas.

Anyway, last fall, we (my fiancee and I) attended a wedding and met this girl there by herself ""Jessica"". She's a coworker of the bride (and the bride is one of our best friends) and was at the wedding by herself. We spoke to her for 10-15 mins and found her nice enough, my fiancee got her number and they've hung out a bit over fall/winter. While she was okay at first, the handful of times I've been around this girl have been terrible, as I've realized her true personality - she's extremely loud, mouthy, rude and above all that - she just makes everything about her. She's a ""one-upper"" and it's impossible to have a conversation with her in earshot without her interrupting to interject her own story or advice. One by one, our friend group have all told us how they really don't care for her and it's gotten to the point that our group has dwindled a bit, especially when they know she'll be around. Even our friend that had her at her wedding (our friend that is her coworker) has asked how we can tolerate hanging around her. I can't think of one friend in our group that is even somewhat okay with her.

She's 30 years old, has no other friends and clings to my fiancee, to the point that even my fiancee (who gets along with everyone) has grown tired of her. She gets into our personal conversations and will tell us how to treat each other. (For instance, if she's over and I leave to walk my dog, she'll say ""Tell her you love her"" or ""you should kiss her goodbye"" - just little things that really barb at me, and have also started to grate on my fiancee.

And then Tuesday evening, we're sitting at home when ""Jessica"" barges into our home. After a few minutes, she mentions ""are you guys excited for Friday?!?"" and starts talking about how she can't wait. I got up and grabbed my dog's leash and left - I was unaware my fiancee had mentioned this to her and now it sounds like she's planning on coming. We spoke about it a bit later that night and my fiancee said she'd try and talk the girl out of coming. Last night, my fiancee comes home and said that they spoke, but this girl is dead-set on coming - not only that, she said that ""Jessica"" wants to come to every game - she wants to be a part of our group and that this becomes a thing we all do together.

I want no part in this and the other couple that we go to the games with dislike her also. They're unaware that she's planning on going and if they found out, they'd surely cancel. I told my fiancee, we can't really stop her from attending, but we can stop her from sitting with us. My fiancee argues that she has no other friends (for a reason) and that she's depressed and we shouldn't ""kick her when she's down"". My fiancee and I have been arguing about this - she doesn't want her coming either, but has kind of bowed that we just need to let her come along, which will undoubtedly ruin something I love and may cost some of our friends, as well as waste the money we've spent on season tickets.

Anyway, tomorrow is the first game and I'm at the point now I probably won't go if she's going. I haven't told the other couple yet, as I know they'd do the same thing. I'm all for cutting this girl loose, but while my fiancee doesn't like her at this point either, is afraid or too mousy I guess and doesn't want to do that. I usually can come up with the answer for most things, but this is one where I don't really know what to do.. Any ideas?

TL;DR - fiancee's hanger-on is trying to wedge herself into an event we both love. We want to cut her loose, my fiancee is afraid of the ramifications.",14Feb2019,1
479,"So I'm a 18M and I go to my moms job to wait for her to get off. There's this women that never really found attractive. However, I noticed that she's been trying to get my attention so to speak. Now, I don't want to feel like I know it all etc. If you know these hints and you think that she is trying to tell me something please tell me. 

Hints: I'll be on my phone looking down most of the time and I look up occasionally. I look up and I see her looking at me. Instinctively, she doesn't look away but just smile.

She always tries to start small talk instead of just saying ""Hi"" or ""How are you"" and thats it. 
For an example, I was eating gummy worms one day and I was minding my business and she said, ""so what you aren't gonna share some?"" And started moving around like she was trying to shake her breast. (Well thats the intention she gave off to me) 

Now that I think more of it I have that mindset now that I want to talk to her and I'm pretty sure she's down to do some stuff with me like hang out or etc. 

I just need advice on the hints she's giving me. Is it hints where she's attracted to me? Or is it just her being friendly? Should I give her my number? I don't know what to do. 

Thanks for reading and I appreciate to understand what you may think.

And also I want it to be secretive. I don't want my mom finding out etc just me and her.",14Feb2019,1
480,"Bit of backstory:
I was kicked out of my mom's house at 18, and I have no family besides my father that I speak to anymore due to a lifetime of abuse. My father and I have always had a rocky relationship but during the last year and a half or so we ended up reconnecting and he even let me move in with him because I had nowhere else to go.


My dad has been amazingly supportive and accommodating to me. I expected to be here a few months and it's already been almost a year. He has no plans to kick me out and he is fine with me staying as long as it takes for me to get back onto my feet. 


I thought he was a changed man from the arrogant aggressive and mean man I knew as a child. A bit more backstory: my brother was caught recording his girlfriend's underaged daughter in the shower and that created a lot of tension and anger in our family and created a huge tear in the family. So I actually have experience with men like this and it's so fucking upsetting that both my brother and father are doing this.


How I know my father is secretly recording his mother-in-law is because he's doing it in the downstairs bathroom right off of my bedroom. They're naturally messy people (father and his wife) but I found it odd there was an empty plastic baby wipe case in the bathroom all the time. I ended up inspecting it one day when I was going into the bathroom and found a cell phone poking out of the top, camera pointed right at the toilet from behind. I looked through the phone and found a bunch of recordings of his mother-in-law using the bathroom/getting up and down from the toilet. 


When I grabbed the phone I realized it was probably still recording so I figured ""good, I hope my dad sees I found his peeping tom shit and cuts it out."" I ended up putting the phone back but turning it away from the toilet and hoped my dad would see the recording of me grabbing it and stop doing it. 


I went into the bathroom again today, baby wipe case was still there. I saw something poking out of it but it was tiny, and so I opened it and immediately found a recording device hidden in the case with a tiny camera poking out of the top. Presumably my father wanted to be more discreet about it, but it was clearly a recording device since the bulk of it (presumably the battery pack) had a warning on the side saying ""Don't keep this too close to your phone, keep distance between your phone and the camera to ensure it doesn't get interference."" I left the baby wipe case open, exposing the device and again figured when my dad noticed he was caught again he'd stop. Within a minute of me leaving the bathroom I heard him go in there, fiddle with things, and once he left I checked the bathroom and he had closed the case again and kept the camera in it. 


He knows I know. I know he does it. I don't know what to do. I'm staying with him because he's the only place I can be without being homeless, other than staying with my boyfriend (but my boyfriend lives with his sister at the moment, and I doubt they'd be too happy about having me stay there as well. he's said they'd let me stay there if it was between that and me being homeless, but I don't want to force their hand into letting me stay there because I was poking my nose in things.)


It's eating me alive to know my father is invading his mother in law's privacy and consent like this, it hurts doubly because this is not the first time a family member has done this, AND I've ranted to my dad about how fucked up it is that my brother did this, meanwhile my dad was agreeing but doing the exact same thing. 


I don't know what to do. I've taken pictures of his recording device just to have as proof, but if I actually try to get him in trouble I will become homeless, he'll disown me, I'll burn the last bridge I have with family of mine, and it'd probably tear his marriage apart and create a divorce with a 2 year old stuck in the middle. 


But it feels so wrong to stand by idly and let this happen knowing it's such a fucked up thing for him to do. I'm so lost.",14Feb2019,1
482,"I moved into a new duplex-type apartment with my sister last year. There are 4 apartments per building, and we are in one of the 2 bottom ones. Our walls are nice and thick, and we haven’t heard  so much as a peep from our next door neighbour or the people above him. 

However, since moving in we’ve been sporadically hearing dial tones (like when you’re calling someone on a cellphone and they’ve yet to answer) at random times of the day and night. The apartment above us was unoccupied at first, which was all the more confusing. A few months ago the upstairs apartment got rented out. We’ve heard a few noises from the upstairs neighbours here and there, but really nothing major - more like when they’re moving furniture and so on. 
The dial tones have continued though. By our reasoning, if we are able to hear the dial tone of someone’s call, then surely we should be able to hear the person that is placing the call, talk as well? Our upstairs neighbours are now visiting their children somewhere abroad so nobody is home. 

This morning me and my sister and a guest of ours all heard this dial tone clear as day. Does anyone have any suggestions of what it could be? ",14Feb2019,1

484,"Just a warning that this post may sound a bit whiny but I would love the objective advice of strangers.

It has been my goal for the past two years to long term travel. This past December, I flew to Colombia for three months and it has been nothing short of a dream. I am absolutely in love with this country and I am so happy to be here and to have accomplished this goal.

While boarding the plane for Atlanta to Bogotá, a very nice guy motioned to me to go ahead of him through the gate. As we walked down the ramp, we shared brief smiles and eye contact. As I stepped on to the plane, he said to me “why are you going to Bogotá?” I explained to him my travel plans, and he shared with me that he is from Bogotá and just spent two months in the States visiting his sister and interning at a hospital. And that is where it all started. After we landed in Bogotá, he very kindly gave me a ride to my hostel and we exchanged numbers. The next night we met up for some drinks. I learned that in February he would starting a 5 year residency for Neurosurgery. I was so impressed by him, but still apprehensive as I knew this would maybe just be a short lived travel fling. 

Over the next week, we spent a lot of time together. We had some very meaningful times and we grew very close very quickly. We talked about me coming back to Bogotá before his residency started in February as he would completely inundated at that time and would not be able to share much time with me after that.

I continued to travel this amazing country, meet wonderful people, and completely fall in love with Colombia. However, I thought about him constantly and felt so grateful that we had met in such a serendipitous manner. We talked a lot and he would tell me how much he missed me and he know he has to be strong because I am on the trip of my life, but he couldn’t help missing me.

Nearing the end of January, I decided to buy a plane ticket back to Bogotá form the north coast as I just did not want to wonder “what if” for the rest of my life. He seemed so happy that I was coming back. The night I arrived back Bogotá, we shared the night together and it was amazing to be with someone again that I had missed so much. We even spent the next night together, and again, I felt so close to him.

By this time, it is starting to get very close to the beginning of his residency and he is becoming very busy preparing. He is constantly telling me how terrible he feels to not have the time to see me. I keep reassuring him that there is nothing to feel bad about, his residency is extremely important to him and it’s important to me as well and I just want him to be as prepared and as confident as possible. This goes on for another week and then finally the residency starts and it is like he drops off the face of the earth. 

He would text me once in a while, but just recently, it would be 3 or 4 days with zero contact from him. I am trying to be as understand as possible, but in the back of my mind I think “no one to busy to say hi to someone they care about.” 

This past Saturday, after 3 days silence, I text him and tell him “I know you are unbelievably busy but you haven’t been trying to talk to me lately and I feel like this just isn’t how you treat someone you care about.” He responded with some very genuine messages that made me feel terrible for even feeling the way that I did. He explained that he has had no time for anything and he thinks about me all the time but this is so much hard than he could ever imagine it would be, and asked if he could call me tonight. At this point I feel terrible and tell him it’s ok he does need to call because I understand how busy he is, and I don’t want to him to feel bad, I just want him to focus on his residency. He responds by immensely thanking me for my understanding and telling me that I am amazing and for now he will focus on this and we can try again later. I was a little confused by this as I am flying back to the States in 3 weeks, and he knows this.

This happened last Saturday and since then we have talked twice, very brief exchanges. As I write this post now, he just texted me saying hello, but it has been 4 days of silence from him.

As I’ve said before, I understand that this is an extremely demanding profession, but I don’t want to have feelings for someone that can go 4 without even just quickly saying hi to me.

I'm a second year full-time student in college. I'm part of an international honors society with a local officer position and a regional officer position (the regional one is a pretty big deal within my group). I work 2 jobs adding up to about 20 hours a week. I have a boyfriend and a healthy social life, though that consists mostly of playing video games. I have a 3.96 GPA, though my transcrtipt reads all A's, and I am a well-respected student leader at my college. 

I've gotten offers this year from Harvard, Cornell, Princeton, Texas A&amp;M, and many others. I've been accepted to a high-ranking private school with a merit scholarship of about $28k a year, though I will most likely receive more. 

Thing is, though, I don't really work hard. I ace my exams without much studying. Everything comes really easy to me. I do all my essays at the last minute and get A's on those as well. I have plenty of free time to do what I please and even still I get A's. About twice a term I fall into a deep depression and barely crawl my way out of it in time to finish my work. I frequently cut classes because I've been very sick recently. I should be getting B's and C's with how much effort I put in. 

I feel like an imposter. I feel like college is way too easy. I feel like an asshole for even talking about this because I see so many others work their ass off for C's. I don't really think I deserve any of these offers or scholarships or anything. I'm not doing very much at all and the world is falling into place for me. It doesn't make sense.

492,"I’m 25, female, and work in accounting. 
At my first position at a small public accounting firm, we were given extremely minimal training with how to complete files, returns, etc. While I am certainly fine with independent learning and don’t consider myself stupid by any means, I’m someone who can take a decent amount of to really grasp the material/work that I’m doing, and I like to learn as I do things, taking my time, asking questions, ensuring I get things right. I thrive under highly structured guidance and mentoring.

This last firm was not a friendly environment, and everyone was so busy it didn’t really matter if you asked questions, they usually went unanswered. So I would spend time trying to figure things out on my own and, as anyone who works in accounting, law, or a similar field knows, you have to bill your time, and the longer you take, the higher it costs the client, the unhappier they will be, and the unhappier your boss will be for you costing more that what your pay per hour is. I HATE timesheets. It stresses me out to no end that every task I do, every extra minute I take to do or learn something I’m unsure about, is watched and monitored with an eagle eye. Eventually, I was let go because of my timing on work, and my work ethic “declining.” (Not true, no one was available to answer questions on files that I did as much work as I could on, but had utterly stumped me). 

I am now in a similar position working at an even smaller firm, with even less people to help train me (I can ask questions anytime I want, but everyone is busy and it intimidates me to bug them) and only one person to really train me each Saturday (she’s awesome, but it’s not enough time for me to really master my job). My boss has already told me my time is high and I’m taking a long time. Today, I was doing a really complex bank reconciliation and it took me a long time to even attempt to figure out, even with his help. He later came up to my office and said “You’ve gooootttta be almost done this...you can’t spend forever on this.” Which I understand, but I’ve maybe done 10 or fewer of these in a professional setting, and I’m trying to learn as I do. As he left for his lunch, he explained something for me to do while he was gone and pretty much implied I was making him late. 

I feel so terrible about wasting his money on my wages. When he confronted me about my time, I even told him that if I wasn’t up to par, I would understand it if he let me go. I come to work dreading my day and feeling so anxious about the fact that I could be let go any minute for my time on certain files. I know I could be good if I had a lot of thorough training, with no pressure from a timesheet. I’d even take a pay cut to facilitate this.

We've only been talking for two days, and I'm excited to meet up, but I don't want to get too involved too fast and thought I should let him know before we continued.

The walls are thin in our apartment complex, so I can always hear when they shower, use the restroom, etc. I'm thinking their toilet might be running since there aren't any leaks or anything odd in my own apartment.

I feel like I should mind my own business and that it might be weird to tell my landlord about it, but I haven't heard them walking around at all and haven't seen their car parked out front in a few days too. I just keep thinking about the worst scenario because I have anxiety and of course everything is a catastrophe. /s

496," 

I joined a new workplace.I was focusing  hard to get going.

Once,i   noticed a female looking at me ,she was really cute. I took it as an   accident and proceeded to mind my business.For next few days, i caught   her looking at me during different instances.I took it easy and did   nothing about it(which was hard).  Couple of weeks later, i was passing   by the exit and she was there alone and our eyes met again.I gave her a   nice smile this time and she reciprocated.I remember the date as well.   Now, for next few days , i noticed her following me to the coffee   machine 8/10 times..we used to look at each other and smile . I wondered   if its a coincidence of timings but no it happened irrespective of   schedule.This routine was so understandable that she she sometimes would   make an eye contact while going for coffee and i would follow herAfter   being this sure of the situation and also of myself (because i rarely   like someone so much), i thought i would take the initiative to talk   next time we met and i did. We spoke but she seemed shy when others were   around us.

To make things easier, i   decided to talk to her on social net.platform(which i rarey use for this   purpose) and sent her  requests to add me. I only wanted to know her  as  a person and gota feeling she is committed to somone as evident from   pictures with a guy on social media She never accepted any of them. I   even dropped her a message asking her but she never replied.One fine   day(after 1 month), i asked her in person whether i am making her   uncomfortable but she said she could not recognize me on social media   and made lame excuses like she was not active. Note:She was active on   most of them and had five times the number of connections than me.I   decided to take a step back.I thought may be she changed her mind after   talking to me and does not want to talk further.I decided to stop the   routine and only smiled if we made accidental eye contact.Few days   later, she accepted  my request on a chatting platform.I sent her joke   regarding her excuses earlier and she laughed. Follwing this one in few   days, i tried to start a conversation through messages but she never   replied. Now, this was the breaking point for me.

I   asked herwhy does not she reply to messages for days.She made excuses   again.I told her i only wanted to talk , to which she said we are   talking.This made no sense to me.

I   decided to chuck it and never messaged her ever again.I stopped the   routine and made sure to greet her only if we were face to face.

Loop::But,   i would still catch her looking at me so many times. She would make   sure to say a loud ""hi"" when i was in a group(which everyone found   surprising) and she is passing by .She would keep a long gaze in my eyes   whenver we had an eye contact.

Loop continued for months.

Loop   was making me really uncomfortable as i had to put on that forced  smile  and pretend that everything is fine.TBH, i had no interest in the  thing  anymore.

I decided to stop  looking at  her at all and get away from the loop .I started acting mean  completely  avoiding her presence and sometimes pass through her. One  fine day(after  two months of this), she stopped me while i was passing  her and gave me  the news of her engagement and offered me candies she  had brought to  office. I said congrats and left.This had happned before  as well when she would stop me to offer stuff she brought which my  co-workers found very strange.This  has becaome a case study for me  now.Sorry for the long post but i need  to undrstand the logic and  psychology here.Why cant people be  straighforward.",14Feb2019,1

There’s this class I’ve got that I’m struggling to go to. My anxiety flares up like crazy in this class. I can’t really explain why, but I do need to show up; there are random reading quizzes, and they’re 15% of my grade. If it wasn’t for that I’d just show up on test days. The class is that easy.

Anyways, the biggest thing I’m struggling with is where to sit. The class is packed, there isn’t really an empty seat, and where I’ve missed so much I panic about having a seat. Last time I showed up to class, this girl next to me was basically like, “are you sitting *there*?” Kind of rudely. I offered to move, but then she said it was fine.

Anyways, I’m a silly mess and now I’m paranoid about finding a seat, because that spot was where I always sat when I *did* show up. I’m not quite sure how to get over those nerves. I know I can find a seat, but I get super nervous about it. ",14Feb2019,1

The problem is that he wants/needs to view the class on a laptop, but he doesn't want to take his laptop outside because of the heavy rain.

He asked me on Tuesday to call the tech guy to fix our internet. I forgot to until last night, at which point they couldn't get someone out until 5PM today. So, what I did was I offered to drive him to his class at 10AM in order to make up for it.

502,"To be clear, both of these are our cats. The problem is the one we've had for a while and she does not like other cats for whatever reason. Anyways, in spite of knowing this, my sister got herself a kitten about six months ago. The kitten is very sociable and tries to play with the other cats, but with this one cat in particular, it is a problem. Basically, the violent cat is out for blood. She is not playing around and will stalk and attack the kitten for absolutely no reason.

My question is, how do we get the older cat to not be openly violent anymore? The two can't be kept in separate spaces 24/7, So I was wondering what I can do to make the older cat to not be aggressive. Another thing I was wondering about is the effect the way we've been handling this aggression is having on the older cat. What basically happens is whenever the older cat is aggressively stalking/attacking the kitten, we basically scare her into running away. Like I will step in front of the older cat and like stomp on the ground really hard to terrify her into retreating, because seriously I have no patience with the older cat trying to probably kill the kiiten that honestly is so much better as a pet. I'm thinking the only thing left to do is to give up the older cat, which nobody really seems to want to go through with. ",14Feb2019,1

When I hear about the suffering of others I expect to feel something, but I don't.  Sometimes I do.  I can be concerned about the emotional suffering of others, but when it comes to physical suffering there is a disconnect.

First, I don't care about my own physical suffering.  I see it as fleeting and not a big deal.  I do have a masochistic side of me that wants to be hurt.  I might have a sadistic side as well, but I would feel guilty if I received any pleasure from someone's suffering.  

I especially have a disconnect with animal suffering.  I wonder if lack empathy somewhere.  It doesn't always come automatically.

I am really struggling with what to do, I am glad he's having a good time, but I feel like a boundary is being broken when she (not roommate but roommates girlfriend) is bringing over her partners, and is doing so regularly.  I have tried ear plugs to help fix the sound issue, but I can still hear it very clearly. I just don't know whether to confront him or what I can do to make myself more comfortable.

540,"Hi, guys. This is going to be a weird one, but I'll do my best to explain.

I clean windows full time. Today, I was doing a job at a hair salon with two gentlemen working there. As I finished up and was preparing to leave, one of them approaches me and says he needs my personal number for the other man that works there. He says he's not sure why, but probably to discuss business. 

I tell them that our company number is on their invoice, but he insists on my personal phone number. I admit, this should have been when I said no. I shouldn't give it out at work. I should have said no, because I have a boyfriend, but for some reason I felt like I couldn't because I was at work and had already messed up the job once and was back to fix the mistakes. 

I thought for a fleeting second that maybe this was a ploy to get my number to flirt, but I was quick to dismiss it on the grounds of this guy only seeing me with no makeup, hair a mess, drenched in sweat. I thought, no way is this dude trying to hit on me when I look like a hobo. I don't even get hit on when I go out dressed nicely. 

I was wrong.

 He called me a minute ago to ask me my plans for Valentine's Day. I told him that I'm actually going out with my boyfriend. He didn't back off. He said he'd call me tomorrow. I blocked his number but I might still need to explain this to my boss, since I don't want to do that job anymore for the sake of not making it horribly awkward.

My boyfriend knows and handled it really well. Agreeding that I should have said no or at least asked, but in that moment I just became anxious and when I'm anxious, I just go along with anything no matter how unusual it is. I know, big screw up. 

I'd love some advice on how to explain this to my boss. He's pretty laid back, but I don't know how I'm going to tell him that I no longer want to clean that job due to what happened.

 Thank you all for reading!

I feel so desperate to get there, and to get married and have a baby - I know I should slow my head down and just try and enjoy life but I can't help it. I just seem to be wishing it away waiting for us to get to this point. 

People and friends share lovely news that they're moving, engaged, pregnant and while I'm happy for them I mainly think about myself. How I'm jealous, how I wish I had a ring on my finger or a baby on the way.

543,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for 5 months. I've looked at his phone multiple times and have seen things I didn't like. He started talking to a girl he used to try to hook up with and I made him block her on Facebook and Instagram in October. In November I found out he had messaged a random girl on Kik messenger but only said Hey; when she replied he never answered back. About 2-3 weeks ago I looked at his phone and found out he spoke to that same girl from October over Snapchat. I called him out for it and he said she messaged him saying she missed him and all he did was say she led him on for super long and was a shitty friend. 


Since this, he's changed his phone code and in my opinion acts strange whenever his phone goes off. The other night we got back to his place after food and he instantly said he had to go to the bathroom. So then I see he's active on Facebook while in there and doesn't flush or wash his hands like normal. He used to check his phone when it went off and now he just leaves it in his pocket all the time. It also seem like he's hid certain notifications from showing on his lock screen. 


I haven't brought up the fact that he's changed his code because I know he didn't like when I went through it. We spend all our time together, besides when he's in school so I don't know if I'm just feeling insecure and he's feeling like he wants extra privacy. What should I do?

TLDR; Boyfriend changed phone code after multiple times of me going through his phone. Seems to hide his phone all the time now and I'm feeling super insecure about it and this girl that keeps trying to get at him.",14Feb2019,1

Only one boy has ever said that he liked me and when I started speaking to him and started a relationship with him he cheated on me, 4 times, and because I thought no one else would ever like me I kept going back to him. He was attractive and popular and I though this would change things for me but no one has ever shown interest in me and it's really starting to damage my self-esteem especially when I hang out with popular people and they're always in a relationship or 'doing bits' with someone. Just today I found out he has a new girlfriend, on Valentines day, after one week of breaking up with him. I've never been the jealous type but I can't help but hate myself for ending things with him, he seems so happy with her and they're (apparently) in a really good relationship.

549,"As in title, I need some ideas, as I've run out of them at the moment.

I mean that I need things to do during breaks, being in a travel, boring lectures etc. to stimulate myself. My favourite one was creating alternative future squads of football teams, but it becomes tedious after it comes to simulating the scores of the matches by own hand (and I lack any programme to do so, although I was wondering to combine it with Excel, albeit using Excel on a phone is quite uncomfortable) and to do research, I require to be online (and sometimes I do not have such an ability). Besides, I was writing lyrics for the songs, but I lack afflatus atm and sometimes it becomes so personal that it affects my mood. The games I've played on a phone so far tended to bore me and learning languages or reading books isn't that kind of stimulation - as I need to create something.

Have you got any ideas for me? Writing a book seems monotonous to me, as I dislike describing all of the things such as human looks, landscapes etc. and also I lack inspiration atm but I think I've could try, though I'm not convinced. I'm also afraid I would give it up quickly and that this is too serious enterprise, while I look more for something to chill. Sadly using Excel on a phone is tiring and there is no Access on Google Play. 

My biggest hobby is music, besides I like things such as history, philosophy, psychology and mentioned football as well.

My Dad recently quit his job in construction just before christmas after 20+ years. He'd basically had enough of the work and it was getting him really down; long hours, lots of travelling, working outside in the winter etc. Which I don't blame him for, it is really hard work, I did it for 2 years and left when I got a better job .. he was self employed as well, so not working = no pay. 

He has saved up enough to have a few months off before needing to get another job, but he's just wasting his time lazing around.

I basically wrote his CV so he could apply for new jobs and have a clean break after Christmas. He booked on courses to get new qualifications but even then he was asking the instructors if he could do it in less days so that he could have Friday off (even though he's been sat on his arse for 2 months).

If he didn't have to walk our dogs he probably wouldn't move off his chair, watching the same programmes every day and scrolling through Facebook. He doesn't eat healthy at all and smokes quite a lot. 

He was the reason I have a good work ethic. When I was growing up he was active, hard working and happy .. now he just seems depressed, unhappy and quite frankly, lazy. 

I dont want to just have a go at him all the time so i want to know:

- Has anyone had to help a loved one get out of a rut or depression? 
- What worked and what didn't?

563,"**Here's a breakdown of the situation:**

\- From the UK, started first grad job mid 2018 (sales)

\- Struggled to book meetings in general, led to my performance being reviewed, and eventually being warned if it doesn't improve there's a good chance I'm getting let go.

\- Performance temporarily improved, led to probation being extended, but now struggling again, and told there will be a performance review at the end of probation to decide whether I am fired or not.

\- I'm not massively stressed about the situation because I know sales isn't for me, and that I'd ideally like to be doing something that challenges me more and is more varied. But, it will still be a shame as I'm close with my coworkers. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, whether it would make more sense for me to quit soon (before the review) or wait until I'm fired.

I'd predominantly favour quitting to avoid wasting time when I could be trying to look for a new job(financial side is not a huge issue right now as I'm living with parents), but also to avoid the actual awkward situation of being fired. Our office is quite close-knit, so to have to practically announce being fired to the sales team is a situation I'd prefer to avoid tbh.

I (F) broke up with my ex (M) a couple of months ago. There is quite a large age gap between us, and due to this and many other pressures, I broke it off after only a few months of dating. We went radio silence, as both were hurt, but reconnected and had a heart to heart last month.

This is no issue- I am flattered, and I can ignore the rest well enough. 


However, today he turned up all of a sudden with flowers, and other gifts very centred around Valentines. I (to be blunt) don’t know how deal with this. I don’t want to date him. I want to be friends without being expected to fall in love again, let all my boundaries down, and be woo’d with gifts. I just want my mate back, and I don’t want to be uncomfortable around him.

Now the whole town knows, is trash talking us, and believes things that are no where near true.

580,"Alright before I get into the part where i ask for advice, let me give you some context on the situation at hand. I'm a 17  year old guy, who's only been in 1 relationship, and there's this girl I started talking to a couple months back (She's also 17). When we first started talking we hit it off and became good friends in no time, but this never felt enough for me. We've hung out a decent amount of times and have even gone on a ""date"". I knew that deep down I wanted something more with her and I made that clear and was told that she considers me a best friend and would never want to lose me if something were to happen (This was on New Years Day I believe). fast forward to a month ago, we talk every day about anything (she tells me about her past relationships and asks me about my own) which I really enjoy. I legitimately think about her everyday and feel happy when I get to see her. Lately, a teammate of mine has been trying to hit on her which she tells me about all the time and how she's not interested in him yet he still tries. Last night she told me that I have a better chance than him which really made me think if me and her was still a possibility despite her telling me I'm in the coveted ""Best Friend Zone"". I make sure to tell her that I really do care about her every so often (partly because I think everyone should hear it as often as possible) because it feels like the right thing to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I usually feel alone when it comes to friends, there's not many people that I trust or share my interests with, despite having an image of being a happy go lucky guy. But when I'm talking with her, be it through texting or when we hang out, I feel happy because I can be myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess what I'm trying to ask is how do i approach this situation? I don't want to ruin our friendship yet it  kinda sucks just sitting on the sidelines knowing I wouldn't take my chances. I know this was kinda rambling but I feel like I needed to write it somewhere. If there's any other information you think I should mention, let me know.",14Feb2019,1

582,"I hope this is an acceptable subreddit to post this in. My apologies if it's not.

I want to start going hiking with my dog but otherwise alone and want to learn how to do so safely. There are local hiking trails that seem interesting but I'm unsure of what supplies I'd need to bring with me and what kind of safety precautions to take, if any. I'm not going to be hiking long distances or anything. Just finding local trails to walk my dog on and trying to explore my city and possibly other places in New Mexico.

588,"I just got my first job recently, started on Monday and worked Wednesday, and Friday coming up. I started working at a certain fast-food place and I was never really told about my job description or what I would be making. This is my first job and the interview was with a regional manager so I figured maybe that was up to manager discretion instead. The first day went fine while I was being trained, I had a lot of duties to juggle but I figured I would give it a chance, and there was some downtime occasionally so that helped. On the second day all of my duties were the same but I was doing them by myself for the most part (Even though there was someone else working the same position as me, they were usually occupied with something else) but later in the day I was stuck with one thing after another that my trainer from the previous day had told me to do. There was no room to take a break just to grab something to drink or use the restroom even and I was exhausted, my feet were killing me, and I was constantly being told by the person previously training me that I need to pick up the pace and kept trying to tell me how to mop or sweep the three fourths of the kitchen I was stuck with and complaining to me about how they needed more of something thrown in the oven ""two hours ago"" and how I need to check constantly to see if something is out instead of having someone inform me while I'm stuck with my constant tasks that I need completed. All of this would have been frustrating and I would understand if things were hectic but most of the kitchen, at least three or so other people (the person training me included) were standing around chatting most of the time while I busted my ass and couldn't get a drink of water even until the end of my five and a half hour shift. I was infuriated and stressed out by the end of it that I was actively talking back to the person training me, they're full of sass as well, being a bit younger than me as I am 19. I don't know whether to give it another try and see if it gets better or just to try and quit in a civil manner before I explode in frustration and end up wasting the regional manager's time and my own. The only reason I am unsure is because I have had only two days on the job so far and it's my first job, the hours are great as well but I don't know if it's worth it to stress myself out.

590,"Last semester (I'm a junior in college), I copied some work from a source for a paper I was writing. I meant to change it, but I was using it as a placeholder because I had a lot of work to do and I needed something to knit the paper together. I think it was just evidence and not analysis. 

My professor ran everything through a plagiarism checker and emailed me that I had copied seven words directly from a source. The other things were merely not cited correctly, so I don't count them. I'm usually very careful with my work — if I use any sources I change the sentences once I'm done writing my central point or I cite them. 

The plagiarism charges were eventually dropped because I dropped the class and some other stuff, and very few people outside of close friends and family know about this, but I can't help but still think about it. I used to think of myself as a pretty strong writer, and I want to go into journalism, but now I don't know if I can because I feel like I can't take my writing seriously because I did such an egregious act. Quite honestly, I feel like I can't have a future because I did this thing, that was so drilled into me since high school — really since I was old enough to write — because I fucked up.

591,"I am 22, you’d think by now I’d have a solid grasp on social etiquette in general. Wrong, I truly don’t. It’s practically a disaster.

I don’t know why I feel this dread and constant anxiety. I can speak in front of people, speak on stage debate I am very confident in speaking in a formal set up.  But once it becomes strictly social I truly struggle. It sometimes feels like my voice won’t even come out of me, I’d say something and t comes out as a faint whisper.

592,"For starters, I live in a very small town. Less than 1,000 people, backwoods country, etc. Drama spreads fast. Additionally, all parties involved are minors.

A couple days ago, a guy we'll call Isaac approached me and was very flirty. Turned him down, because I told him I have a boyfriend. He proceeded to talk shit, saying my boyfriend is a pussy, they could fight, etc. I responded calmly, saying my boyfriend was indeed not a pussy, then leaving the situation. 

I tell my boyfriend about this encounter because, well, I know if he heard someone trash talking me I would want to know. Boyfriend proceeds to text Isaac, saying he isn't a pussy, but he really doesn't want to fight either. He simply asks that Isaac not flirt with me, no beef. 

Isaac goes and talks more trash about my boyfriend to multiple people, claiming my boyfriend is a pussy for not wanting to fight, he's scared. My boyfriend responds rashly and says fine, if you want to fight let's do it. 

Isaac says he won't fight some random person, and then insists that my boyfriend send a pic of himself. Boyfriend sends said photo, and Isaac agrees to fight whilst blasting it on social media.

My boyfriends decision to fight was an 'I'm angry so this is a great idea', descision and now that he's calmed down, he regrets it. 

I didn't want them to fight from the beginning, so I text Isaac and tell him not to because fighting is stupid (I was busy while Isaac and boyfriend were texting), especially if its for no reason.

596,"Looking for advice related to money, maturity, and just life in fucking general. 

My fiancé and I have no idea what we're doing; I feel like most 19 year olds don't. However, the problem is that we need to at least get our shit together enough to survive. Due to family situations, both of us have been \*mostly\* financially independent since we could start working at 16 (my parents still help me with a lot of things, which I am very thankful for, but my fiancé is almost 100% on his own when it comes to money). My fiancé and I owned one car between the two of us. We bought it used and not in the best shape. T-Rex (the car) has lasted us over 3 years, but it seems as if his life might be coming to an end. He is currently undrivable, and we are looking at either a very expensive fix, or buying a different car. Neither of our families have the means to help us out with this, so we are pretty much on our own. We know everything will eventually turn out okay, but a working car is pretty necessary for what we're doing in life right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

My fiancé has an on-campus job that restricts him to 9 hours a week. I don't know if he could handle more hours anyway, because of his course load and other responsibilities. I had a job, have been out of work for 2 months because I am transferring schools (I am going to attend his school. There is a specific reason that I had to make the hasty decision to transfer in the middle of a year, but the tuition will be cheaper anyway). I tried to get a job here at home, but nobody wanted to hire me for such a short amount of time. I'm going to look for a job anywhere and everywhere once I start school there (beginning of March) and take whatever job I can, hopefully, find. 

&amp;#x200B;

Though we are engaged, we realize that we won't have funds for a wedding for quite some time (we want an incredibly small and simple wedding, but it is still beyond our financial means at the moment), so a wedding isn't even something we're concerned about.

Any budgeting and saving advice, as well as ideas on how to make extra money are appreciated. I've already sold most of my books to a used bookstore, volunteered my services for odd jobs, and scoured the internet for ways to make extra money.

597,"Should go on with relationship? If so How do i handle this problem?

Grammar warning 
(Some background) I've been in this relationship with a girl for about 5 years now. She is a high school sweetheart i fell in love with after our 1st year. We barely ever have any arguments and our love for each other seems mutual. Currently it is a long distance relationship that is not so long distance. She lives around 60-70 miles away and almost every weekend i drive up there to go see her witch is no problem for me; i enjoy the solitude that comes with this type of travel (she would drive up if it wasn't for a recent car accident witch totaled her vehicle on the way to my apartment). 
We have both had our share of depression. Ive been through a gauntlet of intrusive thinking, depression, anxiety, ptsd and was given a few other labels i don't care to mention throughout the years but am doing considerably better and would like to think i have some experience with psychological and or life problems. But in the context of intimate relationships i have next to none other than a previous gf witch was a disaster beyond comparison. My current gf on the other hand also has depression and some minor anxiety problems i can sympathize with and help her through it as best i can. 
(one issue) There's not a lot to go off of because shes very reserved about her issues and tends to keep them to herself. She makes a point to be independent as a way of not expressing her feelings. I admire her wanting to be independent but not to the point of emotionally isolating herself. seems unhealthy to me. More my own problem, she often contests to hear my more complex problems which tend to be repetitive. (i sort of understand this and I'm getting better at dealing with my own problems). This to me makes me feel a big disconnect when she refuses to talk to me about her problems because it seems 1 sidede, and honestly i would like to hear them because i like the idea of being able to lean on each other and keep our mental relationship healthy.
(Hear is the main problem) 
I'm a vary active person. I love doing things that make my heart race like working out and doing  things that push me out of my comfort zone and always wanted a partner to do those things with. Unfortunately a lot of times after i make the drive over to her apartment, we do a lot of sleep. And i don't mean having sex, i mean just laying down and taking a nap sometimes for hours. A lot of the activites we do together are downright boring and she has expressed to me that she fears this idea. Most of the time when i suggest even simple physical activity like going for a walk, it is usually met with ""lets watch TV, its too cold, I'm too tiered lets take a nap"" or we will go out to eat (it is vary rare when we do anything more excitable). I value these activities to a degree but not to the point of devoting all my free time to them. I understand this probably hase something to do with how much school she has to deal with and the depression (i used to sleep as an escapism technique when i was dreadfully depressed). Usually i end up going for a walk or run by myself while I'm there. I've tried getting her off the couch to do something more active considering her mental health, exercise being an important factor as to how i deal with my own mental health. Unfortunately not a lot that i say is good enough...
I don't claim to be perfect or even half way to it. I will accept any constructive criticism that is given to me but most of all i just want advice on how to handle this. I love her and i want her to be happy and have made it so at times at the expense of my own happiness, and would continue to do just that. But its getting vary difficult, I'm at a crossroads and I'm not willing to sacrifice most of myself.

TLDR- how do i get and my depressed gf off the couch.",14Feb2019,1

It’s all about the ladies. IM SORRY 😩 Yes, she may get you a gift &amp; maybe some bedroom boom boom. Be thankful! Show her how appreciative you are for it &amp; her. Here’s another secret .... when you show her that attention of how grateful you are that’s going to make her feel all ooey gooey inside and horny! When she feels good and appreciated she’s gonna make sure her man feels good in return ....... if you know what I’m saying 😉. 
Did you know we are all have greed..... yes even your girl. So listen up 
 IF you are the couple that says ohhhhh he doesn’t have to get me a gift we don’t have to celebrate valentines because I knowwww he LOVES me. SHE LYING ! Lies - lies -Lies 
Ok because what’s said out loud is just a filter 
The greed intervenes and deep down inside she really wants you to at least try and surprise her even if it’s something simple and do it anyways despite of what was said.  
For the guys who usually buys their lady a gift for valentines but doesn’t make any effort through out the year to show appreciation for her other than Valentine’s Day , your women are  thankful for your gifts especially What you do for her is special because she doesn’t get anything through the year from you. I’m sorry but ...... she’s going to get on Facebook and see someone else’s valentines post and feel that greed we all have. Because their valentines  was better than hers in some ounce of some kind of way.  I’m sorry 😐 
I’m not saying go out and buy her a gift or go all out for her every few weeks ( I mean if your financially able to have that lifestyle and can do so what ever fits your life) (I’m sure she won’t mind) but if you can get a pack of sticky notes and leave her a surprise note  in her car for when she leave the house, the bathroom mirror, her pillow , on the OJ in the fridge where ever she goes in the house just 1 every week or every few weeks sweet love notes , a coupon , a heart WHAT EVER you want to say sweet her.  That could help your relationship tremendously. When your woman feels appreciated she’s going to make sure your taken care of.
Listen to her talk every time you hear her say things that need fixing or she wishes or needs or wants, make a list in your phone on a note pad don’t try to remember it please. List them as what is a priority first. For future gifts/ occasions or to make her happy 
I hope this is helpful in some kind of way ! 
Ps remember if you surprise her making her feel  all ooey gooey inside what happens.....

602,"Hey,
For all of highschool I've been friends with 4 other girls. I used to be close to this one girl, let's call her A. We were good friends and used to talk after school often ( in GR 9 and 10). In gr9, we met this guy that we all talk to very often, and A became close to him ( but for some reason, pretends to hate him and says she doesn't talk to him, but everytime we hang out, she calls him, and every night they FaceTime, but that's besides the point). Our friend group would hang out, we'd all talk on a group chat and hang out together outside school. It was fun. We were a good and close friend group. In gr11, we were pretty good friends too. We'd all hang out together and extend invitations to each other. I began noticing how much A lies and how it's about such useless things ( like lying about her family being vegan but her parents bring her McDonalds at school, her saying that she's moving into a mansion and going up to finding a picture of a mansion then never moving there, saying how she hates a certain food but eats it all the time, bringing a lava cake to school for lunch and saying she baked it but when I went to her house she didn't even know how to turn on the oven or how to measure butter, dumb things like that). In gr11, I noticed that A and another  friend, let's call her B were getting really close. I felt all of us as a group were equally close but A told me at some point how she thinks her and B are closer and me and C are closer. I told her I think I'm equally as close to her than to b or c. She also said one time that after highschool she doesn't plan on talking to us ever again. that summer, I asked the group if they wanted to hang out, but A told me that she was working everyday and B told me she was busy. I thought ok, well, C and I can still hang out, so I invite her over. She gets a snapchat for A AND B showing them hanging out together. Whatever, it's okay, I confront A about that a little later and she says that it's because she sweeps everything under the rug as work because she didn't think she had to give me a reason for not hanging out with me. I was like okay but in my head I thought it was still rude because why couldn't they have had extended the invitation to me and C, since we never ever hang out without them without asking them first. Through that summer, we figured out that they would hang out all the time without us, without asking us, ever ( they would also send up pictures of them hanging out together). They also posted pictures of them hanging out together on Instagram. Sometime in gr11, she also showed everyone her Reddit account and showed us all the funny comments she posted. A few months later I checked again and saw that she talked tons of shit about us. I talked to C about it in confidence and C was shocked. Fast forward gr12. By now, I really stopped being close to A. I stopped making as much of an effort to keep convos going and couldn't take her word for anything because I knew about how much she lied. She's a compulsive liar so I couldn't believe or trust  her and the things she said on her Reddit were rude, so I just stopped trusting her and being close to her. A few weeks into gr12 she suddenly switched to another school, 5 days after telling us. She told b before everyone else, then the guy, then me, and after she told me, I told c, and c called A and a told her. She did this over phone and didn't give anyone a real reason why she's switching out. Just as she does, made a really unthought compulsive decision. B,C, the guy and I talked about the situation, and we all thought it was really dumb and compulsive, but whatever, her life, she can make it difficult if she wants. I told her I thought it was really a bad decision, but even though I don't support her decision, I support her and wish her the best. After she left, B,C and I started talking and we all agreed that it was a dumb decision but also someone brought up something she does that bothers all of us. Let's say I showed her a song, she'd sing this song, learn it on the piano and come back the next day and say to all of us "" do you guys now this song?"" When I showed her the song!! We'd go buy something together like fake nails and she'd later be like ""hey B, I like your nails, hey alone pool, have you ever done fake nails?"". She also seems to retell her stories over and over again and use terms she learnt from other people and it's just so boring to me to talk to her because she only talks about her work and doesn't ask any questions and says the same stories over and over again, so none of our convos are actually good. I don't know why she'd do this all the time, but she always does it. Of course, a week later she came back to the school because she didn't think her shit through, and the whole day, she avoided eyr contact and didn't talk to me or C. She was entirely fine with B, but me and C, she was ignoring. When she arrived to the school, she didn't even say hi. I told her it's obvious she's pissed but could she at least let me know why. She said later. That night, I texted her asking her why she's mad and she said she's done with our friend group, we're always mad and talk shit about her all the time without confronting her. First off, it might not seem like it in this post, but I'm a really chill person. I don't think I ever showed her that I was mad at her, and people even told me I'm too nice and that they never ever saw me mad ( she even agreed with it at some point). On the other hand, B and C get mad often, and give attitude when they're mad. I told a that she knows I'm really not Moody and barely get mad. She agreed and said that applies to C (idk why not B, because B get mad as often). Then I asked her when did I ever talk shit? And told her that if the only like 2 times I was upset with her I confronted her, meanwhile she absolutely NEVER EVER confronted me about things (when from her Reddit account, she was talking mad shit and had a lot of things she didn't confront us about). She was even probably planning to ignore me the whole day but I asked her why she's mad. She wasn't even going to confront me then but I confronted HER about why she's mad. She answered my question and said NVM but then started talking about how she's not close with our group anymore and doesn't even consider herself to be part of the group, how she hangs out with another group instead ( but it's obviously not true because she's hung out with us everyday since 9th grade at lunch time, and the other group don't see her as part of her group, it's really obvious), how she was never really close to us and how she's done with us and all our drama. Once again, I asked her if she can clarify on her point of drama because I absolutely stay away from all drama and there's literally no drama in our group except for little problem primarily caused by HER, like every 6 months. Also, side note, she also said she wanted to change schools because there's no drama in our school and she wants real highschool drama. Whatever, convo ends and things are sorted out, but I'll still never see her the same way but she's in my friend group. Sometime later, the guy and A were talking about something and the guy said ""A, I'll expose you"". I know for sure, there's no doubt that A talked shit about me to the guy, but whatever. Anyways forward to now, I'm really not close to her at all, but we're a group of 4. Last week, the guy was like, ""hey A did you go to work yesterday?"" A was like "" no I switched my schedule because that annoying guy was working"" he was like "" oh the guy that doesn't talk and says short answers?""

I barely talk to her but she's in our friend group so I feel obliged to talk to her. I don't know, am I right to feel this way? How do I deal with this girl when I always have in the back of my mind all the bad shit she's done, how much of a major compulsive liar she is (she legit lies constantly). I just don't know how she's making friends if she's this way. I just don't know how to deal with her and there's so much more shit she does and says but I can't write all of it here. Am I right to feel this way? How can I deal with her? Thanks so much if you read all of this.",14Feb2019,1

609,"Backstory: For some reason in second year of uni I started getting really anxious before my lab practicums (for nursing). It got to the point where I started having panic attacks and blacking out whenever I went in. I failed a course because of it and had to be put back a year in the program. I redid the course and got accommodations in the form of extra time and I met with my lab instructor one-on-one to go over the material a few days before the exam, and I did really well. This semester, I had a lab exam in another course and I decided I wouldn't use the accommodations because I felt really good about the material and I never used to have a problem with lab exams besides that course I failed. In the exam I blacked out again and don't remember anything. I got my mark back and it's a 20%. I explained the situation but my prof says she doesn't do retests and she can't do anything to help me get that mark up. At this point I need a 90% in the final practicum to pass the course. Is there anything I can do? Does she have to help me in some way if I had an actual panic attack??? I know I should have got the accommodations or said something when I was having a panic attack but I literally blacked out.

615,"Hey all, I'm looking for some advice on how to persuade my management team to reconsider a request to relocate to another office.       
Some background: I work in an admin support type role. The company I work for currently only has one office in the region I live but they will be opening a second office that will be located within a 5 minute walk form my house. Currently my commute takes me an hour and a half each way, for a total daily commute of 3 hours. I immediately made a request via email to my manager to be considered to relocate to the new office when it opens this summer. I asked for her to give me the opportunity to speak to her about it in person but got no reply (she replied to other emails about other topics).       
I had to get her to sign something so while I was in her office I asked if she had read my email and if she had any thoughts.      

She told me that the new office will be ""project based"" (have no idea what that even means) and that my position is not one of the positions being considered to relocate.       

Honestly, I'm really angry. Working in admin support role, there's nothing currently about my position that immediately disqualifies me from working in another office as I have worked remotely from home on occasion. The vast majority of company communication is done across multiple platforms (email, skype, video conferencing), and all of our documentation is on Sharepoint paltforms.     
I also live in one of the most expensive cities in the world and the cost of housing, coupled with commute concerns for staff has resulted in lost employee retention and was one of the main reasons for the company to decide to open the second office.      
To be immediately disqualified from the opportunity to relocate to the second office, as an employee with one of the longest commutes, not only seems vastly unfair but it makes little business sense from my perspective.       

How would others go about dealing with this situation? Any advice on what I could do or say going forward to influence this decision by management?",14Feb2019,1

Some time after she added me on snap she snapped me and asked what I was doing. I was under the influence of marijuana so I didn't think and just chatted. Somehow we ended up in phone call and I think I said something stupid bc she blocked me on snap. Before that we made plans to hangout w/ me her and a friend.

We went to watch some movie. After it ended the girl looked cold so I gave her my jacket. She seemed to like it.  We listen to some good ass music on the way back to my place.

620,"This is kind of a long story, so bear with me. In October 2018 a high schooler I tutor told me that her cat gave birth and asked if I wanted one of the kittens. I agreed because I've never had my own cat before and I was super flattered. She even let me choose the one I wanted--a black male, who like everyone had asked this girl for. However, I knew I'd have to wait until around Christmas-time for it to be old enough for me to pick him up. She gladly agreed to save him for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I live with my grandparents currently and as soon as soon as I got home, I told everyone that I was getting a cat. There's already a cat at my house and my dad is allergic, so my little sister kept making jokes about me wanting to ""kill my dad"". Everything was great and no problems arose.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to a few days after Christmas on the day that I'm supposed to pick up this kitten. I'm looking around for an extra litterbox because I assumed we had an extra one. I asked my grandpa if we had one in the garage and immediately he asks why and states that I, under no circumstances, can have a cat.

&amp;#x200B;

He claimed that I had never once brought the subject up to him (which is a lie) and that we already had too many animals. At the time we had 2 dogs and 1 cat; however, one of the dogs was getting put down like the following week. I assured him that the cat was MINE and that it would live in MY ROOM, but he wouldn't hear it.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, I went and picked up the cat anyway. He even called me when I was out and reiterated that I could not ""bring that cat under \[his\] roof"". However, my grandma just told me to keep him in the backyard at first, since my room has a connecting door to the yard.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been over a month and he still has no idea about this kitten (or if he does, he hasn't said anything). I have since fully moved this kitten into my room and everyone loves him. Tomorrow I'm going to be going out of town for the weekend and my little sister is cat-sitting for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm worried that he's going to be super lonely with me gone, seeing as he spends most of his time in my room, and that he'll cry a lot or constantly escape my room....in which case, my grandpa will find out and all hell will break loose probably. So I'm asking you guys if I should just tell my grandpa about the kitten before I leave to prevent that type of situation. But that could also start a huge fight and he could try to take him to the pound or something (which he has threatened to do with our now PREGNANT other cat's unborn kittens).

623,"TL;DR at the bottom folks
Burner account, mobile, bad formatting and all of that jazz aside:

I feel like I push people away. I’m an extroverted person, been that way since I was a kid (currently 16f, turning 17 next year)

But ever since I turned about 11 and the ability to enter competitions has been presented to me people have started exponentially liking me less.  See, I want to be a scientist. I like Physics, Chemistry, Maths, Astrophysics and all of that good stuff. I don’t believe that I am especially smart, I just have these interests and I am willing to put in the work to pursue them. 


When I was a younger kid, I was relatively successful, but was forced to enter competitions in fields such as Geography or my mother tongue by overly ambitious teachers, which I was okay at, but wasted so much time practicing those that I achieved mediocre results in the things I actually loved. 

 Last year, after entering a new school I decided to quit pursing things I wasn’t interested in and my results improved GREATLY and I was proud of the hard work I put in and the knowledge I had acquired. Finally, it was all worth it! 

But, there’s a catch!

When I entered high school roughly a year and a half ago, people liked me. I had friends and was quite popular in my class. 
Competition season rolled around (January-May in my country).  I managed to get some pretty good results (won’t reveal for privacy’s sake) that I was proud of and met my amazing boyfriend in the process (yay for scientist relationships).  He is currently at uni and we are long distance half of the time and “normal” the other half. 
 
Teachers would mention me quite a lot since only one boy in the school and I went to national/international competitions and won stuff in those, I’m from a small town and a mediocre school. 
The other kids didn’t like that.

Suddenly, everybody around me started disliking me. They started ignoring me, then passive aggressively insulting me, then full on insulting me and it reached a boiling point when a girl who I previously considered a friend publicly accused me of some bad things I never did and insulted me, the few friends I had left, my looks, my intelligence and, what hurt me the most, my relationship. Everybody saw it and lots of people believed that I went on to hurt her, which I honestly never did. 

I figured back when I got my bf and managed to succeed in a couple of fields that my friends would be happy for me. I’m always ecstatic when the other dude from my school I mentioned earlier achieves something because I am genuinely happy for him. He is currently a close friend of mine and is one of the few people who still like me. 

I’m about at the point where my only friends are people I’ve met while entering different science competitions, including my boyfriend, and the number totals to about 3-4, including him. I genuinely try not to brag and only mention these things when necessary, but of course, teachers mention it pretty often. 
I just want to stop feeling like almost everybody hates me. 


What the hell do I do? Do I stop trying to achieve stuff in the hopes of people liking me or do I keep being miserable at school and continue with my life?

I try to hide it when I succeed in something, it’s literally only done for ME because I want to succeed. I’ve worked hard for it and I shouldn’t even be forced to hide it, but that’s what the school psychologist told me (she was also a real bitch and told me that I am making the other kids feel bad and that it’s my fault... I never tell them anything bad about them, I only work on my own future and had they worked as hard they’d be successful too)

Should I give up my dreams in order to be less miserable because of how much people hate me right now?


TL;DR:
Used to have friends at school. Became successful in competitions and achieved some stuff I was happy about and hoped they would share my happiness. Also found a bf. People turned on me and publicly lied about me and called me horrible things. Down to just a couple of fellow science nerd buddies. Should I stop competing and give up my dreams of becoming a successful scientist in order not to be fucking hated?",14Feb2019,1

626,"About midway through last year, I started to develop a crush on my friend in my friend group at the time, who I’ll refer as RG (real girl) RG and I became close friends, and I found out that she was bi. 

Fast forward to the next school year and she keeps switching between calling herself gay and bi. Not wanting to risk it, I kept my mouth shut about my feelings. It’s December now and winter break starts with my long time online friend, who I’ll be referring to as OG (Online girl) confesses her feelings to me, and we become a couple (I’m not sure if that’s weird or not, but from what I’ve heard it’s not that uncommon) over winter break we become very loving and stuff. She tells me about some pretty personal family stuff, her sleep disorder, and her self doubt. I try my very best to make her happy and be a supportive boyfriend for about two months, and she and I grow closer and closer. She feels comfortable around me, and I feel comfortable around her.

Randomly in a class, RG’s friend (who I didn’t know all that all) randomly asks me if I knew RG. Confused, I said yes and he didn’t ask anything else. I didn’t think much of it until a few days ago when I joined a new gym class with RG, her friend, and my friend who was the only person I had told about my crush on her the year prior. 

RG’s friend randomly mentions to me that he had asked me back then because RG had told him that she had a crush on me. RG overhears this and starts denying it, saying she had just come up with a random name when questioned, so that she wouldn’t have to tell him about her real crush who she said lived in Canada, before quickly switched what she said to Vermont. She doesn’t provide a name when questioned, and quickly tries to change the subject. The whole way it was delivered seemed very forced, and like she was lying. She had always seemed to be subtly flirting with me occasionally (although I’m very bad at spotting that so I might have been wrong) and the few days after that she started to talk to me even more then usual. Iv come to the conclusion that she does in fact like me. 

But here comes my dilemma- online relationships don’t really last from what Iv heard, and here my crush is, and I’m practically certain that she likes me. OG has said multiple times how much she’d hate to lose me, and seems very invested in me. I do love her and if she were real then I would never even dream of leaving her. The thing is though a real girl might be into me and I don’t want RG (who has a history of depression and self-Harm btw) to be not only led on by my very bad attempts of subtle flirting in the past, but I also might still have feelings for her. 

Overall I’m just very overwhelmed, lost, and confused of what to do in this situation, any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time on this strangely Valentines themed question ",14Feb2019,1

     So I am a 14 year old in the 8th grade. I have a friend group that consists of 7 people we that became friends in the middle of 6th grade. Mind you they all came from the same school besides me and one other kid named I’ll call Alex . We were all fine in the beginning of the year but starting around November Alex kind of started acting strange towards me. We used to be pretty close up until 7th grade but all of a sudden he just ignored me when I talked and just kind of avoided me. I haven’t talked to him about it because I’m horrible at doing things like that but I’ll try to work on it. 
     There is another kid I’ll call Nate. Me and him were never that close but we were pretty good friends. When fortnite blew up last year he was the only one at school who was good at it so we all tried to play with him and that was a lot of fun up until he started to take the game way to serious and got mad at all of us when we did something like die in the game. At the beginning of this year he started to play with the “popular” kids at our school and after this he started to act pretty mean. He would call younger kids gay, retarded, etc. He also started to just avoid me and make mean comments about everyone here.He never did this up until now and this is my opinion but once he started to play with those kids, his ego became so big because he never did something like this, he was always kind of shy-ish. He is also has ups and downs with only me. He randomly starts to ignore me and call me names and stuff like that.
     There is one more kid I’m gonna mention and I’ll call him Tom. Tom was a super shy kid when I met him at a Halloween party but he went to school with the 6 other kids in my “friend” group. Everyone hated on this kid at the beginning and **Nate absolutely hated him.** Everyone would call him names, flame him for something we all do like trip or something like that. Well anyways, me Tom and 2 other kids started talking outside of school and became closer. We all had sleepovers and stuff like that but out of nowhere the 2 other kids just started hating him. I still played with him though. I helped him play the games I play and we would always play together but that was only for a 2 week period and then he just ditched me to go back to those other kids.
     Now I’m gonna talk about what’s been going on recently. Everyone in the group has kind of changed in attitude with me besides 3 people. The rest are just starting to act different. For example today at lunch I had to go buy some hot lunch but by the time I got back to the table I usually sit at, Tom was sitting at our table (which he sometimes does but moves) and another kid I didn’t know. Not one person told either kid to move. I was kind of sad because one kid I started to become closer with didn’t even care. I asked Tom to move and he just said no I was here and everyone just stayed silent besides Alex. He said “no we want him here more than you!” . I went over to the kid I barley knew and I asked him and just just said no. I just shook my head and sat down at an empty table behind them. I just had to sit and watch them laugh a lot and they didn’t even care at all. 
     None of this kind of behavior happened at all in 6th or 7th grade and it all just started out of nowhere. I am really looking to know how I can deal with this. For now I’m asking some other friends in my classes if they have open seats at their tables for lunch.

632,"I met this girl when I was 14 (in 2014) at a library and we ended up becoming friends through email (she was from Washington State and visiting her aunt). In 2016 I told her my feelings through Facebook messenger and we started ""talking"" to each other and we wanted a future together and a family but she wasn't out and shit got really fucking complicated and she just stopped talking to me. She stopped responding to my emails and everything. That was in 2016 and we haven't talked in about two going on three years. The funny thing though is that I don't hate her of anything like that. I'm still kinda angry and sad that she left me hanging like that but she's genuinely a good person and I want her to be happy with someone even if it's not gonna be me. She deserves the world. I never wanna go through that again. We were in a situation-ship and I'm never going that again. The next person I mess around with has to be the last.

635,"I’m 30 year old man, in a relationship of over 5 years, with 25 year old woman.

But I’m really struggling to cope with my insecurities about our sex life, and in particular my performance. 

Hope you guide me to the best help..

Starting in the beginning, when I was 20, I had a difficult spell of depression after an early relationship failed. 

Fast forward, I meet my current partner when I’m 25. We meet at work and get on great, instantly attracted to each other on every level. We try to have sex and I fail to get an erection and we leave it there for the night. This happens several more times where we fail to have sex on multiple occasions. Despite these struggles, we start a relationship, begin to have a healthier sex life as I am able to get an erection, naturally, although with the odd hiccup where I fail to keep an erection. 

Fast forward to now, we live together and I’m worried I’m failing as a sexual partner. My insecurities are:
• Low body confidence - I’m still in okay shape, not overweight but feel like she doesn’t have the desire to rip my clothes off like I do for her
• Penis size - there’s always lighthearted  talk about the partner of her colleague that apparently has large manhood
• Pleasuring her - she’s never been particularly vocal during sex but sometimes she seems almost bored - literally on her iPhone or Apple Watch. I can please her with oral sex but I don’t think she’s ever orgasmed through intercourse

I’m now in a real hole of self pity and low confidence where I feel like I can’t please her, I’m becoming more upset with myself which is exacerbating the issue. I can’t help but feel that someone else would make her so much happier. 

When I try to talk to her about it, she gets angry, she doesn’t feel comfortable about open conversations about our sex life - as if it’s an admission that things aren’t great. 

Please help - am I ignoring some issues I’m harbouring that I should talk through in counselling? Am I ignoring some mental health concerns? Or do I just need to get better in bed?

I just want some honest advice. Please.",14Feb2019,1

644,"Currently sitting in my fathers hospital room. After having a plasmacytoma 14 years ago he was told he was cured but 4 years ago it came back in the form of aggressive multiple myeloma. I spent hours and hours researching everything we could do. We went to the best hospitals. But after 4 years of fighting, over 5 different lines of chemo, countless cycles, radiation, it's came back so aggressive there was nothing we could do in time. He didn't meet the requirements for the clinical trials we felt could save him. He didn't have time for a donor transplant that might have worked and as hard as i tried we didn't get any sort of investigational drugs approved by the time it had consumed his entire abdomen. I still wish i would face reached out to the pharmaceutical companies that made the treatment we thought would work earlier for expanded access to the drug. I recieved an email back from them yesterday but it was far too late. His oncologist said she was calling to try to get these things done as well. 

We forced him to go to the ER on Sunday and all he wanted to do was stay home. I think he already knew. When my mom told me on Monday that it had spread i left work immediately. By the time i got there the decision had been made. Nothing else could be done for him except make him comfortable. His oncologist called and i pleaded with her to try something. She said it would only extend his misery and probably make it worse. We asked my dad and he said he would do whatever we wanted but he just wanted to go home. A wish we weren't able to fill. 

Hospice couldn't get the equipment to our house until today, 2 days later, and the doctors didn't think he would last that long. They were worried we wouldn't be able to control his pain without the equipment and he would suffer and we'd feel responsible. They also felt he wouldn't make the 2 hour ambulance ride back to our small town. By tuesday afternoon he had become almost completely unresponsive. We're going on 48 hours since he's said a word. They took him off fluids Tuesday morning. The myeloma had taken his left kidney 4 years ago and the current myeloma was destroying his right one. On Monday he was already severely dehydrated and yet 2 days without water and he still presses on. Tuesday night he became agitated and was grabbing at his mask so they gave him ativan. It's the only thing that seens to give him peace so we have the nurse give him more every 4 to 5 hours. Since then he hasn't been restless. 

I don't see any reason to make him consciously experience this anymore than he has to. We continue to play him music and talk to him. They told me i could say my last words to him on Tuesday but i didn't say anything. Everything either of us would say we already knew. My dad was never an ""I love you"" dad but i never once questioned his love for me. We had more of an actions speak louder than words relationship and he absolutely was there for me every single time i needed him. Or even when i didn't. Without judgment. With a smile on his face. We never had deep conversations about life but he didn't really have those with anyone. He was just a live in the moment sort of person. 

I graduated college the winter before he got sick. I moved back home and already something wasn't right but it would be 6 months before they found the mass. At the time i was trying to decide how far away i wanted to move away from home for an engineering job. I'm so glad i stayed. I was still doing construction (what i had done every summer) when they found the mass. I took off work to take him to radiation every day for 9 weeks. At 5'9 he got down to 123 lbs. I helped him get dressed, put his shoes on, it was a whole different perspective of this guy who i had grown up looking up to like he was a superhero. Then 2 months later it came back, and the next remission he would get 2 years. I started a local engineering job that didn't really have much to do with my particular interests but i got to spend time with my dad. I constantly 2nd guess whether i should move away to a better job during that time. All my friends from college had moved to these places I've needed even seen. But I'll never have to worry if i did the right thing. I'm so glad i stayed home. 

So as i lay here typing this out on my phone i listen to my dad, wondering which breathe will be his last. So confused because i would finnnne anything to spend one more minute with him but at the same time wishing he could be at peace. So many emotions. I'm mad i didn't try to get that treatment sooner. I'm mad he doesn't get to live longer. I'm sad he'll never get to experience all the things that are yet to come in my life. I'm mad we find it humane to put our pets out of misery but we force fellow humans to suffer through every last second of these horrible diseases. I'm mad we couldn't get him home while he was still conscious. I'm mad we couldn't get him home at all and give him his last wish.

Most of all I'm worried for my mom. They have been together since high school. Married since she was 19. They were inseparable. They did everything together. My dad was always on the go. Even during treatment he couldn't sit still for long. I don't worry about her taking care of herself. She's always paid the bills and everything but her life will change so drastically. So far she's seemed so strong. She broke down with me when the oncologist called while we were in the ER. But since then she's been a rock. Idk if she had accepted this, like my dad had, before we ever got the news. Maybe it had happened sometime in the last 9 months since the cancer had been refractory to all treatments with visit after visit to the hospital. I think she was as tired as my dad even though i know she never would have given up. I think what we did for my dad extended his life years. I think many places wouldn't have been able to handle this case. I think we gave him some great last few years and i'm so happy i got to be a part of it. Even through all the hospital visits and months stuck inside because he was immunosuppressed. 

I can usually always tell what my moms thinking. We're very close and i can almost always know what's going on but I'm so lost right now. I can't tell how she is. Has it not hit yet? Is she in denial? Is she trying to stay strong for me? Did she already accept what had happened?

They found out the cancer had turned more aggressive on her birthday weekend just over 2 weeks ago and now it's Valentine's day and she's about to lose her husband of 34 years. She has to be as mad and sad and confused as me. So i just sit here, waiting for whatever she need's from me. 

I can honestly say as a single guy my perspective has really changed after this. I really do wish my dad could have met his future grandchildren but it hasn't been something I've thought of much before now. Between work and helping them i didn't have much time. But maybe this is really selfish but when i die i want to be surrounded by as much love as my dad had this past week. He was a great father, husband, brother, etc. And it's times like these it shows.  I want that inseparable love he had with my mom. I want to do as well for my children as he had done for me. And i wish he would have been able to see me do it. Sometimes i wish i would have told him that but i know he already knew. ",14Feb2019,1
645,"Title pretty much says it all haha - I [F19] am in such a wonderful relationship [M21] right now and I am seriously in love with this guy. He's very considerate and we have so many interests in common and we have so much fun together, but as it stands some of my bigger issues seem to be threatening the relationship and I'm not quite sure how to handle it.

I've been in an abusive relationship before him that completely shattered my self esteem. I was bullied through school, I've been picked on in my family a lot - I think it was kind of expected that I wouldn't have the best view of myself. However I've spent a while learning to love myself, picking up the pieces and letting myself be loved instead of pushing everyone away and thinking myself completely unlovable. My boyfriend is very supportive and compliments me quite a bit, he tells me he loves me often and I thought I'd been doing quite well on my own too, only I have an issue with constantly joking about things in a way that make me seem super insecure. Like if I do something stupid or say something ""cringey"" I'll just kind of off handedly be like ""why do you even date me"" or ""I guess youre gonna leave me now"", which he has expressed to be annoying before, but whilst I thought I'd been saying these kinds of things less, tonight he got irritated again because apparently I do it a lot. I think it's kind of an instinctual thing by this point, and my humour has always been kind of deflective or self deprecating anyway, and I'm so scared I'm going to lose him seeming so insecure in our relationship.

I guess deep down I do still have a lot of worry as I'm used to being used or abandoned but I really do love and trust this guy and want to stop, and I do understand why it would be annoying too. Has anyone else had this problem? I know the whole ""you have to love yourself"" first mantra but how can I do that and how can I stop joking like that so much? Like I do it even on days where I feel great about myself, I just don't understand.

I’m looking for advice on how to respond. I’ve since moved ~8 hours away and besides holiday greetings we aren’t in touch. I obviously want to show my support and encourage her to reach out to me if she’s struggling. But I also want to make sure she gets actual professional help from a counselor or therapist.

648,"Sorry for the long read. 

I am currently an engineering manager with specific focus on cable internet delivery to homes and small business for a VERY large company. 

I was contacted by the leadership group of another organization within my company offering a bit of a different role doing product management, still focusing on the same systems but shifting focus to driving future equipment in a much less technical role .

Now, I enjoy the technical side of things quite a bit but realistically speaking I am a mid level engineer but would rate myself quite high regarding management and project management abilities. 

I am supposedly in the pipeline for promotion in my current role, responsibilities won’t change much but will set me up for growing a larger team. This new role that’s being offered would be an immediate promotion and clearly a large change in job responsibilities. 

I am very torn on what to do - I built my entire current team and did a pretty good job, they are highly regarded in the company as being one of the best. I feel attached to them and feel the desire to stick with them. At the same time, our top level leadership in my organization has high expectations but doesn’t want to equip the teams with the tools to carry out the plans. We are commonly working 50-60 hours a week just to keep up and hardly able to make real forward progress. This is really draining me and causing quite a bit of stress. 

The role I am being offered is not an engineering or operational role so the after hours on-call and all of that would be out the window which I believe would drop the stress levels quite a bit. In addition, the team I’d be managing is half the size which in itself makes things less stressful. The downside is abandoning the team I built, the technical side of things which I truly enjoy, and the immediate management I have which is pretty awesome. 

The question that keeps coming up - will I be happy in this new role? It’s in a space I am familiar with and I’d be working with my current team quite a bit but will I be missing something not having any hands on technical responsibilities??

I know this is something I have to decide, but if anyone has any words of advice on how to feel comfortable with a decision and any other insight that may assist I’d greatly appreciate it.
