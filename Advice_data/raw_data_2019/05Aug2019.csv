0,"I've adored and owned dogs for as long as I remember, I just recently got a new puppy and she's giving me so much problems and stress..she's always peeing/pooping everywhere despot any attempts on training her (carpet, random places on the floor, middle of the staircase, right under the closet) basically everywhere except outside during her potty time or her 'potty corner' in the house. She chews through everything valuable, digs through the trash and leaves eggshells and other trash every all over the carpets, beds, sofas.. and I know what you're thinking, it's just the 'puppy phase', it'll pass, but it's been five months since she's been given to us (she was three or four months old when she came) and she just won't stop, she doesn't ever respond to her name, whenever you try to hold her she scrambles away and it makes me so sad cause i feel like she's scared of me or something and I'm just so confused. What do I do? Is it me? Anybody ever experience a dog like this? Help! Please.",05Aug2019,3
1,"I've recently graduated high school. I have two friends (who are twin sisters) who I want to see before we all leave for college and continue forward on different paths of life. I haven't seen them since graduation and we leave in less than 20 days. I love them dearly and they've helped me through a whole caravan of issues. 

I've texted them and they are taking an unreasonable amount of time to reply. For example, I told them I was off work on a certain day and they took 3 days to reply. Today, they texted me acknowledging the bad response time and asking when I'm available. I texted back within an hour and again they are taking an unusual amount of time to reply (it's been 7 hours). 

I'm usually not bothered by this sort of thing or much in general. But as I've said these two are special to me. And this is really striking a cord and annoying me. I know I need to eventually move on, but 3 days to reply...COME ON. 

I don't really know if I should be annoyed or just let it go. I just can't seem to find a reason for the lack of communication. A simple ""We can't do day X but can do day Y"" would suffice. 

TLDR: my friends who I hold dear to my heart are seemingly ignoring my texts about meeting up before leaving for college.",05Aug2019,2

4,"So I made post a few months back about me and my gf (now ex) explaining how shitty the start was and all the wrongs being done. Comment said to dip- I didnt listen and kept going. Fast forward into our 7 months and we broke up because I was friends with her brothers ex. And usually get back together because she realizes her stupid mistakes and I forgive her. Not this time. We've been split for a month but something Is different.  We start talking a couple days after and just like that we were talking like we were together and doing things. But she didnt give me a title not ever wanted to bring it up. Fast forward a week in and I check her IG and shes been texting this guy calling him at 3am and shit. She told me that hes a friend that she liked but flaked on a date with him during one of those times we broke up. Fast forward another 2 weeks - shes told me that this was all a lesson and that she was gonna take me back. Fast forward to 2 weeks ago- she doesnt and I discover that shes flirting with the same ""friend "". Now I cant be mad cuz we arent together but it fucks with me that she still treats us as a couple. We got into another argument- she acted stupid- threw my jacket out in the rain for me to get and threatened to flush down my $100 necklace I got her (I'm only 17 and low class). The thing that's making it all worse - is that shes moving on without reason but still keeping this going. And I never changed- I still do everything for her. So fast forward to today- she tells her mom the moments when we fight but doesnt tell her that part where she apologizes - so the mom thinks I'm an asshole who starts fights.  So to fix thing I bought her brother some mario theme figures (hes a big fan). Around that time I asked her if we could hang- she said no shes busy today. At that same time she texted her ""friend"" and ask him out to get boba tea. And he said no so she moved it to next Saturday. So she knows that I had her IG account but doesnt know that I still have it -so when i read this i felt betrayed. I texted her and tested her. Saying ""hey since I did this today- wanna do something next saturday?"" .

""I'm busy"" -she says 
""With what?"" - me
""Friends "" -her

What follows is her getting mad as I questioned who were these friends cuz I was concerned. I knew for sure that she was gonna hang with this ""friend"" next saturday  but I wanted to see if she would lie to me. She did. And ended up blocking me because I aggravated her. And when questioning her if I could talk to this ""friend' and be friends with him too. 
She replies ""Talk to him and you lose me""

Now what do I do. I know the answer is obvious but I'm lovestruck and i cant spend a moment without this woman. I wish i could delete my emotions but it's too hard.",05Aug2019,2
5,"They broke up about a month ago and I don’t think he’s over it, but she is. Yesterday all three of was were at a party and she was flirty. A friend of mine told me she said to him, she wanted to kiss me (confusing sentence, I know). I asked him if he’d be cool if I kissed her and he said “no”. 
I think it’s kind of childish of him, she’s not his property, but I don’t want to upset him (but she is pretty and nice).",05Aug2019,2
6,"I am a 24 year old graduate, female,  I am of an ethnic minority and I've recently moved from London to a smaller city in the north. While I really like it here and I've gotten used to being the only brown face in a public room or train carriage, this city doesn't seem to love me. I managed to get an entry job within a month of moving and it lasted half a year until I unfortunately failed to meet their criteria to pass the probation period. My BA in the creative arts also doesn't seem to be enough to get a job in that sector either...or any sector. People up here seem to pick a job and stick to it for a very long time. A lot of jobs usually handed to university and college students require 3 years experience up here. I can't afford to move back down to London.

I've now been unemployed for 5 months and no matter where I apply, I don't get the job. I've revamped my CV countless times, tried my upmost to seem personable and competent during interviews, phone calls and emails, yet nothing! I'm either told I don't have enough creative experience, which I don't know where to get, or that I'm not what they are looking for at this time. I've applied for the jobs relevant to my degree, the jobs adjacent  to work my way up into my dream position and even cafe and bar jobs to earn some more money. All applications are ignored or rejected. 

At this point its worth mentioning that I have generalised anxiety, depression and social anxiety. Being unemployed for this long with added pressure from family to get a job is making me feel like a burden best done without. They think I sit in my room all day doing nothing when I've been job searching, applying for colleges again, completing an online internship, watching videos and reading articles on how to improve my skills. They berate me during the breaks I take. I feel utterly useless for not even being able to secure a barista or retail job.  They don't understand how not being able to truly be independent has really interfered with my mental health.

I was recently told to apply to a restaurant job nearby. I've worked in restaurants before and I've been treated very poorly with each job. A senior member of staff tried to groom and sexually harass me when I was 18 and nobody did anything about it when I spoke up. I'm reluctant to apply to work there, but I will be because it's going to stop me from getting into any more debt. I'm just incredibly lost and frustrated with myself at this point. I've pushed myself to the point of panic attacks  and hospitalisation before. Any advice on how to break out of this rut, get recognised by employers or get my family to be more understanding will be incredibly helpful. Thank you for reading this.",05Aug2019,1
7,"I moved out at the end of May with my fiancé. We had been living with my mother, her “husband,” and occasionally my brother in a two bedroom apartment. Her husband was a gambler and drug addict. He would constantly bring over his “cousins” to spend the night. We already didn’t have space. He sold his only car and left two weeks after we announced our moving out. My mom kept chasing after him and her ex boyfriend who tried to strangle her. My mother only started raising my at age 16, because my grandma died. Until age 17, I lived with my grandpa then I moved in with my mom, because it was weird to not have a mother figure around. After I announced we were moving, she disowned my boyfriend, but said she still loved me. I have now been moved out for what like 3 months. In that time she has asked me for money in an unspecified amount (then said nevermind her friend gave it to her five mins later), early money for my phone bill $25 along with a letter for a restraining order against her ex boyfriend who tried to strangle her, and two days ago $100 dollars. However she has a coffee and cigarette addiction and I see her post of facebook pictures of her and her friend at Red Robin often. My brother still loves and lives with her so she says its for her and him to eat. My grandpa is dying and asked if he could leave everything to me and I would give my brother however much I see fit of it, so I don’t want to disown him. My grandpa said “I am glad you two have each other.” We have no one else. Me and my brother have never been super close though. He is just the only family I have left. To get to the point I think I should stop talking to my mother, because I don’t think a mother should ask her child for money. She gets paid the same amount I do and has the same amount of rent to pay. However I don’t want to lose the only family I have. I don’t want to be alone. I have my fiancé, but I am 19 and what if this doesn’t last my entire life. 

In case your wondering, yeah I sent my mom all the money she asked for. I was afraid they actually wouldn’t eat, because she blew the budget. What if she asks again next month though? And the next?

P.S. I don’t really post on reddit. I have only ever browsed. I’m sorry, if this is a bad post.",05Aug2019,3
9,"I'm a small person in my mid-30s at only 5'2 (158cm), and I have always been light in weight. Currently I am at 100lb (45kg), having annoyingly gone down from 103lb last month (46kg).

My problem is that despite being small and thin, I carry more weight in the midsection and it refuses to go away. My torso resembles a toddler's potbelly but I would like it to be flat.

My diet is very clean. I don't eat any processed foods, no artificial sugars, no junk food. It is almost entirely lower sugar fresh organic fruits and vegetables, complimented with an egg, beans/lentils, sometimes mushrooms, and I'll make the odd chicken or salmon meal served up without any breading or salt. With my fruit I'll often have a small bowl of yogurt and ~15-16 roasted almonds.

I don't eat any breads, don't drink alcohol. No fruit juice, no soda. I drink water and sometimes unsweetened tea.

I know that's not a whole lot of protein but I tend to get sick when I increase it. I even tried protein powders at one point but it destroyed my insides. According to my cardiologists they feel my diet is great for my condition, though they do think I need more muscle up top.

Every day I go walking around 3 miles (~45-60minutes), do half an hour of yoga, and another half hour of stretches, lunges, squats, crunches, and light hand weight exercises. That exercise is about as much as I can do due to a bad heart (congenital issue) and two bad knees (injured a couple years ago).

For someone who is underweight yet can't flatten that belly, anyone have any suggestions on what to do?

11,"Okay, so I am 16 years old and (F), and I have recently started becoming friends with benefits with this guy (16,M) last week he came over to my house and I lost my virginity to him (he was super affectionate afterwards.) - a month ago at a party he was at I went up to him and like starting talking, and he straight up says ""I need to drink more before I talk to you."" like what the hell? Anyways, after that I met him inside the house and we did stuff in the bathroom and he straight up told me that he does not care about me at all. The power went out in the house and I couldn't see where I was going because for one - i was drunk. So I latched onto his arm and walked out the house with him. Afterwards he literally said ""don't touch me."" Like he doesn't want me to be with him when he's with his friends. Anyways - fast forward we had an argument about it and he told me that he views me as an object, and that he doesn't want ""friends with benefits"" just ""benefits"" and only wants me for sx and that he wants to talk to me like any other girl he knows. So basically he wants to use me as a toy. He kept on saying that he knows he sounds like such an idiot but that's just what he wanted. He feels bad about it now but I just feel so stupid that I lost my virginity to him when I didn't really know his true true intentions. Like I want to be the friends with benefits but he could at least treat me with a little bit of respect afterwards and not treat me like shit? I just feel so disrespected because everyone was telling me he was a genuine guy and I don't know. Like I have a brain and thoughts, not just a vagina. Like, I don't understand. He said he's going to message me today to sort it out but I doubt that he will. I just feel so grimy and disgusting that I let it happen. Like, the first time was supposed to be special you know? He also kept on saying that ""you're not the girl for me"" ""i would never date you"". Like okay I get that but you can atl east treat me with respect - because it's so different for a girl, like I could get pregnant. Should I still go through with it, or am I overreacting about the whole situation? Please help, I'm so stuck.

I did it with him again at a party a week ago. (i'm so dumb.)

But now i've done it with him again he's being such an asshole and thinks he's top shit and is telling all his friends that I like him and that i'm obsessed with him. Idk I just regret losing my virginity to him (it was both our first times, mind you.) he does stuff like has parties and invites all my friends but me, doesn't bother to make eye contact and is just plain rude. Everyone told me he was such a nice guy and that he'd never do anything to hurt me but i've seen his true colours. Oh, and he told everyone the details. Basically told everyone that I bled the first two times which is already super embarrassing as is, and now everyone knows about it.

What should I do at school now? Everyone tells me I can do so so much better and to move on but i don't know what to do - should I be immature and petty or just ignore him or just not acknowledge his existence or do I just try and be his friend again? I don't understand why he's being like this since I've done nothing wrong.

edit: and now i think i have feelings for him (i have no clue why since he's treated me like shit lol)",05Aug2019,2

16,"I feel so much guilt over the relationship I have with my dad. He has always been the perfect example of “there but not there”, unpresent and disinterested in my life. I thought the way he chose to disconnect emotionally was just the nature of a lot of father-daughter relationships (guys being guys), until I met my future husband and his family and saw what I didn’t have. 

The last few years has been off and on attempts for my dad to quit drinking, as motivated by ultimatums served by my mom. My mom came to the conclusion that he has been drinking for several months from his recent verbally aggressive behavior, and he revealed he had been hiding liquor in the basement. My parents separated this weekend, my mom needed space for him to come to a conclusion to make different decisions on his own terms. 

A lot of my own difficulties with my dad and I’s relationship are coming to the surface as I think about what the next year looks like (with or without my dad choosing recovery). I think I was very quick to jump behind my mom, who has protected us for a long time, who just wants a fresh start.

But these past few days have also revealed family history I didn’t know, and my grandpa’s own verbally abusive nature and alcoholism that impacted my dad, and an uncle, who both received the largest impact. 

It was easier for me to think about the future when I didn’t feel sympathy for my dad, but it’s impossible not to. I feel something similar to hate for what he is, but also deeply sad for his own history and the consequences of his actions.

23,"Hey everyone,

TL;DR, How do I appropriately ask ""Are you the right person I should be contacting about this? If not, can you redirect me or forward my email?"" in a professional setting.

If you think that example sentence is fine, that's odd because it comes off as blunt to me.

So I work for a startup and have to send heaps of emails out everyday. This is NOT my bread and butter and it's a struggle for me sometimes. Anyway, I have to contact universities for something but I don't know half the time if the people/departments I'm contacting are even appropriate for the subject.

How should I ask for a redirect or for my email to be forwarded? Asking someone to do anything when I'm the one being the bother grinds me the wrong way. Personally I would be willing to help someone if they contacted me asking for a redirect, but at the same time, I have to appear professional and like I know what I'm doing *pfff*.

29,"Hello all, and thanks for reading..

About two weeks ago, my mother got contacted by YoungLiving, a company that sells essential oils over the internet. They told her that someone had ordered over $7000 worth of essential oils from her account. 
Fortunately, since this is an industry where bulk orders aren’t exactly common, they stopped the order from being completed. Password changed - end of story. 

About a week later, she noticed that someone had been using her Hulu account to watch various shows and movies. She shares her account with no one (not even me). I had a similar thing happen to my best friend, so I assured her that it was common and that these were likely two isolated and unrelated incidents. 

Flash forward to this week. She received emails from each of Amazon, Apple, and WalMart saying that her passwords have been successfully reset and changed. She could then no longer log into her Amazon or Walmart account, and her iPad is constantly giving her the annoying pop up urging her to sign in with her Apple ID since the password has been changed. 

I have advised her to cancel all her current credit cards that may be stored in any and all AutoFills on any website, as well as deleting all her frequented accounts and starting anew with a fresh gmail address to create accounts with. 

It is worth noting that none of her passwords were the same, and none of them were stored in her notes on any of her devices. 

Does anyone have any idea what could’ve transpired here - and more importantly, is there anything else we should be doing to ensure our safety / prevent this from happening again?? She is freaking out and admittedly, I am startled. I’ve never seen or heard of anything like this before. 

Thanks in advance, guys.

We’ve expressed that this makes us uncomfortable, that it makes many of us and especially in-laws unwilling to come over, that it’s hurting her relationships with her family and friends, and that we’d just like her to refrain from the subject when we’re around, but she just doubles down and yells that she’s just trying to save us.

Because I can’t help but think he was trying the best he could but he just didn’t know any better. And it’s crushing to me that I couldn’t be the bigger person.",05Aug2019,1
36,"Should I worry about myself? I try to date near my age range, but im having trouble with that. I am a 41 year old female, and i was in a relationship for 9 years with a man who was 8 years younger than me. It was a wonderful relationship, for the most part, but it did end pretty terribly.   
  
I really haven't dated much since my 20s, and at 41 years old, i seem to attract the widest array of ages imaginable. Problem is, I seem to only really click with men between the ages of 25-30. It's a serious Trend, and i find it troublesome. Men in their 30s all seem to have some kind of drama. It's like they need to take themselves so very seriously... They are a bit tough to relax around, as they never seem to be relaxed. That and many have young children, and mine are almost grown and out of the house, which im totally ready for. Had my tubes tied for a reason, people.   
  
Men in their 40s all seem to look much older than me, and act like they are still teenagers... Its weird to me that they seem to look 10 years older than me... It makes me feel weird. I haven't found one im interested in yet, this age group may be the least attractive to me....so then Men in their 50s need not be mentioned past that.   
  
I keep telling the men in their 20s that they are too young for me. But the truth is, they are who i get along with. They aren't jaded, they aren't boring, they aren't clingy, and they are the most respectful. They don't ghost me, they seem to understand that I go to therapy because I'm proactive about personal growth, rather than asking if I ""really need that."" They don't mind that i have kids, and realize that my kids are not my whole life, and believe me when i say that i don't need or want them to be involved in theirs either. They are fun, spontaneous, and Don't seem to be afraid of me like the older ones often are.   
  
I feel like this says something about me.... It seems like no matter what age I am, the same aged men are always what attracts me.... I'm worried, because i don't know if that is even remotely normal... Do i just need to grow up?",05Aug2019,1

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  👔  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and  said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she  come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled  to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone  and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back  at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.",05Aug2019,0

One time it was about $20 short, two times it was $1 short, and one time it was $70 over. (I've been working for about a month and a half) 
I have absolutely no clue what could be happening. After it was missing money the first time I made sure to pay more attention. The second two times weren't a big deal as they were only $1 so the managers said it was okay. But when it was $70 over I got written up. 
I cant think of a single moment when I could've messed up and I have no clue how to stop making mistakes. I've been going slower and paying attention but I still keep messing up. I'm scared I'm gonna get fired, but I really need this job for college. 
Also, before we start working we count the money in the register to make sure we have the correct starting amount so it couldnt be the managers messing that up and from what I know, this hasn't been happening to other people so it has to be my fault. 
What can I do to stop making mistakes so that I dont get fired?",05Aug2019,2
41,"So I had this friend group for... around a year. I liked them as friends and as people but it was very shaky. We had falling outs but we always managed to fix stuff. Then I realised that this was happening way too much and it would be better for me and eventually for everyone if I left them. I already have another friend group who I had planned to transition into for months. Now let’s get into the details. So it’s one of my friends last days here and he’s leaving our city for another one in a different country. But for some reason I’m suspicious. He said he was leaving today to check out his new house but he seemingly didn’t leave our city. It’s 50/50 for me. I don’t know what’s true. Now I got asked to come out at 7:34pm but I wasn’t allowed to die to the time, weather, and my parents had ordered food and they hate wasting food. I let my friends know but they persisted and I got a bit annoyed. I got sarcastic as I do when annoyed and then apologised for it. Then one friend went off insulting me so I unadded him from Snapchat. Then my other friends started to insult me heavily. I took it poorly but didn’t retaliate. I got called a nonce cause someone a few years younger messaged me and once I learned they were younger I blocked them (I never sent anything of romantic or sexual nature it was all just friendly conversation because I don’t like being rude to random people often). They also called me gay but that’s not an insult really at our age. I then blocked both of the insulters but stayed in a group chat with them. I added back the other friend and had a conversation which stayed away from insults until the end where he called me a “fucking prick”. But from the group chat we are on shaky but non insulting terms. I then was a sly guy by not leaving the group chat for a while. I am worried because they have some videos of me being kinda weird singing a song but nothing that’ll ruin me. I’m worried they’ll exaggerate stuff. Oh also, they claimed that by me saying that I wouldn’t leave the group chat until asked nicely (I was gonna leave anyway I just really wanted to dig it in and make them say it nicely) I was blackmailing them. So anyone got any advice on my next actions? I really just wanna know why I feel like apologising but anything is useful.",05Aug2019,1
42,"This paragraph is only the exposition of her behavior. My younger sister is 18 years of age, turning 19 this coming September. She’s always had a bit of an attitude, in the sense that’s she’s incredibly entitled and selfish. Even as an adult living with my parents, she throws fits when being asked to aide in cleaning around the house. She is constantly turning people on one another in the family by spreading ‘exaggerated’ rumors that allow her to still lie her way out of while causing chaos between the rest of us. She doesn’t enjoy speaking to anyone in the family but my mother, and talks down to everyone else when questioned or even when attempting to start a conversation. She’s rude and unfair in her responses, and acts as though others’ interests or opinions are beneath her and therefore worthless. 

As of lately, my parents would call me and ask if there was something going on in her life to make her upset, for often she would come home enraged or overly rude without reason. If I knew there had been something going on, I would let them know about it. 

Now, with my 20/20 hindsight, I’m well aware that informing my family of her personal life without telling her is wrong. I’ve already apologized and tried to retrace my steps about it. Instead of accepting it or telling me her feelings were still hurt, she began calling me names and insisted that it was my fault that the rest of our family felt that she hated them, not her outlandish and blatantly aggressive actions. She went as far as claiming that because I had spoken with my parents a couple of times, I had told them that she hates them and doesn’t want to be around them. 

We used to be close, and now we’re almost at two weeks of not speaking. When I go over to my parents, she’s overly unkind or just ignores me. I’ve tried being nice but she responds with immaturity. My parents don’t want me to cut her out of my life but I’ve finally cleansed my personal friend group of toxicity, and I don’t want my own sister to have the right to treat me like some inferior being.

45,"TL;DR I left my boyfriend today but it’s going to make my life significantly harder, not to mention the stress I put on his kid and our dogs 

My boyfriend and I have been arguing for about two months straight now. He can’t empathize with (or even try to understand) my depression and that has been the root of a lot of our problems recently. However, throughout this whole rough patch, I’ve seen a side of him I don’t like. He’s slowly turning into someone else. We’ve only been together for nine months but it’s still extremely unsettling. It makes me nervous because I wonder who else is behind that mask, waiting to reveal itself? It’s as if everyday, his personality becomes uglier and uglier. So today I finally left. 

On another note, our home together is four minutes away from where I work, which has been super convenient since my car broke down recently and buying another one or even fixing this one is going to take a lot of time, because my financial situation has of late frankly sucked balls. The place I’ve worked at for years has been slower than ever and new rules implemented have caused me to make even less money than normal. So living somewhere close to work is nice because I can always find a ride or even walk if I want. Well my mom had to come get me today and if I go through with leaving him, I’ll live at her house until I can get back on my feet. But her house is 45 minutes away from work. She doesn’t mind driving me, but it’s a lot to ask of her. 

Another thing about living with my mom is that she has a big big dog (who I love) but he’s so rowdy and wild. That would be fine with me but I have a 14 week old tiny puppy who will stay small. And when they play it just makes me nervous. He steps on her on accident. I love my puppy with my whole heart, and she’s the only thing that has gotten me through the past couple of weeks. And I know that this living situation is only as ideal for her as it is for me; it isn’t. She’s confused and she’s stressed and I haven’t been able to get her to eat today. I know it will get better in time, but it really sucks rn. 

And lastly, I worry about my (ex?)boyfriend’s daughter. She’s nine and she’s basically a total weirdo just like me so we’re best friends. In fact, it’s actually me, her, and the puppy against the world! And this is gonna hurt her as much as it hurts us. I worry about her not having anyone to turn to when things get bad between her mom and dad (which is often). 

So I’ll wrap it up. If you’ve read this far I just want to know what you think and what you would do in my situation? Anything would be appreciated. Much love to you all",05Aug2019,2
46,"We found out we were having a boy and had finally found a name we both agreed on, Ezra, and even had a nickname for him ""Fez"". My step sister was also pregnant but they were not going to find out and about a month later I figured I'd better make sure she didn't have Ezra on her list of boy name choices. I asked and she said either Jack or Charlie. Relieved, I responded ""oh good, because we've named ours Ezra Kai"". She then says that Ezra was their first choice and she just didn't mention it because she didn't think I'd be ""into that name"" and said it was off limits even if they had a girl because they'd use it in the future. I told her I wasn't changing his name. Fast forward to last week, she had a boy and the dirty bitch named him Erza. She hasn't told me, I found out via Facebook.

47,"Hey everyone, I need advice about a “friend” who betrayed me last week. My friend and I met about three years ago during freshman orientation at UC Berkeley. We’re still there and and we’re entering our final year.

We haven’t seen one another all summer, and while we were catching up, she decided to tell me a joke about raising kids that I though was really funny and insightful (I’m an aunt). After we laughed about the absurdity of parenthood - she told me  “I always loved that Louie CK joke.”

Seriously....Louie CK. I feel completely betrayed right now. First of all, why would she think it’s ok to tell me a joke by Louie CK? He’s a known homophobe and  misogynist. Also, how is it possible that I was lured into laughing at something that he came up with? I really thought I was better than that. 

At this point - I’m ready to end the friendship. This just feels like a complete betrayal. I for one  would never knowingly tell one of his jokes to a friend these days. 

Hopefully I’m not overreacting, but what she did was wrong.

I am a male going thru the age of 22 to 28 I guess I don’t know, this problem is specific one of things that I try to deal with everyday, I have a partner who I not so recently became partners with, i am paranoid about them sleeping with other people, even tho I know 100000 percent they are not, I still get these thoughts around then and it gets worse when I am alone, I have had really bad experiences with cheating before and my last relationship destroyed my life to the point I no longer feel any kind of joy, i am extremely cold and cautious and calculating I don’t show interest in anyone or try to live my life, I don’t trust anyone, I got rid of all my friends I deactivated my social media, it has been well over a year and nothing ever feels better, it doesn’t seem like this is gonna change, I fight with it every day and it just kills me how little I think of myself and compare myself to everyone and look for approval from certain people, on top of all of that, I work so much and I have to be up at 4 every morning I am insomniac basically I literally hate sleeping,  my emotions is always jittery I have smoked cigarettes and weed together I still do I have lost 80 pounds. I also have a lot of stressors in my life when it comes to finances I am basically broke and trying to go to school but my father abandoned me. 
Just to get to the story I think I might have won my first battle against this paranoia and fucked up mentality, I was with partner and their friend at their apartment just chilling watching tv, it was the first night after I saw them a while ago, I have talked to them about time alone before mainly because I am insecure about their friend being around them all the time, I got into my thoughts for some time and always decide to do something triggering or something to gain attention so I thought about telling them I don’t want to hangout with them for the next few days and that I need some space and I also thought about telling them that I am going to bed early. I stopped for a second.... and thought about how my paranoia always gets to me and I decided to go against it because I don’t want to lose that person thay I love so much and they love me so so much, they care for me and always talk to me and help me, with no judgments or expectations. It’s the best thing in the world. My questions here is did I do the right thing ? Did I actually win or is this just stupid ? Why am I making these things up and why do I hate myself so much that I want to torture it with weird and unsavory thoughts.
A little thing I actually ended up getting a little sick from smoking I am laying in the room for a minute to write this story and relax and I just feel that weight getting a little bit lighter rn. I am still trying to figure every thing out I don’t know I have no self confidence.

55,"So my best friend and I have known each other for 11 years now, I call her my sister. We basically grew up together as our families are very close. For the past month we've been searching for an apartment to move into together, as she had recently got out of a bad relationship and my current roommate is moving out of state. Two weeks ago we found an apartment that we liked which happened to be a bit more on the expensive side ($1,610 a month, not including electric). She makes quite a bit of money though as she works as an RN. I do not make as much so we came to the agreement that I will be paying $550 monthly.

Last week when we went to finalize the paperwork for our 12 month lease, she sat me down in the car afterwards to talk. She informed me that her uncle's wife had just given birth, but they found drugs in her system and CPS took the child away. As an alternative to foster care, my friend agreed to take legal custody of the child until both parents can prove that they can be sober. The infant turns 2 weeks old this Thursday. I am in utter shock, I don't quite know how to process this. I spoke with her about my role in all of this, and she said she would never put any responsibility on me for the child, but hello, I'm going to be living there, of course I have responsibility. 

We move in on the 9th, and that same day CPS will need to tour the apartment and get my fingerprints. I work a lot, and won't be able to do it in the timeframe that they need, so now CPS is pressuring me to find time to fill out all of their documents. I am so stressed, we're children taking care of a child. I don't even know how to properly bathe an infant. Not only am I worried about caring for the child, but also how it will affect our living situation. My friend will work a 12 hour shift and then come home and wake up every 2 hours to feed the baby? Also her Uncle is supposedly caring financially for the child, but I know these people, and they aren't that trust worthy. This will affect her financially, and me as well most likely. When she works she says she will drop off the child to a relative, but I know that eventually I will need to watch after it. We have a dog and a cat to add onto it all.

I just don't know how to feel about this. This is going to change our lives, at least until they get the child back (if they ever do). I love my friend, but she likes to take on things that are too big for her. I guess this is a rant more than anything else. Just a way of processing everything.

57,"So I'm gonna start of by saying that I am pansexual. My friend of 6+ years has known this and it's never really been a problem. Last night we went out drinking together and we just were talking about experiences and life since we haven't got to hang out in a while since both of our lives are busy. She was telling me about a recent night she had with a girl that she didn't enjoy it and never has and is basically straight. I'm like cool ya know, I've known this lol. So fast forward like two hours and shes like basically asking me if she should hit on these two different girls and I'm like sure ask them to dance politely whatever ya know. I'm awkward and prefer not to do that kinda thing so I'm just chilling on the sidelines. Eventually we go out side and she starts to hold my hand and sit on my lap and like just really touchy so at this point I'm not drinking or anything cause I'm about to have to take care of her. I drive her home cause her boyfriend starts blowing me up &amp; on the way home she starts asking me if I am attracted to her if I'm jealous of her boyfriend and so on. I answer her honestly I tell her yes shes attractive no I'm not jealous and or am I interested in her but ya know whatever so then she starts to go on about how she wants to kiss me and pounce on me or some shit and I'm steadily telling her look let's not cross any boundaries and ruin our friendship. And so I kissed her on the cheek to get her to stop and sent her on her way. ( dumb thing to do I know but I'm human I panicked and I didn't want her to try to kiss me forreal.) She literally mentioned that she thinks I'm in love with her which isn't the case and now its awkward the next day and idk what to do. I'm an honest person period so I told her honestly shes attractive but shes my best friend and it isn't like that. Then she said I hurt her feelings and I'm just confused. So the advice I need is did i do something wrong? how do i explain that you can love and care for someone and not be in love or that someone can be attractive but it doesn't mean you got feelings for them like how do I talk to her now lol. She thinks I'm like in love with her so I feel like of I write her about it shes gonna think of it differently although she started the whole situation.

59,"I am a bridesmaid in a friend from work’s wedding in 6 weeks. They started planning the wedding about 7 months ago. I work with two of the other girls, another is the brides sister and the maid of honor is one of the groom’s sisters.

The bride warned me early on that her future sister in law would “steamroll” the rest of us. She wasn’t kidding. She immediately took over shower planning (fine by me) but never shared any details, specifically pricing - with the rest of us, even after being asked repeatedly.

In the mean time, about 4 months ago I started to plan the bachelorette. Group messaging all the bridesmaids ideas, dates, pricing etc. None of them had any suggestions and agreed my idea to spend the night in a nearby ski village was perfect, and I also cleared it with the bride... several times.

Fast forward two months, hotel rooms are booked and invites are sent to 20 guests to join us for dinner, drinks and if desired - a nights stay in our hotel room (the MOH insisted on getting her own room instead of staying in the suite we got for the party)

After a week of chasing RSVPs, only 10 of the 20 invited said they would come to pregame at the hotel and join us for dinner, and only 4 (including myself and the bride) were staying the night.

The party is less than two weeks away and I get a group text message from one of the groom’s other sisters stating that since so few people are staying they (her and her sister) have decided to cancel the party I planned (and paid for custom invites and postage) and figure out something else to do that’s “easier”. 

I wrote back that I have time and money into planning this - and was told my plan makes no sense, and I should have had an idea it wasn’t going to work.

All the bride has said is that she appreciates what I’ve put into the event, that her sister in laws aren’t rude, just “aggressive” and it will just be easier this way. Neither of the other girls from work stood up for me either.

At this point I have no interest in being near the grooms family, attending the bachelorette or being in the wedding. I feel insulted, disrespected and taken advantage of.

Do I:
1) keep my mouth shut and go with the flow 
2) politely decline the bachelorette and fulfill my bridesmaid duties at the wedding 
3)excuse myself completely- bridesmaids should be there to celebrate with you, I don’t think it’s fair to either me or the bride at this point",05Aug2019,1

I was born and raised LDS, and have been in and out of it. Now I feel like a LDS mission is my best bet for my current situation, and I’m set on that for many reasons.

I’ve asked my dad for advice, he says he thinks it’s a terrible idea because I’m setting up myself to go down a wrong path. I think he’s wrong. I know this is incredibly vague... ask me questions if you would like to know more!",05Aug2019,1
63,"So I've kinda been freaking out about this for the past 2 months and i just need some advice. So my girlfriend and I did not have sex but there was a fingering accident where i touched myself and im pretty sure that i had no ejaculate of any kind on my hand, and i fingered her for a bit until she pointed out that i had touched myself. I immediately stopped and freaked out, wondering if we were and worrying all the time. 

Fast forward a few weeks later and she has her period 3 days later than expected but within the regular menstrual cycle (she isnt regular). No abnormal clotting  and she said everything seems like its the same. It came on the 13th

1 month later her period comes on the 12th and has no abnormalities except for one larger than normal clot. Bleeds for 5 days and thats the end of it

Well one day my stress got to me so we did a test and it was negative. 

My question is could the test be wrong? Could the bleeding be decidual bleeding? Shes gained maybe 5 pounds since the day we had the incident and looks a tiny bit larger but she always gains weight a few days before her period and shes 8 days away from the next. She hasnt had any new pains that she normally has (hips and sides have always hurt). No bloody or increased discharge, spotting, or bleeding between periods. Shes not at all worried and im trying but i need some advice to get me all the way there. Are we pregnant?

Ps: the day the fingering thing happened i had came already before i fingered her and had been cleaned off. Its been 14 weeks since that day",05Aug2019,1

I am only hired third actual relationship, the rest were friends with benefits type things. She has told me about this and I knew before getting into the relationship.

I don't to destroy our already rocky relationship, but I know it's worse that he's addicted now, and it's my fault. Should I just directly tell our parents? Is there another way I could stop it?

68,"So, LTL, Sorry for formatting I’m on mobile, TL;DR at bottom yadda yadda yadda.

Ever since my sister and I were introduced she has been my best friend. My father and step mother met each other and shortly thereafter, introduced their offspring to each other. I never felt the need for more siblings, but she and I were stuck like glue after a little while. She was the first person I told I was gay. She and I got into all kinds of shit together. Smoked weed. Snuck out. Sped home to make curfew after hanging out with our boyfriends’ too late. She was my best friend.

Fast forward to 2016. We were both freshly out of high school and my parents presented us with the fact that they were packing up their shit and moving to FL. I didn’t want to go, but she did. I went, because she was my best friend and I didn’t want to live here without her. So we go. We do it. 

At the time, she had a fiancé and he was a loon, but I dealt because I wasn’t making the best decisions with boys either (another story, another time). They ended up breaking up and she went to our home state after he left to chase him. They eventually broke up. I stayed in FL for awhile. During that time she met someone even worse. A man whose mother controls his every move. A man who is addicted to drugs. A man whose mother enables that very habit. A man who is 25 and does nothing but let his mother berate and accuse and belittle my sister. I returned to my home state about a year after she did to get a fresh start after my own bouts. I was thinking all would be fine and I didn’t know any of those things about this man.

Fast forward to now, they’re a mess. Their relationship is so bad. They break up and get back together constantly. Me and my brothers are constantly going to save her from whatever shit show is playing that night when she calls. She finally left him for awhile and I was thinking that she was done. That she would pick herself up from the wreck she was living in and get back at it, but she keeps going back. There has been the biggest rift between us because I can’t stand that man, and she knows our family doesn’t approve. She doesn’t have a phone. She isn’t eating. Our family thinks she’s on drugs and I believe them. That’s how badly things have been going. I miss her dearly but I literally do not know what to do. And if she won’t listen to me, she’s not gonna listen to anyone. What should I do?

TL;DR My sister is dating a manipulative dope fiend with an even more manipulative mother and I can’t convince her that she’s headed for worse if she keeps it up",05Aug2019,2
69,"Last night I was working in a kitchen dish pit with two other coworkers. Let's call them Michael and Jay to keep their privacy. Michael and I were talking about all kinds of stuff involving music, politics, and women as usual. Jay came in a little later and talks about his new car. All is well until about halfway through the shift.

Later on Jay just stops talking altogether, which is unusual since he's a bit more reserved. The weird part is he isn't saying anything when Michael or I address him directly. We find it a bit unsettling but continue with the work and banter. Later on in the night I asked Jay if I should do the floors or if he wants to. He responds too quietly to hear and shakes his head. I asked him 3 times with equally quiet responses until I hear him say ""You heard me"". So I responded, ""ok... do you want me to do the floors?"" And he shakes his head yes. It was really weird. He didn't say anything the rest of the night. We figured something personal came up and wrote it off.

Today however, he continues to ignore both Michael and I, but is completely normal to everyone else. I gave him a friendly greeting and he said absolutely nothing. Naturally I got pretty insecure and felt bad the rest of the shift. At the end I confronted him and said, ""look man you gotta tell me if I said something that upset you. I want to apologize but I can't if I don't know what I did. I suppose it's your right not to tell me. So let me know when you're ready to"".

73,"TL;DR I have heard my dad having sexy time with his girlfriend and I am indescribably uncomfortable with it, &amp; I have absolutely no idea what to do/how to approach this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, I realize that I'm gonna sound incredibly selfish in the coming sentences, but I guess that's just how it's gonna be. Around 6 years ago, my parents announced to me &amp; my sisters that my father would be moving out of the house. It had a tremendous negative impact on me, and I still think about it/feel the shockwaves now at 22 years old. Even then, I started thinking about what would happen if one of them starting dating. Would I have to call that new person ""mom"" or ""dad""? Would they start to try and ""take charge"" of me like a step-parent might? It had popped into my mind with some frequency since then and I'd essentially dreaded the idea of it, and what my reaction would be.

It should be noted that my parents are very level headed and good people, I have a great relationship with them both and I love them more than anyone on earth (I think this may attribute to my disdain of the idea of outsiders stepping in), so they're likely not going to pull the whole ""You'll be calling her 'mom' "" thing.

Now, in year of our lord 2019, I'm living with my dad in New Mexico. Left my home/college in Montana to get a fresh start in life as college life wasn't going well for me and I wanted a new beginning. Of course, like clockwork with me, problems started befalling me like a ton of bricks. Finding a job has been a grueling process with 0 luck, no money to my name, general anxiety and unhappiness are rampant, etc. I'm at a point where when something bad happens or a problem arises for me (this happens regularly now it seems), I tend to take the attitude of ""another one on the pile"" (this is going somewhere I promise.

All this piling up in my brain and having big impacts on my mentality towards life, and I get a knock on the door earlier today. ""Hey son,"" my dad says as he comes in, ""just so you know I have a visitor over, a ladyfriend."" He immediately saw my reaction and knew it was gonna be a talking point soon enough, and left. **waterfallsofsadnessandanger**. Basically my worst fear has become a reality. I really disliked this when it happened and a huge weight of stress and sadness came upon me. This woman almost certainly makes my father happy and that alone should make me happy, but her very existence in this circumstance honestly tears me up inside. 

Now the good thing is, I've spoken to my dad about it and he knows that the whole situation kinda weirded me out, and he told me that he was going to make it as easy for me as he possibly could. Hearing this took a huge weight off my shoulders and I felt great after I spoke to him.   
HOWEVER, I feel like he's forgotten the talk or maybe didn't really take it to heart, as last night I heard him and his girlfriend having sex in his room (directly across from mine). The feeling of extreme discomfort hit me again like a wall of bricks, to the point where I wanted to just get in my car and drive away, just leave with nowhere to go. He has her at the house again as I type this.

I haven't spoken to him about this and I'm genuinely scared to. I'm scared of sounding very selfish - this is his house and its his girlfriend - but I feel more like this isn't okay. Its not like I just came to his house and decided I live here, we planned my moving in with my dad for a while, so I'm essentially his roommate too. So for him to do this sort of thing with seemingly no care for what I may think of it, I feel kinda betrayed/disrespected, and I am 100% not okay with it. I don't know if he's going to tell me to get over it, or to get out of the house if I don't like it, or whatever. 

Does ANYONE know how I can approach this? I want to talk to him but its also such a delicate topic and I'm a very emotional person; when I have heart-to-hearts with people, especially when its such a big thing like this, I always break down and cry like a baby, not to mention my fear of my father's reaction.

Thanks to all who read this rambling stupid post, and good luck to others on this sub &lt;3",05Aug2019,1

75,"I want to start by saying that I’m a huge animal lover but I need experienced cat owner advice. A lady at work likes to say that god tells animals which houses to go to for help and I’m definitely one of those houses.. I literally have animals waiting for me on my doorstep when I get home quite frequently. 

I have four rescued dogs, one rescued cat, and one rescued parrot. Two of the dogs don’t get along with the resident cat (Linus) but my house is plenty big so the dogs have their own bedroom and the cat has his own bedroom. This is important later. We have a rotating schedule for the animals and it works. 

So about a year ago this cat (Bags) showed up. Just a black tomcat. I put food out for him and pet him when he comes around. We are always pulling ticks off of him as there are woods behind the house where I guess he stays. But up until a week ago I was fine leaving him outside. Last weekend, I walk outside and Bags is laying under my husbands truck. I call him and he comes out limping, won’t put any weight on one foot. He also is tore up with scratches and scabs all over him. So I think well I’ve got to do something now. 
We took him to the vet to get checked out, got him shots and dewormed, got him neutered and he’s been staying in the guest bathroom for a week now. We’ve been doing the whole thing introducing him to my resident cat slowly letting them smell through the door and smell each other’s stuff. They’ve been allowed to mingle three times. The first time was for about ten minutes. It was pretty uneventful- no hissing or growling. 
The second time was yesterday but they had a little spat I guess it was a fight but it looked like they were playing patty cake really quickly I yelled and they broke it up immediately. That was it for the day. We tried again today. They were allowed out, supervised, for 5-6 hours and things were great until Linus hissed at bags and then turned around to walk off bags jumped on him and they went at it again. Not vocally though, silently fighting. I screamed and they broke it up and then both went and hid. 

Will they get through this? The goal is for them to share the residents cat’s bedroom. But I can’t trust them to yet and I need my bathroom back. 
I don’t know what to do. 

I know bags feels safe in my home and I hate to put him back out on the streets. If he could get along with Linus then having another cat won’t be a big deal. 

What do I do? How long do I give them? How long is too long to put this cat back outside? Will he get ran off by another tomcat now that he is neutered?",05Aug2019,1

78,"Hello all. 

I've [F21] been in a relationship with my boyfriend (we'll call him Jason [M28]) for almost a year now. Things have been really wonderful, and I'm by far the happiest I've ever been. We're looking at moving in together this autumn, etc. 

With that being said, I still carry a lot of anxiety from my past long-term relationship. Which, as the title suggests, consisted of a lot of lying and betrayal. 

Even in the monents of pure bliss with Jason, I'm still struck by this sadness and fear that it could happen again, that it could all be a lie, an almost paranoia that maybe he's just playing a joke on me. It makes my stomach turn into knots and I close down. I haven't mentioned this to Jason, as I know logically he's done nothing to make me have these suspicions and doubts. In fact, he's been nothing but loving, reassuring, and open with me. 

That, in turn, makes me feel guilty for even having these defensive thoughts.

85,"For the last 24 years I have lived in the same house. My neighborhood is nice, and quiet with the exceptional my neighbors across the street. These neighbors, who we will call Ben (son) and Pat(father) were the first house to be built on our road and lived there since the 70’s.  Pat is an old tough and tough guy who keeps to himself other that the occasional yelling/ fight with his son. Pat will always cover for his son, and have heard him tell police he’s fell down stairs when I witnessed Ben punching him. Ben  is in his 50’s, has a laundry list of charges that have been pressed against him, doesn’t work, and makes side cash by doing neighbors yard work and selling drugs. Anytime he has a bit of cash, he rides his dirt bike (which is illegal to drive on a road in my state)  to the liquor store, and invites his friends over. This almost always ends up with yelling, and Ben revving his dirt bike engine and riding up and down our street throughout the night. 

Now, I’ve lived in my house for 24 years- I’m close to being 30 now. Ben has recently taken a keen interest in me. Weird things he has done:
1.) I bought a new car, and he shouted from across the street while I was walking to it that he thought it was cool that I drove a stick. There is no way he would know I drove a stick other than going up to it and looking in. I park my car in my drive way, which means he had to have been on my property.
2.) he is constantly asking the neighbors about me. My neighbors had all watched me grow up and they tell me as a “just to let you know, Ben seems interested you”
3.) when I walk in from my car into my house Ben will shout from across the street asking if I need my lawn mowed. I usually if or him, act like I’m on the phone and go right on I to my house.
4.) recently my boyfriend was over and we were laying in my hammock in my back yard. Ben decided to do yard work in my next door neighbors yard at that time. I could feel him starring and I ushered my boyfriend inside.

It’s getting a bit tired of  living in constant avoidance of my neighbor and having him make me feel so uncomfortable.  Because his attempts to talk and interact with me are becoming more constant and more aggressive, I’m wonder what the best way to address these issues are.  They’re moments I question if I should get the authorities involved due to his illegal habits- but I am fearful he will get released from prison like he always does and  find out I was the one to report him and then have more of a situation on my hands.

I feel like it's a dream and there's only one way out. I've been struggling to remember that this is the real world for a while now, but now, it's getting much much worse.

90,"So I'm going into freshman year of high school, I've been crushing on this guy for almost two years, and I told him I liked him about a year ago. He had a gf at the time but they hadn't really done anything and I mean ANYTHING, so I needed to get it off my chest. We shared everything with each other and I basically broke them up but only bc he was suffering in the relationship and didn't know how to break it off. We didn't talk all last year since we weren't in any of the same classes, and that's when I really missed him and fell for him harder. Just a couple months ago he was acting pretty suspicious and I was just like hey do you like me orr? And he gave a paragraph which basically said yes. So ofc my friend was freaking out and got us together and ig we're bf and gf? But since it's summer we've only met up once (my friend and I were dropped off at a movie theater and met him there - my parents didn't know) since he confessed and we held hands but it wasn't as amazing as I thought it'd be?

I don't know how to get them to not be mad at me. its not like it's a tattoo of some type of assault weapon or something from the real world; its a gun from a game that actually means something to me.

95,"My boyfriend and I had spoken about a week ago about his state of mind and how he was on the very of pushing everyone away. I asked if he wanted to be with me still and he said yes. I told him that I would go with him anywhere he needed to go to in like. Id follow him through the darkness to light. He was happy about this and everything was fine. A few days later he would answer my calls or texts and when he finally did, he broke up with me. I asked him why and he said that he just wanted to focus on himself which we had discussed the day of the original conversation. After telling me that I was the one person he wouldn’t push away, he still did. Honestly, it’s hurting me so much. We haven’t spoken since the breakup because he’s been busy but he said we could in a few days..

97,"Always felt that I can't even have the ilusion that something like drugs, alcohol or sex will ever distract me from my sadness and hopeless that something can ever make me feel happy is really bad.
Even things like suicide thoughts are more about the eternal lack of meaning and worth of everything and everyone from the past, the present and the future than some belief that will make some change in an existencial level.
Never felt close to any parents or relatives, never had a girlfriend, never had a day of making a really bad impulsive thing.
Always felt that nobody understand me, feeling that I'm not human.
Already have a bachelor degree being 22 years, but it's feel worthless.
For many years I don't have a bithday party as ""there's nothing to celebrate"".
My psychiatrist noted that my situation it's more of a psychology thing, but even making 4 years of therapy didn't make me feel that much better.

98,"So, there was this girl in my Spanish class who set 2 rows next to me and we never really talked; if we did, it would always be a single sentence or replying to something she told me (which was not often). Regardless, all I knew was that we had similar music taste and thats all. Whenever I did speak to her, though, I would always look done or try ending the conversation quickly because I was nervous. After the semester was finished and we took the Spanish final, I felt bad for not speaking to her at all during the class since she seemed cool and nice.

After class, I messaged her if she wanted to hang out ""as friends"" - which thinking about it now, it seems like those 2 words have ruined any possible future (?). She told me she was going out of town till the 15th and so I asked if she wanted to hang out when she came back. She didn't say ""I dont know"" of ""we'll see"", she said ""yeah sounds good.""

I'm pretty socially inept and I have almost no experience with women. Is this a good sign? Did my ""as friends"" ruin any possible attraction so early? Is it fine if I message her the day after she comes back, preferably at night to ask if she still wants to hang out?",05Aug2019,3

105,"Hello,
For the past few years, I’ve had trouble staying at any job. It started when I was 20 years old and now I’ll be 23 in two months. I used to be a wonderful employee and stayed with companies for years. Was even a store manager. I guess I noticed the downfall started when I got super sick with chronic kidney infections. There was no reason for these and at 22, I was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease. This a very painful condition. On top of this, I was deteriorating mentally. Ultimately, I had a suicide attempt where I was pronounced “dead” for one minute but revived. Then placed into a psychiatric hospital for awhile where I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 2. This all happened at 20. 

At 21, I decided to move to a new city with my family. I thought this would help. They let me get my feet back on the ground. And I got a job that I did like. But I got sick with kidney problems, missed one day and was fired. I tried more jobs but kept quitting them after either my first day or a couple weeks. I eventually got a job outside my resume. I have nine years of retail experience, which I hate retail. I did go to college and got multiple degrees but can’t seem to find a job in those fields. Anyways, I got this new job and loved it however it was a contracting position and only lasted two months. So I was back to where I started. I kept getting jobs but leaving them. And I would just no call/no show and never return back. I felt like a loser and was extremely disappointed in myself but couldn’t seem to get out of this funk. 

I turned 22, and I met my fiancé. Luckily, he is extremely supportive and makes enough money to financially pay our bills. I feel like shit, honestly that he has to be the main money maker. He is understanding and only wants what’s best for me. He believes God is telling me that I’m not meant for this line of work. And I make YouTube videos/music on the side and my fiancé wants me to focus on that. However, I feel terrible that he has to be the working one. And I hate feeling lazy. I realize this is a toxic behavior but I don’t know how to stop it. I guess I have to figure out the exact problem. And it’s not that I don’t want to work, it always feel like I can’t. Whenever I work, I have bad kidney pain. And/or my mental health worsens. 

Again, I realize this is my healthy. And I don’t feel normal :(  I just want help.",05Aug2019,2

111,"To make a very long story short, a guest came to the front and accused another guest of lewd behavior (a 16 year old, jerking off in front of the window of their room viewing the pool). It seemed a little off, because we had checked those guests in only  a matter of moments ago. It was a father and son, and I don't know how many teenage boys are gonna jack off in front of their dads. Also, the pool was filled with children (like toddlers) not scantily clad teenage girls or adult women. I understand that it's altogether possible that this kid COULD have been doing that, but that's also not the exact issue. It is, however, why I didn't just IMMEDIATELY call the cops.

When the guest first reported it, she said ""if you don't call the cops, I will"". Which I guess she assumed we weren't going to call the cops, which I dunno why she'd think we wouldn't. But I told her I was going to call my manager before I made any decisions. She then said ""fine, I'll call them myself"" and I said ""okay"". She then called the police, who arrived and handled the situation as they saw fit.

The thing is, while the police were getting my statement, they made sure to say ""And don't tell anyone they can't call us if they want to"" and I was pretty confused by that. I told them I never told the guest SHE can't call the cops, just that I'm waiting to see what I should do per management. 

Later, the guest came by the front desk (because anyone who works in customer service knows that customers HAVE to continue bothering you) to tell me that I was negligent, that this isn't going away and StandardHotelName is going to be in trouble. She said ""the cops are on my side"" and then left.

So now, I'm home, worried I'm going to get...who knows, sued or fired or whatever because of this? 

I wrote the cops a full statement, outlining every step I took in the situation, included dialogue between me, all the guests and my manager. I also wrote a statement for my manager and had my two co workers vouch for me, and write a statement saying that I never told the guest I said she couldn't call the cops.

The husband in question is in custody finally, that's a whole different story of it's own.

It's now months later and I've dealt with the majority of my emotions and have healed from most of the major trauma. Anyways. I got super drunk last night and something happened and triggered this unrelenting sadness that I didnt even know I possessed. I just cried and cried and cried. I am not an easily broken female and this brought me to my knees earlier this year. I guess my need to post this is that hopefully I'm not alone in my burying of emotions until they seep out of me. I'm not angry anymore and I'm not in denial or whatever. I've accepted this happened and have done everything necessary to see my husband behind bars and will eventually divorce him when he is in custody in the state i am in (hes being held in am adjacent state currently). The sadness though was so deep and so all encompassing. I will continue on in the way I always do, smile and laugh and make jokes for days. I will process eventually. 

Thanks and hugs.

117,"Hi Reddit,

I have been through a lot of personal changes within the last couple years and I am truly proud of how much I've changed and grown (for the better). I've been more honest than I've ever been with myself and I haven't been as hard on myself to the point that it's crippling. I went through my first major breakup a year and half ago and it's not weighing heavily on my mind as it once was. I am in the process of applying to graduate school, which not only makes me incredibly happy but also scares the bejeebies out of me. I look back at me last year and I am doing so much better, physically and mentally, and I am happy that I've made such progress.

However, I do have my moments (and those moments end up being at least a month) where I spiral and feel like all my progress has flown out the window. Sometimes my funk stems from randomly remembering a good memory my ex and I shared, feeling like I should be progressing faster than I am in my career, or it's me comparing myself and my progress to a friend who seemingly has life put together. It's so hard for me to be in these funks because I will be consumed over these feelings of dread to the point where I just lose interest in doing anything that makes me happy or will positively impact my future. 

This is hard for me to post here because I feel like I haven't articulated my thoughts in a clear way, but I just want to know: how do you deal with these pits of despair? How do you pick yourself up and continually try to live a more fulfilling life? I just find myself more and more in my head lately, and it makes me mad that my emotions seem to ebb and flow in such a drastic way. I know I will eventually get out of my head and feel fine again, but I want to know how to stave off the next low point or at least learn how to deal with the low points in a more effective way.",05Aug2019,2

I go over and pretend to be an old friend of hers and asked if I could talk to her for a sec (just to make sure she was okay in this situation), one of the guys was really aggressive off the bat asking things like “Who are you meant to be??”, “If you’re her friend what’s her name?”. He was getting really aggressive and ready to fight, so I was just explaining that me and a few friends saw the situation and wanted to make sure if this girl was okay, the girl and one of the guys were really understanding and thanking me, but this one guy wasn’t back in down, I said that I was sorry about all of this and offered to buy them drinks, this guy demanded multiple drinks for “really fxxking up”, so I did because I’m not gonna argue with a drunk guy taller and bulkier than me.

126,"Yesterday my mom brought me out to eat and asked me if I could possibly wait to go to college in January rather than August (now have two weeks left, told her I was accepted two weeks ago). Obviously I don’t want to wait. I want to be with my boyfriend across the country, get an actual education and not be even further behind, not live with 10 other people in a 4 bedroom, 2 bathroom house, etc. The list goes on.

I want to clarify: out of the 2 years I’ve been in college, my parents have not helped me pay one dime of tuition. My mother constantly borrows money from me (my dad gives me $30 a week for food and I don’t have a job) when I’m living at home for breaks, all while my brother and his family of 7 lives here for 2 years and has not paid one single bill. Our electricity alone is $300 and my parents pay for literally everything except 90% of their food and personal crap like toiletries. Can anyone see where I feel like I’m being fucked over?

So yeah, yesterday I spent a while planning things out to make sure my parents get up there to help me move in. I’ll take a spirit flight, catch an Uber to an air bnb, and go to my orientation on the 19th. My parents will drive there (they want to instead of flying)  on the 22nd and I move in on the 24th. They’ll leave on the 26th. Sounds good, but they still aren’t happy.

I don’t know what to do. My college will not let me move my orientation and it’s mandatory as that’s where I schedule classes and get my ID, etc. Like I literally cannot just skip it.

My mom wants me to wait so she can do the experience “the right way”  and celebrate etc. but I feel like it’s unfair to ask me to wait. I also feel horrible that she feels bad and doesn’t want me to leave. I feel like she’s manipulating me and I don’t know what to do :(",05Aug2019,3
127,"Was kicked out of school (medical type degree) because I got charged with a felony (case got dismissed after probation). The state licensing board said nah, and so the school wouldn't let me continue on. They're all federal loans that I know of and the interest is around 8% APR. And no, I promise I've already checked, I cannot use my credits or re-enroll in the same program or do basically anything with those years I wasted. It's just gone.

I'm 28, have a child, a wife, I'm broke AF and jobless at the moment. We're literally at my parents' (in my hometown) figuring out what to do. I have 5 classes left of an accounting degree (one in fall, four in spring) and will be graduating in spring 2020. I don't even know if I can get my CPA when all's said and done cause of the shit I've been through.

I'm so confused as to what to do and have considered suicide in the past. I have no savings, I'm highly in debt, I am jobless, and my future in my field of accounting is unpredictable. I'm considering not even finishing school and just quitting altogether because I've been taking college courses since 2007 and having nothing to show for besides an associates degree.

I was talking with my family about getting a $10 an hour job cashiering and eventually just pay for an apartment around here and wither away because I'm incapable of getting out of this situation.

Also, going back in Fall to do one class and then four in spring sucks because I've already ""only"" taken one class this past spring, and I'm gonna only be able to take one again in fall, for a grand total of two classes for an entire year. My school's also charging me out of state tuition because of all the damned credits I had from graduate school before getting kicked out. Besides this, I was falsely arrested and charged and still put through the damn horrific system, so I have major trauma, depression, and PTSD from my experience. I cannot even fathom staying there until May of 2020. I had so many horrific events happen: Got robbed at gunpoint, had a a friend who got murdered, an acquaintance who got murdered, got cheated on, kicked out of grad school, neighbor harassment, etc. I honestly just feel like killing myself.

129,"me (20yo f) and my bf (20yo m) have been together for almost 4 years now. 

we met in high school. the first year was tough, we both had just gotten out of a relationship with an abusive partner, but it had already been a year for me and only 5 months for him. we dated for about 3 months before assuming our relationship, and his ex was crazy, suicidal and manipulative. in this 3 months, they talked in secret, and met a few times. we were not officially together, but he was the first person i opened myself to after breaking up with my ex. in january of 2016 he was staying at my house and went to take a shower, asking me to bring his phone so he could listen to music. his phone was unlocked and in the messenger app. i saw the conversation between them, and opened it. there i found that they’ve been meeting in secret, and the day of his birthday, which i canceled a plan to go out with my friend whom i had promised a year before to go see the first run of the new hunger games movie, to see him. he arrived hours late, and i didn’t mind at the time, but reading the conversation i found out he was with her at the time and they’ve kissed. until now, i’m not sure if they had sex or not. he told me she was manipulative and threaten to kill herself if he didn’t meet her, and he time he denied her she actually tried to kill herself and ended up in the hospital. i’m not sure of this. this completely ruined my trust in him, resulting in a year of abuse and mistrust coming from both parts. we hated and loved each other, and it resulted in me having chronic depression and social anxiety, seeing i couldn’t see him around anyone without having crazy jealous fits, panic attacks and self-harm. i suspect he too ended up developing depression. 
in my depression, i gained almost 20 kg, and hated myself very strongly. i hated seeing myself in the mirror, refused to go out and isolated myself from everyone but him. he took care of me the way he could. i’m not trying to blame him, i was also very shitty to him. but he lying to me about her after i was healing after  a relationship where i was cheated on broke me. i come from a very abusive household, which i’m constantly verbally and physically abused and beaten my whole life. he was my savior, my protector, and i loved him with all of my being. 

he was sweet, caring, charming and my best friend. he still is. we’ve been through hell and back and always got each other’s backs. now, in 2019, things are starting to get worse again. in february, in the place i work, i met a guy. he was stunning, funny, caring. after hating myself and having 0 libido because i thought i was so ugly i didn’t want to have sex for almost 2 years, i was absurdly attracted to him. i wanted to jump him, kiss him, strip him every time we saw. we never had anything and he doesn’t know the way i felt. since i was in a relationship, i denied my feelings for him. the months passed and we got a little closer, but not much. ever since we met he constantly stared at me, sat close to me, and i never though anything of it. my friend is his best friend, and we got closer through him. after one day which we talked alone a lot, i had to go sleep in my bfs place. i’d smoked cigarettes with the people from work before, and when i arrived he started nagging me about the smell. i was already extremely frustrated about having feelings for the work guy, and i ended up being very rude to him. i tried to bring the topic about open relationships, and i’d didn’t end up well. he dint have any interest in it, but in his words, “ended up talking about it only because he knew i would say something he knew i was hiding from him”. i told him about the work guy. the discussion was horrible, and i started to have a severe panic attack, in which he had to calm me down. this was june 1st. 

now, ever since knowing about work guy, our relationship has been horrible. we fight almost every time we see each other. he says don’t like him, and only are with him because i’m used to and are scared of change. i am. but i also like him, very much. i’ve been trying to better our relationship, but to almost no avail. things suck. i cry every weekend. he has no patience to deal with me anymore. i know that coming back from vacation this week i’m going to see work guy again and those feelings will come back. 

today, after fighting again, we talked 2h on the phone about breaking up or being on a break. i said that if we were to be on a break, i wanted us to be free and live our lives. this includes seeing other people, to see how we feel. he doesn’t want that and says it’s the same as breaking up. i kinda agree. i’m torn. part of me thinks is time to let go, i don’t want to cry anymore. i don’t want us to suffer and end up hating each other. 
the other part knows i’m letting go of not only my lover, but my best friend and all of our memories. 

when is it time to break up?",05Aug2019,2

I’m currently living with my family in a new state. I’ve been working at my uncle’s business with him, and it’s been going well. My cousin is off to college soon, so I’ll soon be left in the house with my aunt and uncle. For the last few days, I’ve been feeling more and more apathetic. Nothing affects me anymore, nothing brings me joy, sadness, anger. It’s like I’m watching everything happen and my emotions aren’t reacting, my heart isn’t responding to anything. I’m single, I don’t have any friends in this new state, and I have don’t like small talk, so that has slowed my process of creating friendships. I’m not even sure of what’s happening to me, and I believe I am lost. I have struggled with manic (bipolar) depression,  anxiety, and I was emotionally and physically abused when I was younger. My personality type is INFJ-T. (Not sure if these 2 previous sentences would help, just listing anything I can think of atm) Any and all advice would be appreciated.

132,"Hey everyone,

So I’m in my early 20’s and I suck at girls. There’s this particular girl that I fancy. But, I’m having trouble reading the signs. There’s times where she’ll comment on a Snapchat story or Instagram story. Then when trying to strike up a conversation with her she’ll hit me with the one word. 

So not wanting to be rude I just end the conversation. 

I would just straight up ask her out but she’s already turned me down before, saying that she was talking to someone else at that time. 

So I just feel weird like having her slide in my DMs at times, have her seem super interested in a conversation, then a text later just seem bored and disassociated with the conversation. She’s drunk snapped me a couple times and I’ve drunk snapped her. 

Am I being led on because I give her attention?

I’m 5’5 and 131 pounds. My waist size is almost the same at my hips and I have crazy hip dips. I HATE IT, my body has no definition. Maybe my body is okay, but I don’t think so.

140,"I need an opinion. 

Back when we lived in the house my dad bought us a car. Agreement was he’d get us a car and we pay for everything associated with it. My older brother later sold that car and bought a new car. (Btw all of these are worth around6-7k) 

One year into college I abruptly stopped going mid semester on my sophomore year to enlist in the marine corps. My dad didn’t like me leaving school/ enlisting in general but ya I left. 5 months, almost 6 mo after I returned for leave dad was like “you should take the car” etc. I left for MCT and then went into MOS school straight from MCT. I then got orders to Hawaii and anyone going overseas gets leave. I returned home again and yep. I commented to my dad about the car and he sounded a little hesitant. He said (sure, just look into it) I left for Hawaii and a few days after I called dad again after having asked and I was like “since I’m overseas the military will pay for everything but I only have 3 months, after that it’ll be out of pocket” and he was like “and after you’re done with your contact?” And I was like “they’ll ship everything to my home state” and he was like “alright” again sounding hesitant. 

So now I’m thinking, “maybe he just doesn’t want me to bring the car?” It’s only him and mom back home (mom doesn’t drive) and they have 2 other cars over there so it’s not that they wouldn’t have it and they don’t drive it anyway. 

But, I’ve always wanted a motorcycle anyways although it would cost more long term (buying + slightly more for insurance vs just maintenance for the car and insurance) so I’m thinking about just getting a motorcycle &amp; not shipping the car

142,"So a very close friend of mine, literally my only friend has a fat crush on me, going as far as saying “I love you” to me. Not directly but implied and saying things like, “I wish I didn’t fall in love with you.” I like and care for the person a lot, but for a long while I thought I also liked them back, but I came to the realization that I really don’t, I love and appreciate our friendship, but I don’t want more than that. I made the decision they needed to know that, so I told them. I told them in the most absolute, nicest way I could because I’m not out here trying to hurt someone I care about. But when I told them they kinda.. lost it?

I told them two days ago, and since they have been “okay” as they say, but every time we talk they just constantly degrade themselves. And by that I mean just always saying, “clearly you don’t want to talk, I’ll shut up now and leave you alone.” And like I said, I adore our friendship but it’s so hard to not feel like absolute shit for what I did. I’m the reason they are acting like this, I’m the reason they keep trying to give me their stuff because they “won’t be around much longer.” (We all know what the means). I can preach to them as much as I can about how we are still able to be good friends and that I value our relationship but they just can’t see that?

I at every chance I can get will try am spare someone’s feelings, but this is becoming unbearable. I want to just freaking yell at them and tell them to stop and that the way they are feeling is understandable but taking it out on themselves and blaming themselves for everything isn’t going to help. That it is hurting me as well some I’m the mean one who told them that our relationship can’t progress where they want it too. 
But if I do any of that they might just go off and hurt themselves, and obviously I don’t want that. They told me that I’m the reason they haven’t relapsed on drugs and harm, but I’m ultimately gonna be the reason they do.

What do I do? I feel stuck, I can’t yell at them because it’ll make it worse, I can’t tell them nicely because we all can see where that brought us. They say they think they are bipolar and etc, I feel horrible for the things I’ve said even tho I’ve said them the nicest way possible. I had to turn my location off on Snapchat so that when I don’t open their messages they can’t see that I’m active and ignoring them, but I honestly can’t keep talking to them when everything they reply with is self degradation and no matter what I say they will not change their mindset. It’s all their fault to them, and I can’t fix it.

I’m really stuck, I don’t know what to do. So I ask all of you, what do you think? What do I do? What if they hurt themselves because of me?",05Aug2019,2

Thing is, about a year ago he started flirting with a girl and soon after they were dating. After that he never had tim to hang out or that's what he said. He'd always say that he couldn't because he had plans with his girlfriend. 

This went on and on until we basically didn't talk to each other at all since he was always busy with his girlfriend, he even ignored me from time to time when he saw me.

Overall giving me a heavy heart, and with me being in that state of mind was purely focused on ways to erase said comments.

That's when I thought about either hiding or deleting my old YouTube channel that I used to make those past comments *(I got a new email and in-turn a new YT account)*. After backing the old account up by downloading old videos and taking screenshots of it, including two comments I wanted to keep. I ended up hiding my old channel as that would delete my replies without erasing my channel.

After going through with it, I was happy for a few hours until I remembered an argument that happened about 9 months ago. During which instead of simply editing the reply I just deleted it and made a new one several times, which was questioned about why and I answered. Remembering this, I realized I was so focused on fixing the one-liner mistakes that I pushed aside the ones where I truly had a conversation. Continuing this thought someone reminded about the Streisand effect, that's when I realized my mistake, and the cycle of worrying about, essentially nothing continued all over again.

That's why I'm here. I need advice on how to move on and accept my mistakes, how to stop constantly worrying about something that technically isn't even a big deal. Before I do something idiotic in an attempt to ""fix"" my previous ones.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, for any advice you may have, and I hope you all have a great day!",05Aug2019,1
170,"Long story short , as kids me and my sister were raped several times ( I wasn’t raped by my stepdad). We were physically abused and beaten by my step dad, he would favor his two daughters and have them watch while we were beat. ( he favorited them ALOT, for example he taught them how to drive and he never taught me ! Even though I was the only boy and older than them. I bought myself a car and taught myself how to drive by driving around the neighborhood, almost killed myself twice, got in 3 accidents too , I never had experience driving in snow and with my luck I ended up starting my second job the morning of a snowstorm, Guess what ... I crashed!!) 

We tried telling my mom but she just told him what we said ( he told her that he didn’t hit us) and he would just beat us even more.

Over time they got divorced and my mom started messing with drugs because she didn’t know what to do , she met a guy and started staying with him , she’d leave me alone for weeks at a time, I ended up punching him in the face because I got fed up with him beating her but of course she still chose him, oh yeah he fractured my nose.

When she was home , It was just me and her , she claimed me for food stamps and cash aid , that’s how she kept the bills paid.  That was the only money she ever really had.

My sister ended up getting raped by my stepdad and of course my mom didn’t believe her .

My sister started running away, she was living in a few group homes for a while ( if you don’t already know , some female group homes are absolutely fucking vial, the girls that live at some of them are fucking evil cunts, my sister had the shit beat out of her several times and they also stole a lot of her clothes and shit.

I would go visit her and have to watch them degrade her because if I was to say anything they would just beat her once I left.

She got a boyfriend that would constantly beat her as well, he would also bring meth around her which is the reason she started to use.

My mom is mentally tired of my sister. My mom has 4 kids living with her, she just had 2 babies within the last 4 years , she’s living with her boyfriends family, the only money they make is off cash aid, food stamps and unemployment. My mom has had 1 job that I know of in her life which was only for a week or two .
My moms clean now that we are all grown up , she’s now raising her new babies exactly how we wanted to be raised which is nice . (Sarcasm )

3 years ago I was invited by my grandparents to come to Wisconsin for a week ( they bought me a round trip ticket )  and meet my other side of the family. 

My moms white and my dads Mexican, so I got to meet the Mexican side basically. They all loved me very much! They threw a birthday party for me, it was my 18th birthday , they offered for me to stay with them for a bit until I got on my feet, it was a hard choice, I just turned 18 , I had recently got expelled from the last school district that was close to my moms house, I ran out of options and I had to make a decision that would impact my future HEAVILY and I had to make my mind up fast because the return flight was in 2 days.  After lots of thinking I decided to just stay. One second my life was going one direction , then one second it’s going the other. I knew no one, I had no history or life in this new state, I loved it, I needed a new start

I tried a bunch of jobs, I struggled a lot, I’m thank ful for my family here in Wisconsin but I was not comfortable with the family I was staying with. They used me like a slave, I’d have to mow their lawn , plow the snow, sweep the basement , take out the trash, watch the kids, pick up the dog shit, do the dishes , walk the dogs , mop the basement.

I was working grave yard shift at a factory so basically 3pm - 4am , id also take my buddy to work too everyday

I get that I had to help around the house , which is something I had no problem doing but it made my life so much harder, I’d have to wake up at 8 and watch the baby, then they would expect me to be up before 11 otherwise they’d call me a lazy piece of shit.  I was only making like 300$-400$ and because of the accident I got into , I had to pay around 1000$ for damages since I had no insurance. I literally had just got the car a few weeks before that and I had used all the money I had saved so I couldn’t afford insurance right away . I had to pay them 50-60 dollars every week for groceries, so I had no money saved... whenever I would go to grab food to make lunches they would talk shit , telling me that I’m grabbing too much food , or that someone else is gonna eat it so I have to put it back ( even though they had A SHITLOAD OF FOOD, THESE PEOPLE ARE RICH TOO) I would go to work starving, I just stopped touching the food in general because I was tired of hearing them complain

One night I decided to stay out till 11pm with my buddy and they got mad . They said if I wasn’t home by their curfew then I would have to find a new place to live. 

Me and my buddy decided to move out and go half’s on a apartment , it was hard cause I had no money saved . 

I got fired from that factory job because my buddy had got caught sleeping in the bathroom stall and they fired him. I was his only ride so I had to drop him off at home, they fired me too because they made me choose between work or dropping him off an hour away.  We literally had just started work that hour  to,o so he would have waited a while . I should have made him wait but hey good karma haha

I eventually found a hvac job which led me to the electricians apprenticeship I got now. The electrician I work with gave me a year on my apprenticeship in advance. I now own a 2 bedroom apartment with my girlfriend . One room is ours , living room is where my girlfriend watches Netflix and the other room is my office for gaming. 

I felt the need to give you guys a quick backstory, keep in mind these are minor details, there is a lot more that has happened , it’s just a lot to type.

This is where I need your advice , I barely talk to my sister. It’s been 3 years , she still live in Cali . 

One morning I see Facebook reminding me that it is my sisters birthday , so I send her a message. She told me what I didn’t wanna hear. She said she wasn’t doing too good.

Today she called me crying, asking me how I’ve been, how my life is, what do I do for work. 

I asked her what was wrong and she told me that her boyfriend had just gotten locked up, she said she’s been sleeping at her boyfriends friends house and when she’s not there she’s sleeping on the streets.

She told me that she was really hungry and that she has to steal food when they aren’t home , and how her friends mom sells ice cream and they’ll give her one every morning for breakfast. 

She has no guidance , no one to point her in right direction , she’s hurt and alone . I know how she feels , I know exactly how she feels. 

I offered her multiple times to come live with me

 as a man and a big brother it is my responsibility to care for my family. 

But my girlfriend disagrees , she said she doesn’t want to take care of another person at such a young age and that my sister most likely won’t want to change and that it’ll most likely have a effect on our relationship. 

What do I do? Do I just watch my sister die ? Do I pick my sister over my girlfriend ?  I’m confused and lost and I really wish I didn’t have to make this decision. My sister has nobody, my dad just got of jail and she tried living with him for a month but he starting beating her. I stood up to him and he threatened to kill me.

She can’t go with my stepdad because he supposedly raped her and my mom wants nothing to do with her .

Adoption is out of the picture. She’s 18 now . I need advice please",05Aug2019,0
171,"So this is all very dumb and I feel very confused and feel I have no one to discuss this with.  My rational side already knows exactly what I should do, but I just need to talk about this or get a more objective opinion from people with more life experience.

So two years ago I developed a crush on someone in one of my music classes.  I didn’t know him super well, so I decided it’d be wise to try to become his friend.  Long story short it went exceedingly well.  He became my friend and I met several other people because of him.  Sadly, the feelings I had for him were not mutual.  He said he felt only friendship for me.  I got over it, he started dating one of our mutual friends.

Fast forward to now.  I live about six hours from him and my other friends and I’m about to move further away for college (long story).  This friend and I are now much closer. Earlier this year he got dumped by his gf.  He’s taking it hard.  It’s been a few months but he’s still having issues.  It’s been a dark time for him.

So a few weeks ago I went to visit my friends for one last time before college.  I spent an entire day with the person is question and it ended on a fairly emotionally intense note.  We had a tearful goodbye.  And my sorry ass picked up more feelings for him.

They’re driving me insane.  I have no idea how to cope with these feelings.  They’re arguable more intense than the previous time.  I think I know the answer is to get over him, but how?  I’m not going to distance myself from him, he doesn’t have a ton of good friends in his life.  I want him as my friend.  I dont wanna fuck that up.

He’s still in pain from this breakup.  I don’t know if I should discuss my feelings for him with him or not. I’m so confused.  I’m 100% sure he doesn’t feel anywhere near the same, but I feel like I’m going crazy.",05Aug2019,1

176,"How do I get my room mate to take better care of her cat? 

About a year ago, my room mate and her partner insisted on rehoming a cat which lived at the parents' place.  This cat is probably 15 years of age, and the process of rehoming was rather arduous, taking a few months before the cat would feel comfortable to roam around the house.  During the first few months (when the cat would run off upon seeing either myself, or our other room mate), I noticed the cat had a bit of a limp.  I mentioned this to my room mate, who said that she'd take her to see the vet if the limp wasn't gone within a couple of weeks.  Fast forward a month and I pointed it out to them again.  Fast forward another two weeks, and still nothing.  Eventually, whatever caused the limp seemed to self resolve, and the cat's been moving fine.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, they also forget to feed the cat on a regular basis.  As in, the partner will probably remember the cat needs to be fed on average once a week.  The other room mate maybe once every two-three days?  Sometimes the cat goes to the lounge (where her food bowl is) to ask them for food and they ignore her because they're watching a DVD, after which they go to bed and forget to feed her.  It's basically myself and the other room mate (neither of us wanted a pet in the first place) that have become the ones that actually feeds the cat (sometimes they even forget to purchase cat food).

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks ago, the cat was going nearly a week without eating much.  She then was vomiting after trying to eat a little.  Myself and the other room mate were worried about her, and kept telling the actual owners of the cat.... but they wouldn't take her to see a vet or anything.  I was at the point where I was deciding whether to take time off work to take her to the vet myself, but she managed to bounce back.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that it's not my cat, but I absolutely hate seeing the poor thing suffer.  I'm worried that she'll get sick / injured again and they won't do anything about it (again).  As a room mate, what can I do to 1) get my room mate to actually take better care of her pet?  and 2) Where does the line get drawn - what do I do if the cat gets sick again, and they refuse to seek medical attention for her?",05Aug2019,3
178,"Disclaimer: ok so this does sound like a very subjective matter but I'm just looking for any advice I can get.

My current girlfriend and I have only been together for a month. Sexually we're used to different rythms in bed.. I've been used to rougher, faster paced sex and nearly all my moves fall into that category. She however has been used to gentler and slower paced sex. I'm struggling to reconcile the gap and it's leading to performance anxiety. 
I'm not being able to figure out the right moves nor the right place. I've been with women before and this is the first time this has happened.

Has anyone here been in a similar situation? any advice on what I can do to help bridge the gap?",05Aug2019,0

atmy daughters schools from 8th -10th grade, in PE she attends the swim unit and boys and girls have it together? Why is this allowed? Wouldn't this make girls feel uncomfortable and give immature boys an opportunity to harass and humiliate girls? And cause distractions and goofing off among everyday? Not to mention young boys will be shirtless around young girls and I think that is inappropriate especially in a school setting My daughter keeps saying she does not care but she is young and may not understand how wrong this is this just seems wrong especially at school. Giving a boys a chance to leer at girls like this this class also pretty much just gives students to look at all the other students in bathing suits. What is this a party or something? How is this appropriate for school? Why is the school providing an avenue for voyeurism? can people really say honestly that young boys and girls will concentrate on swimming while they are around each other in bathing suits and not goof off? That boys (who aren't known for sensitivity) won't use this opportunity to harass or tease girls? what reason do they have to put them together? They can easily separate boys and girls buy taking the boys of another gym class and putting them with the boys in the gym class doing the swim unit and the same with girls",05Aug2019,0

181,"So I’ll start off by saying I know I am 1000% in the wrong here. I have been out of work for about a month but just recently started a new job. My rent is due on the 5th of the month. Currently my July rent has not been paid and August rent is due tomorrow. I plan on using a student loan to cover the cost of both months rent but am unsure when I will be receiving that money, it could be a week or two. The past couple of days my landlord has been requesting the payment and my plan was to ask family members for a short term loan. I only have 2 different people I can ask who would have the money to spare for a week or two and the 1 I have reached out to said they need to think about it. I still have a little hope with the other family member but it is not a for sure thing. My landlord was expecting money orders left in his mailbox by the end of today, which didn’t happen. I received a text from him this morning which reads 
“Good Morning. After several attempts to reach you and your many failed stories on providing the rent, we are concidering your eviction . Please let me know what you intend to do.” 

In my state there is a 3 day period to pay any unpaid rent, which I’m certain I can come up with the money in that time. 

I don’t know how to go about this. I don’t know what to say to him tomorrow, when he sees the money orders were not left in the mailbox. I feel awful that I haven’t been completely honest with him and realize it was a huge mistake. 

I also have a roommate who just moved in about two weeks ago who doesn’t know what’s going on.

Any advice on what to say to him? Also if anyone knows any financial solutions if the other family member is not able to help? I am 19 and do not have much credit established so a loan isn’t really an option

190,"**Some backstory:** In October, one of my best friends (not the one mentioned in title) introduced me to my former fling (let's call him T) at a party. We quickly became close and started talking. A lot of his friends also came to this party, and I really liked hanging out with them a lot. We were long-distance (about 3 hour drive), but we had a lot in common and I genuinely thought we were more compatible than any other person I've been with. Eventually, we slept together and started visiting each other when we had the chance. Fast forward to January, he loses feelings and calls it quits (I made a last-minute surprise trip just to see him... big mistake). I was so caught off-guard and devastated, but tried my best to accept the fact. The next day, I call his close friend, K, just to hang out. We eventually get to the topic of T. We bonded a lot over T, our shared experiences with him, and our own personal experiences over the next couple of months. Now he's become one of my best friends that I go to about almost everything.

K told me in May that T has been seeing someone (though he hasn't made it public), and I went in a downward spiral for a couple of weeks. I ended up seeing them again at a rave, with his friends and the girl he's been seeing. I told myself to just hold in all of the bad feelings until I didn't have to see them in person again. A few weeks later, I gave in and checked one of T's profiles (we still follow each other on social media but I've muted him). I ended up being in a bad mindset again and K said that I just needed to get used to it as sad as it is, and that I was doing so well when I saw them at the rave so why am I still like this, and that he was getting tired of me always getting myself down about T. I eventually started to recover, but now K has added me to a Discord with T and a bunch of their mutual friends. I know T said he wants to be on good terms and eventually become friends, but it's honestly torture seeing him with someone else, and having to pretend that I'm fine and it doesn't affect me. It also hurts knowing that I've been an emotional burden to K, and that I can't share my feelings involving T anymore.

Now here's the issue. I've been asking myself why I am still not over this fling even though it was only for two months, and I'm thinking it's because I am still linked to T because of our shared friendship with K. In my past relationship, I had never been close friends with any of my ex's friends, so it was fairly easy to not get involved with him except for when we had work together. He's also moved across the country, and that's significantly helped me move on. This fling with T hurt me more than I thought it would, and I honestly don't want to be associated with him at all just so I can move on. But I also don't want to lose my friendship with K either. I know he considers me a lot when there are times when I have to talk to T, but I can't help but feel he's trying to get me to become on good terms with him even though I haven't moved on. I don't know if me wanting to cut off everyone except K is immature or the right move. I just want to stop hurting about a stupid fling. I feel so embarrassed catching feelings for someone who basically hit it and quit it.

TL;DR Still think a lot about my two month fling, but we now have a mutual best friend. Best friend wants me to get over him and the situation; also suspecting that he wants me to be on good terms with the fling again. Idk how I feel about that and want to get over it on my own terms, but I don't want to cut off my best friend. What do I do?",05Aug2019,2

He was expecting a call at a specific hour and my stupid, stupid ass decided to no caller ID him just to get him excited, when he answered super happy I just laughed into the phone and hung up. He was immediately super hurt by this. I am a massive, horrible asshole 100 and 10%. I felt disgusted with myself. I truly, TRULY did not mean to be so horribly malicious. I don't know what reaction I expected but I did not do it with horrible, horrible intent. I can't even justify it. Horrible, horrible judgment call. Anyway, today I apologized. I told him I was so unbelievably sorry and there was no way I could take it back but that I love him with all my heart and truly didn't mean to hurt him. He said that we're good and that karma will come back to bite me in the ass. I feel I completely ruined what wasn't even the best relationship to begin with. He's teased me and busted my balls hundreds of times but what I did was clearly too far. I fought a small fire with a forest fire. Any ideas on what I could do to possibly fix our future?

198,"Hey guys. This is a random post I thought of making just to get some other opinions on the matter (although deep down I’m a little concerned about it). Do you guys think we will see a major reduction in the workforce in the next ten to thirty years due to automation? I see articles about companies downsizing due to automation and it’s very sketchy to me. I know most people will say “just go back to school to help automate things” but in America, schools are very expensive. Add the cost of student loan debt and current living expenses you may be looking at living in poverty after school, at least for a while. Not only that, but eventually wouldn’t the most senior automaters just automate your job as an automater? Automation just seems like a problem that is going to (eventually) cause most of the country to live in poverty due to the automation of all or most jobs.  Or am I worried about nothing?",05Aug2019,1

201,"So, this semester is my last in college, which has me bugging because I feel very deeply that I do not want to earn my bread doing this. Don’t get me wrong, the knowledge and experience college gave me was absolutely worth it, and I hope to use my aquired skills as a hobby. I recently talked to my father, who said he would gladly support me through yet another graduate course, although the thought of going into college again is kinda freaking me out. There were several times during my current studies that I simply wanted to quit, give up and etc, and if I get into college now, I imagine those thoughts will come up again, but I will then be around 27-28 years old. Is it too late? Would I be better off focusing on a specialty, such as a masters degree? If I had to choose a field of work today it would be medicine, but I don’t know if I could thrive at it, or even make it out of med school btw. Are there some ways I can become more secure on this big decision? How can I get to know more about the practice of medicine and if it’s for me? Like a good read perhaps?",05Aug2019,3
202,"I'm struggling at my current job with a bad boss. She's a nice person, but she's a bad manager and boss.


It started 5 months ago, on my first day at the job. My boss was giving me directions to do some projects, but it was super vague so I asked questions to clarify on certain things. She took it as an offensive question and angrily said that her directions are straightforward and clear, and repeated everything she said which is still very vague. I don't know what else to say at that point, other than I rely on my notes with her directions. After I complete the project, she got angry and said this isn't right and got even more angry that I didn't listen to what she said. I told her I'm sorry but I wrote in my notes and followed the directions. She didn't listen to me at that point and just told me to double check the project again.


At that point, I asked my coworkers in my department for advice on how they handle this. They said to ask questions, which I did. So they helped me on interpret our boss's directions based on my notes. This helped a lot but I don't want to keep asking my coworkers for help, but they are taking my side and understand how I feel.


On the side, when I'm taking breaks (going to the ladies room, lunch breaks, or getting water), my coworkers chat with me and my boss caught me a few times and keeps counseling me to never chit chat in the office (yes even chatting during lunch breaks, she finds it unacceptable). And then she'll give me more work to do to keep me from talking to people in the office.


At this point, my reputation at my job isn't doing well. I'm struggling to keep going at my job, and this causes me to feel very depressed and anxious to the point of having panic attacks. I can't stand up or defend for myself, or at least I try to but doesn't work out. I'm a very nice person with a kind and sociable personality. The ironic part is that my main job responsibility is to communicate with internal employees and  people outside of the company. I don't know what to do right now?

208,"Context: As a child, my family moved every few years, so I never made close friends nor (because of other issues too) really opened up to anyone. The only people whose deaths would really make me sad are my immediate family (and my cat which is already dead), for others (friends, grandparents, ...), it's just a short ""That's too bad. Ok, whatever"" in my head and a possible topic to have small-talk about.

Similarily for relationships, I can be really nice and all, like the person, but it won't go beyond a certain threshold where I can still pull away from them at any time without real repercussions for me aside from a bit of shame/embarrassment/awkwardness for a few days for just leaving them. 

I want to be in a relationship with someone I can trust, but I know and feel I am not ready to be in a relationship, because I can't get close to people, so I also don't want to be in a relationship. Adding to that, I feel a bit conflicted about people, often going from ""Fucking cunt."" to ""Very nice, I like that/you"" in my head (both ways), completely randomly, even if they didn't do anything nice/good or bad.

210,"Hi, all. First time poster - using my depression redditting alt. 

So. Wall of text. But this means a lot to me, and I could seriously use some advice.

I am visiting my home province from living near my Uni, staying a week with my family. We're all incredibly close, in a way that we all overtly recognize as special, and atypical. We love each other through thick and thin, and can spend hours at a time laughing with each other over food we've all helped prepare. We operate under the assumption that there are no secrets and every facet of our lives are able to be safely shared and enjoyed, with nothing more than guidance or well-meant words to direct our actions. We have all found this to be comfortable, flexible, and allowing for us each to find our own happiness, sociability, and success.

Today, after dinner, and while my 3 siblings (all younger) were away with their respective pals' houses, I walked into my sister's art room. It's my old room, which she uses to paint, sketch, store her instruments, etc... 

It's incredible. Art everywhere, genuinely, objectively good art, portraits and landscapes of a quality that I would never hope to accomplish. There are small books of sketches laying open on the dresser, half-finished paintings on easels, sticky notes of ideas, and supplies that are somehow both organized and yet sprawling throughout the room. I take a few minutes to get really close to some of these paintings, appreciating the massive amount of time and effort that went into them - looking at how she's used highlighting techniques so sparingly yet accurately, how she's used grid systems for portrait copying, and things like that. There are pieces everywhere. And there is a leather notebook with a sketching pencil inside laying out on her desk.

I open it, expecting to be greeted with more of her wonderful art, but I find a date, a title, and text. 

It's her diary.

I broke our trust entirely. I read it front to back. I felt pretty awful during that time, and you are all free to chastize me for doing the one thing a girl would never want their brother to do, and what I should never do, but the more I read, the more I needed to read. 

The contents terrified me. She is horribly depressed. I've been dealing with Bipolar 2 disorder my whole life. It started out this year, and simply with inspirational quotes, goals, plans, sketches, song lyrics, but now what she is telling her diary is pretty much what I tell myself when I'm in need of seeing a therapist. She speaks of death, life's purpose (or lack thereof), loneliness, the idea of happiness, and pain more than anything else. Her friends treat her like garbage, use her, mock her, embarrass her in truly awful ways, and then lie to my family about it all, to apparent success. She talks about the expectations people hold her to, her lack of interest in everything, and how lonely she will be once the sibling older than her leaves (in 2 weeks).

She has been taken the rough route with her dating life as well. Sadly, I mean that in the worst of ways. She is a victim of sexual assault. My first reaction was to literally ball up my fist and shake in rage. I've met this person. I've smiled and shook his hand. I immediately began envisioning myself breaking his nose when he answers me at his door. 

It sounded horrific and devastating. The entries got worse after that. She speaks frequently of death and hatred. Most of her entries were about how alone she feels. This all broke my heart. She's no longer addressing her entries to her diary, but to whoever finds it when she's gone. She's now been cutting in places where people won't see it.

I have struggled with suicidal ideation and cutting personally. I kept it hidden. Very well hidden. I'm scared that she has the same ability. This terrifies me, because I finished my would-be suicide note the same month I was elected student body president - and she seems super happy and successful like I was. 

I need help with this. I can't go immediately to anyone she or I knows yet because I don't want to fuck this up. This happened tonight, and she's away, so there is time to react with you all. Here are my questions;

Is this a problem I should be seeking to solve? I know that is a very strange proposition to make, but diaries can often be an exersize of one's darkest (and potentially exaggerated) feelings. She could be ok and using it as a release - but should I react as I want to?

How do I approach her about therapy and medication? Should I mention my own experience and struggle? Or just open a conversation? My family is lovely, but she is obviously hesitant to seek their help, as I was. She had an entry about her friends not listening to her pleas for help. She has pages of ""HELP ME"" scratched hard into the paper. I want to try.

Do I tell her I read it? Is there any path to lessen the blow? I know I'm an asshole for doing so, but now I feel that I may be trying to save her life. I think I need to act fast. 

Anything will help. I love her. I don't want to know she's in this pain and carrying trauma without acting on it. But this is a teetering situation and I need to be careful.

I am sharing too much information - I know. But she will not see this, and I will delete it within a small amount of time. But please, while you can; help.

TL;DR I read a book, which ended up being my sister's diary, and now know for a fact that she has been assaulted and is depressed, cutting, and suicidal. I breached trust, but now have some crucial information. What do I do?",05Aug2019,1

213,"Please help me. I don’t know what to do. I got privately owned student housing where I have my own room and bathroom. I only share a kitchen and living room with two other people. 

I am not a partier, I don’t drink often and I don’t smoke weed. Under the survey I said no to all these things for roommate matching. These two girls whom were friends before this and are two grades above me are into all those things. 

They specifically told me they drink most nights even day drink, smoke weed, eat edibles, go to casinos, and like to go out all the time. 

This is so not me. I am very studious and I take my school very seriously as I am paying for it. I have already asked them not to smoke in the apartment because the smell really bothers me. 

They did not respond to this and changed the subject. So, not only are we so different on these fundamental issues, but our personalities and likes don’t match up either. 

I’ve looked at my lease and it doesn’t seem that I will be able to get a different unit, but I will be calling management to try. I’m not sure if they both lied on the surveys or management just didn’t follow them. I’m also worried their actions will end up costing me when we move out for damages. 

They’ve already expressed inadvertently that they’re basically going to try to “corrupt me”. 
What should I do? I’m so upset right now about all this. I’m not looking to make life long friends in them, but I don’t want it to become a hostile situation. I don’t think I’m being unreasonable for wanting to not smell weed. Idc if they drink a bunch that doesn’t affect me. I’m just so anxious about this all. 

Let me know if you’ve been through something similar and what you did or any advice really.

223,"My boyfriend and i have been dating over 2 years. First year was casual, past year is serious and exclusive. We have now even lived together the past couple months.
He travels a lot for work and had asked me to take out some of his close friends that were visiting from his hometown around for a bachelorette while he’s gone.
I met them up and introduced myself to 12 women as his girlfriend. At some point the bride to be told me that she’d heard a lot about me, and that the month before, he asked her for a +1 to the wedding for a “homegirl he’d been seeing for over 2 years.” She told me she said, “so you mean your girlfriend?” And had to playfully badger him for a second with her fiance and my bf’s father till he finally admitted im his girlfriend. I was offended by this but she’s known him for 11 years and assured me that he was just being an idiot and that hes all around awkward. (He is.)
Couple days after, we were chatting on the phone, when i overheard someone in the background ask who he was talking to, and he instinctively said “just a homegirl.”
Im ashamed of it but i absolutely lost my shit and cursed him out. He said i was over reacting over a label, that he spends every day of his life at home with me and has been faithful, which is true, but i feel disrespected regardless. Cursed him out some more and hung up.
Later i sent him a screenshot of my friend texting me about how one of the girls pulled her aside at the club asking what i was bc he referred to me as “a homegirl” to her and how even all his friends thought i was wifey material and that he was fucking up. All he answered was that i was right, that he “fucking sucks” and he’s sorry, and that he “gets scared.”
A day later i sent a super long message that im now embarrassed about explaining how hurt i was by everything and how none of this is normal at all, that i can’t do these mind games. 
Its been 2 days since i sent that and i’ve still heard nothing from him. I figure he literally has no idea how to respond to me because he knows im right.
I feel blindsided by this considering how happy we’ve been every day together. Whenever he has to travel we face time constantly and happily. To say i’m heart broken and confused now is an understatement. The label matters to me and i refuse to be gas lighted.


POINT IS! I know he’s going to call eventually trying to fix things.. but at this point i dont know if to even answer, hear him out and try to work on this, or ignore him and just give myself time to let him go. He’s not going to be back for another month. I know i should be with somebody that after over 2 years and that lives with me wouldnt hesitate to call me his girlfriend publicly. Idk why he’s ashamed of me and it’s killing me :( a lot of guys are constantly trying to take me out and i politely reject saying i have a boyfriend. Now idk if i ever did. Now i feel like im selling myself short. Yeah, im really in love.. But im not down for these games this far along with him.

224,"I'm asking this mostly because I'm a rising senior in high school, and I'm afraid that I'm ""too shy"" for life. I thought it was traced to my poor self esteem, so I worked on that this summer (I'm feeling pretty good about myself, honestly!), and I've concluded that that's not it. I'm trying to talk more to people, but each time I try, I'm just extremely shy (the rhyme was unintentional).

The thing is that I'm obnoxiously loud among friends and family, I'll use dark/crude humor among them and have a blast, but when I'm among acquaintances or strangers, I tense up and my mind goes blank. Also, I blush like crazy in public when I'm meeting new people. The other day I went in to talk to one of the department advisors for a school I'm applying to and all I did was introduce myself and my mom whispered to me, ""Why are you so red?"" and I hadn't even realized it! 

I do blush around guys I like, but around strangers?? Even if I'm (not) attracted to them, it's still ridiculous! The amount of attention I get from people is a factor, too. I'm working in this fun seniors' project and I've had to talk to several of my classmates in assigned groups. I enjoy talking to them, but because we're in groups, when you speak, around 12 eyes stare at you and boy oh boy does that make me burn.

I feel like maybe it'll look like I'm flattered for all of the attention, but that's not my intention at all, and the blushing just comes and goes when it wants. 

I know this is an absurd topic, but it's been bothering me a lot recently, and I want to know if anyone has anything to say about it that would help me. I know I'm naturally introverted, always have been always will be, but is there a way to control it up to a point? I love being ""extroverted"" with my friends and family, and I want to be like that with strangers, too, just because I feel it's the more likeable part of me.

I've been watching lots of comedy shows recently, so maybe that's why I'm thinking like this and their need to be  extroverted is rubbing off on me, I don't know...

My GM is a bitch and will literally piss me off because she thinks it’s funny. Like to the point of she makes fun of my disability (partially deaf) until i literally cry about it and then makes fun of me for crying. I am wanting to quit anyway and try finding a job with more set hours, which leads us to stress #3 on why that’s gonna be hard. 

#3, i am a full time college student going into my sophomore year. i literally have all my classes online except 1 which only open class was in the middle of the day on Tuesday and Thursday. It. Sucks. I want to one day be a clinical social worker, practically a therapist, so i am really wanting to get on at a local mental hospital but the only shifts they have open are 7am-3pm and such. This is the only place local to me that doesn’t require a bachelors degree to work in a mental healthcare setting so i feel like it would help me get a head start in my career, but they work Monday-Friday and due to my college classes it’d be impossible for me to work full time 🥺

I know this is probably all over the place but someone please help me figure out what to do because i am soooooo stressed about this.",05Aug2019,1
226,"So I'm 19 years old with a credit score of 643. About a month ago I got a preowned car through financing with Toyota. Last Wednesday I was coming home from work and got in a car accident. Even though the guy had to be speeding in order to come around the corner and hit me I'm still at fault since I was at a stopsign before crossing the road.  I've already filed a claim through insurance  (USAA) and they're dragging it on talking about not being able to finance the claim (possibly). They're saying this because I recently had a non-car owners insurance policy, and a few days after getting the car I called to change my policy. I talked with someone for about an hour, got a quote way beyond what I was expecting but affordable. She said she'd put it in effect so I can legally drive and that she was gonna see about lowering the price bc it was a bit higher than it should be for someone trying to get on their feet. But after filing for a claim they tried saying I was no longer insured and my quote was cancelled. I got a new quote immediately (had the claims agent transfer me) to put that into effect and after talking with her about what happened she said she'd talk to my claims detective about further looking into the case because the plenty reason for me to assume I was covered. (right?) 

So here's some background info before I ask do advice:

•I like to hope for the best and prepare for the worst so instead of letting tow lot fees build up while I wait on insurance I wanna go ahead and get this process started

•I need to get my car off the tow lot but I'm not sure if I need should have it towed to where I'm staying or to a body shop 

•At 19 I'm currently working in a restaurant. I currently cashier, host, and bus, and am about to become a server as my main job (30 hours a week @ $10.50, servers get cash tips but salary is much higher) . On top of this I also door dash in my spare time. But in order to work these jobs I NEED my car back ASAP

•I've had alot going on since highschool and after the car financing it's safe to say I'm broke. Happy to answer any questions just don't want to dump everything out on everyone 

*$200 in my account right now

Day of Accident: 7/31
Towing fee from accident - $233
Everyday on towing lot $33
Trying to get possible ideas for a solution Monday   8/5 with something in effect to get out of this mess by Wednesday 8/7

*Neither car is totalled 
*No injuries 
*Fender damage to other car
*Damage on rear passenger side from impact on my car
*Due to impact my car spun out into a ditch causing damage to the front. My friend who picked me up from scene is a mechanic and said it's not totalled
*I plan on calling insurance for more answers on Monday  (8/5) before lunch break time 
*More than happy to talk my ass off about financing and how I got into the situation I'm in money wise (like why I don't have much money saved up). 
*I've had a rough time growing up with depression but am becoming much more stable now and after a year break from college (starting this coming up semester) I want to go to a tech school locally for a few years and when I do that I would prefer to have my own place by then 


Here's what I really would love your advice on if you have the time! :

*Since I'm not enrolled in school currently I won't qualify for any student deals right?
*What's the best way to get this problem in the solving process and not just where I'm  building up fees with my financial situation as it is?
*Do I try to for credit cards? Loans? 
*If I'm going for either of those should I try to see if I can get financing for moving out as well? 1-1.5k a month rn with current job (excluding doordash income and I will be upgrading to serving soon but the summer is coming to an end as well)
*I'd like to get my car off the towing lot ASAP but don't know if I should get it to my house or to a body shop?
*If I don't even have the money for towing fees then what's the quickest way to get this car moving?
*How can I get around without bumming rides? Uber to work cost $35-$38 without tip one way 
*What are my quickest and smartest solutions? The sooner I can get a car back the sooner I can work more. Thank you so much for your time!",05Aug2019,6

230,"I recently believed I had not gotten into a university i was applying for, through a series of complicated events (I was thankfully wrong, but it’s important to know). I had “found out” during a class, and was deeply upset by it. However, I did my work quietly, didn’t speak to anyone, and believed to show that nothing was wrong (this is corroborated by my other friend who sits next to me, who explained i acted as I always did). The truth was revealed the following day, and all was well. However, I was in another class with THE friend (who was in the same room when I heard the news) and she (although I asked her not to) told the a teacher (in front of me) that I, upon hearing bad news, “threw a tantrum in the back of the class” and proceeded to laugh about it. 

I am deeply hurt by this, as the connotations of a tantrum are extremely negative and against my usually calm personality. My friend has also told her family, and no doubt many of other students and strangers who don’t know me, and now probably believe I’m a violent, uncontrolled, and emotional. I’m aware I may be overreacting, and there isn’t much I can do towards my reputation with Who she told, but it still deeply upsets me. I don’t know if I should talk to her about it (although situations like this have happened and she has turned it around on me to say I’m either too sensitive or should just get over it) or try and ignore and move on.

231,"Recently my sister expressed to me that she's concerned I have anorexia. She said I look like ibe lost a lot of weight in the past year and a half. She's not wrong, I've lost about 10 pounds in the last year, but there's a reason for this. 
A year and a half ago, my dad passed away. Obviously it put me in a bad place and I would go on to be diagnosed with severe depression by a psychiatrist. My depression makes eating seem tiring and undesirable, as it does with everything else that isn't sleeping. I've been eating a lot less but not because I'm trying to lose weight or i dislike my body, but because I'm literally too depressed to eat sometimes.

Also, I know my problems aren’t nearly as big as a lot of other people’s, but here we go. I’m an 18 year old girl about to start my sophomore year of college. Here’s my problem: I don’t do anything. My daily routine is waking up (usually around noon), eating, watching something pointless that I don’t find entertaining, eating some more, and then falling asleep at 3 AM. I don’t do anything useful. It’s not that I don’t want to, it’s that I lack the motivation. Everything seems like so much work now. Showering, cleaning, getting off the couch — I don’t want to do it anymore. And I’ve found that I’m so passive now (and sometimes even self destructive). I don’t really care about things happening around me. I solely do things because I have to or because it’s what I’m supposed to do. Like going to school. And I realize that all of this is happening. I’m aware that I’m doing absolutely nothing productive, or even anything that brings me joy. I see myself doing it but I still can’t stop. It’s exhausting and just sad. I feel like I’m wasting my life. Every night I lay in bed and feel guilty about what I did that day. And I have a couple people I could talk to (maybe?), but I think I’m physically unable to talk about myself like this verbally to another human. I don’t think I could get past 2 words without bursting into tears. I don’t have anyone super close to me, which would be nice in this situation. I don’t know what advice I’m asking for here.

243,"Well hello there reddit, you know I never thought I'd be one asking for advice from the people on the internet but today was literally the last straw and I just need advice on dealing with this situation. 
 So basically what happened was that there was a big state fair today where I live, I originally wasn't really planning on going until one of my cousins came to my house to pick up something she was borrowing, well long story short she invited me to join the group that was going to the fair the next day. She told me that she had a few plans that day in the morning but that she'd pick me up AT 3:00 in the afternoon.  So the next day I got ready to go to the state fair, I was done like 30 ish mins before the pick up time. Then 3:00 PM rolled by, followed by 4 PM and then 5 PM. I didnt receive any texts. By this time I was sad, disappointed, and angry, there were only two options 1. They decided not to go or 2. They forgot about me. (Both of which I wasn't informed of) Later into the night I found out that they were all infact at the fair, they had completely forgotten about me and had gone to the fair. I have to admit that it really hurt, and although I try not to be angry and petty I just really want to, do i not have the right to?? They didnt even bother letting me know that they had left without me.

A couple months ago she confessed to me that her mother's boyfriend has been sexually abusing her. Since before we met. My girlfriend had been planning to move in with me, and I had gotten a new job to be able to get her and whatnot. I start this new job in a week. The first paycheck I'm going and picking her up. Late this month or very early September.

There's only a couple weeks till she's away from him but it's eating me alive not to tell anyone. To just sit by and let it go on. I've begged and begged on multiple occasions for her permission to tell the police, her oldest sibling, anyone. She begs me to drop it and it'll make everything worse, she's been going through this for a long time and assures me she'll be fine, it's only a few more weeks. Says she'll never forgive me if I tell. Her family would never forgive her either. I end up letting her sway me, because I can't take hearing her sob and start panicking. She wants to be in control of this situation in anyway she can, and I think her having the ability to hide it helps her cope in some way. But I hear that piece of shit in the background of our phone calls talking to her mom or brother all the time, I hear when he comes through the front door, sometimes my girlfriend randomly has to mute for a while or she'll abruptly tell me she loves me and she'll call me back soon then hangs up. It makes me sick, I can't even begin to describe the feeling of staring at the 'call ended' screen wrestling if I should call the cops or thinking of him hurting her.

250,"Me (21 f) and my family are being harassed by our neighbor (20/21 m). It’s an odd situation but I’ll try my best to keep it short. I’ve known this guy for a pretty long time, he lives down the street from us with his family and we went to elementary school together so I have vague memories of riding the bus with him. Other than that, I haven’t had much contact with him or his family. He consistently speeds through the neighborhood (about 45 in a 25 mph area) so my dad has said something in our neighborhood Facebook group asking if people could please slow down-not calling him out specifically. Besides that I can’t think of any reason for him to be doing this. Every single time he drives by our house he will either yell “fuck you” or give us the middle finger, sometimes both. It happens every time we are outside when he drives by. I’m concerned because it seems very malicious and to be honest he’s always been a sketchy kid. I remember kids in the neighborhood saying he would torture frogs and stuff like that. My dad doesn’t want to do anything, but my mom has gone to the police and they’ve said there’s nothing they can do unless we have proof that he’s threatened us. I have really bad anxiety and this has made me pretty paranoid, I don’t feel safe when I’m alone at night and I just have a bad feeling that he might try and do something.

254,"*TL;DR : PETA protesters are unfairly harassing my restaurant and my employees, and there is little we can legally do to stop them. I don’t want to harm them or stoop to their level, but I need a clever way to protect the business and ward them off.*


I work at an upscale restaurant in a medium-sized city in North Carolina. We are located right in the heart of the downtown area on a high-traffic corner, both pedestrians and vehicles. There are several restaurants on this block, seven or eight in a very short distance. It’s also a hot spot for street performers and, per the title, protesters. 

For the past few weeks, a small group of PETA protesters have been harassing my restaurant. They stand with large flat screen TV’s strapped to their chests, showing reels of factory farming and slaughterhouses. They have several children with them as well, alternating between shouting at the guests and speaking into a megaphone. They have cameras strapped to their persons as well, to record any interaction we may have with them.

The restaurant, on one side, has great big windows with two nice tables that overlook the sidewalk, and on the other side, a big patio with 12 tables overlooking the square. The sidewalk surrounds us, meaning that if the protesters stand on the sidewalk in front of the windows or next to the patio, they can target our guests from a public space while also attracting the attention of passersby. 

I believe this is why we are the target, because no other restaurant nearby offers the same volume of visibility from both diners and pedestrians. 

The thing is, we are green certified, and a locally &amp; ethically sourced sustainable restaurant. Our chefs have personally visited many of the farms that supply our meat, dairy, and vegetables. Even our wine is sustainably sourced. We do everything we can to support humane, small-scale, local farming. We offer many vegan and vegetarian dishes as well. I’ve been with this company for four years and they do a lot for the community and genuinely care for their staff.

There are several other restaurants in throwing distance that cannot say this. This is why it’s so infuriating that we are being targeted, because it could damage our business and drive customers towards places that *do* source from large-scale factory farming. 

The protesters are impossible to ignore and make themselves as intrusive as they legally can. They entered the building once, and were asked to leave immediately (they didn’t, but we didn’t press charges, although maybe we should have). They haven’t tried to enter since, as I’m sure they know they will be trespassing. Police have been called, and they said that while they are being obnoxious and rude, unfortunately the protesters are well within their rights, which I understand.

How can we combat this? 

If we ignore them, our guests are subjected to watching videos of slaughterhouses and being screamed at as they dine. 

Asking them to leave yields nothing, as they know that they are well within their rights to stay. 

Engaging them is exactly what they want, getting anything on film they can edit to use against us. 

They have called myself, my employees, and our guests sociopaths and murderers. They are harming the business, and honestly just pissing me off. 

Help me, Reddit, you’re my only hope.



*Just for the record, I respect the tenets of veganism. I am not one myself, but I get it. I also believe in the freedom of speech that is guaranteed these folks, just as I would want my own to be. But I have a business to protect.*",05Aug2019,0

Angry voices completely fill my head, and when it sets in I cannot have a single positive thought for the 2-4 days that it will stay around. I cannot see any way our my current situation, and I often tell people off like I never would over things that, later when the episode ends, seem minor to me. I’ve been starting fights with my girlfriend, making plans to skip town/run away, screaming, smashing and punching and kicking things like furniture or myself, often leaving bruises. 

On top of this I’ve been starting to have panic attacks. All of these make me miss work, which i fear makes me look like an unemployable wreck. 

I have been seeing a councillor at a community hospital that I can afford on my current health insurance. I have talked with my manager at work a couple times and I feel like there is some degree of understanding. I have no friends, aside from my girlfriend. She tries to get people to hang out with me, but it does not work. They flake on me, ignore me over her, etc, effectively making me feel more isolated.

I ended up doing something stupid and told her that I was molested by my cousin as a child and that I think because of that I did the same thing when I was about 12 to two of my younger cousin's. One 7 the other 9. I knew what what I was doing was wrong but I didn't realize the consequences of my actions until later in life.

When I told her she went dead silent then told me 'I had no right to say that to her'. She then told me about how she was abused and raped as a child (nothing specific), something I had no idea about until then.

259,"(F 20) I’ve been single for almost a year now and I know how to deal with breakup and the heart break. Unfortunately I was in a very unhealthy relationship and I feel emotionally scarred from the whole relationship. Moving forward, I worked on myself a lot, found a new hobby to indulge myself in, hanging out with friends more and being confident in myself. While I do find myself thinking about my ex and the situation and I do still feel the pain. I have not been emotionally involved with anyone for a while because I am scared of being in similar situations but I wonder if it's time to move on completely and see what's out there?

260,"I think I may be addicted to marijuana... every single night before bed, I either think about smoking weed or I smoke weed. I try not to do it every night because I feel there’s a lot of social backlash towards anyone who is a ‘pothead’ and people are very weird around it because it is still illegal in my state. It helps me fall asleep quicker and I have always had problems going to sleep. Before I started smoking weed, I would have nights where I stay awake for hours, but now I can sleep whenever I want. I think of it like a medicine to help me get to sleep/sleep soundly for the next day. Recently I have been smoking more frequently at night and I have had a huge energy boost during the day. I want to smoke weed every night but I am still very afraid of being labeled as a ‘pothead’ or as an addict. I live with 4 friends and my girlfriend frequently stays the night, so it is difficult for me to smoke around them and I generally just won’t smoke. However, this creates another problem, since my girlfriend never really sees me smoke... cause I won’t when she’s around. She doesn’t know how often it is. We have smoked together with friends on weekends before and still do, but it’s only ever if we’re going out to bars or partying. I tell my girlfriend EVERYTHING and we have a very open and honest relationship, but I feel like I am hiding this from her. This is my dilemma... 

Do I?

Stop smoking weed entirely because I might be addicted to it and I’m actually just a pothead

Tell my girlfriend about my habit and why I feel it has medicinal value (helping my sleep) and hope that she accepts that. (I still am not totally sure what her feelings are about weed and I don’t know how she would react.)

Keep using it to help me sleep, but only when others aren’t around. I don’t want to make them uncomfortable and I don’t want to be uncomfortable around them, so I may not have a problem at all.

Thanks for any advice!

TLDR: I smoke weed a lot but my girlfriend doesn’t know. I’m not sure if I should just quit smoking entirely, tell her about it, or keep it to myself .",05Aug2019,1
262,"My parents divorced when I was really young, and because of that, I’ve spent a huge chunk of my life living with my mom, my younger brother, and my stepdad. And while I love my mom a lot, I really, really, really hate my stepdad for a laundry load of reasons (in no particular order):

He eavesdrops on me mid-conversation so that he can yell at me about something he doesn’t even know the full story about. He uses empty threats and scare tactics to stop me from doing really trivial things like biting my nails (pulling my hands out of my mouth) or picking my nose (telling me that it’s worse than eating shit). [NOTE: I know that both of these are bad habits, but my point is I wish not to be treated like dirt when it comes to trying to fix them.] He blows up over the smallest things that me and my brother do. As an example, he yells at my brother (swearing included, mind you) over staying inside to wait for the school bus, and we have never missed it once. He makes blanket statements and false assumptions about my brother and I that have no basis in reality, and even when they do, he still manages to exaggerate and blow them out of proportion in a way that would be seen as comical if it weren’t for his ignorance and arrogance when talking about them. He gaslights. He believes he’s always right. He’s forceful and controlling. He’s a perfectionist. He is very black and white when it comes to topics that are brought up. He hates people who bitch and whine, despite being a pretty bitchy whiner himself. And despite claiming to not be a fan of arguing (and also shutting things down prematurely instead of providing a space where we can talk about our differences cordially), he still likes to say things that could start an argument. Hell, he’s even turned me into too much of a pussy to even confront him directly about any of the problems I have with him. He’s made me feel scared shitless and has partly turned me into a mini-him in someways (or that’s how I feel, at least).

[NOTE: I know it sounds like I’m repeating my points for a lot of these, but I think it’s impressive to see how cyclical and predictable he is just because of a few core traits. Also, I know that a lot of this is analysis paralysis, but I’m writing this at 2 in the morning and I wanted a place to vent out my frustrations and seek help about this. Speaking of which...]

I hate that he has both controlled who I am and what I do, but at the same time, I feel like there’s nothing for me to do. What can I do whenever he does one of these things so that I can feel like I’ve made a step into improving our very pessimistic and sour relationship? Or is there another approach to this that I haven’t thought of? Overall, what should I do?",05Aug2019,1
263,"Really long story short every relationship I've had in the past has been I guess you could call abusive and toxic.

All my friends are telling me not to think too much about it and that eventually it'll get better but right now it seems kind of hard.

269,"I'm heading into my senior year of high school, and I don't have a lot of friends. Or any close friends, really. My best friend left me when I started high school and I never found another group.

&amp;#x200B;

It's not that I myself am bad at making friends; I believe its the environment. When I took a community college class last summer, I made two great friends and I was outspoken in class and it was great. And when I went to UCLA this summer, I made five AMAZING friends, the best I've ever had, who unfortunately don't live super close to me normally. And I was open with them, emotional, even annoying (I have anxiety and when I get anxious, I get quite annoying asking for reassurance-I'm working on it but its VERY HARD), and we made so many inside jokes and got super close and everything. In less than three weeks!

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I want friends like that at school. I think that I almost subconsciously close myself off in a normal environment. Perhaps it is some social anxiety from knowing that these people already have friends and believing I'm not worth their time, or knowing that I have to see these people every day (but that's unlikely because there's only one year left); whatever it is, I'm much less open with people at school than at UCLA. I'm friendly and a pretty good listener (I think), but I never get loud or boisterous or do anything really exciting that leaves an impression; I'm too afraid of offending. I guess it might be because I feel like (illogically), these classmates are my ""one actual shot"" of making friends. Like, if I fuck up making friends at UCLA or in a community college class, I still have actual high school classmates to try with. But if I fuck up with them, then I'm just screwed and friendless, so perhaps I'm afraid to try in what I consider the ""actual, higher stakes"" friendship making.

&amp;#x200B;

I've even met a group of people, I'm in a book club with them. We're all going to be seniors and we're all smart, but they're pretty much already their own group. It's four/five guys and me and one other girl, who is friends with them but not really in their group. Anyway, their guy group seems SUPER fun, but they're already established and have so many inside jokes and references and everything it just seems insane. At the book club today, I made polite chitchat and everything, but I was holding myself back from saying anything potentially annoying or even loud or noticeable. I want to stop but its very hard when you're scared and anxious and holding yourself back.

271,"So my gf and I have a pretty good relationship. We have also both discussed that we date exclusively because we can see ourself with the other person in marriage one day. She’s even told me that I’m the only one she has ever seen herself marrying.

Now right before me she got out of a long term relationship and had been sexting a guy. This is something she had never done before so she wanted to try it.

Now she’s with me, she gave me her virginity. So she’s getting more in touch with her sexuality and all.

She’s mentioned that she used to watch lesbian porn and was very curious about it years ago. She says it’s not so much any more. But she does kind of wonder what it would be like to kiss a girl. I asked her if she would ever want to and she said if she found a girl attractive and wanted to kiss her, she would run it by me, but she’s never really felt like “I’m really into that girl. I wanna get with her. She’s just been attracted to other girls.

I asked her if she would consider it cheating and she said not really if she ran it by me first.

Then I asked her what she would think of me kissing a guy. She said “...yeah, I guess I wouldn’t be cool with it.”

Now I’m just a bit uncomfortable about this because when I dedicate my time and exclusivity to someone, it’s because I am interested in a future with them. Looking into the future, I worry that her curiosity will bug her enough to want to try it out.

This stems from one of my friends who walked in on his mom cheating on his dad with another women. They got a divorce and now she’s married to the woman. This happened when the guy was 22 years old.

So I really don’t want to build something up with someone just for that person to want to experiment or whatever.

And I’m not cool with her experimenting in the relationship either. Monogamy is very important to me (and she says it is to her as well).

But idk. Is this something to worry about? How should I handle this?

277,"I found out my boyfriend of 2 years has had a reddit for about 1 year. I really couldn’t care less; I have social media accounts myself and I’m always posting too. Unfortunately, my curiosity got the best of me. Since I now knew his username, I clicked through his “comments” that he’s made on this site. He’s made a few comments that mention me, and it’s nothing bad or anything. But, he posts A LOT about his ex gf that he dated for ~1.5  years (they broke up 7 years ago). Always referencing her, talking about sexual things they did together, saying how he thought they’d get married, etc.

In one post (from 6mo ago), he talks about how he’s emotionally unavailable in his current relationship (me). This is something I already noticed myself the whole time we’ve been dating. He only recently said “I love you” and has barely showed emotions of true affection. I would always push these feelings down because I don’t think love has to be this big production. But now I feel as if he never had a spark with me. 

Other things to note: since we’ve started dating I’ve gained about 15lb, and I’m worried he doesn’t find me attractive anymore. He falls asleep on the couch (next to the bed) most nights and doesn’t sleep next to me. we have sex 1-2 times per month (we’re in our 20s). 

Is this a red flag? Is this me over-analyzing and feeling jealous? I’m not sure if I want to confront him, because I want him to feel like reddit is a safe space for him. But I can’t shake the feeling of being hurt, and feeling like I’m 2nd best.",05Aug2019,2

Will most likely post this on an careers subreddit as well.🙂 )

I have no idea where to go in terms of a career.
The past few years I've been caring for my grandmother, who had advanced dementia, but she passed away a few months ago.
I've been wanting to get back to university to get a degree but I don't know what career path I would suit at all.
 
I'm pretty shitty at maths, so I'd need to look for a job that doesn't need a lot of it, or only needs really basic maths.
I have SPD so I can get sensory overload from very loud environments, but I don't have any learning disabilities.
And even though I like to help people I'm not sure I would do too well working in aged care because I have a bit of...well it's not quite trauma, more like an emotional hang-up from my grandmother's fast deterioration.
Any careers that I think I might suit are either hyper competitive or have no growth, so chances of finding a job are slim even with a degree.

288,"So this deserves some backstory id say so I live with my grandfather and my mom. For years my mom has been very manipulative and controlling of me and suffers from paranoid delusions (she believes everything bad that happens to her is cause 1 small group of people from her old job are paying people off to do said bad thing) this ranges from a rude customer service interaction, to her getting in a accident, to someone simply not letting her return a item cause its against the places policy) its quite ridiculous and unbelievable, and ive tried to reason with her but she doesnt listen or just reacts angirily when i try to offer a more reasonable explanation. Ive talked to other family members and they dont want to do anything about it sadly. Shes also racist and homophobic which thankfully doesnt come up much but when it does i feel really uncomfortable and i happen to be gay as well which idk whenever she does that stuff it makes me question if i can ever come out to her. Originally her paranoid delusions mostly affected her which is fine but now she tries to bring it into my life making everything bad or just kind of unfortunate that happens in my life link back to it. Like i had a asshole manager awhile back and i mentioned it to my mom just to vent about it then suddenly she said it was cause ""the people"" paid them to be an asshole to me. 

My grandfather is mostly ok we have some nice conversations and hes actually very open minded for his age. My only issue with him is he refuses to recognize my mothers issues. 

Now that you got the family backstory lets move on to the college part. So about 4 months ago my cousin died (all my 1st cousins are like 20-30 years older than me) but i was good friends with this cousins kids my 2nd cousins who were right around my age (20m, and 22f) Im 19m. Anyways a few weeks after this happened my older cousins boyfriend started messaging me asking me if i wanted to go to school out there and how my cousins wanted me out there. I thought this was a good idea thought itd get me out of the house away from a toxic enviorment and also be good for my cousins who just went through a loss. so at the time i said yes we talked about it for a few weeks then suddenly he said ""actually it wont workout cause they're moving into a trailer so not enough space for you and maybe next year it could work"" so i was a bit bummed but i just dealed with it. Then originally i was gonna wait to go to college till next year but i decided i might as well try it out here to see how it is since itd be cheaper to. and i spent al this time signing up for this program talking to college counselors and i was all set and ready for this class. then suddenly a few weeks before the summer section of the program i joined started. My cousins boyfriend was suddenly like ""great news they are keeping their house lets get you out here asap"" and i told him ""oh i already signed up for classes"" and he was like ""yea but thats just a certificate not even good, we need you out there the house has such a depressing atmosphere"" and then i told hima firm no multiple times then i started messaging him and talking more indepth about it i forgot what was said exactly but I decided i still wanted to go out where they are for college. BUt id still take the summer section of the program out here (since its just prereqs. But idk the more into these classes i got i started to wonder if itd be better to just stay out here i like the professor the students, the style of teaching (its a bit different since its a technical college) but then idk id talk to my cousins or my cousins boyfriend about my concerns and id change my mind or i think i would anyways I remember the last conversation i had with all three of them in a group chat my cousins boyfriend saying ""you""ll never progress in life staying in the warm cacoon of home"" and he said ""Im very good at life I make alot of money"" amnd idk thinking back on all these messages i made the relization that my cousins boyfriend is kind of an asshole with a superiority complex. and I began to question how much of me wanting to go is actually me now. (I can tell you i know for sure the first time he asked me i genuinely wanted to go out there and be a bit more free away from the toxic enviorment my home life provided, but then i signed up for classes and i felt like i was moreso being forced down the path when it was brought up again) but there is still appeals to it. Im just not sure what i truly want

Now another issue ive been facing is my mom who I recognize doesnt want me to go out there and uses alot of tactics to try to get me agree. Like initially she accused me of lying about them wanting me out there saying id be a burden on them when they proposed the idea. Then she said ""you know youll be living with them so you wont be able to get the food you want"" and I thought (idk if thats even true but even if it was ill manage I have before) i know they always had a packed fridge so id imagine even if i got a job out there and bought my own food i may run into issues but i accept that. Then she said ""you know youll have to do your own wash and help around the house"" and I thought ""yea i usually do my own wash here and i always help around the house here and I realize its different here but I can manage"" and just to be clear this wasnt like her just simply informing me of the responsibilities expected of me she brought them up multiple times in a way that could only be to dissuade me of going out there. then she tried to guilt trip me into staying by saying ""she'll miss me"" which is true and fairly normal i know but then she stayed saying ""you know i could die any day like think about your cousin she died so suddenly that could happen to me"" and shes said ""I bet grandpas worried something will happen to him well your away"" which he might be but im glad to say hes perfectly healthy. and he doesnt like the idea of me leaving either but in a much more normal way. where he isnt trying to control and manipulate me into a decision. My mom also still often goes on her paranoid rants and her racist tirades about some asshole neighbors we have (who happen to be black) and im really getting sick of it. But at the same time I love her and she does have good traits as well. Its honestly hard for me to think of many at the moment but idk i know she loves me alot and cares about me, but she lets her own selfish desires get in the way of my personal happiness  alot of the time unfortunately. and idk i know this whole things word vommit but basically im saying im unsure if my thoughts about not wanting to go are truly my own as well. Im stuck between a asshole, and my narcissitic mother who is a different kind of asshole. and idk what decision I should make. Because honestly I think if i go out of state ill be able to be myself alot more be more free (everytime ive been out there ive always been alot happier and more myself id say, I have to tip toe around what I say and cant swear or mention my sexuality here or really do anything at all.  where there despite having some issues with my cousins boyfriend and not being the biggest fan of the housework theyll probably have me do I feel alot better there typically. But on the flipside I do like the state i live in now and enjoy the college setting im in, and despite my issues with my mom I do like the family i have out here and i am a bit terrified that something could happen to them when im away (especially my grandpa despite him being healthy) Ive kind of cried in anticipatory grief thinking about that the past few days thinking about never having a random conversation with him again. him not being there when i get up in the morning. and even my mom with her issues i know id miss her alot if anything happened to her. but  i also greatly fear if i dont do this that ill never have freedom or never feel like myself.

298,"Hi there. I was going to post this in /r/depression, but maybe it's better suited here since I'm really lost and could use advice:

I'm just a high school dropout with a GED and experience in sales. Unemployed now. Having to start over at 34 years old is pretty daunting. Looking at job ads and college courses online makes me feel bad, as I don't feel like I'm capable of doing anything. I feel completely inadequate. I've had bad anxiety most of my life, as well as depression. 

Also I don't have any passions in life, so I don't know what I would do even if I could pick a dream job/career. It sucks. I wish I had a career path I could follow and was passionate about doing, something I could work towards. Nothing seems worthwhile. College is pretty expensive, too, even community college. I don't know what I'm going to do. I've been stuck in a rut for over a decade and can't get out of it.

Anxiety and depression are a bad combo, but often go together. Seems like my anxiety is getting better this past year at least, but my depression has gotten worse.

Anyways, I make it sound like my life is in shambles, but I'm a very lucky dude, despite my woes. Still, some advice could be quite beneficial to me. Thanks a bunch.",05Aug2019,1
299,"I've been making a lot of progress the last year or so, emerging from almost 6 years of moderate/severe depression, beginning in high school. I always assumed that it couldn't be fully cured but after a little over a year of prozac (stopped ~2 years ago) and plenty of positive lifestyle changes, it might as well be. I still have lots to catch up on from being only fractionally functional for so long, but depression isn't holding me back anymore.

While still depressed about 3 years ago I made some friends- the first since high school, and just as depressed as me. I moved into a 2 bedroom apartment with one of them almost a year ago, shortly after I really started taking efforts to improve my thought process and lifestyle seriously. That time since moving out of my parents' has been very constructive. I've got myself a decent paying job coding, I quit smoking cigarettes about 6 months ago, quit drinking booze and smoking cannabis around the same time, started eating better, sleeping better, got a gym membership, started reading again, going on dates, etc. I met a really great guy about 2 months ago and now we're pretty serious. Additionally, I recently came out to my parents as gay and they were both wonderful about it. I'm very lucky to have them.

The whole time I've lived here there's been a few issues but I tried to live with it, and do the best I can to change them, and improve regardless of them. The kitchen is always a mess, for one. My roomie tried for a while to clean up after herself but good habits got less good as time passed and the fridge, sink, pots and pans etc are consistently gross yet again, in spite of promises to do better. This is particularly bad for me as it means if I don't want to clean up another grown adult's mess I harm my personal improvement either by a) spending money on unhealthy fast food or b) going back into high school eating disorder mode and skipping meals.

There's also a noise issue, with her loudly watching tv or listening to music or talking to people on speakerphone until late in the night.

Finally, the house in general is always a disaster with clutter all over, and my roomie doesn't know normal social graces. I used to try and have a little family dinner here every couple weeks but now I'm embarrassed to have them over on account of the clutter, kitchen mess, and social ineptitude. My boyfriend rarely comes here, we prefer spending time together at his apartment.

These are all issues we've talked about, repeatedly. She's promised to change her act, repeatedly. She's failed to do so, repeatedly. The lease is almost up, and she's asking me to re-sign, promising that things will improve around the house.  Should I just find a new place?",05Aug2019,13
300,"My wife and I have been married for five years, together for 7. We met in high school and have been together ever since. Yesterday morning I came home from church to find out that she had left me, and left behind a note saying that she is not happy being with me.

She left me for someone she met on Facebook, and moved 6 hours away to live with him. She packed all her things and left in the 3 hours that I was gone to worship service. 

I found out about this guy about two months. I noticed my wife had been texting him very frequently, and before long these text grew to be in appropriate. We had a heated discussion about the messages and she swore him off, and allegedly never spoke to him again. But now, two months later, I found out she had still been messaging him behind my back, and he drove 6 hours from Arkansas to pick her up here in Mississippi.

We have since spoken on the phone and we laid everything out plain and simple. I will be visiting with our church’s preacher today to get some assistance and guidance, and I will be filing for divorce immediately after. 

I’m just so lost. I have never been involved in the dating world. My wife and I met when I was 17 and she was 15. She’s the one person I’ve ever “been” with. I’ve never even had another relationship aside from her. I don’t know what to even do, how to proceed, or what first steps I should take. 

I know things will get better with time and work out in the end, but I don’t even know how to ask someone out. I also have Aspergers which makes the social aspect of this situation even more difficult. I’m so scared and hurt and alone. I slept about four hours tonight, and I’m surprised I managed to sleep that long. I just wish I could wake up and everything be over. I want to wake up and everything be back to the way it used to be just a few months ago. 

Please, any advice that you guys have... I just need help. I’m willing to answer any questions you may have. 


Side notes: 
My wife and I have already spoken on a recorded line and calmly worked out what she wants from the divorce (her car and her dog). The only money we have saved up has to be spent on $1,900 of debt she left me with (from a surgery her dog had). As far as divorces go, I’m hoping that our recorded arrangement will hold up legally and this will be a smooth divorce. 

As selfish as this may sound, I’m really just more concerned with where I personally go from here. She’s got her new guy and a new place to stay. But what about me? I’m left with nothing but a mess to clean up, an empty bed and no direction. I feel so used and misled. I just... want it to stop and I want to have someone who loves me again.

304,"It’s just after 3:00 AM and I’m a teenage boy who eats at weird times, sometimes even in the middle of the night. I was going downstairs for a snack and I walked into the room that I have to walk through to get to the stairs. I saw my dad’s computer open and saw a big photo of a brunette woman, which I didn’t think anything of at first, until he slowly scrolled down, revealing her entire naked body.

Until this moment I didn’t appreciate that people aren’t kidding when they talk about things that make their jaw drop.

This is my 60-year-old dad who:
*Has spoken to me before about how porn is disgusting and immoral
*Is very religious and pretty conservative and would logically be opposed to viewing porn
*Has been married to my mom happily for 38 years
*Is truly a mature man who I’ve looked up to my entire life

I personally kicked my porn addiction after I got a girlfriend and realized it was just kinda gross. It’s impossible to wrap my head around the idea that my dad, who, according to all logic, would never indulge in porn, is suffering from this addiction.

Maybe I caught him the one time he’s looked at porn in 40 years. Or maybe he does this once a week. I don’t know and I truly don’t care to find out. And truthfully, I try not to judge people’s individual choices. But porn addiction is terrible and can take a lot out of your ability to focus. And I worry that he’s not satisfied with my mom. She’s obese and I don’t imagine they’re sexually active, so maybe this is just what he allows himself so his libido doesn’t drive him crazy.

I just don’t know how I look at my dad the same way after this. I don’t want him to ever know I caught him looking at smut. But I also want him to stop for his own sake. Perhaps the fact that I’m moving to college in less than two weeks will allow me to avoid that reckoning for now.

Maybe this belongs in r/vent more than it does here, but if you have advice, I’d certainly like it.",05Aug2019,1

309,"Hi Reddit,

I need a second opinion so I thought I should ask you guys of Reddit.

I just finished an Information Technology High School and now I have to choose what I want to do with my future. Some month ago I applied for a job position at a very well known organisation (I don't want to specify its name to remain as anonymous as I can).

That's what I want or at least what I think I want. Some time ago I got the good news (or at least I think so), my application got accepted. However, what bothers me is that some relatives and friends don't share my choice, they think that if I start working now I won't continue my studies (I want to go to university after working there for 1 or 2 years because I still have a lot of things to learn).

What if they are right? I think that by going to work there I would learn a lot of new things such as improving my knowledge in English, French, general knowledge things and how companies works (it would be my first real job).

If I went there I would have to move to Switzerland alone. And I'm a little worried about that, not too much but just a little bit. You know I would have to do a lot of things by myself that now my parents do for me. And from where I came from, children usually stay with their parents until they are 25-30 years old.

I think there are other 2 options.

Option B: I can go to a not so great university (that's based on other people opinion, but I don't think it is so bad just not as good as option C, maybe) near me (30 min commute time).

Option C: I can go to a better university (again, based on other people opinion) but further away from me (1h 20m commute time, so about 2h 40m commute total every day). I don't want to chose this option because I think it is too much time to commute every day.

That's a hard choice but I am pretty sure about what to choose (option A, going to work) but what others think makes me have second thoughts. Another good reason for option A (other than that I would learn a lot of things that will be useful in the future) is that I don't like living with my parents.

If think that if I don't take this opportunity I might regret it forever. The only problem is that I don't want to waste 2 years of my life doing things that won't be useful for my future career. The internships I had before (one month and a half in total) were pretty useless and I, in my opinion, I haven't done some meaningful work. I just did boring office work that they didn't want to do... That is what worries me, I want to do something interesting (I really like the IT field and I enjoy doing such things).

Another thing that is keeping me from not choosing choice A is that I'll do the university with people 2 years younger than me. I think I won't be able to have some good friends, I don't know why but I think I'm losing something there.

I just wanted to hear your thoughts. Sorry for the long post.",05Aug2019,2

311,"I am in university where my course requires that all students in my course take the same papers as one another. I get along well with a lot of the people in the course (there is only 30 of us because of how specialized the degree is) but there is this one girl who will not leave me alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

I like to get to my lectures early to collect my thoughts (or browse Reddit) and will often sit in the general seating in the building that my lecture is in. This girl seems to think we must be best friends (despite no attempt on my part to establish a friendship) and will actively seek me out (in the library, going off to eat food and sitting next to me at every opportunity despite me wanting to sit and chat with my friends) and will often force herself into activities that my friends are doing (going to grab hot chocolates, even once trying to follow me back to the library despite me explicitly saying I am having lunch with my boyfriend) and will spend a good deal of time in the classroom intensely staring at me which freaks me out a tad. It should also be noted that she has a deep fascination with dissection, blood and the macabre, going as far as to dissect her family's turkey before Christmas.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point you must be wondering why I don't like this person and why don't I just befriend her or ignore her. It is difficult to explain but I have a gut feeling about her that just  feels off (I have had this sort of feeling before which turned out to be well founded). I shouldn't have to literally plan my day around not having to sit with her or be stared at. I like to be alone when studying or eating on campus and she needs to respect it. I don't know how to be polite about this and honestly I don't know how much of this is me overthinking. I don't have the nerve to ask my friends of their opinion of her (the field we are going into is quite small so any gossip will spread like wildfire). What the heck do I do?

321," First, I'm sorry for any mistakes in this post for it's my first.  
I am desperate, and i don't know what to do anymore or how to handle my situation anymore. I'll try to keep everything as short as possible.However I'd like to add some context to the situation, if i can. My mother is an alcoholic and has been for as long as i can remember, I can remember being about 5 years old, digging my teddy bear she threw in the garbage out from the pile of beer cans . She did that because i wouldnt stop crying. It wasn't until i was 13 when she became physically abusive. Nearly every night she'd attempt to pick a fight with me, and when i started having anxiety attacks at school due to the stress at home, i stopped going to school. And she beat me for it until I attempted suicide, she left me alone about school after that. I was 16. I managed to get my GED through the depression but the anxiety made it hard for me to get a job and keep it, hell i did not even understand how mentally unwell i was until i was 25 and was able to go to my first therapy appointments. I understood i wasn't okay but i did not understand the gravity of how bad. between the ages of 16 and 25, i have been homeless and attempted suicide in total of 4 times because of her abuse and the situations she's put me in.

My younger sister had to deal with her alcoholism as well, she's liked a lot better than I am by our mother and received better respect than I ever had by OUR FAMILY (yes, it was not just my mom, but her siblings as well who were abusive). Which is why i think she became as angry, abusive and disrespectful as our mother (but even more so on the violence part), and i understand that, and always tried to reason with her even more so, but i'm not seen as a person to these people. My sister has punched me in the eye and broken my glasses, yells at me randomly, threatens me, and once beat me up and poured rubbing alcohol down my throat just because I was telling her to get out my apartment (the one me and mother got after 2 years of homelessness) after she hit me. She didnt leave, our mother didnt want her to live at her bf's place so i..didnt have a say. at all. 2 months later we lost the place after getting kicked out. After that it took 2 more years to have the place i do now. Moved to a different state with my mother, had a terrible situation there but because of it was able to get help from a social worker and therapist, and meet a whole lot of people who helped me get to a better place. Not just physically but mentally as well. I felt like i was saved and had a chance, even though my mother was drinking, i felt like i was on my way to getting away. away from allll of it. Like, i wasnt responsible for taking care of anyone but myself for once.

Now. A month ago, my mother decided to get my sister, who was really going through tough time, because she wanted to take care of her and my nephew. My mother said, that they were not going to stay here, but at my Uncle's place. Everything was arranged and i took her word for it. Like an idiot. But at the time I heard what was happening to my sister and didnt want her to die or anything, and my nephew was also in trouble, so im like okay. It went to hell, almost immediately. Sister was going through withdrawals from the drugs, my nephew, has clearly been neglected, my sister has been being abusive towards him (like yelling profanities at him, smacking him and i even had to stop her FROM PUTTING HIM IN A CHOKE HOLD BECAUSE SHE WANTED HIM TO STOP CRYING), my mother has done barely anything to stop her, the only one my sister would listen too. but then again, I HAD TO STOP MY MOTHER FROM TAKING MY NEPHEW OUT FOR A DRIVE WHILE SHE WAS HEAVILY DRUNK! and they both from the stress started to take it out on me. To top it all off, none of us have a job, the landlord, from the kindness of his heart, is letting us stay in this apartment while we get our shit together and get jobs. He only told us to please not smoke in the house( my mother smokes but she does it outside and away) and not cause any trouble. My sister knowing this, smoked weed in the apartment, my mom started to drink even more, started a fight 3 weeks ago and nearly choked me out. (i tried to stop my sister and her from fighting) The landlord had to come down and get my mother to calm down. Time is clearly ticking, I'm afraid he's going to kick us out anytime, especially after the fight tonight, im afraid for my nephew, im afraid im going to get seriously her. All this stress, everyday led me to do what i did tonight.  
I am a light sleeper, the slightest noise, or bright light wakes me up. Our apartment is small, and my room is the living room between their room and the kitchen. I ask my sister, please when I sleep at 11-12ish pm, please just leave the kitchen light off. Every night, she yells and cusses at me until eventually she does. I have been sleep deprived for about 4 days. I try a new tactic(after an 30 mins of waiting for her to go) in which i mirror their behavior and maybe if i show how ugly she's been, she'd get clarity and stop. I go to my mother to tell her to help, she ignores me. I snapped. I punch my sister and scratch her. Mother gets in the middle and defends her, I start calling them out on everything, calling them terrible things, we're all yelling. Mother is telling us to take it outside, she's saying she's going to fight me, my sister takes out her pocket knife, mother gets in the middle and tells her to put it away AND USE HER HANDS. mother takes sister for a smoke, as they are finally going into their room, I am threatened that i'm going to be leaving tomorrow. from my own apartment. Im always being threatened that im going to be kicked out by her, but this time i actually did something bad. The only reason why police wasnt involved during the fight is because, the landlord during the last fight said he didnt want any police here. (we live in a basement apartment he renovated and he lives in the main house above) And my mother wouldnt risk her own skin in such an obvious way, so I dont know what she's going to do. If she will do anything. If she'd tried to get me arrested. I did something bad and stupid, something they would do, its my fault. But to lose everything...

I just dont know what to do, Im tired of taking care of my mother and sister and having to save them from themselves. My social worker is doing all she can to help, but the options are so limited( and take a long time to even process), I can't drive, the car broke down, I don't know how to help my nephew. I don't want my sister here. I dont want to live with them. The process for housing my social worker is helping me may take months, I am so lost. I cant talk to them, they dont even listen to reason. I dont know what to do. I'm sorry for the long post, if anyone has any advice, could you please tell me? I've tried all that I can, but i dont know everything. Im so stuck and i'm scared. I dont know how to stop any of this.

TL;DR: My family is abusive, I can't get away from no matter what I do, I snapped and hit my sister and now Im afraid i'll lose everything. If there's any advice anyone can give to help me, could you please tell me?",05Aug2019,2

Like for example, I come from a family background of drugs, but I live with my grandparents and was raised to believe that drugs are bad and if you do drugs, you're probably a bad person. They never said why. I was also taught to stay away from alcohol, and I really don't even like alcohol much anyway. But I tried weed in high school, for example, and really enjoyed it. But it's illegal, and I eventually told my grandpa I was smoking because I started to feel terrible for going behind his and my grandma's back. He didn't approve, and I still smoke, and feel bad about it. But I have rules to keep it under control. 

But I constantly worry about whether or not I'm a good person, and it's always because I feel like I'm breaking some kind of rule. It goes like this for anything, even for sex. When I was in school I was always worried about being late because if I was late then for some unknown reason, I felt like everybody would hate me. It only ever applied to me, because I remember looking at other kids who were late, and it being treated like no big deal, which I didn't even question. For some reason in my mind I was never allowed to have any fun in fear of breaking any rules. I didn't allow myself to ever loosen up and relax around other people, I felt like I always had to be on alert in case something went wrong. I've had panic attacks over the being late thing. One of the worst ones I've had was when I was either 15 or 16, and I had started to become really depressed about a lot of things and stopped caring about being late. I just didn't care anymore if I showed up 15 minutes late to class, and my grandpa started getting onto me about it one morning, when we were in the car, and I heard about it the whole drive to school, how I was going to end up homeless and addicted to drugs one day if I didn't clean up my act.

Now I've gotten my first job at Mcdonalds. When I first started working there, I really lacked any confidence in my abilities and got so worried about messing up one morning that when I did mess up, and my manager said something, I started crying and disappeared for about five minutes in the bathroom. Another manager came to calm me down, and everything was perfectly fine, I just felt bad about crying in the first place. A lot of these managers are really supportive, and helped me break out of my shell a little. 

&amp;#x200B;

But it's not just rules, it's with people too. Often I'm scared of how someone will react to something I say. Because I don't want to accidentally make their day worse if they're having a bad day, or make them upset. I used to just settle for saying nothing at all, but I can't live like that. I did get better with this, but now I can't *tell* what might make someone else upset, but I worry I'll just scare the other person off. Like there are situations where I obviously shouldn't say a certain thing, I recognize that, but idk I just feel like I'm *weird.* Sometimes the way I carry myself makes me seem cold or mean, but I really try to be nice and I like making other people laugh at work, even if it means making a fool out of myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then I feel like if I'm ever in a bad mood, if I snap or get really annoyed, then I feel like a bad person and it's really fucking confusing for me. I know it sounds pretty fucking stupid, but I've never been more honest about how I'm feeling in my life.",05Aug2019,1
324,"Hi everyone, me again lmao. I need some advice on what to do atm. My mum nearly died a month ago and my dad was in a car accident two weeks later, so there’s been a lot going on in my life. Mums had multiple mini strokes and is slowly getting better, but her memory isn’t great and there’s days where she’s good and days where I just can’t handle it. 

I’ve been very hesitant with my job from the start, it’s so boring and I’m not getting satisfaction from it but I don’t know if that’s because of everything going on in my life or if I’ve utilised these experiences to my advantage and realise that life’s too short to be unhappy and I’ve accepted my unhappiness and want to move on to something better.

I’ve always wanted to be a nurse, and today the applications for next year opened and I’ve applied to uni eagerly. The problem is, I don’t know if I need a holiday or if I need a new job. I know I want to be a nurse but from now until I finish my degree I just don’t know what to do. The pay, the leave, the people here are so good, but I feel so empty and just unfulfilled in this job.

I’d appreciate any help from you guys, I’m just so exhausted and stuck at the moment. Thanks :)",05Aug2019,2
325,"I met this girl like 6 years ago and have always had a thing for her, she always told me she liked me but whenever we started to actually talk she would get back with her ex (this happened like 5 times) I eventually moved on and I now have a gf.

326,"here’s the backstory, we adopted Molly from the shelter when she was 3 months old. We always wanted a big dog but held off because we lived in an apartment, but she was super adorable so we ended up spontaneously adopting her. Everything went well for the first year or so, we took her to dog parks occasionally to socialize her and she got along well with our other dog (10 yo Female Minpin) and our 2 cats. The only problem was she was always cooped up in our apartment with no yard, we put up a baby gate to keep her in the kitchen separate from the livingroom because she wasn’t house trained. We still took her on walks daily, but it didn’t seem fair how she spent most of her time in the kitchen and we knew it wasn’t fair to her. I don’t remember exactly when but she started showing food aggression and in fear of getting bit we let her get away with it. We just didn’t bother her when she ate. When she was about 2 yrs old, our other dog passed away. My parents were really upset, so for Christmas i bought them a new minpin puppy (female). In April we finally moved into a house out in the county with a huge front and back yard. We were really excited for Molly to finally have a yard. All our pets roamed freely in the yard and played together all day everyday. Molly started to become toy aggressive so we took all the toys away and only gave them 1 toy to play with under our supervision. It really made me upset that her aggression was progressing and I felt pretty helpless, we didn’t know what to do but we did our best to manage it. One day while I wasn’t home, there was a gofer outside the fence that Molly was really amped up about, she was barking and throwing a fit because she couldn’t get to it. My parents suddenly heard Molly snarling and when they turned around they saw her trying to bite our other dog. We think Molly got so frustrated over the gofer she lashed out on our smaller dog, there wasn’t any bleeding and she didn’t break the skin, but we were in shock that she even attempted. It became very apparent that she had a real aggression problem now, we kept them separate for a few days until things calmed down &amp; then they began playing together and carrying on like nothing ever happened between them. About a month later, I came home from work and when i entered the yard our small dog ran up to greet me, as i go closer to the front door i saw Molly go after our small dog and attack her. She grabbed her by the neck and shook her a couple times before my mom sprayed her with the hose and she stopped. It only lasted about 5 seconds. I completely lost my shit and our dog was bleeding everywhere, she had multiple wounds all around her neck &amp; we took her to the vet to get stitches. We all agreed this was the final straw and our dogs would now have to stay separated forever. We were lucky that Molly didn’t kill her, because she very well could have, and judging by the location of the bite it seems like that was her intent. We tried rehoming her, we posted her on Facebook and Craigslist, letting people know she needed to be in a home with no other animals or children. We asked the vet what to do, we asked about euthanasia, because we couldn’t keep her, taking her to a trainer is too expensive, the shelter where we adopted her wouldn’t take her, and we contacted several rescue group in our area but they were either full or didn’t take in aggressive dogs. The vet wasn’t too keen on euthanasia and obviously neither were we, but we didn’t know if there was any other option. We were stuck and had no other choice but to just keep her. So now lives in our backyard, separated from our other pets. Since we spend most of our time indoors or in the front yard, Molly doesn’t get a lot of attention at all now a days and the guilt is really starting to get to me. I try to spend time with her by taking her on walks or playing with her for a few minutes but i’m always either at work or school. She just doesn’t get enough attention as our other pets anymore and I feel like the isolation is making her depressed or something and it breaks my heart I don’t know what to do. what is the best option here?",05Aug2019,1
327,"I'm 20 year old girl. I have no friends, I must really know someone before going anywhere. I'm foreign, I'm in England 7 years though I don't feel confident with my language. I've been alone for 6 years. I'm in a secret relationship for 3 years nearly with someone who I don't think I should be with, yet he cares for me but he's a friend of my mother which feels strange and he lives in my family house. Yet I love him though but I think not in a way as lovers do (I was before). I have normal/low self esteem, and was brought up in a religious fanatics family and my parents divorced. I've lost 2 most important people in my life and I have many regrets for the past and can't get over it. I feel like others are better than me at most cases and someone like me doesn't deserve anything. I don't feel like I've got family beside my bf's. Many shitty situations had place in my life which left me with nothing but unstable mind and dark thoughts. I feel like I wasted my teenage years yet I had no choice to act much differently. I blame myself. I blame my family (which I think is right). Sometimes I get suicidal thoughts and anxiety attacks. I can't relax, I have problem with sleeping.  I'm planning to go back to my country and isolate a bit from my 'family' here. I was considering breaking up but I'm not sure whether I'm able to do it. I want to start again yet everything is so painful. I don't know where to find a good friends. 

Was someone in similar situation for too long? I need an advice, I planned to post way too long post of these 7 years but I don't think I should.

330," Just like the other peptides we have covered so far, GHRP-2 comes as a lyophilized powder. It must be stored in a cool dry place and should be reconstituted using bacteriostatic water or sodium chloride meant for injection. Once the peptide has been reconstituted, GHRP-2 must be kept in a cold storage like the refrigerator until ready for use. GHRP-2 can be taken in high dosages, if needed; however, it is still unclear how effective these high doses are. Normally, GHRP-2 will be used 2-3 times a day at around 100mcg-300mcg per injection. As with other GHRP’s, it’s highly advisable to also use a GHRH in order maximize the effectiveness of the pulse wave combination in accessing the pituitary pathway to release growth hormone.",05Aug2019,1
331,"So I've let a friend of mine crash here for a year after graduating from college. He wants to go to med school, but hasn't really been motivated to apply. He's been working part time, and applied last minute to a grad program, which he didn't get into. He wants to take the next year to work on improving his MCAT score and applying.

I think I've been very accommodating, but I really just want my house back to myself. I feel selfish for feeling this way. But I think a year of living here rent-free has been pretty generous.

If I had to, I could let him stay here another year. I just don't want to. I just don't know how to tell him that without hurting his feelings or ruining the friendship. I think part of that is on him, as I feel he is asking a lot and putting it on me.

335,"I am a 21 year old man just trying to get my foot hold in my dream job. I am currently a student working on my associates. Everyday I check job boards looking for jobs that I qualify for in my industry outside of California. Now I have lived here my whole life and all my family is here. I grew up in Southern California but i moved to Northern California to live with my sister while I go to college. Basically anytime I bring up these ideas of these jobs to my family it gets shutdown. Others outside my family also shut it down to basically implying why would you want to move to X state when you live here. For example: job in Texas right now I could go apply for.. cost of living there is 47% lower than where I am at. I could care less about California beaches and all that because I rarely go outside and all my friends I connect with via the internet. Is there something I am missing cause I am young? Is all this extra money I spend really worth to live in California? I feel its a great idea to move out of state to start my career, save some extra money because of cost of living differences and then if all said and done I want to come back to CA later, its always there right?

 No girlfriend, and no social skills. To be fair my social skills is okay but needs real tweaking. In some situations I would say the wrong things that would make me sound stupid or childish.

I havent been working recently because of depression and anxiety. However I need to overcome this as my mom is beginning to pressure me to change and grow up. However I try changing, I've been to therapy, taking pills for my depression, I've listened to family members for counsel , read many books and audio books, seek religion for inner peace, meditated. I keep going  back to square 1. 

My family member recently said I'm not changing because I don't really want to change, and it's all an excuse so I don't need to grow up. This is all what I've been told by a family member.

339,"So I've had this erotomania/limerence thing going on with this girl for about 4 years now and I'm over it. I was following her on social media using my sister's accounts cause she's sort of friends with her, but I've become increasingly frustrated with the situation and changed my sister's social media passwords so I couldn't lurk this chick anymore. That was 24 hours ago and honestly the obsessional thoughts have gotten worse.

I've been treated for psychosis and depression in the past so I honestly think it's most probable that it was all a delusion, but all my delusion went away and this one did lessen but I was still obsessional with her.

I feel like I can't talk to anyone about it, except my psychiatrist who I'm seeing later this week. He found out about this a year or two ago but made no adjustment to my meds so I'm gonna ask him if he can give me something that might help with this because I'm so done

I just interpret shit regarding her and her posting on social media as some ""sign"" that she wants me.  But I've literally asked her out twice, and been rejected twice  (once cause she had a bf, once cause she wasn't interested in dating anyone at the time (don't really believe her, I think she was probably just too nice to say she wasn't interested)). And I sent her one love letter on between when she had a bf, honestly have never regretted anything so much in my entire life I was just mentally ill and addicted to drugs at the time so it just happened.

Anyway, I refuse to entertain the thought of asking her out again, tbh I just don't want to, although I've wasted a painful amount of time thinking about her I just want to cut my losses and completely forget about her. I'm legit done.

Ive had a really shitty 24 hours, it kinda feels like I'm withdrawing from a drug.

I finish uni at the end of the year and I'm thinking of moving as far away from where I live as possible, mainly so I can get over this and also because I'm sick of the city I'm living it atm (I've lived here most of my life).

Anyway, any advice? Especially for the next few days until I see my psychiatrist.

I think getting rid of my ability to see her social media shit will help because of operant conditioning. I'm hoping this obsession will reach extinction if I literally have no access to anything to do with her. I've also blocked her on my social media accounts so I can't lurk her from there, and it makes it that little bit harder if I impulsively decide I want to message her.

You know what the sad thing is? Even though I'm so determined to forget about her I still catch myself thinking that it might all work out, that we might be together. And then when I realize I'm thinking that I get really angry with myself.

But like I'm fucking done I'm not doing this anymore I just want to completely forget. Help plz this fucken sucks.",05Aug2019,1

347,"This happened a couple of months ago but it still haunts me to this day. It was in my old apartment in the middle of the night when I heard a couple who lived in my building arguing out front. They were being pretty loud so I got up to investigate. While I couldn't see them I could hear them well enough and recognize their voices as they lived above me and I often heard them and their friends being loud in the hallway in the middle of the night. I had seen them a couple of times to let them into the building but other than that never talk to them much. The building also only had four apartments in it and only three tenants consisting of only me an old guy at the top of the stairs who hardly made a peep and them so I was fairly certain they were the ones arguing. I listened closely and what I heard was the following.

&amp;#x200B;

Guy: Get over here now!

Girl: Leave me alone you a\*\*\*hole!

Guy: If you don't stop walking away from me-!

Girl: What are you going to do hit me? Go ahead be a man!

Guy: Shut the f\*\*k up you dumb b\*tch!

From this point on the girl proceeds to taunt the guy telling him to hit her over and over again and saying he's not a man and to ""be a man and hit her"" in a patronizing tone. This goes on for a while as I am just waiting to see what happens and unsure of what to do. Thinking it's just a basic lovers spat gone a little too far I don't try to directly intervene.  The girl stops mid taunting for a second as if stunned by something and then starts to shout even louder at the top of her lungs. She repeats the words ""Did you just hit me!?"" a couple of times sounding angrier and angrier. At this point, I am holding the phone ready to call the cops.  I hear what sounds like her struggling to get her hands loose after a failed attempt to hit him back which mostly sounds like gravel being scraped violently by boots and her still yelling ""did you just hit me!?"" at him. I'm struggling to unlock my phone to call the cops still very much half asleep when I hear her start spouting racial slurs at him I had never heard before. She starts screaming loudly that he is quote "" A white N\*\*gger"" I am so shocked by this I just listen to try and see if I was hearing things. Sure enough, she repeats it several times loud enough for the entire block to hear and keeps saying it until the altercation inevitably ends with him going inside and her still shouting at him outside before leaving. I hesitate to call as I am now facing a moral conundrum. On one hand, I don't agree with domestic violence against anyone and on the other hand, I am personally appalled and stung by the word being subjected to being called it myself. Knowing that calling it in would be helping someone who hates my kind makes me hesitate to call the police. I can't decide what to do so I ask my mom who also lives in the apt with me. I tell her exactly what happened and ask whether or not I should call the cops. She is no help at all as she just laughs at the situation and doesn't say anything further. I go to bed thinking I can't call the police because the woman has left anyway and there would be no witnesses at the scene even if I did.   

A couple of weeks later I see the woman who was yelling racial slurs outside with two black eyes as she walks down the stairs abusive boyfriend in tow. She is quite a bit bigger than him, him being skinny and frail-looking and all but that doesn't stop me from getting a huge twing of guilt seeing her like that. I want to help her but I can't bring myself to reason it considering she is openly racist against black people. I guess I was still stunned and appalled at her using"" that ""word as an insult when we hadn't done anything to her and I was concerned enough to try and call the police on her behalf. I just shook the image off still being enraged about the comment reasoning that if I called the cops she would probably vouch for him anyways and it would do no good but I regret it. I still think about that woman and seriously wonder if I should have just been the bigger man/woman. Sure she hates people who look like me and she wasn't the best or kindest neighbor but that doesn't mean she deserves to be hit her skinny boyfriend right? What are the limits on helping someone who hates your race? I feel like maybe I am in the wrong in this situation but I also feel justified in not helping someone who most likely would never do the same for me. I don't know maybe I should have helped her. . .",05Aug2019,1

I look at my son who is now 5 months old and wonder what I was so afraid of :(  my stomach is in knots and I just want to punch something and scream because I missed the best chance I had at letting her see him in person 😭

TLDR: the fear of measles and my first born son getting sick prevented me from ever traveling with him to meet his great grandmother in person before she died. How do I stop regretting my decision and move on? How do I stop beating myself up about this?",05Aug2019,1

350,"Basically I'm 26 and I still haven't dated anyone. This is in part due to my very small high school, where I didn't like anyone, and my mostly female college. The other problem is that I rarely feel attracted to guys (immediate crushes are rare. Occasionally I'll develop a crush on a guy after knowing him a while). 

I've always had this problem though: if I have a crush on a guy and he asks me on a date, I'm all for it. But if I don't like the guy, then I don't know how to react towards advances.

Recently there is a guy, an acquaintance of mine, who has been showing me some interest. I'm just not sure if we would be a good match. But I've been thinking if I get to know him better, I might start liking him (which does happen to me occasionally).

So I've been treating him as a friend, occasionally texting with him. Today he texted me he ""missed"" me and I didn't know how to respond. Old me would have told him ""I'm not attracted to you, so let's just be friends.""

So my question is, as a girl how do you deal with advances? Do you flirt even if you don't like the guy at first? Do you tell guys to back off or let them be?

 I don't want to lead him on, but I feel that my old approach maybe isn't the best...",05Aug2019,1

We have been speaking over snapchat, texting etc pretty much every single day, and because of that we have gotten to become really good friends, and admittedly I fell for her over time. I asked her out about a month ago, and was told that maybe in September I would have a chance (due to some failed relationships in the past, she didnt want one going into school). Since then everything has gone back to normal, but I have felt immense stress and sadness because I think I'm reaching for a goal im not meant to accomplish, even though I know its wrong.

356,"I’m going to try to keep this short. My family travelled overseas for the summer for reasons I would rather not say and have been here for a month already. Before coming me and my brother fought with our parents to shorten the time we spent there from two month to one as we came for unfortunate reasons and want to spend the least amount of time here possible. We fought and me and my brother left home, a day later our parents called us back home and said that they would shorten our trip to a month and that we would be Back home by August 1st. That did not happen, my dad kept putting off talking to the travel agents or the airline that by the time he finally left the tickets were sold out in economy, and first class was too expensive . I pushed and pushed for them to go visit the air line and book new tickets and I keep pushing but nothing comes out of it. Then my dad said we would go try again the day before August 1st to see if they have any seats opened up, and they had seats. We would have to pay a 400 difference for the seats but I would be able to go back home. We went in the morning and the guy selling the tickets told my dad to wait till the airline office is about to close to see if the price goes down. My parents sent me to my aunts house and then said that they went a little before closing and the ticket prices went up, but that they’ll book a seat for a week later. I agreed because I can’t do anything about it anymore, the office would be closed. This was Thursday, it is now Tuesday and we just came back from the airline and August 8th is fully booked. There’s no more seats for any class. I’m desperate to go back because I need to apply for the new university semester and I was told we would only be gone for a month, I told my employer that I would be back by August 1st and will most likely be fired.

I play roughly 11-12 ish hours a day on a free day, 9 hours on work days. I do have a social life and a nice circle of friends, most of which i play video games with almost daily. Ive always wanted to be a pro or streamer or something and thats why i play so much. i want to become really good at what i play. video games has always been my real strong point and my only real interest. its so fun and although im not as good as what i want to be, my gaming ability is my pride. ive never really had much else as a hobby. i go out with my mates often and we get something to eat and hang out in the city. i just dont have much else to fall back on when it comes to hobbies. its ruining my relationship with my girlfriend and my parents just think im wasting my time when i play. i need help with finding options since anything i have tried just doesnt bring me as much interest and joy as video games does. thanks &lt;3",05Aug2019,69

They now think I’m very controlling but have completely got the wrong idea and the wrong side of things and I think maybe they don’t realise that I really do want to make an effort with them? 

I’m wondering if maybe I should message the main girl (that my boyfriend has slept with in the past) that I’m sorry she thinks I’m controlling and that I really wanted to make an effort with her/them and that if she has a problem she can tell me about it

My dad asked me to rate their marriage from 1-10 in front of the whole family, I freaked out and quickly answered 6/10, even though it was obvious that their marriage is a serious 2/10.

He then said, in front of his 8 year old daughter, that he wants to go to kill himself and go to hell (we’re very religious).

365,"It happened in early January 2015. I was at a high school winter retreat with a few of my friends, as well as some classmates I didn't know as well as my friends. Let's call him Brady. Brady was a close friend of one of my friends. We never really got along in school- he was very sarcastic and knew how to hit back with snide comebacks, so I'd usually just avoid him or ignore him altogether. And he was gay, even though he wouldn't come out until a few months later. We all kinda knew already, and we didn't really care.
 If I were being honest, I had the slightest crush on the guy.

Fast forward to our last night at the retreat and me and him are the last ones awake in our cabin. We had struck up a conversation about books and were actually getting along well. He ends up leaving his bed to come to my bed, but ends up falling asleep next to me after a few minutes. I shrug it off since two guys falling asleep together isn't unheard of- guys fell asleep watching movies on their laptops, playing cards games, etc. all the time at this retreat.

Maybe twenty minutes after and I'm almost asleep, when suddenly I feel him grab my hand and pull it towards his ""place."" He then proceeds to stick his hand down my ""place.""  I'm in shock and initially force his hands out. He tries it again about three times until I give up, a bit out of curiosity. Long story short, we end up going all the way.

Immediately after I'm hit with a wave of remorse. I leave to use the communal restrooms and he insists on coming with me as the instructors laid out a two-man party policy in order to travel from place to place Right before we leave the restroom he leans in for a kiss, and I half-heartedly return it. At this point I'm fully regretting it. This isn't how I wanted my first kiss. This isn't how I wanted my first time to go. I wanted it to be with someone special who I truly loved, not like this.

Him and I seldom spoke after. He came out and his parents kicked him out of the house. He lives with a few friends, and I see him occasionally whenever one of my friends invites him over (it's rarely more than twice a year). It's always awkward because we never speak past ""hello."" He seems like he's doing great now, but I can't get past that night. You never forget your first time.

I guess what I'm asking is how can I stop making it bother me? It's hard to forget and it makes me uneasy thinking about it. My parents are also against homosexuality. They're definitely not as conservative as his parents are but I don't know what they'd do if they found out. I fear that he'll slip up and word will spread before I'm ready to handle it.

Also, what he did wasn't r*p* right? Was it consensual if I resisted at first but then went with the flow only to regret it later?",05Aug2019,2

368,"So this past week I have done nothing but stress over stupid YouTube comments/replies I've made over these past three years (and mistakes in general). Whether it was commenting/replying to something, I later realized I wanted no part into commenting/replying out of pure anger (even rampages in a comment section). Overall giving me a heavy heart, and with me being in that state of mind was purely focused on ways to erase said comments.

&amp;#x200B;

That's when I thought about either hiding or deleting my old YouTube channel that I used to make those past comments (I got a new email and in-turn a new YT account). After backing the old account up by downloading old videos and taking screenshots of it, including two comments I wanted to keep. I ended up hiding my old channel as that would delete my replies without erasing my channel.

&amp;#x200B;

After going through with it, I was happy for a few hours until I remembered an argument that happened about 9 months ago. During which instead of simply editing the reply I just deleted it and made a new one several times, which was questioned about why and I answered. Remembering this, I realized I was so focused on fixing the one-liner mistakes that I pushed aside the ones where I truly had a conversation. Continuing this thought someone reminded about the Streisand effect, that's when I realized my mistake, and the cycle of worrying about, essentially nothing continued all over again.

373,"Alright, so we've been dating for a solid three months, now. We have known each other for longer. And we're both in our early twenties.  


Now here comes the kicker: **She's moving abroad to Amsterdam** at the end of the month, to study. We've talked a lot about it and we both know how hard it would be for the first few months if we went.  
But we're both willing to give it a shot. She doesn't like our little country(I don't either), so she doesn't really plan on coming back to live here again.  


Biggest issue for me isn't even the moving itself, but the money. It's not like my parents are well off so I can borrow daddies summer home or whatever. Quite the opposite, I usually like to chip in some money for the bills and food when I have it. My girlfriend is in the same boat, but she has had time to prepare.

I doubt I'd be able to scrounge up a few thousand bucks in the next few months if I don't borrow it from someone. And I wouldn't just want to go there to exist, but to work, so I can support myself and my folks back home. I'm a game designer, illustrator and the general designer, so if I could snag a job there, it would be great income. Which would be a great opportunity for me and would help out my side projects if I were to make it work. If not, I would probably take whatever until I got something in my field of work.  


She plans to go by the end of August. We had a discussion what if I waited here for a bit and earned some money for a few months and then go. I'm not a long distance relationship sorta guy, and either way, I don't think even given the few extra months that I'd be able to make that amount of money, without doing a job under a contract.

Even thought I am quite an impulsive person I have never even considered doing something like this with anyone. I get the tendency to overthink a lot, but with her it's all good, and it would be a shame if I were to lose it.

It all seems like a giant hassle. The papers, the money, the bills, visa etc. It's kinda doing my brain in.

She currently has two good friends, and they’ve stopped hanging out with her. I’ve heard her talk about how life would be much easier if she were dead, both while laughing and crying. She cries excessively when she’s alone, but never does it in front of us. She gets irritated much easier, and yells almost every day. She has insomnia, and usually stays up all night. She hasn’t slept for two days. My mom found out and took her phone away. She’s losing interest in everything she enjoyed, and only sits on the couch and watches YouTube on her phone. I hear her crying after getting off the phone with her friends all the time. She can’t focus as well, and even though she’s the third smartest in her class, has forgotten how to multiply. She has worried much more about her weight, and will go days without eating. Once we find this out, we force her to eat. She says it’s because she’s too fat. She’s 95 pounds, and the other girls in her class are about 80. I’ve read lists that she make about all the reasons she should die. She crumpled them up and throws them away. What’s got me really worried is that she’s also dehydrated. She barely drinks water. She also has these weird visions.

378,"So about a month ago, I (22M) found out that my girlfriend (21F) was talking to another guy (34M). At that point, we had been dating a year and a half, and I was intending on proposing to her on our 2nd anniversary and actually getting married around our 3-4th anniversary (so I could finish my degree and then get married). However, this incident has really shaken the confidence in myself, our relationship, and my trust in her. Granted, these are all natural responses, but it doesn't make things any easier.

&amp;#x200B;

I have verified proof that they didn't have sex, but that they did go on dates and he did touch her sexually. This infuriates me to no end, and makes it hard for me to be intimate with her again after knowing that. I know that she feels absolutely terrible about it, and doesn't really hang out with her coworkers (she works in a salon) much anymore because they were the ones that hooked her up with this guy to begin with. Her parents borderline disowned her because of it, and my parents don't want much to do with her either. My brother (30M), who I'm sharing an apartment with, has even put restrictions on how frequently she can come over. She can really only come over on the weekends, but even then she works on Saturdays and I work Mon-Fri.

&amp;#x200B;

The part that's scaring me is how much I don't trust her anymore. I used to trust her 100%, but now I find myself questioning every little thing that she does. I find myself checking her location via snapchat, anxiety flaring up when she doesn't respond to my messages in a timely manner, and checking her phone (with and without her permission). These are all toxic and controlling behaviors, but I don't know to shove these feelings to the side and trust her again.

379,"At some point in life, I decided I wanted to be Jack Kerouac and explore the world as a bum, skipping from town to town, without much to my name. That, however, is not a viable career choice so my mother freaked at the idea. I chose, then, to follow the regular college plan and try my hand at poli-sci. Problem at hand: in my country, there aren't many colleges offering poli-sci. Also,  I graduated in the middle of the year in the southern hemisphere - a total weirdo - and consequently could not apply for most colleges seeing people only join up in February or March. No poli-sci for me.


But, you see, my mother always had a dream. She wanted me to attend a prestigious private college, just as my cousin was doing. Make no mistake, it is an excellent college despite its lack of interest for political theory, you could probably claim it is one of the top in the whole continent. Well, there's another problem at hand: I haven't got the money. Student loans are not a common thing here, and after seeing my parents sink in debt over the years, I never wanted to come close to anything like that myself. Plus, my mother seemed to have it all sorted - a friend of hers knew a professor who could surely write me a recommendation for the dean to get a scholarship. He did so, alright. But, apparently, that's not enough. I need to sit down with the dean, too, it is just that he lacks time for it so I have to chase him down during his lunch break or when he is about to enter his car.


I spent a whole day chasing down that man. I have only a vague idea of how he looks like and the car I tailed for most of my day took off with two women and a colored man at last - he surely was not in the bunch. Then I missed the first signing up date, which meant I had to reclaim my spot, which meant another day on campus and another day hunting this man down to get a scholarship because contacts!


Hours wasted and dedicated to all of this crap. Hours in the cold cold winter waiting for a barely recognisable man to show up to approach him and beg for money. Money for a college I never wanted to attend, to take a course I never wanted to take, to please a mother who hardly ever recognised my effort in anything I did.

381,"I had lower jaw surgery about 3 months ago, surgery went perfectly, after a 2 week check-up they said everything had healed up nicely and they were really satisfied with the procedure and results. The swelling returned on one side of my face after about 4 weeks after the surgery, and they concluded it was probably an infection and I got on antibiotics for 10 days. It worked well and the infection went away within a few days. But I'm so fucking worried that it will return now. I have always had a sore spot on the jawline on that part of the face, and i feel it when i stretch my lower jaw in it's ""maximum"" positions.

Is this a legitimate concern to have? They said if the infection returned it probably has to do with something irritating, like the plates or a shard of bone and by that point they will take x-rays. I just want to talk about this concern with someone, but it feels too small of a matter to contact them directly about it when I don't have any symtoms, other than that small spot of soreness that's always been there, it's just me being worried.

398,"Using a throwaway cause lots of people know my reddit account.

My parents (mainly my dad) forced me to stop playing video games because he thought I was playing too much as ""wasn't normal"". I was playing in a professional team and when I was playing it was training or competiting and we were a new team but were blasting through our competition and qualified for the pro circuit pretty easily all things considered.

My sister and my mum kind of supported me but it was never really sincere and no one in my family or even a large group of my friends expressed any real interest in it. They just decided that they were going to stop me from competiting anymore even though it's a huge dream of mine to win a league or final (which with some more experience and time I think we were capable of doing). I'd really just resigned to not playing any games again until I saw my brother again for the first time in 2 years (he lives and works overseas and we don't talk much) and he was the first person to say that he was proud of me and that he believed in me and it felt like a huge weight had been lifted off me and I realised how crappy I'd felt for the last year cause despite trying all the time no one gave any interest beyond just being polite.

My whole family plays sports and I did as well (played football for my high school as well as club) but I got a really bad ankle injury and I can't run much beyond just going for jogs and my parents (my dad A LOT) really supported/ supports my sisters playing sport. He always offers to drive them to games and watches them and talks to them about it even though both don't live at home anymore and anytime I tried to talk about or introduce him to esports he'd just tell me I'm wasting my life/ I'll regret it when I'm older ect.

It didn't negatively affect my grades (at uni studying law) and I often got to talk to my friends online most nights and see them quite often at official and community finals/ events and I'd still go out and see people and excercise reguarly (played so much sport growing up it just became a habit) and although I didn't really have a lot of spare time between studying/ training/ working I've always been like that and they had no issue with it when it was football and not esports.

How do I tell him (and everyone) that I want to compete again when every time I bring it up they just refuse to have a conversation and tell me that they're 100% right and that I don't understand and will just regret doing this later in life?

A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it.

Well my bff had invited me to hang out for a few hours after I got work , and because I was free I agreed, I stopped by and told my boyfriend at his work on my way to see him (so he wouldn’t  think I was sneaking around) and he flipped out, he asked if I was going to see him every time he’s at work(I’ve seen him literally 4 times this year) and I said no, but I might sometimes because it’s better then sitting at home alone, he then says that my hanging out with my bff is just as disrespectful as if he would start hanging out with my very sexually abusive ex (who is also a registered sex offender) and I was like “only my bff never raped you!” And he said yeah but he’s done other stuff and it’s just as bad.

404,"I am 24 and lost my faith at 19. Even when I still believed I wasn't big on Church so now that I don't go, no one finds it suspicious as they're used to it. What I need advice on is the issue of whether I should tell my parents and others. There are no serious repercussions for myself except perhaps for some awkwardness when visiting home. The problem is that my mum told me repeatedly growing up that she doesn't care what I do in my life because all that matters is that I am saved. In addition to that, I found out how my dad completely broke down when his unbelieving father died, and that his only consolation - to which he holds onto dearly  - was that he had a bible on his bedside table in the hospice. 

What caused me to finally let go of my faith was when is came out accidentally that my sister was not a christian. This was the final blow to my faith, which was already on the rocks for some time at that point. My parents took it very poorly as they no doubt weigh up their success as parents on whether their children believe. Furthermore, I was at home when this all came out and so my mum spoke to me about how distraught she and my dad was. It was the timing of all this that compelled me to keep my mouth shut about my own doubts and eventual unbelief and she has asked me whether I believed regularly every since that day. At first the lie I told sickened me, but it has since become easier to say and going to church occasionally and saying the words has never really bothered me since Churches have always been a home away from home for me - even now. My parents respect my sisters right to unbelief and she has not been ostracized, but it is the elephant in the room and it very clearly affects them even now (they regularly talk about how they hope she dates a Christian in the hope that it brings her back). 

What brought this issue to the forefront recently is that a family friend and Christian, whom I think the world of, has started showing serious interest in having a relationship with me. She is very much devout and I like her a lot, but I don't see how I could ever make her happy given how there is no possibility of me every believing in the literal resurrection again. I feel like I am leading her on because I do enjoy talking and spending time with her, but if I told her the reason I don't ask her out then it will surely be the case that my parents find out. To give some context, dating non-Christians is seriously frowned upon and discouraged due to the corrupting effect it can have, and how it may affect the religiosity of any children (who are the main purpose of marriage and relationships in the first place). It is not unheard of, but will always be a cause of tension. 

To me it looks like a situation in which I have to lie and keep up the facade because doing otherwise would just cause misery and heartache for all parties involved. This would particularly be the case if they found out the extent of my atheism, which has only calcified after years of reading Christian Apologetics, going to Christianity Explored and Alpha Courses, and reading the bible generally.",05Aug2019,1

I feel these are directed more so towards social events where other people are involved so I guess I tend to expect the worst in people.

407,"I have a friend of three years that I haven’t spoken to for a long time but we just reunited. When we reunited, I was pretty sure he was different. He was very nice and kind, but he sounded drained. When I left him years ago, he had just gotten out of a relationship with an absolutely terrible breakup, so I was noticing him changing anyways. 

As I reunited with him, I also reunited with other people we were friends with. They seemed to have been by his side when I left, so they knew that he had been through shit when I was gone. After a few days, I started realising that he was only nice to me and said pretty mean things to others when he had the chance. This wasn’t the sweet boy I knew, not at all. However, I had pretty serious problems on my behalf, so I chose to stay out of that area. 

About a week passed, and that was where the problem started. I snapped at him very minorly when he was being a bit rude to me, and suddenly, he blocked me on everywhere we spoke, banned me from a server even though he wasn’t allowed to and just.. very suddenly cut me off. I thought I lost him, and I was feeling it. I even got drunk and had a panic attack about all of my problems suddenly getting on me. 

At night, he unblocks me, and I tell him that I wouldn’t forget what he did and wouldn’t let myself get treated like shit, but I forgave him. He refused to believe that I had forgiven him, and he sounded pretty depressed overall. I kept trying to reassure him, even until the next morning when he continued, to a point where I was begging him to let me help. He blocks me again. 

Suddenly, when I am randomly writing to the groupchat, he just comes and starts insulting me, calling me childish names. He is also using the 'she' pronouns that makes me feel dysphoric. At some point, I start asking him what I did to him to deserve this, and he just goes on with his insulting, including the n-word and 'retard'. At some point, he tells me that he’d 'pay me to kill myself.' He gets kicked out of the groupchat and I have my second panic attack of the week.

I thought this was all done, but my friends decided to forgive him and add him back to the groupchat. I have so many good friends in there so I don’t wanna leave, but he randomly comes up to me and starts saying unforgivable things.

I often have to go and ask him for advice or input on the work I'm doing, my boss even tells me to go ask him sometimes. This would be fine for any other person, I've come so far with my social anxiety, that this isn't too much of a problem anymore.  

He's the exception, everytime I go to him he already looks at me with disgust, and I can tell that he's incredibly annoyed. He doesn't take my inputs on the question seriously.  He gets really loud and intimidating and dismisses pretty much anything I say, even when it's something important that he just didn't notice. I have seen him treat other people bad, but he treats the older employees much better.  

I've talked to HR and my Boss, their responses we're basically: ""Deal with it, he's not going to be gone anytime soon"". It's a family business, I feel like if it was just a big corporation he'd be gone instantly from all the complaints.  

I feel like he's singlehandedly reversing the progress I've made with the whole social anxiety stuff, because I actively start avoiding him, and I feel like I'm going back to my old ways. I don't know what to do. I don't really want to switch workplace just because of one guy?

well i know she already had a bf idk he's at germany or aussie idk. i know, no matter how i look at it falling in love and wanted someone who already had lover its a bad thing, yet i my heart still want her.   


so i wanted to ask how can i completely erase these feeling of mine? or shud i just tell her about my feeling ( i know the outcome would be a rejection)  
what i've done already :   
trying not to talk to her as much as possible, bcs each time i talk to her idk my heart pumped up.

trying to put some distance and be a bit cold to her, idk how to explain it maybe when she ask something i just say yes or no thats it.

i no longer look at her like i used to be. my heart just melted when i saw her. so when we cross each other i always throw my face away. 

well one thing that i know is she doesnt any have any special feeling towards me, i can confirm this for sure bcs i used to observe how she act towards other and towards me. 

i know that i dont have any chance at all, and i think im just stupid.",05Aug2019,1

He has offered to move in as a roommate to help me out and in a few months we could get a place, just the three of us. My current roommate stresses me out. 

We seem to get along much better when we are not together. But I think it might be awkward living together once I start dating. He has sort of been seeing someone. I think he may still have feeling for me as he gets really jealous when I say I’m going to hang out with a male friend.

417,"I was just a total asshole in the middle of the relationship and still had some tendencies towards the end. The times of me being an asshole just keep playing over and over in my head and it’s driving me crazy. 

One instance was when she had a dinner to go to and it was the same day as a Patriots playoff game. Well she forgot the key to the place she worked so she was gonna have to wait until the end for someone else with a key to unlock and get her stuff. Well I pretty much freaked out on this and said “you’re fucking stupid”. I immediately felt horrible when we got in there but it didn’t take back what I said obviously. 

Another time was when we were on vacation and she bought like a $8 granola bar from the hotel. I was bitching at her saying “what the fuck are you doing”? 

Also another time when she wanted to go to her dads on a Sunday. We lived an hour away and she works right next to him. She worked Saturday until noon so I suggested (very bitchy) that she goes Saturday and that it’s idiotic to drive up there again when she would already be there. 

Just other little shit too that I would bitch at her for, it all just added up. I never wanted to hurt her, I love her more than everyone except my mom, but that’s exactly what I did.

She wasn’t perfect either, like one time we were arguing and she pushed me as hard as she could into the wall a little. Also she lived with my parents rent free, didn’t have to pay for food or anything and she wouldn’t do anything around the house except if it was our room. She also broke up with me over text a week before we were moving down to her town. Now I’m stuck there for at least 6 months. It was definitely all my fault though. 

I feel like I ruined my whole life by being an asshole to her. How do I stop reliving the moments I could’ve been a better person? I just feel awful, she’s a sweetheart and didn’t deserve that. I hate everything right now",05Aug2019,1
418,"Just a preface: I’ve been best friends with this awesome guy since 6th grade. I don’t have many friends and neither does he (for various reasons I won’t get into), but we are so incredibly similar that our friendship has stayed strong even though we go to different schools now. We are both 16, and going to be in sophomore year of high school in less than a week. 

A few months back I got caught drinking with my friends. We used liquor we stole from my parents when they were out of town. I thought it was just gonna be a good time but I was wrong. When they found out I got a warning and I did a good job of negotiating and getting away with it, but they swore to me if it ever happened again there would be “consequences I couldn’t even imagine”.

Fast forward to last night (around 10:00ish). I went over to the same friend’s house and we stole a few shots worth of Whiskey from his dad’s stash. This isn’t the first time we’ve done this, but this time ended up differently. We walked up to his room and set the water bottle we filled on the ground and were planning on taking a few sips. Long story short, his mom woke up because we were being a bit too loud and she saw the bottle. She texted my parents (who were asleep) and 10 minutes later I was in an Uber on my way home.

I woke up my parents as soon as I got home and explained what happened. They seemed to handle it pretty well, a little too well. They said we would talk about it tomorrow morning.

Well, I finished the talk a few minutes ago. There were a lot of tears and my dad did most of the talking. He gave me a surprisingly reasonable punishment, but I know I’m not in the clear yet. The worst part is that he told me I’d never see my best friend again and he’d make sure of it.

I know I was being stupid and irrational at the time, but I could really use some advice rn on my situation.",05Aug2019,1

420,"About 9 weeks ago i had a double jawsurgery, my mum did'nt give me
my antidepressants after.( I was on prozac for about 14 months now)

Once at home after being discharged from the hospital (may 30th) my parents would wake me up every 4 hours for medications, my mom decided i can't take the prozac due too other medication i got after surgery (i got diazepam, oxycodon, paracetamol, quetiapine and antibiotics) without talking too my doctor who prescribed my antidepressants. I did'nt argue because i was in a lot of pain and the only things i did was sleep, then wake up crying due to the pain, begging for my painkillers (there has to be a certain amount of time between them) and sometimes i had to wait 1 hour before i could get my next dose.

Now alsmost 10 week after surgery, i only take quetiapine (just a low dose before bed). I know it can be dangerous to abruptly quit taking antidepressants, especially when it's a high dose. I used to take the highest dose, 60mg. The first 8 weeks after surgery went fine, i felt happy with my new face and thought i did'nt need Prozac anymore. 

I've been depressed for about 6 years and only started taking prozac in year 5. I never told my doctor i quit taking them, made an appointment though.
The last 2 weeks i noticed my moodswings become heavier and i know the feeling of being depressed.

Anyone got any tips before i go to my doctorsappointment?

I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way.

428,"I'm starting a new one-year Masters program soon, majoring in Finance/Accounting. This is the subject that I have always struggled with, but am looking to improve in. I have been doing a lot of prepping and finding out study materials, former notes, etc. and I was thinking of sharing the notes with my other future classmates (we have a group chat). Especially since I've heard from former students that some of the classes can be really tough and demanding.

I really don't see why I shouldn't. I think it's nice to help each other out and make sure everyone succeeds/gets good grades. Or, at least create contribute/create an environment where others feel free to share study resources whenever possible. Since this is not my strongest subject, it would also be nice to have people on my team to help me in case I struggle.

But, on the other hand, I don't want to create a situation where people will start to think that I am their personal study material finder and that they'd expect me to tutor them/have them do little to no effort to pass. I've been reading a lot of r/ChoosingBeggars story and I'm a bit nervous that I'll create a situation like this for myself (maybe I'm worrying for nothing).

At the same time, I'm not really competitive and I wouldn't mind sharing. I guess I just don't want my 'willingness to help' to be abused by my other classmates. I'd like to stay drama-free and I'm fine with helping people, I just don't want them to rely on me and then lash out in case I am not able to help (not even sure if this will happen).

What do you guys think? Should I try and be as helpful as possible, or just stay in the back and say nothing? If I do want to go through with my plan of sharing- how can I best approach this without getting abused in the future?

434,"Hii new here. But wanted to share smth that's been bothering me-

I have a friend. We're both art students. She was enthusiastic and bubbly, I was shy and meek. We both like to make up stories and characters, then share our own worlds to each other.  But we're not that close, we almost did at one point though. 

Then I created a character that became lovable and *iconic* among our peers. She joined in the fun, making up stuff for my story and my character along the way, and since I let her do that and emphasized that it shouldn't be taken seriously, I let her make up stuff. Then she started doodling and posting more of my world on her social media, with fellow art mutuals praising and showing love for the character. I would tell her that she should properly credit me for my character, and she did. For two-three posts. The rest became vague mentions and additional comments mentioning me(ex. ""Paix, look!"", ""This bb i swear, @paix) 

When people started tagging HER for the fanarts they made of that character, I had to message her that it hurt that she didn't even bother correcting people that I was the one who started it. To speed this up, we had three different confrontations and ""mature"" talks for one year straight. It always ended up to her apologizing for taking it her way, or me apologizing for not being honest with her soon. But then a few weeks she would always go back to making ""canon"" stuff about my world. I've made attempts to post on my social media about my stories and reclaiming my character, but nowadays she's pretty much more involved in this than me. I know it's just a story, but I felt that you can really tell what kind of a person someone is by their actions in even the smallest of things like handling secrets, or properly giving credits to people, etc.

She has added more characters to the story and told me that this character has ""changed her life for the better"" and she thanked me for being the creator. I was baffled. So many times have we talked about this and I didn't know what to say. I told her jokingly that she needs to find other characters to leech off and she goes, ""I would never!"" - oh and wowow, she invited a mutual friend to become the official cosplayer of my character without telling me. She started making small stickers of her and this other OC she made to pair up with my character. And ofc, all her OCs dominate my characters.

She started incorporating those characters, esp mine ofc, into her EXAM plates and TEACHERS WOULD THINK ITS HERS. And she's such a story teller. One time I left my opened sketchbook in the classroom to get something, went back and saw our teacher looking at it, and he smiled and said, ""(friend's name) is really good at coming up with lovable characters and their designs-"" and I said, ""sir, I actually did those drawings."" And he was apologetic. He said I rarely show off my doodles and stuff. That hit me. 

I got tired, and this is only part one. I tried to condense this all into one post, but it's hard to explain. I've left this story sitch to a standstill, so think of this as an introduction to a future post. If I ever get encouraged. 

We're still classmates, but she has lately started to try one-upping me in almost everything. Or she has started to downplay my life to try to humble brag her art progress and art peer connections. I'm getting discouraged and pretty sad. It's more than that, can't describe it well atm.

435,"First off, I love dogs, I always have and I always will. I'm a firm believer that there's no such thing as a bad dog and everything a dog does is for a reason. With that said, here's some background:

My cousin and her boyfriend (We'll call him Mark) have three dogs between them, my cousins dog is about the same age as one of Mark's dogs, Mark's other dog is much older. I got asked to watch them over the weekend and gladly did it, because as I said, I love dogs.

I was warned before hand that the two dogs around the same age - My cousins and Mark's - don't always get along since they've only known each other about five months. So, I was being careful all weekend to not put them in situations where they could provoke each other (only letting one out at a time, not feeding them in the same place, etc). However, yesterday I had Mark's two dogs outside in the yard and brought the third dog out because he needed to go. He went to relieve himself and I called him to come back in. As he was walking in and seemingly out of nowhere, Mark's younger dog barked and ran toward him, the older dog got there first and stopped the younger dog by biting him in the throat.

I quickly got the third dog inside and went back out to separate the other two dogs but they were going at it. I've seen dogs get in scraps before but these dogs seemed like they were ready to kill each other. It took me 15 minutes to separate them and the older dog came out with a large gash on his ear and part of his lip hanging while the younger one had puncture wounds all over his snout and throat. I got bit two or three times in the process and I was covered literally from head to toe in blood and mud so I went to the ER and was given a tetanus shot and some stitches for the bites.

Also if you're wondering why it took me so long to separate them:

1. I'm not a professional in animal control, I don't know all the tricks.
2. They're both 40 pound pit bulls and I'm like 150 pounds soaking wet.

I know I got lucky and I could have been hurt much more seriously but I also know that the dogs don't hate me and probably will get over this on their own. The problem is the older dog is still growling at me and I've been having a lot of anxiety about this since last night. My question is what can I do to help myself getting over this? I don't want to be afraid of these dogs and I don't want this to influence me but right now I'm having trouble even being in the same room as any of the three of them. My whole body is sore and I still have to watch them for another day, please give me some advice.",05Aug2019,2

437,"  

In 1997 I was travelling through Bali and Australia and I met a wonderful girl called Becky, she was just out of Cambridge University – Magdalene and was also travelling like I was, we hit it off and were together for what seemed like a lifetime but by late 98 all was pretty much lost and we had grown apart, I moved away from London back to Scotland, and she got on with her life at the law firm she worked at. We kept in touch regular by phone and visited each other until 99 when she met someone else and she told me it felt special, the calls grew shorter and she got engaged and we agreed contact should cease.

I haven’t heard anything of this girl in 20 years.

Lately a few things have happened that have made me review what has gone on in my life and she is the one person I would love to hear is ok.

I have no idea where she is or how she is, I have no idea how to even find out.

I have looked for her name on Facebook but nothing – if she married it would be different anyway, I also looked for her sister Sara but nothing.

What I ask is – what else can I do ?

should I even continue to search – would it look creepy to even continue to try and find her – maybe she has no interest in talking to me – but I wont know any of this unless I try. i feel i should add i am not looking for a relationship out of this. 

There are reasons I didn’t look before.

Any advice appreciated

I'm feeling upset about some stuff right now and I want to know if there's anything I can change to be a more resilient and happy person. 

From what I observe, more warm or feelings driven people tend to ignore or forget about bad things. They don't want to talk about it.

I feel like I can't forgive people who neglected me or left me especially when I feel my lowest, and that alone has given me so much hurt.

Just to give you a little background.. I’m Indian and pursued a career not many Indians pursue and became an airline pilot. I’m also fairly young for becoming an airline pilot. So at family gatherings my career is always the central topic of conversation when I’m around. Most are happy for me that I am doing something I love and chased my goals which most of them weren’t allowed to do because of family pressure to take the safer, more well known route. But I do have a few family members try to belittle me and dig very deeply into my personal financial situation. 

Usually I get the few snarky remarks like

 “Oh he doesn’t do anything up there he’s just the Co pilot”  

“Pilots don’t do anything they just turn the auto pilot on and sleep”

They don’t bother me too much just annoying to hear all the time lol 

Then they start digging into how much I make, and how much I save, why I’m not investing it a certain way, and why we make so much money for doing little amount of work. I try to avoid giving a straight up answer because it makes me feel uncomfortable and everyone starts judging and having perceptions of you. 

I don’t have any problem telling someone how much pilots make and educating them on this career because it’s a different and most people don’t usually know many pilots. But when I know the intention is to judge me i don’t feel comfortable.

I told him that I'm not really good at talking to people, he said the same, he feels just like the way I feel about talking to someone and then thinking we might say something to upset that person. I don't really know what to do, I really wanna talk to him more and he also said the same, I sometimes leave his messages unread for hours because I'm thinking of a reply to him that doesn't make him upset or bored and I feel like he's doing the same.",05Aug2019,0

There are 4 apartments in the building and I don't think any of their alarms went off.

456,"I won’t be flying back for another 4 weeks. 

I sent my cat to my parents’ friends’ house for them to take care of her. Little did I know that after only one week, they let two little kids play with her, and accidentally let her out. 

I specifically told them she gets scared around strangers. I told them again and again to never let her out. Now it’s been two days until they finally decided to tell me the news.

I’m literally half an earth away, so the question is, should I fly back to find my cat, or should I stay put? 

That is also to say that my parents, stubborn as they are, refuse to pay for my plane tickets if I decide to fly back. Mostly because they feel like our relatives would then comment on this, saying I would fly back and find my cat rather than visit them. To put it bluntly, my parents basically want to keep their nice reputation【This is China and most of my family disagree with me on most of everything】

The plane tickets are not cheap, it means that I have to beg everyone I know for money. But I know if I don’t fly back now, and my cat doesn’t come back, I would spend an eternal asking the magical “what if”. “What if I did fly back?” “What if by not flying back I miss the only chance to see my cat again?”

On the other hand, there is also the tiniest possibility that perhaps my cat would eventually turn up herself, at my doorstep, at my friends’ doorstep, or at the animal shelter’s doorstep where I originally adopted her. 

That is best case scenario I guess, but I doubt it will happen....

457,"TLDR; at the end

We've been dating for three years and have broke up twice. The first time was after six months, because he was severely depressed after his father dying and he didn't feel like being in a relationship and I could feel him not wanting to be with me.

One month later, we got back together.

Two years after that, I broke up with him because, yet again, he was too depressed to function, he would go to work, go to class and sleep. We would never see each other, he didn't have the energy or the time for me. Not even call me on the phone. So, I broke things off because I didn't feel I was being treated the way I should.

Six months later, we got back together again. He promised he would go to therapy and spend more time with me, which he did the first month. We would go out two or three times a week, call each other and everything was good. 

The last two months have been hell, though. Suddenly, whenever I saw him I felt irritated and didn't know why. I thought I was having some sort of depressive episode, since I had one last year and have had some episodes in the past. I thought it was me, that I was the problem, but after this time I realize it was him. He is, *yet again*, depressed. Hasn't gone to therapy, says he's looking for a psychologist but we've been back together for three months now and he hasn't gone to a single session. To top that off, he has serious money issues, which also makes it hard to seek professional help. 

His family doesn't support him at all (in fact, he's the one that takes care of his mother economically and emotionally). His family doesn't help in relieving any of the stress he has, in fact, they do shit to worsen the situation. I always try and tell him how he should deal with problems at his house so he can leave more peacefully but he doesn't even try.

He has serious spinal pains, continuous stomachaches and gastritis. Our university offers us any medical appointment at their clinic for ONE DOLLAR (more or less on our currency). I shit you not. When I didn't have a job I would go there whenever I needed to, because it was cheap and there were some good doctors. However, he hasn't gone even once. I know he has money problems but he does have one fucking dollar to spend. He just doesn't wan to. Or can't? That's how bad the depression is.

Also, no money means no means of transport and it means less time together. AGAIN.

I care about him a lot, he's kind and loves me a lot, but I can't take this anymore. I don't think I love him anymore but I'm really scares because he doesn't have a strong support system to take care of him when I break up with him. 

I don't even know what to tell him, how I can tell him I can't deal with his depression anymore but that it's NOT his fault.

TLDR; My boyfriend has been depressed for years and I can't take it anymore. I've tried but he won't go to a psychologist. How should I tell him I want to break up without him thinking it's his fault?

Update: Several weeks ago, I told him I wasn't feeling good with the relationship we were having. We started talking a lot about how we were feeling and he started crying. His father's passing three years ago took an enormous toll on him and he hasn't really dealt with those feelings. The depression monster hasn't left him for the past three years. We've had good moments but eventually we circle back to the same thing.",05Aug2019,50
458,"This will be a long post, I will put a TLDR at the bottom.

I am 27 years old living in my hometown, currently enrolled in a bachelor program with a decent job. I live with 2 friends in a flat and have been out of a fairly toxic relationship for over 8 months now. I am currently in a really depressive state and just have no clue what to do with me and my life... 

Let me explain why. I think I should start with the relationship, as it is the thing haunting me the most.

I was in a really toxic relationship for over 3 years. I loved my ex more than anything in the world. Her irrational jealousy and mistrust made my life like a living hell though. I was constantly accused of cheating, not finding her attractive, not loving her and all the crazy bullshit. The thing is that I was constantly by her side (when I wasn't working), I lived 200 meters away from her, I was always answering my phone and I didn't even have contact to any females at all (for her) and am btw a pretty loyal and trustworthy guy, something I was always proud of... All of this drove me depressed and mad, literally. In the last months before the breakup I began to scream at her, throw stuff around , getting really aggressive, punching myself against the head, things I have never done before honestly... all of that after nearly a year of constant verbal abuse, I just couldn't take it anymore. I tried to talk with her countless times, tried to explain, I tried everything I could think of, but failed everytime. In the end I was 100% sure she was mentally sick. I told her to seek therapy. She did not, instead I was the one seeking therapy... When she told me, that she will commit suicide because of me, I snapped. I think I ended things a month after that. This relationship literally destroyed my life. I felt empty, like I lost 4 years of my life and lost the person that I once was. I know it was the only right decision, but fuck my life it still hurts so bad. I put everything on the line for her, I was fighting till the very end and this woman still has a place in my heart after all this pain we brought into each others life.

The months after the breakup were not easy, though I was feeling a lot better. Not arguing and fighting everyday really was a refreshing change and I had time to rehabilitate. I apologized to everyone of my friends for being absent for nearly 3 years, got back into contact with my family and so on. I picked up the pieces. Bit by bit. 

The next major fuck up in my life is my bachelor program. To be fair, I am a trained wholesale and foreign trade merchant, was always working since I finished school and thought it would be a great idea to get a bachelor and maybe a  master to have more freedom of choice with what I want to do with my life. So I didn't do absolutley nothing the last 9 years (finished school at 17 in 2010). I started my bachelor programm around the same time I met my ex. The first semester was ok.. but after the struggle with my partner started, I ditched university completely. I cringed out. I have not acquired a single credit point since the first semester. This was over 3 years ago. I have just been struggling with my relationship, drowning myself with work (I have a job where I can work as much as I want to) and I smoked a lot of weed to help me cope with all the toxicity in the relationship. Being on the campus gives me actual anxiety nowadays, because it is tough for me to be reminded of my failure. It should have been easy for me to complete a bachelor at least and I just couldn't bring myself to give it another try.. It would take me nearly two to three years until I could actually finish my thesis, my parents who financially support me have actually no idea about all of this and think I can finish in the next year. 

Next thing that fucks me everyday are my roommates. They are both good guys. We are friends. But they take a fuckton of hard drugs, are always partying for days, coming home and having their drug hangovers... The flat is always dirty and messy. I cannot cook when I want to, I am ashamed to invite friends into my own home because it is so filthy and I became a pretty messy guy myself... Why should I clean for 3 people? I told them more than once that I cannot stand it and how we should change TOGETHER, but in the end nothing changes. We are all around the same age and both of them are depressed as well, so we are just a bunch of sad guys who play computergames all day and just live day to day.. On top of all that, I live 200 meters away from my ex's old flat. She moved away long ago and I still linger around in this shitty neighborhood. It is pretty tough, when everything in the radius of 10 kilometers around your home reminds you of your last relationship. Every bench, every coffee place, every park I have memories connected to her..

With this in mind, I had another pretty traumatic event. Two weeks ago my grandfather died. It was not pretty. He and my parents were suffering a lot for the last 5 months. We did everything we could to get him the best medical care, we got him into two wonderful nursing homes, but his conditions got so worse in such a short amount of time, that he spend his last days in intensive care units of mental asylums, because his dementia got so bad in the end (ran away a lot, was aggressive to medical staff and so on..). I loved the man, he was my hero. My parents suffered greatly under all the stress and it took a toll on our family to say the least. We have a business to run on top of all this, so there was little to no time to really recover from all the stress. My mother got depressed as well. Oh yeah, we had to put down a 5 month old puppy  a few months back as well...

So here I am. I quit the weed for quite a while now and all of the suppressed emotions are coming to the surface right now. I am thinking a lot about my ex. I have trouble getting good sleep. I feel extremely uncomfortable in my own home. I don't know if I should quit my university or give it one last try. I feel like my life stands still at the moment. I have trouble getting out of the house.. I want to start doing sports again. I want to become a person I can be proud of again. 

On top of all that I met a woman. She is really good to me and appreciates me for who I am. And out of nowhere I dream about my ex again. I am afraid I am too damaged and will hurt her the way my ex hurt me. I am just a fucking mess overall and am really afraid to commit to this person.. She was single for many years now and I am fresh out of a really intense relationship..

Honestly I just want to get a dog, pack my shit and travel the world... I just wish to disappear from this place... I know I can find happiness in life, but I lost my way such a long time ago and every little step requires so much energy.. How the fuck can I come back from this? I really need some advice. I cannot figure out where to start and what to change...

I would be very glad to hear your opinion. Hit me with the hard truth, I think I need it. 

Thank you for your time and have a very good day :)

Cars are never the same after a big crash should I sell it? (Sorry this is long)",05Aug2019,1
460,"Hi everyone! I am in need of some advice! This is a little long so please try to bear with me.

A little back story. I am a 25 year old male living in the New England area. The town I live in is an up and coming coastal town. Nightlife has gotten huge in the past 5 or so years and new real estate ventures and businesses are attracting new people to an area that used to be a small, unknown lobstering town.

With this being said, people my age make up a good majority of the population, and with that, many of the bars in my town cater to the younger crowd.

In this town, there is an awesome nightclub. Some from a larger city might not think it’s much, but for us residents who like to party, this is the spot to go. Enough with the backstory and on with my situation.

This place is notorious for having rude/disrespectful security, but I’ve never had an issue in the 100s of times I’ve gone, So I decided to go there with my girlfriend and her single friend, since we were trying to help her meet some guys and show her a good time. We arrived and everything was normal. I got a beer and we went out onto the dance floor to have some fun. This dance floor is huge and it really is a great place to let off a little steam and have a blast to some dope trap beats.

Well, while I was drinking my beer (I’ve been in the club for less than 30 mins at this point), this aggressive looking security officer walks over to me. You’d think I just smuggled a kilo into the club. He tells me that he needs to have a word with me and points me to a different room. Confused, I comply and follow him, all while my girlfriend runs after me leaving her friend.

He tells me that the bartender observed me and I looked completely intoxicated and that I had to leave. This was untrue (my second beer of the night since I had one at home before I left). My girlfriend was trying to ask if she could at least go get her friend so we could leave, but they said nope and that we had to leave her there (sounds very sketchy). I tried asking what I was doing wrong and how I looked intoxicated to which they said I was being an a**hole and that I need to leave and would not be getting  my cover charge back. I was pretty pissed at this point since I spent $20 for 2 drinks for my girl and I, and I just paid $21 in cover for my girlfriend, her friend, and I to get into the club. 

He took me outside, where I started getting aggressive myself and asked to explain how I was being an a**hole. He refused to tell me what I did and kept mentioning how they were facing a DUI lawsuit and how they had to be extra strict. Of course I was like “this is my fault, how?” I continued to demand my cover back. This dude still refused and kept going on his ego power trip. I should also mention that this guy was apparently the bar manager (position underneath the owners). I mention the lawsuit because of a disturbing detail that came next. They demanded that I rip off my wrist band (to show I was over 21, the wristband says the bar’s name on it) to cover their asses in the Event that I got into an accident or was pulled over for a DUI. 

Another employee who also wanted to feel important joined in and said, “you can either remove the wrist band or I’ll remove it for you.” To which I replied” what’s that supposed to mean? Is that a threat?” Of course, tough guy had nothing to say after I told him I’d report him to the police for threatening to harm me. As luck would have it, some kind gentleman from behind the bar came rushing out and explained to the manager that they had the wrong guy and that the bartender confused me for another intoxicated customer. He told me to follow him, got me a new wrist band and I was able to go back inside. Neither the manager, nor the other employee who got involved apologized for being wrong.

Of course at this point, I’m pretty over it and all I can think about is getting back at those 2 guys. I dance for a little bit longer and my girl and I decide to get her friend and leave. On my way out, I find both the employees and ask their names so I could call the following day and report my experience. I know at this point their already going to have it our for me the next time I go, so I have nothing to lose. Well, one of them tells me their name and then walks over to the manager who confronted me earlier. This dude loses his mind and refuses to tell me his name. He had to go on a power trip and pretend To kick us out, even though we were leaving anyway lol. 

As I was leaving, this manager, in an upscale bar, in a beautiful coastal town has the balls to say “you better watch your back, cus you’re gonna get f*cked.” Some other loser followed us “to make sure we were actually leaving” They would not even let us wait for our friend to use the bathroom and told us to leave or they’d call the cops. Not wanting to compromise my job, I just left and on my way out, I told the manager that It must be sad he needs to kick people out of his bar to make himself feel powerful. He then said (In front of a line full of people trying to get in) “come say it to my face b*tch” obviously mr tough guy knew the cops would be on his side if I did anything, so I just kept walking away. 

Fast forward to the following day, I emailed the owner of the bar (info was available online) and he forwarded my email directly to the guy who kicked me out the previous evening. I am tempted to ask the owner if he would speak directly with me, but I need some advice on how to get back at these guys. I found all of the employees on Facebook, except for the manager, but I was able to find his name. What should I do? This bar is a great place for me to get together with my friends, but I would be ok not going back if I was able to get back at these guys for how they treated me and others. Online reviews won’t work, since this place is also a restaurant and there are a lot of good reviews mixed in with the bad nightclub reviews. They even publicly respond to the bad reviews and brush the people off as being intoxicated and disorderly, even though it’s the bouncers who are to blame. 

Any advice would be much appreciated. It would even be a bonus if anyone has any creative (legal) suggestions that I can use to get back at them.

462," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 

When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d been snotty. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly.

464,"We have been friends for years. Last year my friend told me she was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. However, she was never compliant. She hates her meds, therapist, everything. When she told me, it was obvious that she was still in denial. 

Now, I already had depression and anxiety before she told me her problem. At the time I was already in therapy for 1 year. So I kinda know how hard it was to keep going to therapy. How hard to fight yourself. How hard to force yourself to face your fears. How hard to not run when you were so sensitive that everything the therapist said, you get offended and defensive. How hard to fight when everyone around you didn’t believe in you. I did not have any support at all back then. I don’t have family or friends around me. My lecturers told me to drop out. I had to fight alone. 

I didn’t want to do that to my friend. So I tried to be the listening ear. I told her early on, I cannot be her therapist. I am not a therapist. I’m just her friend, along in this journey of healing ourselves. It was great in the beginning. We both tried to be supportive to each other. But then, it was clear that it wasn’t enough. I suggested her to get back on therapy, which she did for a few months, but stopped because she didn’t like her meds, she thinks she can survive on self help etc. I told her a therapist can help better, but she refused. 

From then on it got worse. It has been 4 years. She kept complaining on things that obviously need professional help. She developed obsession on politics. She kept on pushing her views on me. She would get upset if I don’t agree with her. She would suddenly go contactless whenever she is down. Then suddenly she is okay. Then she is sad and angry. I tried to be supportive as I can, but it was clearly one sided. Suddenly there’s only me trying to fight this alone, along with hers. Suddenly I felt like I’m the only one trying to maintain this relationship. It’s tiring. And frustrating. I tried to move on and have other friends. However making friends and trusting them telling my condition is something I’m still struggling with. 

What should I do? I’m afraid that cutting her off suddenly would be dangerous, given her condition. I don’t really want to leave my friend. 


Tldr; Best friend’s depression and anxiety worsened but she still refuses therapy. I’m depressed too, and I’m tired being the listening ear. I’m struggling to make new relationships. What should I do? How to move on?",05Aug2019,1
465,"My parents got divorced when I was 4, and since then my mom has succeeded, and my dad has not. My mom is now remarried, has a nice, big, house and works the job of her dreams. My dad lives in a small apartment in a small town, and works at home. 
When it comes to happiness, I'd like to think they're both equally happy. My dad has always been a 'glass half full' person and it astonishes me. Finacially, he is not doing well. He lives paycheck to paycheck and has no savings whatsoever. He has enough for what he needs, and maybe a couple bucks left over.

I worry a lot about his future. His health is not great and he doesn't have a doctor or any benefits. Since theres no money for retirement, I worry about how he will spend his retirement, or if he even will retire. 
I want to help my dad in every way I can, it's just the rest of my family is discouraging me from doing so. I would be completely fine with postponing finishing my degree if it meant I'd be able to help him. People are telling me I have to focus on myself first, and that he should worry about myself. My mother implies that he's a lost cause.

468,"Sorry this is so messy. I have lots of stuff to tell and I have no idea how to make it short without making it stupid. I'm trying though.

So I'm 15 years old, turning 16 in December. I'm starting high school later this week and it has been stressing me out. I live with my mom, 4 younger siblings and two cats. Me and three of my siblings do visit my dad a lot, just.. not enough and my youngest brother doesn't know his dad and undoubtedly, my mom is TIRED tired. I haven't been at my best recently, this whole summer has just been a big depressive episode with me getting worse each day. My recent medication change hasn't shown any kind of effect yet, but there's still some hope with that. I also happen to be nonbinary and closeted and my issues with my body and gender identity bother me a whole lot. So basically, I really am not doing good.

I don't have the best relationship with my mother, not after she completely broke my trust and basically ruined me by putting down/giving away all my cats behind my back, one by one. It may not seem that bad but my cats really were my best friends, especially Pörrö, the last one to go. My cats were all I had, I still cry over them even though it's been a long time. My mom did get me a new little friend a year ago once she found out how bad i really was doing - and I love Pippuri to the moon and back - and another one just a month ago - I also already love this kitter so much - but the damage was done. Ever since I've been a wreck. And I never realized that my mom isn't okay either.

So today I freaked out over schoolbooks, cried, yelled at my mom, blamed her for everything, the usual. Later on she came to my room, crying, telling me about how tired she is and how much she wishes she could do something to help me and how she's just trying her best. At that point I'd cried enough and didn't really feel much - gotta love the numbness that comes with depression - and I had absolutely no idea what to say. I just told her something along the lines of ""I'm sorry I'm so difficult, it's not your fault, no you can't help no one can help me because I don't even know what would help me"" and now I feel absolutely terrible. 

And I have no idea what to do now. I probably should say something but I truly do not know what. Depression has already turned me into a lazy, lifeless blob and even if I somehow recover someday it's gonna take years and I've already managed to ruin everything for my mother so this situation really feels impossible. What do I do now? How am I supposed to act in a situation like this? What am I supposed to say to comfort my mother whose life I ruined and who still has to be stuck with me? Should I just move out? To a mental hospital or something like that? Am I a horrible child? Do I not even deserve to live anymore? How do I get out of this? What kind of options does a not so wealthy family with a tired mom and too many kids have? Am I a horrible person for not helping my mother out more? Do I have any reasons to even try anymore? Is there anything that could help me and my mom? Are my younger siblings all gonna grow up to be as bad as or even worse than me since I've already drained all my mom's energy and will to live? Should I just go out and get some fresh air and then apologize to my mom for yelling at her and try to just live day by day even if I don't see a future for myself or this family? Are we totally doomed? Do I have any chances to get better some day? Is high school going to kill me? 

I have so many questions right now and I'm so confused. But basically, I'm depressed and have managed to make my mom miserable, is there anyone who knows what my next step should be?",05Aug2019,1

470,"TL;DR my mom [53f] is definitely a narcissist, I’ve never thought my dad [60m] was. But my dad has tried divorcing my mom and she won’t sign the papers. She manipulated my brother [now 28m] out of enlisting in the army when he dropped out of college and now bitches about him living with her daily. I’m trying to get away but each time she treats me like I’m crazy for wanting to get out, but I think she is. 

I had a pretty untraditional childhood, I was born in northern Kentucky where we lived for five years. During this time my mom and dad already had marriage troubles and my dad was cheating on my mom with his secretary at work (my mom claims this). I was obviously oblivious to it all because I was a baby.

In between Kentucky and California we moved to North Carolina for a month and that’s a blur that I don’t really remember at all.

When we were 5 we moved to California. Here my middle older brother sexually assaulted me. I didn’t tell my parents because he told me not to. I was a very quiet child at this point but was known for being very helpful in school however I was always afraid of boys after this experience. I also began to feel guilty any time I blamed anything on my brother or told my parents anything he did to me (throw a bouncy ball full force at my head, but me on a skateboard and have me luge down a mountain side, trap me under a table, etc.) I essentially stopped asking for help here.

Then when I was 7 we moved to Florida, here I became a pretty big loner child. My two older bothers were going through their “beating each other up so much I thought that were sometimes going to kill themselves” phase. And this gave me a lot of anxiety so I would listen to CDs alone in my room or play with the few girlfriends I had or ride my bike throughout the neighborhood to meet up with neighborhood kids or take car of my neighbors dogs. 

I’m Florida my mom enrolled me in springboard diving and I started to get pretty good at it. At the time, she also had my playing softball, gymnastics, and cheerleading on top of diving (which is a year around sports) Through sports I had the confidence to start asking for help again. My parents marriage continued to deteriorate and they fought often behind closed doors, I’m not sure if the fighting turned physical here or in the next state. 

Finally at age 9 going on 10 we moved to Texas. I struggled to make friends immediately in Texas because I still had a northern Kentucky accent that kids liked to make fun of. I had also lived in multiple states that were/are completely fine states and when I would tell kids that I would get the “YEAH BUT TEXAS IS BETTER!!!!!!” response as if Texas was god and I didn’t know him. I struggled to make a solid friend group in my town because most of the kids had been together since they were in kindergarten so I ended up being friends with a group of girls from the daughter of one of my mothers co workers but I ended up loving them regardless. 

Additionally, this was the point when my middle brother [27m]  decided i that I told on him TOO much for things I shouldn’t. So he would teach me a lesson in ways such as chasing me around the house with a split end grill knife when my parents were gone. Holding me down on the floor and tapping me sternum repetitively (this doesn’t seem too bad). Calling me Snagglepuss (I had a Snagle tooth). He played football and was my parents golden child so he generally received medical treatment when I didn’t. I once got a staph infection that my mom said we were too broke to visit a doctor for. So I treated it at home with hibi cleanse, peroxide, alcohol, and Lansing it myself to drain it and pack it with cotton balls.  There were multiple times when my coaches told my mom I needed to see a doctor for injuries and she just wouldn’t take me. Now I struggle to consistently work out because I eventually feel all of my injuries but am trying to get stable enough for the possible medical care I need. 

I was always a Tom boy growing up and these girls helped me a lot with manors and realizing my feminine side so I will always appreciate them for that. It was here that I started fighting my brother back again and yelling at him for things. I also became a nationally ranked springboard diver here which is where my mom put all of my worth. I did well in school but my middle school my mom had my attending two morning practices a week, five afternoon practices, in the athletics class at school, and doing gymnastics one night a week after diving practice. My diving team was an hour away from our house.

I continued this schedule through high school, even when they opened a new club diving team that was closer to our house. When I was a sophomore we started losing our house, I asked my mom if I could quite or at least join the closer/cheaper team so that I could have a job outside of diving and she said no, that I would never do well on that team, etc. I started struggling in school on account that my mother made me take all AP classes and I was not diving in the mornings three times a week, having high school practice during school, then driving the hour to my club practices after school. I did gymnastics one night during the week and sometimes on Saturdays as well. On the days I didn’t have morning practice I would wake up at 5 am to do homework and on the days I did I would wake up sometimes at 2 and 3 am to do it since I was usually pretty dead beat once getting home from three practices + weights and conditioning and a full day of school 

I struggled to make friends and the friends I did have eventually would get upset with me because I made the “i can’t I have practice” excuse all to often. I wasn’t allowed to have boyfriends or normal social experiences so I began sneaking around to have these experiences at this point. I’ve always been pretty liberal on a politics scale and I come from a very conservative home town so I just figured I would never end up seriously dating a guy from this place. 

My mother was also really hard on me about my weight - to the point that I would starve myself so I often became afraid of sex after my period would stop and I’d embarrassing my tell whomever I last had sex with, then I would eat better for a week and I would come back once I gained weight. However I did have one abortion when I was 19 via the pill. It was with a boyfriend whom I actually did love and I would never tell my mom at this point because she hit me when she found out we were even having sex at 18.

She would hit me if I didn’t have a good practice, she would hit me if I was afraid of a five at practice, she would hit me if I ever talked back (probably deserved that), and she would hit me if I ever told her she needed to divorce my dad. Her and my dads relationship continually deteriorated on account that my dad could never get through to my mom about anything. So, he cheated multiple times and my mom always played the victim. Finally my dad moved away however, he has filed for divorce now 5+ years later after being separated for that long and my mom won’t sign the papers 

Anytime I try to move on with my life or anything my mom tries to sabotage my plans. My senior year I wanted to go to an in-state school for college because of cost but I had a boyfriend at home so my mom told me that wasn’t a possibility. I went to an out of state school for a year, decided I didn’t want to be dying in out of state student loans for the rest of my life, and when I decided to transfer my mom came up with an elaborate lie about how much more in-state tuition would cost me.

Anytime I try to move to a new city she tells me how much my insurance won’t transfer etc. etc.

I’ve helped her lose 100 pounds, move into a new home, get her life on track and try to be happy alone and I’ve sacrificed so much of my own happiness to do this, and I also don’t want to become a narcissist myself.

Any advice on what I should do/how to not become a narcissist would be helpful. I really don’t want to continue through life like that but also know I need to focus on myself.  I struggle to tell the truth to people on account that I’ve been on survival mode for so long and I feel like I lie about the littlest and biggest things someone’s to try to protect myself. I don’t want to continue living this way, and am looking for any help I can get.",05Aug2019,2

I’m going to be super real with everyone reeding this I want to be truthful to people on what I say . I wanna be a person that’s speaks solid facts ( I personally do ) but no one really know this as I’m so lowkey in social media and real life it’s almost like a ghost. 

My dream is to become a property millionaire and own business... yes this is a real goal and extremely hard to achieve so I really don’t want any Pep talk on the difficulty on achieving those 2 goals and just knowing what we know now it’s hard and profitable to be In that sort of business plus’s achieving the education alone is hard... 

My family and friend are very negative.. the worst type of people to tell if you have a new idea or have an opportunity to do great or good. They slam me down every-time I do something new or come up with good ideas. Iv lost jobs ,friends, family, broken friendships over my dream and none have fallen though. 

I have plans .... they are real... there just as you read at the start ridiculous hard and big as Robert kiosaky says the more money you want to earn the more risk there is the smarted you have to be. 
I don’t wanna sell people stuff I just wanna province value and make something of my self to show people I’m not this so called dumb ass that my family proclaimed me to be from all my failures. I mean this I hate posting on reddit sometimes I get slammed by people on my previous accounts that I’m not going to lie , I pussied our and just went to hide emotions got to be as reddit and people in real life just don’t understand me so I’m giving this another shot but I’m going to be 10x more on point to what I want from people ... I’m embarrassed I done that but now I genuinely don’t give a fuck I want real people to slam me with facts and help me be the person I wanna be and make my life to my dreams.

480,"So someone i used to consider my best friend for the past few years has been hurting me in the recent months. I trusted her with one thing that really bothers me and i always knew i could rely on her to not do it but she did it because she was speaking to some guy. Whenever she's speaking to someone she likes or whatever she disregards everything and does all the things i ask her not to. It really hurts. I know it's probably dumb. 
I also don't like confrontations or serious convos, they make me shake and cry, idk whats wrong with me. I just don't want to talk to her about any of this anymore. Atleast not physically.

I just feel really bad, i feel like crying. It almost seems like she manipulates the situations into her favour, but it's not even really serious stuff, just to me it is and I'm a sensitive little shit.

I was having a bad day and family problems and stuff and i asked her to meet me since we live 5 minutes away from eachother by walking, she said she cant and has to go to sleep but then she stayed up on Instagram answering people's questions on her story and didn't even ask what happened, just started talking to me about a boy. She said she was going to sleep and basically just stayed up another 5 or so hours. I just really needed a shoulder to cry on and i don't understand why she couldn't see me, she's the only close friend that lives near me. I've never really been vulnerable to anyone and the one time i really wanted to she didn't want to see me or seemed to care at all.

I really want to stop being her friend but it makes me even more upset, I've never gotten that close to someone before. We live close and have many pictures together and stuff. I don't want to see her ever again. What can i do?

483,"Sounds like a weird title. I have been working online since I was 18. Never had a real job. I had a good situation years ago but I screwed that up. Then I fell into doing something else online, that made enough money to get by but over the years it's fizzled up now.. I've always been heavy into being an entrepreneur or trying to make it somehow on my own, and I do believe that I can do it but I have been plagued with cloud of confusion and hopelessness, and motivational issues.. but I think that I can manage the motivation part.  


Fast forward to 2019. I had gone through several psychedelic experiences and realized what I want to do in life. I even realized a great career path (involves working online, ideally from home), where I could help many businesses and people and get paid well. Something that I would love to do but previously was confusing and I didn't quite understand. But once my mind was set free, I was able to understand all these complex things that for years were confusing to me.. and now I want to do those things.  


So now I've been in the stage of learning/studying/applying the knowledge, to demonstrate to myself that I can do this, get really good results online, replicate it, replicate it until I'm confident I can do this for anyone.  


**Until then,** I need to get a regular job because I have no source of income at the moment and by the time this stuff finally kicks off, its gonna be like 8 months to a year from now.. which I'm fine with waiting, but in the mean time I need to get some kind of job so I can pay rent or whatever  


I just feel this overwhelming sense of dread, of having to go get a regular job, since I've never had to report to anyone or do anything other than from high school. I'm in my 30s now, and I don't have post secondary education so I've done up my resume as best as I can and I'm sure I will be able to get a job but, as retarded as it sounds, I feel like it's 17 years of conditioning, of not having a job, of being your own boss, of doing whatever you want when you want, to now having to go get a job..  


I'm nervous  
I have a sense of dread hanging over me  
I'm scared  


It is dumb I know, but hoping someone can just say something to me or maybe someones been in a similar situation

I just am trying to remind myself that look it cant be that bad.. Just go apply places, get hired somewhere, who cares what it is....just do the job and when you get home, work on the other stuff so you can eventually get out of this job  


I just feel lame because most people have been doing this for their whole life, it's nothing to them, here I am scared as shit and feeling all this dread when I shouldn't  


It reminds me of my first day of high school... I had all this worry and super nervous.. that's the closest ive come to reporting anywhere in a long time.. but I do remember that the 2nd day or first day, things got easier and I wasn't worried..so im hoping its gonna be like that once I do start working at whatever place  


I think there is some element of I hate the job I'll be doing so it just creates more dread around it..

490,"I’m 20/F and I’ll be explaining this from my point of view and my family’s. My family thinks I have an addiction to gaming. They think it is a problem. I’d say I have a small problem in comparison to the one I really have.

Spending. That’s why they complain so much although they would find something else to complain about. They think I’m fat (I’m under 130pounds) they think I don’t want I job (I quit my last one because I was hired as an assistant but I was doing gardening instead of the actual job I was supposed to do and am actively still looking for work) but spending has always been my problem. I’ve said it out flat, that it’s hard not to spend because it feels good but feels like shit afterward. 

They look at me looking at any screen, my phone, my computer, and assume I’m gaming. Instantly. They never bother to ask. In truth my entire social life is pretty much an app called discord. I have severe anxiety and bad experiences from the past that render me finding making friends in person difficult. I also love writing. I’m in absolute love with writing and I want to be a writer- just a month ago I finished a 200k word prologue. For a FANFICTION. 

I maybe spend, four hours a day writing, three hours a day gaming for inspiration, two hours or so a day conversing. The problem is I have to be looking at a screen for that to happen. They seem to like forcing me into situations I’d be uncomfortable with (they like drinking and partying) and I just can’t really handle being outside for a long amount of time (more than 4 hours) my room is a place of safety and comfort and I’m basically tethered to it. I like going on walks every day, but it doesn’t matter what I do or say because they still insist the problem is gaming.

The problem is spending money, 100%. I have shit self control and my mind always manages to convince itself that just one more is enough, that if I have this budget I’ll be fine, that if I only spend 20$, everything will be okay- and it feels damn good to do it, but then like shit when I realize that I gave in to those impulses and that I’d have my family angrily snapping at me in the morning (my aunt controls my bank account, my family tends to be very controlling AND aggressive, not a good mix)

Is my problem gaming? Is it the computer in general? What should I do? I’ve told them time and time again that it’s the spending and I want it to stop but I can’t. They’re going to send me to rehab for the wrong thing and that’s what upsets me the most. I don’t care about going, hell, I even want to go if it just stops but I don’t think I can do it on my own but they don’t listen to me and never have. 

Is there any advice on what I can do??",05Aug2019,1
492,"I'm an introvert. I think I have depression or/and anxiety too or it's just in my head. Anyways, a few months back, I got the results for my 11th grade exams. I don't know how education systems work in different countries but it was an important exam. You basically study for 2 years and then you take part in the exam. The results were as described by my friends and family, ""very good."" But according to my expectations, they were shit. I could've done a lot better. Where things get even more confusing even to me is that I don't even think I deserve the results I got. What I mean to say here is that I didn't study enough to get such a good result, but it's not good enough as I could've done better. This doesn't even make any sense!

The most frustrating part here is that my damn parents(I know that they love and are doing the best for me) went and applied for a scholarship for stupid freaking me!! The same shit goes here. I don't think that I deserve a scholarship and I just wanna be like every other students in my school. In a few days, an event will be held to award students from my country the scholarships. If you remember the part where I said I'm an introvert, that's where it applies. I need help to go to that damn event. There'll be cameras everywhere, ministers who will be awarding the prizes and the most terrifying thing: humans, lots of them.

How should I mentally prepare myself for the biggest obstacle I've seen in my life yet? How should I react if somebody asks me if I like something when I clearly don't but I don't want to disrespect them. There's no avoiding it as my parents have already told me to ditch that idea. And can anybody hint me what's wrong with my brain?

what I’m wondering is how do I do this? do I get all of my shots at once? does it hurt? are there side effects? do I need to get specific shots since I’m older? 

I’m not planning on getting the yearly flu shot (unless work or school requires it) because my family has all had bad reactions to it, and I’d rather not risk that

500,"I [M24] currently live with my parents  in Middle Tennessee and work in a low paying job in Nashville. I know I need to find a new job here shortly but I'm unsure if I should be looking in Nashville or one of the cities I've been eyeing at moving to, Louisville or Jacksonville. The reason for the possible move is that Middle Tennessee is so expensive and my end game is to own property in a LCOL metro area which Louisville and Jacksonville both are. If I could afford Nashville I would probably opt to move there but it is out of my price range. Honestly I would probably move to Louisville next month if I didn't have an extremely solid friend group here which is BY FAR my biggest hold up. I see my options as:

1) Find better paying  job in Middle TN and in Spring of 2020 I plan to either find a house in Nashville or move to Louisville.

2) Move to Louisville by end of this year, get to know the area and  find a job. Then buy a house next spring.

506,"I need help with how to deal with an issue also I need to vent.  We have a family member that moved in with us and I am becoming irritated with them.  I have never lived with a roommate before and that may have a lot to do with it.  I feel like I cannot tell a grown woman what to do or express how annoyed I am.  This person is extreamly overweight, obese.  They do not pick their feet up when they walk and just shuffle around all day, I tell the kids to pick their feet up when they walk but I feel like I cannot tell a grown adult what to do.  She does not understand why the cats run away from her.  There is a huge person shuffling after them using a baby voice and my cats are not into it.  They hide in my bedroom and avoid her but are friendly with everyother person.  

 When it is dinner time, the kids set the table and this person just sits there waiting for the food to go on to the table.  We set the table as I am making dinner so they sit at an empty table waiting for dinner for up to an hour sometimes, it is weird.  They don't use napkins during the meal and have food bits dripping from their chin, chew with their mouth open and make the all the stomach churning noises you can think of while eating.  I place out a napkin but it never gets used during the meal.  They will talk with a mouthful of food and continue shoving food in their mouth.  I am trying to teach the kids manners but having this adult that I cannot reprimand at the table is frustrating.

This person sleeps all day and only does small chores (occasionally) when my partner is around.  She has tried to start issues between me and my partner about my lack of daily chores, he shut that down thankfully.  I work 10 hour shifts and am finishing my degree, so my partner understands why I only do chores on the days only have school work.  I leave the house at 7 am and get home around 8 pm, eat dinner and then do some school work before going to bed.  So yeah, I am not doing any house work that does not have to get done on those days.  I get the cats fed at watered, scoop the litter box and make they kids lunch boxes up in the morning.  On my days off I do all the weekley chores to make up for my partner having to do the daily chores.  Laundry, moping, bathroom cleaning, porch cleaning, deep cleaning, sunday dinner making, ect.  It works for us and I really do not appreaciate someone trying to start drama when they are too lazy to even get out of bed before noon.  

Also I am becoming increasingly annoyed when I am working with the youngest child that this person will provide the answer to the child if I ask a question.  I am big on giving the child time to figure out their answer and feel that a well thought out wrong answer is better than a spoon fed right answer.  We have never even raised our voices to the children and this person will bark out orders too them.  They are good kids and only need gentle direction to do what is expected.  

So I am trying to find a loving way to bring up my feelings so everyone can live peacefully together.  I can avoid the person most of the time but meal times are the hardest.  I also feel like if I up any of these issues I will be the bad guy.  My sanity is at stake here, I want to love the person but these basic things that a six year old is taught is lacking.

Her boyfriend was in some kind of secret society and my mother caught him cheating on her. Since then, she feels stalked by him and basically ""sees"" him wherever she goes. When the wifi at home is slow, she suspects that he ""hacked"" it, when a tyre is flat, he obviously slashed it and when something in the house was moved, she thinks that he was in there.

511,"My girlfriend and I just recently got a house together with her family. This house was a foreclosure, and when we started moving in we kept finding more and more issues. These problems ranged from plumbing, to drywall, to electrical. Fixing it up has taken over a year now and in that time my girlfriends car insurance was no longer able to payed for by her family, due to house costs. We thought this house would be fixed up quicker than it was, and now theres no money for her car insurance. My job is too fickle with its schedule to drive her to work, and her family works long hours, so they cant drive her to work either, so she’s out a job.

After awhile everyone’s money was gone trying to fix up this house. After the money was gone people started to get angry at the situation and take it out on each other, except me and my girlfriend are doing ok. Now we are out of money, missed out on college and can no longer afford it, and the rising tempers are making it hard to even want to move in. I’ve been trying to work my hardest to get us out of this situation, but its hard to make it to work on time or have enough energy to make it threw the day when all of this is happening keeping me up all night. 

With tempers rising even further, and no hope of having enough money to fix it up (on top of other family members wanting to jump ship on this house) we don’t know where to go or what to do. 

The only thing we did have figured out is I have a friend and his girlfriend are willing to get an apartment together but they wont be able to till next college semester, and we have plans to take an online course on UI Design, but from now till then we don’t know what to do.

513,"I'm 18 and I still live with my mother, I have 2 more years of school left because of some Issues that I'd ran into in the past and had to repeat my grades, including mental health issues, which I'm currently battling as well. I'm not religious, but my mother is, and today she's been trying to get me to attend some stupid ceremony that my aunt is hosting at a church. I don't know what the hell it is.. sounds like some kind of sacrifice of bread to the gods tying to get their house good luck or something. Completely stupid. I don't believe in that stuff and I'd never go there. I haven't been in a church in years and I'm not interested in doing so any time soon. Anyway, like I said my mother doesn't seem to understand when a person tells them no to something, none of my relatives does. She's been asking me to go with her over and over again all day. But I have other things to do and pass my time, I have my dog to take for a walk, I have stuff to read. She's not the type of person to believe that mental health issues are cured with religion, at all. I have my therapist for that, who I'm obviously gonna tell about this next time i see her. The thing is my mother is too much, she just wouldn't stop no matter how many times i refused. I can't get angry because of my anxiety issues, it gives me severe headaches and makes me feel really bad afterwards, but she wouldn't stop. I had to start yelling because ignoring her didn't seem to work, she kept assuming that I agreed to go and it was really annoying. She wouldn't stop, I was getting really angry and she completely ignored the fact that I'm not supposed to be getting angry because it's not good for my condition, and I just blew up. I told her something similar to ""F*ck your god"" after I kept explaining to her that I have nothing to do with religion and had absolutely no reason to be in such place. She went silent and hasn't told me anything else ever since.

514,"TL;DR - My friend who suffers from mental illness and is getting a divorce joined a cult; I don't know if I can be friends with her anymore, but I also don't want to be a fair-weather friend. Help!

A year-and-a-half ago, I (27-Female) got engaged and asked my nearest and dearest husband-and-wife friends 'Eric' (29-Male) and 'Dayna' (29-Female) to be in the bridal party. I was in their bridal party when they got married six years ago. They accepted right away, gushing about how thrilled they were to participate together.

Three months later, they separated. 

According to Dayna, they separated because Eric had an emotional affair with a coworker. According to Eric, they separated because Dayna refused to seek help or take medication for her severe anxiety and depression for two years. At the time, even though I tried to be neutral, I was really angry with Eric. The idea of having an emotional affair with someone and then leaving your spouse for reasons relating to their mental illness seemed so harsh and unkind.

Now, a year-and-a-half later, I'm considering ending my friendship with Dayna for the same reasons, and I could really use the perspective of folks separated from the situation to help me consider my conundrum with rational thinking and (most importantly) kindness towards my friends.

After the separation, Dayna wrote several suicide notes that made their way to me, our other friends and my fiancé (officially, she attempted suicide twice, but she wrote over two dozen notes). Our group of friends were on suicide watch in shifts for a few months until we were fairly confident she wouldn't attempt it again. We asked her to seek help; she saw a therapist for a session or two and got a prescription for medication.

Once Dayna stabilized, she started attending a local mega-church with her mom. For context, Dayna's mom left Dayna and her dad when she was six, and she struggles with a delusional disorder. I have a lot of sympathy for Dayna's mom, but I don't trust her to not hurt Dayna.

At first, religion seemed to help Dayna a lot as she was going through her separation, but over the last few months, Dayna has gotten involved with an (admittedly unpopular) section of that mega-church that is, for lack of a better term, a doomsday cult. Dayna tries to convince me that she has predicted the end times. She asked to add me to an email list for doomsday prepping. She's become obsessed with YouTube prophets who preach about the rapture and tells me how, one day, all of her friends (me, Eric, my agnostic fiancé) will see that she was right and join her group with her mom. She even started telling me how her mom's delusions are actually God-given prophecy (never mind that they are inconsistent and go against church teaching). Because I'm the only other religious person in our friend group, she mostly has these conversations with me, which can be really draining not only because they're intense, but they fly directly in the face of some of my religious beliefs (I have been careful not to disparage her newfound religion while simultaneously expressing differences in our belief systems).

A lot of this stuff has spilled over into other areas of her life. Because she now has certain religious views on marriage, she's started showing up to Eric's place of work and home unannounced to talk to him about God and their marriage (their divorce finalized two days ago). She acquired Eric's new girlfriend's number and started texting her to 'back off' (side note, the new girlfriend is not the same person with whom Eric had the emotional affair). She stopped taking her medication and seeking therapy because she felt it 'separated her from God'. She is about to get fired because she stopped going to her Sunday work shifts in order attend services and didn't communicate this to her superiors. She is 10K in debt from (among other things) church donations. 

At my bachelorette party, Dayna brought human-like puppets so that she and I could practice a televised puppet show that she thinks we are supposed to do together for the 'Glory of God' (never mind that she never communicated this to me and I have an intense phobia of dolls - my other bridesmaids and I spent four hours trying to convince her to leave them in the car). Finally, during the bachelorette party, she made my very pregnant sister stand in 95F+ degree heat so that she could have a twenty-minute conversation with a complete stranger about her mega church. She also told my sister (who is not religious and does not attend church) that the only people who don't go to church are people who suffer from trauma and brokenness.

For these reasons, I think I need to end my friendship with Dayna, but I don't want to kick her while she's down. I realize that a lot of her obsession with this new religion is tied to her struggles with suicidal ideation and her divorce, but every time I think about Dayna, I fluctuate between intense anger and worry. I'm scared she's going to end up homeless like her mom, but I'm also furious at her immaturity and short-sightedness. I've tried to express my worries to her in the past, but because no one else in our friend group seems to want to also express their frustration, my concerns have fallen mostly on deaf ears. The one time we tried to organize a group intervention to specifically address her stalking of Eric and his new girlfriend, I was the only one who showed up and actually had a conversation with her about it (and, frankly, she just played dumb, so the conversation got nowhere).

Most of my conversations about Dayna (when Dayna is not present) involve me apologizing to my family for Dayna's behavior towards them, creating plans with our other friends for how to prevent Dayna from hurting herself or venting about Dayna's most recent actions. None of these are healthy and none of these make me a good friend. I know I need to do better by Dayna, but I don't know what actions to take.

If I were in Dayna's shoes, I know I'd need friends in my corner to help me, but I'm exhausted and tired of being Dayna's babysitter. What do I do? What kinds of conversations do I need to be having with Dayna? Is it unreasonable to tell Dayna that, until she starts seeking professional help again, we can't be friends (this was suggested to me by my fiancé, who is very worried about my own mental health in relation to Dayna - my last three therapy sessions were focused almost solely on Dayna and how stressed I am about her). How can I be a good friend to Dayna while also saving my own sanity?",05Aug2019,6

516,"Throwaway account, obviously. 

I have a 3 bedroom flat in a densely populated urban area. Earlier this summer, a guy moved out. We're looking to replace him and on a recommendation from a personal friend, we talked with ""John"" about maybe moving into the empty room. He's nice, seems like we'd get along personality wise, he likes that there's always cat buddies around to hang out with. 

I'll give him points for honesty, he's had a history and he's upfront about it. Hasn't been on a lease in about 5 years. He's had struggles with depression, anxiety, alcohol abuse, in and out of treatment centers more than once. He's in a ""good place"" currently. In that, a stable full time retail job (had it for 2 years) and is moving out of a halfway house. Has a decent cocktail of behavioral  Doesn't have much material wealth, but could afford the rent / utilities. 

I work in digital marketing, I'm at the office M-F typically, and I have to get up pretty early in the morning. My current roommate, ""Kevin,"" works from home in a similar industry, web support stuff, though he sometimes works weekends, too. We *can* afford the place just the 2 of us, but I don't think either of us *want* to. It's still cheaper than living alone, which was the whole point. Neither of us are clean and living types, and this is not a dry house, and we have no interest in making it a dry house. We're very basic 30 something bachelor bitches. I'm really into the craft brew scene and ""Kevin"" does bar trivia and evening cocktails while I'm having a beer. 

New applicant, ""John,"" has not... kicked the habit. He know his limits, or says he does, and believes he can drink a bit, smoke a bit of weed, and have it not be a problem. I have known alcoholics in my time and some of them really do need a hard ""not a drop"" because they have impulse control deficiencies. Others just need to avoid certain scenes, social pressures, and others still just had to learn that blacking out a lot is dumb and they eventually stopped. There's no knowing which version of alcoholic ""John"" is and we have to make this decision pretty quickly. 

I've already thought about entering into a non-binding roommate agreement letter. He's an adult and we'll treat him like one (ie, not policing his behavior day-to-day) but if he does start to overdo it, there's at least a roadmap of next steps. 

I'll reiterate that I met ""John"" via a close personal friend and that recommendation carries a lot of weight; enough that I'm strongly considering it. Without this vouching, I'd probably pass. But I do trust my friend's judgement.

520," 

Hello guys  
i live on an overbearing house although i'm being able to break my chains and live freely!  
I'm  mostly living with them because of their financial situation. My dad is  not getting paid well and he got fired few months ago, i'm mostly  helping them and being with them in case something goes wrong.

I  had few problems (some still occuring), but i learnt how to deal with  them and manage the expectations of my mom, which is the main problem,  and live my life freely! She speaks a lot if i come home later, if i  stay most of the day at my gf house, if i spend too much (in her eyes).  But i simply ignore everything! I'm living, which is what i want.

I  contribute monthly with 2 cards that i get from my job to help buy food  (around 1000 coins in my country \[brazilian money\]), and i give those 2  cards so they can buy food, and also i end up buying whatever i want in  the supermarket with those cards as well!

My  girlfriend raised the question to me: ""aren't you being too generous?  She doesn't think about you when she calls you, texts you to come back  home... shouldn't you stop and get one of the cards for you?"" (she being  my mom).

Am i being too generous (ending up being a fool)?",05Aug2019,1
521,"Ive been working full time and saving instead of going to school at least for now with the goal of saving enough to pay off my college (so i don’t have to take out loans) and in the mean time trying to mold my ideas of what I want to do.

522,"Hi all!

Moved into current neighborhood 2 months ago. Next door neighbors just had a baby. We saw them going out for a walk with baby the other day. We haven't really interacted with them all that much. They seem to value privacy, but I thought it might be nice to just give them a card. However, I don't want to seem creepy.

How should I proceed?",05Aug2019,947
523,"I am a software developer. I was a late starter with my undergraduate work. I earned my BS in computer science at 30. I earned my MS in Information Systems at 33. I got my first job as a junior developer when I was 28 during my sophomore year. After two years, I was promoted to an associate developer and given a raise. It was the most money I had ever earned, being from a poor rust-belt state. At that time, I thought I was doing great. 

Then life happened. I went through a nasty divorce and custody battle. I got remarried and planned to move with my new wife cross-country. She has family there and works in healthcare, so her salary will be much better. We now reside in the SF Bay area. I put in my notice with my employer, and they offered me a position as a contractor working 100% remote on the same projects. I thought that was gracious of them and accepted, thinking when I get to CA at least I won't have to look for a job right away. I know that CA is working on laws to have companies not classify workers as contractors if they should be employees, but I don't want to start anything regarding this since I feel the company went out of their way to keep me on the team.

I am now 34. I have spent two years working with this company as an employee and four working as a contractor. Since I've become a contractor, I have had no raises and no annual reviews, things I would expect as an employee. I discovered that my salary was decent for my home state, but well below median for my new home. I decided to see if I could land a new job. Once I got an offer, my plan was to talk with my employer about my contract and see if they would be willing to beat the offer. If not, I would ask them if I could keep the contract and move to part-time work in the evenings, giving me two sources of income. If neither was possible, then at least I had a new job with a better salary.

The SF Bay area is home to a lot of tech companies, and I've been doing screening interviews on lots of developer positions. I've gotten a lot of rejections. One company brought me in for in-person interviews, and unfortunately I got rejected after a total of four rounds of interviews.

I've had the privilege to sit down recently with a small group of software engineers who have either worked for or interned at Facebook. I showed them the projects I've contributed to and my resume looking for feedback. I would love to work for one of the big tech companies here. Even the interns are given a housing allowance and stipend that comes out to be a bit more than my current salary. 

The feedback I received from the group were that a few things were working against me:

1. Most big tech companies have to comb through thousands of applications for any position/internship. One of the items they use to reduce that number is to start with people who have degrees from the top 10 or top 25 schools. My alma mater is definitely not in that list. At least 2 schools near the SF Bay Area will be on that list (Stanford, UC Berkeley) with two more near LA (CIT, UC LA).
2. If you don't have a degree from a top 25 school, then you should have a list of projects you have contributed to that are known in Silicon Valley. Something that has made waves or has become popular with developers. My work projects in the insurance industry are definitely not it.
3. If you don't have contributions to well-known projects, then references from other big tech firms will help. My firm is not a big tech firm.

Some advice I was given:

1. Contribute to projects using different technology stacks. All my professional experience is with .NET and the MS stack, so projects using stacks like MEAN will open up the number of companies I can apply to with relevant experience. This will take 1 to 2 years before companies will count my experience as valid when looking at it on paper. Try to find projects that give my name exposure to other engineers working at big tech firms.
2. Commit to my current stack and get vendor certified. The MCSD certification carries some weight with shops that use .NET and other MS technologies because MS gives them discounts for hiring certified. However, there is also concern that this cert can be obtained with rote memorization of exam dumps and it does not prove skill with the technology.
3. Check with top rated schools to see if I can get a degree from them. I already have a BCS and MSIS from a small unknown school. Stanford or UC Berkeley would be a good refresher, expose me to more technologies than I had before, and offer much better career services support.

I expressed concern about my age as I'm not the typical mid-20s engineer, and I was told that should be ranked below the other items. With what I bring to the table now, I should expect offers only from small established firms working on small projects.

I was wondering if the software engineering community on Reddit had any additional advice or comments?",05Aug2019,0
524,"When I was in 8th grade The was this girl I used to named Mia. Everyday on the bus ride home she would sit and talk to me. We weren’t dating but we weren’t just friends either. I would describe the relationship as “romantic lite.” Anyways I’m in high school now and so is she, we also both ride the same bus. The really awkward part about it is that after the summer break the first year we met, we just stopped talking. I don’t know why. It’s like the entire year before just never happened. And it’s like whenever we look at each other it’s so surreal. Her gaze is extremely empty, it’s just a completely emotionless look. And when we pass each other in the hallway it’s like she sees me but I don’t know what she’s thinking. My point is that I don’t know what to do. I still have feelings for her but she has a boyfriend and seems to have made new friends. It just makes me feel like I was tossed aside for being too boring or she was wanting me to ask her out but I kept her waiting too long, idk.

526,"Hi! So, my uncle, we’ll call him Mike, because that’s his name.

Mike is a single, 40 yr old man who lives in a tiny basement apartment. In addition to being the typical bachelor, he’s also a photographer and has a YouTube channel where he posts comedy skits.

But the thing is, I worry about him.

He’s a really good person, and he’s very talented and I love him to bits, but I worry that he gets lonely all alone in his apartment.

He always comes over to my grandmas house to just sit around and take naps, so I feel like he just needs to be around another living thing.

I thought about convincing him to get a pet. He doesn’t really like cats (though I’m convinced he just has to meet the right cat), and I doubt his apartment allows dogs.


I want to convince him to get a cat, make him watch a bunch of cat adoption shows/videos, drag him to a cat shelter that’s by my house (Cat Nap From The Heart, it’s a super great place in Illinois if you’re looking to adopt!), etc.


Am I being crazy? I feel crazy, but I just care a lot, I don’t think he’s going to get a long term girlfriend (or boyfriend?) anytime soon, so I want him to have someone to keep him company in his apartment.

Any advice on the matter???



This is his photography website btw!! His YouTube channel is Gnut65!

527,"So, to begin I'd like to ask anyone with what they consider a decent coping strategy to drop it below! I'm going fairly well but there's still some parts in life where I'd benefit from a larger toolbox.

What's my cause? 

It was a close relationship, lasting over 10 years at this stage! Few rocky patches here and there but I was chipper and content!

We'd home from pretty much highschool friends to a relationship and progressed from there, getting our own home, becoming self employed and even getting married at the start of this year. 

We went through some tough things, such as my partners mental health including chronic depression which lasted a number of years and involved a couple of visits to the hospital to sort out the ol ""Keep the blood in the body dear"".

It was hard at times, but I'm proud of how I was throughout all that. 

With that said I am not perfect, and between working hard as, my partner being unemployed still keeping financial pressure etc I focused a lot of my free time on myself and winding down. Generally of gaming or Lego etc. While I spent time with my partner I'd have to admit it wasn't really fairly balanced. It also wasn't bad enough or an excuse for what came next. 

Earlier this year, shortly after getting married, my partner admitted under her own steam that she's been cheating on me with someone else... For a lot of years. 

The two key points of why I didn't pickup on it is it was a friend of hers dating back from before our relationship, and in a trusting relationship you have... Trust. 

From the information that followed the cheating was over the course of many years, just shy of the start of our relationship...

Over 5 months of trying to process, comprehend and therapy I finally came to the mental state where I made a reasonable decision to end the relationship, in as amicable way as possible and focused on maintaining that amicability to date while handing the separation. (I want to be able to look back and be proud of the path I've taken despite the hand I've been delt).

My trouble still is that, while triggers are reduced between the help I've gotten so far, the separation taking away that uncertainty and so on, there's still times like showers or long drives where the mind wonders. 

I do my best to, not avoid, but to reduce the impact of those down times. I keep busy, work, and focusing on enjoying some of my interests. Connecting with the few friends I've got again, living at home once more with my folks which is actually a positive to have that company all the time during this time. 

What I'm asking I guess is, to any who might have been through something similar, do you have anything that you learnt through the ordeal that made for a good coping strategy or even just something you wish you knew earlier?

Any and all answers and replies are greatly appreciated.

Thanks for reading, -cm",05Aug2019,3
529,"Keeping this as vague as possible for obvious reasons. I work for quite a large technology company and I was recently promoted to a trainer role. 

A new group started recently and I was assigned the task of training them. This was quite a long period of training, about 3 months or so. 

I had a deputy trainer with me who approached it very differently to me. She went for drinks with the team, had lunch with them, was generally more social than I was. But she was giving incorrect advice and landed us in hot water quite a few times. I confronted her about this and she just became aggressive so I had to report her to her manager. 

I ended up training the team myself for the final 2 months and some of the women on the team who had become quite close to my deputy trainer instantly took a disliking to me because of this. I don’t think they understood why the other trainer was dismissed and I have overheard them calling me a bitch etc in relation to it.

We work in the same office and every morning now when I come into work I say hello but this specific group of women ignore me. They have a group conversation on our work system that every other woman in the office is included in but I am not, they arrange social outings and talk about them next to me but never invite me.

One of them slammed a door in my face last week as we were walking out of the office.

I’m in my early twenties and I don’t really know how to deal with this behaviour. I feel quite uncomfortable in work.

Has anyone else experienced something similar or has any advice on what to do?",05Aug2019,1
530,"I'm going into my fourth year, but honestly I think my current major, psychobiology is total bullshit. I can barely sit through any of the psych heavy classes because they're boring and I find them pointless. However, at the same time, I'm really bad at any of the heavier STEM majors so that ruled those out too. Ultimately, I plan on applying to medical school, but I'm terrified in the case that if I graduate, I'd be stuck with a degree called psychobiology and especially as I don't plan on becoming continuing school to be a therapist should I not go to med school, (I truly don't have the patience nor the personality for it and tbh I'm not really into the social science careers), I'm worried that I picked the wrong major.

Essentially, any of the other life science majors are open. But I really need to decide, like today, because I have to decide if I'm taking the weeder course for my current major this quarter. I was thinking maybe Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, but tbh any of the life science majors that sounded cool to me are known for being ridiculously difficult and I know people that needed multiple gap years before being considered for medical school. I guess another benefit of picking EEBio is that there isn't a weeder course per say as notorious as the one for my current major. But I'm really scared on what I should do because I have a few hours to decide.",05Aug2019,1
531,"I’ll give you a short description of the situation. So there’s this girl that I’ve known for a little more than 10 years, we met because our parents often meet up because they are close friends (they live about half an hour away from us). I’ve never really seen her as anything but a really good friend. When I’m with her I feel like I’m the best version of myself that I can possibly be. Lately things changed and I think I fell in love with her, when I’m not there and she’s going to a party I’m always so scared she’ll find another boy and she’ll just drop me like it’s nothing (although we aren’t even in a relationship), I think about her all the time and I really can’t see a future without her (sorry this sounds so cliché but it really feels like that).

535,"This isn't advice for me but for my housemate as she doesn't use reddit, so thought i would make a post for her.

This situation has been going on for about 3 weeks now and is continually getting worse. My housemate started working at her current company in February as an assistent for aforementioned boss. The first months were great, with the boss and my housemate getting on extremely well. My housemate would often say that her boss would say things along the lines of: ""we make a great team"" and ""i really enjoy us being friends"" etc. Even inviting her to sushi evenings and dinners and to go to Italy for a weekend together. 

Now my housemate has started dating a male colleague who works in a different department but at the same company about 2-3 months ago. As it is getting relatively serious, my housemate thought it was important to let her boss know that she was seeing this guy as the boss is friends with him. (As a quick side note: the company allows colleagues to date each other, in fact the boss's husband also works at the company). Since then the boss has made sure to constantly berate my housemate for everything she does and nitpick at things she's doing wrong. If my housemate leaves work ""early"" because of a family emergency the boss will get annoyed, say that she is being unprofessional and say that she finds it terrible that my housemate could leave in the middle of a busy period. While the boss herself goes on holiday practically every two weeks and frequently schedules appointments during work hours. Today, the boss filed a complaint with her own boss about my housemate stating that she is on her phone ""too much"". My housemate says that she's on her phone because her boss is actually texting her all day while the boss is out of office. 

Understandably, my housemate has come to the end of her wits now and really wants the situation to stop. She has come home crying many times in the last two weeks and i've been trying to help her as much as i can but i'm not really experienced with these kinds of situations.

My advice to my housemate was to go to talk to HR about the problem but that has hit a bit of a wall as the HR person who oversees the department is friends with my housemate's boss. What could she do to improve the situation? Is there anyone else she can talk to within the company about this?

TLDR: my housemate's boss has been making work difficult for my housemate cause she's jealous of her relationship with another colleague?",05Aug2019,1
536,"I'm from the United States and I moved overseas a few months ago to teach English. I went through a company that set up an interview with this school. Interview was great, contract was good, everything went smoothly. 
I arrived in the foreign country, started work at the school and it was nothing like the interview made it seem. The age group was different than what was agreed upon, the teaching philosopy they claim to follow is not what they practice, and the principle doesn't even speak English. 
There are veteran teachers who have been there for several years and they control everything. They manipulate you and make it seem as if you are in control but micromanage every little thing in lessons. Their understanding of how children develop is all wrong. It might be a cultural thing and also learning English as a second language, not quite sure on that. 
The turnover rate is high amongst the other foreign staff. A contract is one year and only from what Ive heard through the grapevine, rarely does anyone stay for more than a year. The teachers I work with directly are mean, they make condescending comments to the children in a tone that seems ""nice"" but their words are hurtful. These young children haven't a clue on what they are saying but I sure do. Why work with children if they're these horrible things you call them? 
I know I'm not perfect and I sure as heck have a lot to learn as an educator but I know this is not right. I graduated university, have experience working with children, went back to college to further my education in working with children in a more specific field to pursue grad school down the road. 
I stress myself out, can't sleep, dream about these people. Ultimately I know it is up to me on how I let them inpact me, I can't control them and I can only control my behavior and actions. But I just cant keep going along with this when I know deep down this is not developmentally appropriate practice for these kiddos. The teachers tell you to let them know if you have any issues or need help but they don't appear to be genuine. Sure I should trust their words but as soon as I question anything, this one specific teacher, conpletely changes their demeanor from mean to even meaner.
I definitely struggle with self confidence and anxiety but the teacher speaks to you in a way that makes you feel like a real idiot! Im a grown adult and this person makes me feel like this, you can imagine how the children might feel when spoken to in that way.
I don't know what to do. The principal could care less, they only care about $. I feel like if I even mention anything to my supervisor about my concerns it will ruin the rest of my time at this school. I can't just quit, I have a lot of money invested in this, my family has helped with this transition tremendously. And I don't want to quit! Most days I smile and nod and continue to do what I think is best for the children emotionally, developmentally, and educationally. I need help.
Wow didnt think I had a whole lot to say.. sorry for jumping around.

538,"My mom is very religious. She also has (I'm sure) some mental condition because while she refuses to go get anything checked out, she has huge panic attacks and mental breakdowns where she escalates everything and tries inflicting harm on herself. 

Our family is also pretty dysfunctional but everyone is super religious and a girl moving out on her own is seen as bad. While she has been open to the idea because my college is super far, she also wants me come home every single weekend and I really don't want to. In fact, I don't want to come back once I leave. I want to visit on my own terms and have my privacy. I just know she'll have a meltdown and show up whenever once I refuse to come for just one weekend.

My 3 older sisters are no help either. They're just as religious and not very understanding at all. I went out with friends yesterday at around 3pm. I told her I was going out. We decided to see a movie at a drive in at 9:30 pm. I also texted her this. She starts texting me things like ""When are you coming?"" ""Why are you going so late?"" ""It's almost 12 where are you?"" Even though I told her. She does this all the time. I come home and she yells at me for being out late. She's skeptical about who I'm with and said  ""I dont know who you're going with or what you're doing"". She also told me to be ashamed of myself. 

I wanted to move out with her permission so it wouldn't be as hard on her. I don't know how else to do it without damaging my relationship with my family because they'll forever hate me if I go off without their permission. If I do move out with it, its only under the condition that she picks me up and takes me home every single weekend and holiday.

But last time I was seeing someone that had a UTI, she got distant, and I later found out she was cheating. 
By no means am I saying that my new girlfriend is cheating. In fact, I trust that she isnt.

546,"I(20M) met a girl(20F) on tinder. She also told me she was bisexual but was previously in a relationship for 3.5 years with her gf. I was seeing her for 5 months and I really liked spending time with her. Every time we hung out we would hang do 4-12 hours and would see each other 1-4 times a week.

She did tell me a little about her ex girlfriend. Basically I don't like her because the girl I was talking to said that her and her ex used to do molly a lot and she think she has a ""speech impediment"" because she did it so much. She also said she never new what she was taking wasn't necessarily pure and probably could've had other stuff in it.

However, she was sometimes spotty answering my texts(taking over 12 hours to 2 days sometimes) and that bothered me a lot.

We never had sex but we did kiss a few times when we were drunk. The first time we hung out and drank was when I knew her for 2-3 months and I told her I liked her and she got all blushy and said ""even like as a girlfriend"" and I said ""yes, if you wanted that"" then she said ""I'm just not used to having a guy not just want to stick their hand down my pants and the last guy that did like her like that died of a heroin overdose"" she told me about her brother and his girlfriends heroin problem and how they went to rehab together for it, then she told me ""I drink too much and want to find sober things to do"". 

Later that night we were watching a movie and the night was winding down and she was talking about how the first year of her relationship was good and the sex was good but then her gf wouldn't even kiss her to bed. She also said she was seeing her girlfriend again because her dad died. She also told me she's never had sex with a guy either and her cherry wasn't popped yet. Eventually we went to bed and I was laying next to her and I said ""so your girlfriend wouldn't even kiss you to bed?"" And she said ""no"" and I said""I know someone who would"" and she said ""I just don't know how far I want to go"" and I said ""I can kiss you without having sex with you"" and then we kissed.

The next morning I left and I texted her the next day and I didn't get an answer. So I texted her again asking if everything was okay and she said that she didn't even know that I had slept over and she said she blacked out and she said she never blacked out before and that she wish the night never happened. 

However, that night she was drinking water in-between drinks and we even talked about drinks that made us black out before.

We drunk kissed a few other times when I went to her parents cabin with her too. Also, one time we were at the bar doing karaoke and we went to the bathroom hallway to make out and k told her I loved her and she said ""what did you say"" and I said ""I might be kind of drunk but I said I love you"" and she said I love you back. She also said ""the real you comes out when you're drunk"".

Anyway, another time we were hanging out sober and I walked her back to her house after dropping her off and I asked for a hug and I got one and I asked for a kiss and she rejected that offer.

Other times we were sober she had called me boring but that always confused me because she would still want to hang out with me. There were nights she even called ""perfect"" like when I took her to see Travis Scott in concert and then dinner.

She also was telling me that all of her friends have told her that she's not bi and that she's gay and she told them she's bi.

Anyway, the day after we did kareoke I helped her move out of her place and I was kind of getting sick of the mixed signals. She was going to rode home with her brother that she lived with but they left before her so I drove her back.

However, in the car ride home I broke down and told her ""I don't feel like I'm a priority in your life and I feel like you only like me when you're drunk, and maybe we shouldn't drink together"" and she said ""I don't know I feel like I can talk with my friends better"" and I said ""but do you hang out with your friends 3 times a week for 7 hours and always hold a conversation with them the whole time?"" And she said ""no"" then there was a long pause and she started to tear up and said ""this feels like a breakup"".

She then was asked me if this was my first relationship type thing and I told her yes. And that really surprised her and I told her that most of the time I meet people and the farthest it goes is that people just call me funny.

When I pulled up to her house she sat and said ""I don't know if I like men yet"" she also said being overbearing is kind of a turn off. Then she asked if I could still be friends and I said ""I like you too much"" and she said ""just make it home safe"".

I waited six days to text her and I told her I was sorry she saw me like that and asked her if she wanted to go to a park and she said ""I think it's best we stop talking"". She the didn't block me but removed me from her friends list on Snapchat, removed me but didn't block me on Instagram. However, she showed up.in my subscriptions on Snapchat still and I could still see her story so I knew I wasn't blocked so I did something dumb.

I sent her a text that explained how my mom was an alcoholic and did a lot of dumb things while drunk and that I was excited to find fun sober things to do with her. She responded with something along the lines of ""you're annoying, I'm blocking you, goodbye"".

So I waited a month and texted her again telling her that I was sorry I made some extreme assumptions about her and I was worried that she was doing Molly with her ex again and if that was wrong that I'm sorry. But idk if she ever saw that or not.

So basically I'm just wondering if there is anything I can do to fix this now. And now that I have been away for a little bit I would be cool with being just friends. Or if there is any amount of time that could help me wait and then try to reach out to her or if there isn't anything I can do. I really do like her and I feel like I hurt her but might've burnt the bridge",05Aug2019,2

I have to work though during the summer and everyone already had vacation plans with their hometown friends and family. We said ""no problem, we can plan to go on September"". The problem is that the destination we wanted to go seemed not cheap enough. They wanted to change destination and they made me make the plans (where we are going to stay, how much we're going to spend there etc). Of course it was much more expensive where they wanted to go. I got tired of making plans and them taking them to the trash. As a result one of my friends told me that we should go on our own because the others had problems with the plans. They told us beforehand that if they couldn't afford it, it wouldn't be a problem. 
One week passed and as I was finalising the travel plans and my friend told me out of the blue that they decided to go to Berlin without me on November because it will be cheaper. They very well know that I have exams then and just decided to ditch me.

I don't know what the problem is. I always made sure that I never ditched them when I got a bf. I always made time to hang out. And I stayed in touch even if I work 10/24 and I have to study on top of that.

Now i’m deployed with the army and she said the reason is because we didn’t do enough foreplay and we never did enough to get into the mood.

It makes sense, i’m not that great looking of a guy, and she’s beautiful in every way. People have told me to break up because they think she’s probably cheating. She isn’t that type of person, and there’s reasons i don’t believe that. But are they right that i should break up? Also to add, she won’t let me give her head, which is weird.

I brought a green cheek conure back in February, and my partner HATES her. He’s just started a new job that will involve him working long shifts and doesn’t want to deal with the bird making noise when he’s home. He’s threatening to make the ultimatum that it’s him or the bird. He thinks he can just move out but if he leaves I will end the relationship, I don’t want to live separately. 
I can understand the noise issue, but every attempt at problem solving I’ve tried has been disregarded. I’ve asked to move her downstairs so he won’t be able to hear her when he’s in bed but that’s a no. 
I really love my partner, he’s someone I genuinely want to spend the rest of my life with- but I also made a long term commitment to my bird when I brought her, and really love her- it would kill me to be forced to rehome her. I also don’t think it’s fair that I should be bullied into an ultimateum. I’d never do this to him.

557,"so i’m currently in atlanta weather, which is nearly 90 degrees and i’m fucking freezing, shivering. i’ve been clean from painkillers a few days here and there in the past but every time I couldn’t get any, I’d just smoke a ton of weed to help, like a gram of concentrate in just a couple days. the reason i’m quitting weed too is because it was always a crutch, plus every time I was on painkillers (i’d dose 4 times a day), I would also smoke a lot because the combo was bliss. 

so weed just makes me crave opiates so much since I always was on them together. i want to start smoking again but i want to wait a couple weeks so i don’t get intense cravings for painkillers. anyway, sorry for the rambling.

560,"Hey, this post is a rough one. 

I received a phone call today that my first cousin (my dads niece) died this morning and they have no idea how yet. They’re transporting her body to where my aunt lives. This already just sucks because she was really young with no health problems but the reason I’m coming on here is I have absolutely no idea how to tell my father. Here’s why. 

My fathers whole blood related family is dead besides me including his mother 2003, father 2006, and only brother in 2010 to a drunk driver. This last one really killed him and sent him into a spiral. However things had been looking up until late last year when my dad suffered a double stroke and complications after with his health. He has recovered pretty well physically with just some limited mobility on his right side but his mental health has taken a dive. He has been admitted three times to the hospital for psych issues and tried to commit suicide once. Nobody would take him after the attempt because he wasn’t “actively suicidal” within hours of the attempt. He’s not cognitively 100% there anymore and it’s really hard because he’ll get really worked up over small things. He’s been getting a lot better, where we don’t have to be around him 24/7 but he still struggles with things. 


This just happened and I don’t even know anything about it but my aunt hasn’t told him yet bc she didn’t know how he was mentally, which is good because I don’t know how he’ll take this.  In the coming days I’m assuming I’ll have to drive us down to where she’s from and transporting him let alone after telling him is going to be a shit show. 


I guess my question is, should I wait to tell him until I have more information about her death and the funeral arrangements and can spend time with him alone? I’m still grieving myself and need some time for myself let alone trying to keep him from going off the deep end. I am off from work today but I can’t take off an insane amount of time to go to the funeral and the time before to make sure he’s ok. God I don’t know what to do. Help. Should I wait until I get more info even if that means not telling him right away?",05Aug2019,1
562,"

I can be private about my issues and I always seem 'okay' and I am a good listener and willing to make time for my friends -- but I feel like one friend in particular has taken advantage of that. She had an ex-boyfriend (I also had a boyfriend at the time) and their relationship was pretty toxic. In other words, the universe seemed to be against them in every way possible. Not sure if any of you guys have been in my shoes, but it is incredibly exhausting hearing about your friend's toxic relationship, featured with a dose of their unlimited arguments and negative aspects on how she feels about him, not to mention, toxic and ugly things were said to each other and he didn't really seem to respect me much at all which was a massive eye-roll, but I always gave her advice and she spoke about him non-stop, but I listened. Seriously, she would somehow mention him in any topic within 0.2 seconds.  


Fast forward to the summer, we both went through break-ups around the same period of time, and she wanted to call and discuss for us to go on holiday and heal. I agreed to call in a couple of hours, and I needed some time (for obvious reasons) alone to grieve my ex as I was still quite emotional. I also had plans to go to the shop, but I had to get ready to go to the beach with my other best friend so I didn't even manage to do my own errands. She then starts going off on me saying how next time, I should let her know if I'm unavailable because she's been waiting for me. I couldn't believe what I was hearing, especially since I only went through a break-up yesterday. I rightfully stood my ground and she texted me apologising, saying nobody was replying to her messages that day and she felt lonely so she was on edge but I was still in shock, especially since she basically took her anger out on me (I am not a punching bag and I refuse to be one) but forgave her. Then, she texts me to confirm if we're still going on holiday as she needs to revise her schedule and I said sorry, no with a polite small explanation and she just says 'ok'.

We don't talk for days, and then she calls me (but I missed it) and she said she messaged her ex (even though I said don't do it) and he ignored her and she was in shock. We haven't contacted in days on any platform, our last form of communication seemed off and you're expecting me to fix your issues and pat your back with no consideration of my situation?

Time passes, she calls me and she's crying on FaceTime. I was watching a trashy reality TV show that was on live (yes, it was Love Island) but I'm not the type of person who can lock off someone crying. She said she found out her ex was with someone else and I gave her advice, insisting she needs to remove him off all social medias and delete his number. She was thankful for my support and asked me to call/check on her every morning (please, a reminder, I'm also going through a break-up too but this seemed to be forgotten about) to check on her as the mornings are hard. For obvious reasons, I did not do this. I have a life of my own, nor do I even get a glimpse of that energy from her.

I just feel so emotionally disconnected. It's been about 4 months since their break-up and sent me a 5 minute video of her talking about a TV show we both like and then discussing her break-up with a quick 'oh but how are you doing?' and continued rambling on about how she wanted to do some sort of ritual to burn her ex-boyfriend's stuff but her other friend was unavailable to go. She also sent me about an 1,000 word essay of how she wants to be famous but she's worried about the music industry and how toxic and shallow it is. The next day, she quoted her message again to me. It's been about 3 days and I just don't have the energy to reply. I feel like I'm a walking problem solver but I am also human. I do plan to discuss my feelings with her, but I'm not seeing her face-to-face until late September.

It sucks because I'm living with her next year in university, and I just feel so emotionally disconnected and above all, she is my best friend.

TL;DR: Best friend and I went through a break-up, she got mad at me because I failed to call her at the scheduled time (I was crying and upset bc I broke up with my ex the day prior), she apologies and we don't speak for days, she messages me only because things are going wrong on her end, bombards me with messages that are solely about her, I feel suffocated and unconsidered as I am 'the strong friend' and I'm living with her next year and it's too expensive to live alone.",05Aug2019,1
564,"Hi everyone! Always been a big fan of reddit, hoping that this awesome community can spare some time to offer some much needed advice. (Throwaway account for obvious reasons). 

  
Sorry a bit of a long post. TLDR; at the bottom .

Went on a 2 week road trip with a friend about 6 months ago. One night, in this town 6 hours away from home we went out for some drinks and I met this girl. We got on really well, like really well and I ended up going back to her place where we had some fun. We exchanged numbers the next morning and kept in touch after I got back home. We got on, but we both knew it wouldn't work because of the distance. 

A few weeks later I got a text from her to tell me that she was pregnant, the condom must have broken and her pill hadn't worked - I know, what are the chances?! I asked if they could be anyone else's but she assured me that they were definitely mine.

Just as I was recovering from the shock of it all, she announces after the 12 week scan that she's not expecting one baby - but two!! I didn't believe her at first, that is until she showed me the scan photo, I thought that this must have been some kind of joke. It also gave me a chance to see the age of the babies to see if the dates match up with when I saw her - they do.

Anyway, she's currently about 2 months away from giving birth to twins, we've spoken since and realised that we have different ambitions and values in life so we don't want to be a couple. She's moved back in with her parents so that she can afford to look after them.  We don't get on that well anymore and are currently only being friendly for the sake of the children and her mum and dad don't want to even acknowledge me (understandably). 

Up to now, it has all been out of my control, but I'm now coming to a point where I need to make a decision as to whether I uproot my entire life where I currently am and move hours away so that I can be a part of my children's lives.

By moving, I will have to give up my entire support network (friends &amp; family), everyone who needs me for support and my career that I've spent 6 years working hard towards and I'm finally in a place where I enjoy what I do. I will be moving to somewhere where the only people who know me, dislike me. It will be difficult on me physically and mentally, it will also be very lonely as I will be either working or looking after my children - there won't be anytime for me. 

I feel like I should be there in my children's lives but I'm worried that without any friends or family around me, I will suffer mentally being so lonely, I want to make sure that I'm looking after myself first. I also want to protect myself by staying where I am, but that means living with the potential guilt of not being there for them.

I have asked her opinion on if she wants me around and she's said that it's completely up to me.

Any advice or other options would be so helpful as this has been the most stressful few months of my life. Any help would be great, especially if you know somebody who has been in a similar situation.

TLDR; Got a girl pregnant with twins who lives 6 hours away, and we don't want to be together romantically. Need to decide whether I uproot my entire life and move away from my friends, family and career to be in my children's lives in a town where I will know nobody and have no job. Or do I turn my back and look after myself first as nobody else will. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",05Aug2019,0

567,"I run a discord server for members of my college's anime club, which I created to shitpost weird stuff without getting put on timeout constantly.  There are about 10 people in our circle of weirdos and we all get along pretty well. 

Early this summer my friend S broke up with his girlfriend of 1 month, M (who is also in the group), after a political debate got particularly nasty. and since then has spiraled into a mess of depression and constantly talking about how miserable he is, and how much he wants to die.  He really hasn't handled the breakup well AT ALL (she wanted space and time to think, he bombarded her with messages anyway).  He went to a professional and was diagnosed with pretty severe ADHD, which he's trying to get under control.  But the problem is, he hasn't stopped the depression posting.  In the semi-private mods chat, he'll openly moan and groan about how much seeing M posting about stuff makes him sad, and on several occasions has hijacked other people's rants in our ""emotional support"" channel to be about him, my posts included.  The rest of our group has tried to be supportive, and those of us who are nearby to him try to get him to come hang out and be social.  We all understand how rough depression and its symptoms are, and nearly everyone in the group has suffered it at least a little before.

The problem is, at least for me, that his ""woe is me"" messages are uncannily similar to the way my narcissist father speaks, so it's becoming incredibly grating to have to hear it in what had been a safe place.  My dad is low-key abusive, so to hear it makes me incredibly on edge and makes being online way less fun than it used to be.  It also briefly made M so uncomfortable that she left the group for a few weeks.  Other members of the group have reached out to me to ask what happened, since the details of the breakup stayed within the mods chat, and they've agreed that the posts are getting excessive and annoying.  I obviously can't help unless he wants it, and he's choosing to drink instead of be productive or active, so that option is out.  

So now I'm not sure what to do, other than politely and privately ask him to stop, or try and semi-publicly shut it down within the mods chat.  And even then I'm not sure I'd be able to do that without him just saying screw it and bailing from the group and from anime club.  I've been where he is before, and I think when I had been there, if my friends had told me to stop complaining about how much I want to die, I think it would have maybe motivated me to do more to help myself, but he's been so weird and death-wishy lately that I'm afraid it would make things worse.",05Aug2019,1

574,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I am a seventeen year old male living with my parents in North Carolina. Growing up, there have been many things that my parents and I disagreed on (this is putting it nicely), and consequently I am trying to become independent from them financially as soon as I possibly can. For the past fifteen months, I've worked a part time job and I have saved almost $7,000. I make about $850 a month. They homeschool me and always have, so they have pretty much complete control on whether or not I get to graduate.

Here is my dilemma. I recently bought a car. I don't trust them, so I wanted it to be in my name. I got my own insurance policy so that it could be in my name, even though mine is more expensive. Now, about a month later, their company is telling them that they have to insure me (their company is USAA) in addition to my own insurance I purchased (through GEICO) and my parents are pretty much telling me I have to pay for both unless I cancel my own insurance and stay just on theirs.

The only things that matter to me are 1) I can continue to own my car completely, and that they can have no way of legally stealing it from me when I bought it or prevent me from leaving them in it after I turn 18 (if I wanted to). And 2) I'd like to save money, not spent a ridiculous amount of money on car insurance.",05Aug2019,1

580,"Hello all...

Long story short... work in the city, have been grafting hard for fifteen years... doing ok for myself, work in tech for a well known company - all I seem to come up against is people that want to side up to me and then stab me in the back when they stand to benefit from a situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Latest example - started a new job... one of the guys that interviewed me is a colleague in my team - during the interview process he was normal, chatty, all smiles - saw him in the office on my first day again all smiles - now he does his best to avoid me, no eye contact etc. Loads of people like that - I've not said or done anything to anyone - ever. Never screwed anyone over... all I've ever done is help people...

Am I being too sensitive or is there cause for concern - how do you even approach someone to talk to them about something like this? This happens in every job... I'm not even a good self promoter, I don't walk around blowing my own trumpet... I just get on with the task in hand...

Any help or advice welcome... fire away with questions... thanks in advance.",05Aug2019,0
581,"I have had this friend for a long time. In the years shes kind of pushed me away for other friends, and that's okay, but she has recently been set in a pattern that she refuses to recognize. She suffers from depression, as do I, and I know it can leaf to self destructive paths but she seems to be going full force with this one. She usually only comes to me when no one else is around or she doesnt like their advice. More or less she likes her shitty feelings and bad decisions to be validated, always turns the conversation onto herself and is overall self absorbed. Several of her other friends have pointed this out to her in as kind and gentle ways as possible and she takes it as a personal attack every time. It has gotten to a point that two of them have just decided they need space from her and her behavior. My friend refuses to recognize her own destructive behavior and I'm trying hard not to step on her toes too much lest she gets worse or even suicidal.

I have convinced her to go to a therapist, but I know she had a habit of skewing the truth to make herself seem better in these bad situations she often makes for herself so I dont know how honest she might be with the therapist. I am concerned because I feel I am now the sole person she is leaning on and if she continues down this path I might get to a breaking point with her as well as we have already agreed (before all of this happened) that we cant be around each other for long periods of time because we become very toxic for one another depressive episodes and I really dont want her to drag me back down into one...

582,"TW: sexual assault, mental illness 

I’ve been suffering from PTSD for a few years now. When I was a teenager, I experienced a number of instances of rape and sexual assault and other kinds of heartache. My teenaged years were marked by these experiences, but I think I want to be done with it. I know that healing is a slow process, and trust me, it has been. 

I’m in a healthy and safe relationship now and I’m going to a really good university. I’ve avoided everything for years though— just pushed it to the back of my mind and carried on. So in a lot of ways I’ve changed and grown, but the mistake of avoiding it all and never getting help is still there. I’m going to start seeing a therapist at school once the semester begins, but I want to start now. Maybe you guys can help me. 

One thing I’ve been very cautious about is social media. Only recently have I posted whatever I want without a fear of who’s going to see it or who knows what about me. I have every person who’s ever hurt me blocked. But this keeps them having power over me. I want to tell my story and I want to stop being afraid, but the only way to stop being afraid is to face your fears. I would never see my rapists in person, but should I unblock them on social media? Like a “fuck it, I don’t care what they think” type of thing. Even if they message me and I freak out, that freak out would be one step closer to never feeling like that again. I’m ready to be happy again.",05Aug2019,1
583,"Not sure if this is the right sub, but anyways... (also, this may be triggering for someone who has an eating disorder)

So I (F20) have never had a problem with my weight, I feel pretty average when it comes to my size, if anything a little overweight, and have no problem with that. I go to the gym when I have access to one (at college) and recently (4ish months ago) became a vegetarian. However it seems like lately, for about a month, that I have no appetite. Sometimes I can go until 3/4 PM without being hungry or eating. And then when I do get hungry, it doesn't take much for me to feel full. I want to clarify that I don't feel I'm anorexic. I don't want to starve myself, I love to eat and love food. My stomach just never feels like I am hungry, if that makes sense

If you are wondering what I eat, I eat (when I'm actually hungry) a lot of salads, veggies, fruit, corn, and cottage cheese/yogurt. I don't snack on processed foods or chips much anymore, although about a year ago I did a lot. The most unhealthy thing I eat is ice cream, which I maybe have twice a week. I probably would guess if I didn't get enough of something it would be protein, but I'm going to start using protein powder when I move in at school. I can't start now because my parents disapprove of me being a vegetarian. But could the lack of protein be causing my problems?

I will literally take any advice. I know  that it is dangerous for me to only eat when I feel hungry, because if I did I would probably only eat once a day. I do force myself to eat when I'm not hungry, but at times it is uncomfortable to do because my stomach feels full. My weight has basically stayed the same and only fluctuates 3ish pounds both ways. I have had other stomach problems and will get cramps twice/three times a week (unrelated to PMS) and occasionally feel uncomfortable after eating.

I have gone to the doctor about this, but they were more concerned with other issues (a torn shoulder) than the ones I wanted to try and get her to address.

If anyone has an advice or tips on things to try I would be super grateful!",05Aug2019,1

585,"***I apologize in advance if my story is very scattered around and messy, I tried my best to write the story to make sense.*** 

I \[15F\] was in my freshman year of high school. In May, my school had formed a video games club. When I joined, I came across a few people that I ended up befriending. One of them \[15M\] ended up becoming my boyfriend. He hid a lot of his real emotions in public eye, and inside had a really, really bad depression. I attempted to help, but no matter what I would say, it would only get worse and worse. I actually contacted my school's counseling office to make an effort to make him feel better, and he was taken to a mental hospital to recover.

I wasn't able to contact him whatsoever at that time, and that was the moment that I no longer had feelings for him. I just felt more free, but maybe that was because I don't enjoy dating in general, and didn't realize that until that moment. I attempted to break off the relationship, but he would constantly call me and message me, and at one point texting ""Give me your mother's phone number, or I will go to your house and make you"". It was almost freakish, and psycho. He made his friends get in a call with him and forced me into the group call to interrogate me and force me to say I was wrong all the time. They called it a ""therapy session"", but all they did was ask me questions that I could not answer without saying, ""I was wrong"", the answer they wanted. I was screaming at them and sobbing hysterically, because of all of my anxiety building up and lashing out on them. My family found out what had been going on, and told me that if I was going to keep talking to them, they would move me to another school.

I realized that talking to them anymore would only make me feel worse about myself, so I blocked all of them and left every group chat that they contact me through. We had formed a Youtube group at the time, and made gaming videos together. They mostly played popular video games and followed what was popular, but I mostly played RPG's and rhythm games. They never appreciated my presence. They made me feel like I was only there so they could make fun of me. Whenever they uploaded a new video with me in it, they would always say ""\_\_\_\_\_\_, you ruined the video"", or ""\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is so annoying, we shouldn't of had her in the video"". When we weren't doing Youtube content, they constantly accused me of horrible actions such as raping my cats, or doing sexy dances on live streams for money. They never called me my real name during our whole friendship, and used names like ""loli"" and ""thot"". Thinking back on them after I left, I remembered I had a group before that would do the same thing to me, and one of my closest friends made me leave them, saying that she did not want me to think that constantly making fun of me was considered friendship.

After the school year, his friends publicly made fun of me on social media, saying they would ""do unimaginable things to me"" and that ""I should have went to the suicide hospital instead of my boyfriend"". After seeing those messages, anxiety had built up to the size of a mountain. My ex was still not over me at the time. Even though he knew all of this was happening, and that I was being harassed online my his best friends, he said ""they're not me, and I don't plan on stopping them from making fun of her"". I had to stop all of my streaming and Youtube plans because of the stress I had from those messages. My past nightmares have only been of them harassing me during school or shooting me in the middle of my classes. What made my vision worse was that most of them actually have a bad school record and did drugs, so they could easily knock me out in a flash or buy a weapon, because they've gotten into fights before. I was also never with the same group of friends for a long time, nobody really wanted to associate with me during school, and rather just talked to me out of pity. I had nobody that I could trust to give me genuine advice. I also lost all of their contact information, so communicating with them would be impossible.

This might be a super immature problem in your eyes, but when school starts, I have to face this problem again. I can't just block them from my life like others can. I'm enclosed in a rectangle building for 7 hours every weekday, and of course, I have to look at their faces. I've lost all motivation. Help me.

TL;DR! - A old group of toxic friends constantly harass me online for breaking off a relationship with an psychotic ex. School is starting next year and I am scared of them beating me up during my classes.",05Aug2019,1

592,"My boyfriend and I just moved last weekend. It’s my first time moving out of my parent’s house except for a 3 month long out of state summer internship 4 years ago when I was in college. We’re renting a house from my mom, which is gorgeous and in a beautiful neighborhood, and since we’re renting from my mom we’re getting an incredible deal, and both of my parents have been extremely helpful in helping us move and getting things we need and very attentive to any maintenance issues we’ve encountered so far.

However, my mom is starting to feel a little overbearing. She has been at our house EVERY SINGLE DAY since we moved in on July 27, typically for hours on end. Sometimes she’s doing something like pulling weeds (the house has a huge garden and neither myself or my boyfriend have much of a green thumb) but other times she’ll be doing things like sorting our laundry or poking though boxes we haven’t unpacked, which frankly feels a bit invasive. Sometimes it feels like she just invents a project for herself so she can come over. For example, she gave me a recipe that I asked for and told me she’s going to come over after work to help me make it, when I’m perfectly capable of doing it myself. It’s not that we don’t appreciate everything she’s doing for us to help us out, but my boyfriend and I have had almost no time to ourselves to relax and enjoy our new place together.

I am coming into my senior year of college and graduating May 2020. I have been working an internship for a town hall with the focus of Finance. I started May 2019 and they want me to work for them during the school year too. It is 50 minutes from my school. The plan is I work two 10 hour days a week since I can only work Tuesday and Thursday. (20hrs a week). I could get a job closer to my school, but it would be something not related to Finance. I don't mind the 50 min commute at all.

I'd be getting paid $12 an hour and driving 50 minutes each way to and from the job two times a week. In these 10 hour days, my boss said I can do homework if needed as long as I am above and beyond with my work. 

Should I find a closer job or stick with this job related to my field?

I don't really know where to begin. I'm 29 years old, I've never known my dad. I gave up ever meeting him when I was in my teens. As time went on I put less and less into any idea of finding him or who he might be. My mom would talk about it from time to time. She was pretty ""active"" when she was younger. She thought my father had been this married man who played in a small time band that she had a polyamorous relationship with his wife and him. But every once in a while she'd mention some other guy that had been a cab driver and would help her get around town. 

My mother was adopted as an infant. She has always wanted to be connected with her biological family. Finding her mother and what not through different services assisting in such searches. A year or so ago she had asked if I was curious about my father. At the time I wasn't but after asking several more times I relented and gave her the green light to search him out. I did the ancestry DNA test as a starting point and my mother took the reins from there. 

A few days ago my mother found someone who shares 70-80% DNA with me. Making them the closest relation I have on my father's side. Through a different service that finds family members through Facebook profiles my mom found a connection between this person and the cab driver she knew back when I was born.

My mom made contact with the cab driver. This person I share the DNA with is the Aunt of the Cab driver. He remembers her. And told her to have me contact him. My mom is certain that this man is my father. 

My mom has been single and struggled to provide for me and my sister, she also dealt with alcoholism which resulted in our relationship through my teens being tumultuous at best. I think this search and contact is mostly driven by her guilt.

I dont know what I would gain from knowing him. I dont need any support. I dont know that I missed or am missing anything by not knowing him. I just honestly dont know what to do.

603,"First off I’m 23, male. I recently started going to a trade school and I’m having a hard time grasping things, still. I’ve always been a terrible student. They essentially pity passed me through high school. I’ve always suspected that I have an attention deficit, but my parents were always so against the idea there was anything wrong with me. I seemed articulate enough, and I appear fairly normal I suppose, so to them any of my shortcomings were because “you’re just lazy” “you just need to apply yourself”. I dreaded going to college because of my poor history with school, but I was also told that “college/university is different because you’re paying to be there and it should be something you’re passionate about”. However I’m still the last one to finish taking a test (always), always missing things the teachers are saying due to day dreaming. And even when I muster all of my willpower to absorb something I’m reading I often read an entire paragraph and it’s like I didn’t read it at all, it’s like my brain just went through the motions of reading the words, but not retaining any of it. This causes me to read the same thing over and over again. By the tome I finish absorbing something it becomes exhausting keeping the proverbial car that is my focus on the road. And simple math is incredibly difficult for me. My roomate wanted me to volunteer to sell 50/50 tickets at his event, and he gave me an example of how the ticket selling process would go, like how many tickets for however much money. When I gave him the wrong answer to an example he was just like “yeah maybe we’ll find you another job. I’m starting to wonder if I’m actually mentally challenged. It’s not just my difficulty in school, but I notice I also have odd tendencies, like I fidget a lot, and I’m very klutzy. I know the easy answer to my question would be go see a doctor or a professional, but which kind? I look online and there’s so many different types of counselors, therapists, mental health workers, psychologists, psychoanalysts, psychiatrists, all with specialties in different areas and different qualifications. Where do I begin to a life of competency? I feel like maybe there’s some pill out there that will make me “normal” where I can read a book without skipping a beat, where I can maybe make decent money someday. I feel like maybe I’d be able to start dating at that point. I often wonder if the reason I’ve never been in a relationship before or had a girl want to talk to me for more than a few minutes was because I was off putting because she could sense my lack of competency. I’m also told I overthink, nonetheless probably something to bring up with a professional. I just really want to get help and be like everyone else.

My wife never wanted to marry me but she was forced by her family and i married her for her sake because her parents didnt want her anymore. after that we started living with my father, he kicked us out too because of problems between my wife and my mother who wanted to bully her. So, we ended up renting a room and i got a job. For the past months we have been living independently.

I promised her that i will not pressure her or anything. We didnt have sex, wait we didnt even hold hands (Romantically) . We share a bed though. Anyways, i did have crush on her before we got married and that crush developed to ''love''.

I didnt tell her because i dont want to make her feel ''threatened/scared'', i just dont want our life to be awkward. Btw, we didnt get a divorce because if we did/do, she will have to go back to her parents who will make her life hell and force her again probably.

Anyways, the past week she has been chatting with a guy ''online''. At first they just talked like normal friends. she is with me in the same room so i basically hear all the things they are saying. Then 2 nights ago, their conversation got more flirty and last night i told her that she shouldnt talk to him in my presence.

She got mad obviously. She asked why? and i told her that she bothers me, talking all the time. pretty immature responce right?

Then she told me to talk to other girls, that she will not mind it at all. Then I told her ''if you want to flirt with some men you met online, then do it outside the house not here''.

After that she stopped talking on the phone and she also didnt talk to me since then.

Don’t get me wrong it wasn’t against my will because I want to be more than friends with her but I’m a really shy guy when the situation has anything to do with love. Do you think she means anything with those things or am I just being a little too hopeful?",05Aug2019,1
607,"Despite recent news, I hope everybody is having as good of a day as they can get!

So I have tried dating in real life. I have 2 short relationships and dated 3 other girls that didn’t go anywhere for the past 3 years (with 5 additional rejections). To make matters worse I am still a virgin because I am really not the type who want to be super pushy with woman or to rush things. So after being single for a while, I tried Tinder for a year. But I never got a date off of it (I am a 5’5” Asian American so I don’t think I was on anyone’s top choice list haha). To make matters worse, a lot of my friends are in relationships so I always get relegated as the something odd number wheel when they invite me. Also, a good lady friend of mine recently ridiculed virgins, so I lied and said I got laid at a frat party (a girl was interested in me for a quick lay but she seems to have a boyfriend and I don’t want to get between them despite the fact I was drunk). 

Anyway, I know that prostitutes are illegal in most of America. But since I am studying abroad in Europe for the fall semester, I was thinking about visiting the Red Light District at Amsterdam. I would honestly enjoy knowing what it feels like to have sex and to lose it. It will also give me to extra boost in confidence to know I am desired in a certain way. Lastly, even if it doesn’t go well, I will learn that sex is overrated. Though I am having 2nd thoughts at times. 1) I heard that women get trafficked often even in legalized areas and I am not a scumbag who uses women. 2) I don’t want to get a disease. 3) I would have to keep it in secret to everybody (besides those who read this post) because I don’t want my reputation in a good college to get ruined because I wanted to do something other teenagers who do.

Final questions: Any thoughts about this? Should I go through my plan? Could other people who have went to Amsterdam add in their experience? Thank you!",05Aug2019,0
608,"Hello everyone. I am new in reddit after watching a bunch of rslash, cuestar, emkay videos i decided to try it out! Well, I have a good father but lately he has changed (he has depression and the medication is not working). He has always been strict but lately he has been very sexist. He just favors and coddles my brother.
Well I have a Gionee P5l phone and it's a bad phone and I want a new phone. I just started doing private tutoring and it is amazing. My father never gives any money to me and I finally have money and I can buy new clothes rather than my old ratty clothes. So I asked him to provide me with the price for my desired phone Redmi Note 7 PRO and I assured that I'll pay him back by giving an EMI of Rs. 2000/- per month. But he flat out refused. The thing is I know it's not money problem it's just he always kept me under his thumb and the only reason for not giving me money is because he can.
Yes, I know i can save up and buy it later but I just wanted it you know? Do I sound like a brat? Or is my father correct in this situation? Also, what should I do?",05Aug2019,1

The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone  and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back  at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.",05Aug2019,2

613,"When I make complaining posts, or asking for help, people throw nothing but tons of downvotes and hate speech and trolling, then that hate speech gets tons of upvotes and responses how everyone agrees. And my behaviour, regardless of what I do, is unwelcome.

While when someone makes complaining post, or asking for help, and I throw some hate speech on them, I get the opposite reaction that I would if I were others - I get tons of downvotes, and a permban.

The definition of good behaviour is ""done by others"", and the definition of bad behaviour is ""done by me"". Whether it's good or bad, doesn't depend on the act itself, but on the person who does that - if it's me, it's bad.

Examples:

1. I followed the general googleable advice on finding a job. It didn't work. So I ask. I get tons of replies, telling me to try exactly what I just tried. I say that I already tried that. Then they say another googleable advice. I say I tried that too. And that happens multiple times, until they say ""why even ask for advice, if you say no to everything"". So, I delete the old bad post, and make a new one, with better wording, stating directly that I tried, and listing all the methods I tried. Then, I get responses ""trolling again?"" ""stop trolling"", and eventually banned.
2. I ask on r/tinder how I look on those pictures. People say ""try smiling"". OK, so I add picture where I am smiling. They say ""it looks aggressive and creppy, you could smile"". I say that I am smiling - ""no, you are not"". Someone says that I should try with open-mouth smile. So I do a smile with open mouth, and post it - people again say ""try smiling"" ""should have an open-mouth smile"". I say ""it has open-mouth smile"" - tons of downvotes and ""no, it's closed"", with tons of upvotes. And such.
3. I've been working out for 3 months, and post a picture somewhere - I get ""start working out"" responses. If I commented ""start working out"" on someone's picture, I'd get instantly blocked and flamed how rude it is.
4. People tell me that I have social anxiety, that I should open up to people, to meet some people, talk to them, and make some friends. I do exactly what they say, open up, talk with people, be myself - and people start to hate me again, proving that I was wrong to open up. And I close up, again, live alone, refuse to talk to people. I keep seeing others socialising, having fun. I am so jealous, but that's all I can do. It's others, not me. Then they again tell me to open up. I do that for yet another time. Because why would it work for everyone except me? And I had yet another clear proof that I was wrong opening up to people.
5. I go to another country. I hear from people how nudity is accepted and common. So, to reduce hauling the baggage to hostel bathroom, I go out to the shower in just my underwear. I hear ""CLOTHES"". OK, next time I'll go inclothes, then. Another hostel, I forgot my upper pyjamas. Another staff person says ""put on some clothes"". Then, later on, I visit someone at his house, and take a shower. And I accidentally dropped my shirt into the bath, so I'm going out bare chest. It's not a hostel, it's a local's house, so the locals will accept. Yet, ""why are you walking around naked?"". Now I'm certain that it's just a myth that people here accept nudity. Then someone again tells me that there's nothing wrong with nudity, it happens normally, and such. I say ""it'S just a myth"" - they tell me to not talk about things that I have no idea about. Few days later, I see some shirtless people on the street. Nobody cares. So why do they care about me? Are my pants invisible or what?
6. I was looking for any reason why it's specific to me. No way. Nobody gave any feedback. People would refuse to talk. Just read without answering, sometimes blocking me, eventually giving me some hate words before that. So, I was on my own with that. I decided to look for something that I do, but others don't. Couldn't find anything, apart from some few examples of people being weird and still having lots of friends. So, I decided to try to be weird too. Started saying that I'm an elf. Even thought people don't believe, they now find me funny and like me.

So, what is going on? Am I really an elf?",05Aug2019,0

617,"So I've been dating my gf for about 7 months now. Our relationship has been a rocky one from the start due to her insecurities. I understand she's been in a past relationship and was cheated on and lied to, so that's her excuse for treating me so poorly. 

Things she's done.
1. Invaded my privacy and peeped through my phone and found a text from a number with an area code I previously lived at. The text said "" yo, what's up"". That's literally it, she chastised me for about a week saying that i was texting my ex about that text when she finally told me what the text said. Which was in the context of "" yo what's up"". The text was just that?!?! Like wth.

2. I used to work with my gf and she like to socialize with everyone, as does the general population whether the person be male or female. She talks and jokes with males I have no problem, I don't see anything wrong with that.  As long as it's respectful to me and our relationship.
I literally had like a 2 minute conversation with another coworker which she is female. My gf snapped at me and berated Nd chastised me about it, abd embarrassed me in front of friends and coworkers. Yet she's being a hypocrite doing the same thing?

3. The most recent one is she created a fake phone number and texted me hey I miss your dick wanna hook up? While she was literally sitting right next to me.  I showed her immediately and was like wtf look at this, who the fuck is this. She said she has no idea. I asked her are you joking with me right now? She completely denied any involvement with that text. So later on in the day I "" played along"" with that number because I highly suspected it to be my gf. Saying hey let's meet up around the lines of that. Tried calling the number after about 5 minutes of attempting to contact the unknown person, I get a call. It's my gf. Screaming at me really really?? You didn't know that was me like if she got my ass slipping or something. It's just sad and so petty at this point and I find it highly unattractive. 

Before the 3rd incident I expressed to her that this type of behaviour needs to stop. It makes me unhappy and I don't deserve it. I have done nothing to deserve this stupid ass juvenille behaviour. She's an adult, 26 years old like wtf I feel like I'm dating some juvenille. I'm on the fence on how to proceed with this relationship, I love her but this seems like it will never end and I don't know if I want to spend the rest of my life with someone who can't even fucking trust me?

620,"So all my life I've never really quite enjoyed being active but by life circumstances I just fell into it. I've never been super athletic but for some reason or other participated in active activities regularly like hiking, geocaching, swimming, yoga, walking etc. Mostly low impact stuff since I have particularly large breasts.

I bring up how I've never particularly enjoyed physical activities to indicate that it's hard to keep my motivation up once I start an activity I don't really enjoy. I've only found two physical activities I enjoy doing without a partner and that's swimming and specifically hot yoga.

Over the last year I have become a huge sloth. I can really feel it in how it's affected my happiness level and the way my body feels but I need to figure out how I can get back into physical activity.  

Here are some of my obstacles: 
1. My commute is over an hour long one way every day and I usually stay later than I'm supposed so I don't get home until after 7pm most nights and leave at 8am most mornings. 

2. I have tried to introduce better eating habits recently so that means cooking which leaves not a lot of time in the evening to deal with my kid plus cooking.

3. I'm not a morning person, I'm just not. A friend challenged me to try a month long experiment to change my sleeping habits so I'd get up earlier and go to sleep earlier. The going to sleep earlier worked out better than I thought but I'd wake up earlier and still be exhausted. I didn't get up and be productive as they thought. In addition I wasn't getting stuff done at night because I was going to sleep earlier and you could forget socializing which left me depressed.

4. I live basically in a city center where it's not safe for a woman to walk around alone. I also live about 30 minutes from the nearest park.

So I know I need to do something but I don't know what to do to add some physical activity to my life. Any suggestions welcome!",05Aug2019,2

623,"hello all. any advice is greatly appreciated. i know i should probably see a professional but i am in a bit of guilt panic. 

&amp;#x200B;

i have gotten myself into a tough pickle, AS ALWAYS. i am going to try to be as vague as possible to try and not get too carried away with detail. ( i got the title bc i was talking with a friend about how people cry wolf and i had the feeling it was a slight towards me but i can't even be too mad because it is true -- i see it too. )

&amp;#x200B;

so. my boyfriend got into a ""catastrophic"" accident while on the job at the beginning of 2018. he was out of state for six months tending to his injuries and rehabilitation.  

in september, he is going out of state again to be LISTED for a transplant. they still do not know exactly what type of transplant will be needed. it is between two options and one option, he would be put at the bottom of the priority list because his liver is still ""functional."" 

we would have to be within FOUR hours of the hospital, we live like? fourTEEN. so -- we would have to move up there.  and be there for who knows how long -- waiting and then recovering afterwards.

i do not want to air out his family business but -- his mother, father, and sister cannot go with him. and he can't go by himself. 

however -- in early july i lost my grandmother to cancer. the whole thing was very sudden. diagnosed and passed within a month. while i was close to her, i am even closer to my OTHER grandmother whom i live with and also has cancer. (to help keep up with the grandma's -- i will refer to the one i live with as nana)

i had some issues with leaving my nana even before i lost my other. i have not even told her yet because i just can't look her in the face and tell her i am leaving. but now with the loss of my grandmother, i am clinging on to nana even more. 

i am an only child. from a town less than 1,000 people. before -- i was thinking of this move with my boyfriend as a once in a lifetime opportunity even with it's shitty circumstances but now i really do not think i can do it. i cannot bare the thought of leaving my nana and my father. even with the modern technologies. it is not the same and i do not think i could be able to bear it. i would be so miserable. my nana only has my dad and myself left in this world. and my dad is super busy with being with and dealing with my mother as she mourns her own mother. 

i feel super guilty. i couldn't tell my grandmother i was leaving and now i do not know how to tell my boyfriend that i don't think i could go with him. 

keeping in mind from what i have been told about myself -- i am very straight forward/dry and people could assume that i am being confrontational. i also do not want my boyfriend to think that i have thought this the whole time we have been planning this and then back out last second bc it has really only hit this past month and it is the only thing i can think about.     

i love him but i love her too. maybe more.  any thoughts on how to go about telling him or things to consider would be greatly appreciated. i hope you all do not think i am as big of a piece of shit as i feel.

624,"TL;DR found at bottom

For the past two and a half years, I haven't had any contact with this girl who lives down the street from me. Her and I used to be pretty close friends with. Both kept things platonic, never really wanted to date one another especially since we would converse about our own partners and sex lives. The most pressing issue for me is the fact that we had such a close connection that sometimes I have second thoughts about keeping her out of my life.

We met each other in fourth grade and gradually became closer through elementary, junior, and high school. As everybody sort of found their groups going into junior high (as most kids do around that age), the constant was always our friendship. I ended up going to a different high school than all of my other friends, including her. Despite this, we all remained pretty close friends, hanging out, watching movies, parties, etc.

Going into high school, she had started dating the fuckboy types and built up a bit of a slut reputation. I didn't really care because I wasn't trying to sleep with her she was fun to hang out with. Things got out of hand when she started hanging with the really skanky bunch. Like the saying goes, who you surround yourself with, you become. That crowd was in real tight with the dropouts and troubled kids that didn't care much about their future. As a result, they rubbed that careless attitude off on her and she became more reckless. Even so, her grades never slipped and she had a decent home life. 

The incident that ended our friendship happened on my birthday two years ago. I invited our friend group to a local restaurant and we all had a good time. Unbeknownst to me, she was organizing a fight to take place in the parking lot outside. One of the dropouts she met recently and had been fucking for two weeks (flexes guns, money, drugs, you know the type) had heard her mentioning me and thought we were romantically involved. Wanting to escalate the drama, she kept egging him on to try and get him to come to where we were eating to get us to go at each other. I wasn't really upset so much as I was annoyed by the idea of some pissant coming to interrupt the whole function just so we can fight about absolutely nothing. I joke with him over the phone some and leave it at that.

As we're leaving the restaurant I ask her not to give out my address to this guy, it was bad enough that he knew she lived down the street from me. She agrees, and we all leave. Fast forward about an hour, I get a text from a number I've never seen with my address. The guy says that he's coming and to look for a white pickup. At this point in my life, I've only had a few scuffles with neighborhood peers. Knowing he had guns and wasn't one for talking scared the shit out of me. I scrambled for the shotgun in our closet and peered out of my window for the next hour, keeping my eyes peeled for the white pickup. He circled the block twice, parked outside of my house for a couple minutes, and left. When it became clear that he wasn't coming to my front door, I began to put the pieces together and texted the girl. After five ignored texts, I get a call from her. When she picks up, I go off on her, telling her how I told her not to give out my info to this guy.

I didn't know that she had made it a conference call, with the guy on the other line. He chimes in with, ""Now I know you're a bitch, bro."" I go silent and put myself on mute. After about a minute, they think that I hung up. For the next ten minutes they both go on and on about how much of a pussy I am and how I made myself look like a fool. Hurt and angry that my best friend of nearly 6 years could say such things, I take myself off mute, call her a lying bitch, and hang up the phone.

It was around this time I began to experiment with recreational drugs. The incident itself was not a motivating factor behind my usage, it just started around then. I met other using buddies through my current friends and built up a network of friends. Eventually we had formed an entirely new clique. We even became a little more popular and respected because of all the places we'd go, things we'd do, and stories we'd share. We went to parties, hit licks on people, and got high 24/7. Being in active addiction and doing the things I did shattered this illusory image I had about people. I was timid, kept my head down and didn't look for trouble. Gradually, I became more and more confident in myself and less afraid of the people who would give me shit. Enough people get high so that over time, you see a wide variety of people. That being said, you get better at reading people and identifying ways that they carry themselves that tell if they really are about their shit or all talk. 

I had lots of fun over the next two years, but it wouldn't last. During those two years the girl would send me paragraphs and paragraphs about how sorry she was, how wrong it was of her, and how she wants to go back to the way things were. My usage peaked the months following my mom's diagnosis with stage III breast cancer. It was a shitty thing to do, but I had no other healthy coping mechanisms. Even after her surgery I still went out and got my fix. My grades bottomed out the last semester and that was the straw that broke her back. This past June, she went and got me checked in to a rehab facility about two hours from where we live. Detoxing and leveling back out was hell, and for the first week I had a permanent scowl. Over the next few days I came around to it and decided to make the most of it and take back what I could. The separation from my life back in town was crucial for me. I had actual time to clear my head and reflect on things. I know that that isn't who I am, nor who I want to be.

Back home, attending therapy, and I have a greater understanding of myself and who I want to be. Much better managing responsibilities. The one thing that irks me is this girl and the apologies she's sent me. I've hated her through this time, even when mutual friends would try and get us to come back together. Forgiveness is a component of recovery, but I just don't know how to feel about it given her betrayal. What do, Reddit?

TL;DR: best friend of 5+ yrs tried to set up a fight with someone she knew for 2 weeks on my birthday. i'm a drug addict in recovery, not sure whether to forgive her bc i have conflicting thoughts on the matter",05Aug2019,3
625,"So to start, my career was in HVAC.

I moved away from HVAC to snag a job for the utility company in my state.

Life was going great, making steady, reliable, good money and was building a foundation for my life to begin on, and was hitting my debt hard.  


I was an idiot and had a couple of beers and drove with a broken tail light, got a DUI.  
Got fired  
Couldn't find a job for 6 months  
Nobody in the HVAC field would pick me up because of the DUI, even for an installing position where there are 2 people in one van, because they'd need the second person to be able to drive if the other calls of sick or something.  


Factories turned me down, restaurants... I spent 6 months wiping out my savings hoping for a half-decent job.  


Finally, I settled for one of the places in my town that I KNEW would hire anybody.  


Terrible work, for terrible pay.  


I'm now working 10x harder than any other job I've had, for the least amount of money I've ever worked for.

However, now I'm underwater... I've never lived paycheck to paycheck before.... and sometimes I'm having to borrow money from my parents, which I've never had to do before.

I'm struggling to make ends meet and this is REALLY hurting me emotionally. I'm really not sure what to do at this point.

I used to see a light at the end of the tunnel in this thing I call life, Now I don't see anything... I can't even begin to envision a future for myself.

628,"Hey guys, first time poster. I'll use this account for now but will probably have to delete later because people may know this account. I (22m) have an older brother with Asperger's and depression (31m) and an older sister with depression and bipolar disorder (27f) as well as two parents that struggle with anxiety and depression. So there's the background. 

I'm currently in grad school making barely enough to survive on my own so I am unable to help anyone out. My brother recently had to quite his job because he was too depressed to keep working. My sister is in the same boat, but shes trying and works part time. My parents have to foot a lot of the loans and bills put forward. My mother has to get a job because my father alone cannot afford it all. My brother and sister both seem to think my parents are asking too much from them. My brother went as far as to say that he would rather be homeless for a while rather then ask for more help from them. My sister has very bad debt and he gf is the only one providing for now I believe.

I'm always in the middle ground it seems like. They will all talk to me about issues but won't talk to one another because they'll just fight and get upset. My parents don't even know my brother is deeply depressed and unemployed. I always have to reach out to them and it seems like I'm the one trying to keep everyone together. 

It's a lot I'm sorry, but is there anything you suggest I try? I've left out a lot, including that I live 600 miles from them. Anyone have similar experience with advice? Anything at this point will help. 

PS sorry for typos, on mobile.",05Aug2019,2
629,"Axel spends a lot of his time on the computer and has recently been looking at some figures on the government websites his father has showed him (he loves statistics). We were going to the waterpark yesterday and waiting at a bus stop with about 5ish strangers around us.

So he is talking about his discoveries about the population growth in the last few decades and I was just nodding along. (Was still thinking about the Luther episode I watched last night, Idris Elba is tooo hot) The bus pulls up and as we are about get on he says something horrific...

""Mommy there are a lot of black people on this bus, can we wait for the next one""

I take a second to realise what he's just said as the surrounding publics necks snap to face us. I demanded he apologize to everyone and explained he was autistic and quickly explained to everyone that I wasn't racist and I don't know where he got it from. I was so embarrassed.

I shouted at him asking where he learned that, and he started explaining to me that because black people 'did the most crime', we would be safer to wait for a bus with less of them. I was furious. He sounded like a rightwing politician and I don't know what to do. This autism in his brain makes him not understand that figures aren't always right and he takes it to literally.

Please can someone who has experience training autistic children of their own help me?",05Aug2019,4
630,"My older brother and I go and play pick up Basketball from time to time

He is really good and is playing since childhood while I just started playing a few months ago because of a growth spurt ( I'm 6'7"" now at 17 y/old )

In the past few months I spent countless hours on the court every day trying to make up for not playing before. I'm really giving it my best and even joined the gym to improve strength, endurance and vertical all for the cause of getting better. I'm entirely sure that I'm giving it my 110% and I want to continue but I'm facing some problems

We often play 1 on 1 and in the beginning he would destroy me without even trying. 
And he was always trash talking too, I'm not sure if he just wanted to motivate me or he genuinely wanted me to stop playing basketball because he was aware of my confidence problems. He never played below his maximum even though I was really bad. After some time I started catching up to the point where today we are probably level

Earlier today we went to a local court to play 1 on 1. Defence is always my primary asset, even though I improved drastically my scoring is not the best so I always go all out

After we finished, there was a dude my age and a bit shorter than me. My brother said he played with him and that he is extremely good and I should play 1 on 1 against him claiming that I've got absolutely zero chance of beating him, and trash talk maybe doesn't motivate me but telling me I can't do something surely does

We started playing and it was the most contested game of my life. The dude is really good with extremely good handles so I had to defend him the best I could. I was literally diving for loose balls on an outdoor court ( Even tore my jersey ) The other guy was also going all out as he didn't want to lose to a beginner. After the most exhausting game of my life we both fell to the ground - I ended up winning 11-8 but the game lasted for almost half an hour because we both played our hearts out on both offensive and especially defensive end

That was the first time I felt like I improved so much and I felt really good about it.

On our way home my brother told me that even though I beat him I still am not nearly as good as that guy. And I felt extremely discouraged and disappointed. I worked my hardest for months and finally saw incredible results by beating a really good player only to be discredited like that. My brother's argument was that the guy didn't give it his best even though we both could barely breathe after the game and he congratulated me. I tried to bring up how I played great defence and I even accepted that I wasn't as good as him offensively I still managed to get some blocks by hustling hard ( I tore my fucking jersey and had some minor cuts and bleeding ) No matter what I said my brother would just keep telling me how I can't play basketball for shit and I maybe got lucky today or that guy wasn't having the best day. My brother kept saying how that guy is much better basketball player than me - which is true! And I told him that, my point was that at the end of the day I ended up winning not because I am a better player but because I played better and he refused to accept that.

I was feeling really satisfied with myself after a while and being discredited like that really made me loose confidence even more to the point where I don't know what to do to prove that I got better since winning is clearly not enough",05Aug2019,1

634,"Today my mother sat me down and told me that her and my father were over. This wasn't really a surprise to me considering they haven't lived in the same house for almost a year, with my mother renting another house to get away from my father's negative attitude. She told me that she's been seeing somebody else for a couple of months now, saying he's sweet and actually want's to live life. Once again, this came as no surprise since I've always loved to ease drop and snoop (it's not my favorite habit). The whole time she was explaining this to me I nodded my head and smiled and said that none of this shocked me and I was really happy for her to find someone who was positive. She told me how happy she was to know how well I took it. I am really happy for her, but I'm now really worried about my father.

To start, my father has PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) from serving in the army. He's an alcoholic and a smoker and he's always been so easily aggravated with little things. He used to be really bad with his drinking; he used to day drink and would sometimes rarely yelled at me (I would have been around 5-7 years old). He says e doesn't remember that and from the bottom of his heart he apologized for those dark times. When I was around eight yeas old he was emitted to the hospital because his depression was getting too much to bare and he became suicidal. When he was there he planned to kill himself and he wrote a note. In it he was talking about how much he was sorry that he was going leave me and sad he was never going to see me grow up. He didn't even include my sister in the note, who are both five years older than me. He eventually came down off the ledge and went to therapy.

My mom told me that she had told him that they were over. Thankfully she called his best friend and his wife to check on him and be with him while he took it all in. I'm really worried for my father because he has had a lot of people he's loved either turn on him or left I'm entirely. I've been the only constant in his life for sixteen years and I'm really afraid that he's going to fall back into the old place he was in when he was in the hospital. I don't know how to handle this because I've always felt I need to take care of him and make sure I'm there for him because I KNOW that I'm the reason that he's still here (I over heard an argument with my parents where my father said ""Do you think I'd still be here if it weren't for the boy?"")

I don't know how I could focus more of my time with my father to make sure that he's okay because I'm the only person that he thinks he has and still be there for my mother. I really need some advice because I'm feeling a little lost

636,"Someone in a local community group I'm part of claims to be harmed by seemingly innocuous things, and I would like to better understand their behaviour and get some ideas on how to respond to the situation.

For example, they had a fairly intense reaction to [this dog meme](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D7s40sjXoAAho8y.jpg) and are claiming to be harmed by it. They are demanding acknowledgement that they have been harmed by the meme, saying that it has caused them ""ongoing emotional strife"" and that it is ""cruelty"" to not acknowledge that they have been harmed by the meme. They wrote a statement in response to the meme:

&gt;This doesn't look like just a dog picture, or dog pictures to me. This appears to be a comparison of dogs to humans in what could be interpreted as a binary and/or stereotyping format.

&gt;Many people may not view dogs as having gender, that's valid, and personally i find i can appreciate that. 

&gt;At the same time, in my experience many folks have normalized gendered language around dogs. Some of that same normalized language at times may also be used relate to humans in a way that can be derogatory. This language may also overlap or have similar references to language used in 2SIAQTBLG+ communities. 

&gt;i've experienced people holding stereotypical beliefs of certain breeds, and types of breeding in reference to both dogs, and humans, at times in extremely derogatory ways. 

&gt;i feel i can only guess as to the intended metaphor, or lack thereof, in this particular image... my guesses here give me warning bells. However, i'm not interested in trying to complete anyone else's journey in to understanding more respectful humour and possible dynamics represented by this image. 

&gt;The only person's experience i'm trying to articulate here is my own. By asking for clarification i was honestly somewhat hopeful i could be missing a joke. Instead the image and reactions overall feel frightening to me, and remind me of various experiences i've had where people assume who/what/how i am, etc, based on appearance alone, and at times knowingly and/or unknowingly make ""jokes"" that can be harmful.
 
&gt;i've had many experiences where a ""joke"" confuses and/or harms me and then people who claim to be in community with me seem to demand further proof of me when i'm confused and/or hurt. To me that's a sign of an exclusive community, and a harmful one. ""Joke"" defense, if i could call it that, is not a new reaction to me personally, and i've come to expect this and similar dynamics in my interactions with many [local community group] members.

&gt;It's not my fault i don't find this funny.

They also had a similarly intense negative reaction to a Canada Day greeting, and responded negatively when another member wished the group a Happy Pride. 

They've decided to not return to our group, and sent us the following:

&gt;When folks at [local community group] (or anywhere) laugh at things that hurt me, it hurts. This happens very frequently when i try to attend [local community group]. There's a lot of reasons why i haven't been in attendance.

&gt;Many of you have taught me to be wary and scared of you while simultaneously smiling. i know you don't know what you're doing when that happens. i've tried to call in and call out when i am able, with little success and a lot of pain, as well as time, and energy lost.

&gt;i've been harmed and i don't feel welcome.

&gt;i can assure you there are members who have quietly left of similar stories.

&gt;i can assure you our membership lacks greater diversity in part due to repeatedly harmful dynamics in [local community group].

&gt;Some folks have expressed a desire to have me back at [local community group], but at the same time seem to struggle to make the time to understand reasons why i had to leave.

&gt;i don't currently have any reasons to believe that the majority of members are willing to take accountability and action to create and maintain a more safe and inclusive space.

&gt;i know what i've witnessed.

&gt;We have so many choices before us.

&gt;Please, try to be anything but silent on this. Conflict is not inherently abuse, and if we can't communicate about this then we probably can't change it.

They also said:

&gt;Much of what i've expressed here has been spoken in hushed tones in and around [local community group] and associated events. i believe there's sufficient awareness of harmful dynamics within the [group], as well as a strong lack of willingness to take accountability and action towards different dynamics. 

&gt;i did enjoy [local community group] at times, but that joy could be sort of drained out of me by [local community group] dynamics and interactions at impossible to predict intervals and frequencies.

Other members of the group have responded by apologizing for anything they may have done to contribute to this, but no one seems to be able to figure out what it is that we've done. This person does not wish to explain any further but wants us to find answers ourselves. I guess that's what I'm trying to do now.

I recently got engaged to the love of my life. Ever since we started getting serious, my mother has been standoff-ish towards my fiance. She is never really flat-out mean to her, but she will make certain comments or start questioning my fiance to the point that it starts to feel like an interrogation.

We thought we had put this behind us when we finally got engaged, but things got tense this past week over a family vacation. It all started when we were discussing having our dog as the ring bearer in our wedding. My mother responded with a snarky remark about how it was stupid/not a good idea, and we were living in a fairytale if we thought that was a good idea. This was the breaking point for my fiance and she had an emotional breakdown (once she was alone upstairs). During this breakdown, my fiance told me about other instances when my mother had made backhanded comments that made her feel like she wasn't good enough and wasn't deserving of being apart of our family.

Both of my parents married young, divorced, and found each other later on in life. One of the concerns that they have is that they think we are too young (I'm 24, she'll be 22 next month). Another concern that they have is that they feel like they don't know her well enough. My fiance had a very rough childhood, but overcame it and doesn't let that define her today. My parents have expressed that they feel like they don't know enough about her, but my fiance doesn't feel like she owes anyone an explanation on her past because she is trying to put all of that behind her.

652,"Hi,  
I have been on Suboxone for over 2 years, at 24mg daily, same clinic and all. Last week my doctor went on vacation on the date I needed a refill. I had called ahead of time and asked about this, but nobody answered my question. So I figured maybe they had it all  figured out and would call my meds in before she leaves. When the day of my refill got here, I called the clinic, left a voicemail and then they called me back the next morning &amp; left a voicemail of their own, telling me to call them back. I had told them I was out of meds and had none til my next appointment. I figured they would have other doctors on site to take care of issues like this and would have just sent one over to my pharmacy. Needless to say, I tried calling back 3 times and got no answer &amp; even left another voicemail. Thankfully I was able to find some medicine to get me through, but I pretty much was abruptly dropped at 24mg and left to fend for myself for 7 days.   


My question is, can doctors do this? Or could they get in trouble for it? I could've ended up in the emergency room or hospital. Suboxone withdrawal is NO picnic. I'm guessing it's okay for them to do whatever they want, since I hear of people being cut cold turkey off from their pain meds all the time, but something about this doesn't sit right for me. I'm suppose to be in 'treatment' and I don't consider going 7 days without help ""treatment"". I have an appt tomorrow and hopefully will get my script back, but I also smoked weed to help ease the withdrawals during this period, so I'm wondering if they're gonna test me and cut me off, which I don't think would be fair considering they just left me 7 days to fend on my own.",05Aug2019,1

I have been approaching her much more frequently these past few days and she is clearly getting sick of me asking her the same questions. I try to be open but it seems to her that I'm just not getting it because I am too stubborn. I really try but I keep getting back to square 1. 

I talked about this belief that I had that i didnt believe in myself because people kept shitting on my life experience , saying that i didnt experience much of life. How that hurt my confidence because it puts my life into shame. She suddenly said that I should definitely go and kill them, or kill yourself. If that is bothering you so much. 

At first I didn't believe it so I asked her , are you serious or joking? You're really yelling at me to kill somebody ? I reassured that she understood my question but she kept repeating it. After this point I told her how I cant trust her anymore , and how you just cant say these things in front me cause I'm sensitive cause something with my uncle who told me the same thing about killing people. Now I dont even talk to him after a similar incident.

I just find it so absurd for someone who is in a mentorship role would tell me this to my face.

657,"Hi, 

i made my account just for this topic, i am an avid reader, (leecher maybe) this may play into my question.

I am from Germany so please excuse me trying to avoid dashs, i try to use them but it's (ouch..see)a pain.

This is not something that bothers me (too much) but i am thinking about this for a long time and did not want to necro some thread where it may come over as offensive.

I think for a forum i am the worst sort of user, i use it when i want some piece of information and then i vanish. I am not a stranger to forum posting but i am way more used to write in a business context so i often want to structure my posts (wich most people seems to totally ignore) in a way that i think is readable, but the forum software often makes my post look akward. I know it is my use of the enter key but i just can not drop that habit. Not my topic though.

In general i use a forum if i have a problem, sure i nearly always get my answer but i really would like to contribute sometimes. And with this habit of only looking for the problem at hand i often end up in topics that are years old.

That is not a problem if i look for say: How do i solve problem xy on my computer.

But if i look for some serious stuff this often makes me mad because i find topics, not only on reddit..in general, that really hit the point but are 2 Years old and i know even if it is allowed to answer there it would not do any good.

Making a new topic is often a problem 

1. Sometimes it is just trivial and i just need a tiny bit of more info

2. Sometimes it is a sensitive problem where i am happy to have found someone who had the same problem and same as above it just does not fit 100% to my needs.

After writing this i have to come to the conclusion that: Make a new Topic! is the way to go...but you know internet forums and it is sometimes hard to discuss topics that have been explored deeply (in most peoples minds) and seem to be ended, again. So i (and i think many people) hesitate to bring up some topic again.

I am no the person who follows internet forums, as i explained they mostly come up in my google searches. 

How do other people deal with this, do you refrain from posting your opinion? Do you post and stand the backlash (wich i think is reasonable for people who follow that forum), or do you just keep to yourself and get what you can from the internet?",05Aug2019,2
658,"Hey all, 23F here and I have a sister- we will go with Karen 22F- who has a laundry list of mental problems. She was official approved for medical disability last month and just got her first check last weekend. She has been very excited to start a new life for herself and use the resources she now has access to by the state, to help her learn how to live without my mother. Karen will go on all social media platforms and say things like "" I have no one"" "" I hate my life and I wan't to die"" ""I will never be good enough for anyone"" "" If you care about me, then reach out to me because I want to die"".  Last night she went on snapchat and made a little "" Vlog"" and announced that each day she will post a video on how her day went. Harmless right? Well the video kept going and she decided to announce to the public, ALL of her mental disabilities. She also announced that she is "" getting money for the government "" and is able to use all of this money on herself now. She also mentioned that she is mentally unstable and very lonely. It was extremely hard to watch, as it was incredibly cringy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Karen has the mind set of a 15 year old. She doesn't think like everyone else her age and the moment she opens her mouth, you know there is something different about her. She doesn't realize that the video she posted had people making fun of her, it made her look very ""desperate"" as some said. And all it did was embarrass her and her family. I didn't say anything to her, but I did text my mom to let her know what she is saying on the internet and that she should probably tone it down a bit and that she needs to sit down and talk to Karen for a mental check in. 

&amp;#x200B;

Karen know's she is different, and unfortunately doesn't understand that when she goes on social media saying all these strange things- it looks very bad on her and our family. All it has done is cause more people to make fun of her and that is obviously something no one wants in her life. We want her to rebuild and learn how to live with a disability, not show case it to the world the way she did. I am not saying she shouldn't be vocal about it, but the way she went about it was very attention seeking and now EVERYONE is calling her out on it.

666,"I apologize if this belongs in /r/legaladvice, let me know if it does.

TLDR; My roommate and I can’t afford to eat, and a family friend of his is offering me $10,000 if I co-sign his loan for $20,000 to get a working vehicle and get back to scrapping again. Need advice on if this is a good idea or not, and suggestions for other avenues we might pursue.


Hi /r/Advice,

I’m in a rough spot in life right now.  My family is struggling with legal issues and having to pay most of their limited income on attorney fees, and I just started a new job after being unemployed for a period.  Both my roommate and I are struggling, we just had to pay bills and we’re basically completely broke right now.  We both get paid on Thursday, but we only have a few dollars to eat on between us right now.

A neighbor who is a family friend of my roommate’s, let’s call him D, is down on his luck as well.  The last vehicle he, his mother and father have is on its last legs.  The transmission just started going bad in it this morning.  The truck’s been in rough shape for a while and he’s been requesting that I help him get a loan for quite some time, and he’s said that he would let me keep half of it at no charge if I co-sign.  He has a daughter that he has to get back and forth to school as well.

His plan is to get a loan for $20,000, give me $10,000, and use his half of it to get a vehicle he can use to start working again, collecting and hauling scrap.  He talks like this is a pretty lucrative business and says he would have no trouble paying off the loan in full.

I’m in a very desperate situation and he seems like a stand up guy.  My roommate advised me that he didn’t think it was a good idea, despite knowing him for a long time and saying he’s honest, due to the high risk involved.

So, my questions are these:  

• Is there a way I can bind him to the terms he’s agreeing on, like a formal contract?  

• If not, am I stuck with the responsibility to pay if he can’t, no matter what?  

• If doing this would be riskier than it’s worth, can you offer any suggestions for a couple guys who’re borderline starving til their next paycheck? Would it be?",05Aug2019,1

669,"Hey everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know where to start to get you the understand the whole situation, so here I go:

&amp;#x200B;

My parents and I always had a 'weak' relationship. That doesn't mean they are bad people but we just did not have any hobbies or anything in common (I'd like to change that even though that is not the main topic here).  I know that they are working really hard to provide me and my sister everything we want, and they have been very successful doing that so I thank them for that. 

I grew a really big love for endurance sports when I was about 17 and I've been trying to get competitive without my parents knowing, because my mom is a little traditional and I don't think she would be happy if I were to give up my education to pursue something in sports, but maybe I am wrong.  When I was 18 I've had a great chance to start a University abroad and do Veterinary medicine. At that time that was the only academic career that I could have done because I hate**d** human interaction in any form. But during my time abroad I've met so many great people and during the 2-3 years that I have lived alone, I've learned to accept a lot of things as they are and share experiences with totally different people. I grew more in those years than I have ever done. 

All the people I have met are quite happy or taking steps to be happier and pursue something they love right now rather then making plans for when they are 40+, retired. And I am not happy right now (I know I am very privileged and maybe 'spoiled' even, I don't take anything for granted) And the thing that would make me very happy is '**sports'.** The city I went for school has great opportunities in terms of cycling, running, etc. and I literally haven't been able to benefit from any of those because I have to constantly study and practice for the tests or clinic work. I do not wish to be spending my best years in a library or stuck inside in a building and just reading, memorizing couple hundreds of pages at a time. 

So this year I took a step and while I was getting by in my school I applied for a different major and got accepted, something that has been interesting to me but I've never accepted because my sister studied the same thing, and I did not want to be an 'imposter'. But now I realize that is all in my head now. Me and my sister have a relationship beyond that simple thought process. 

So my question is: How do I break the news to my parents and have a meaningful conversation with them?  I was supposed to finish Veterinary in 3 years from now and this new major will take the same time because Vet medicine is ridiculously long. And the financial support they have been giving to me can even go down a bit if I switch schools. So they don't lose anything in the process at all.

Thank you for reading till here!

&amp;#x200B;

P.S: I am not expecting this new major I chose to be easy or anything by any means. I just know for a fact that it won't demand my attention 24/7 and it interests me a lot more then Vet medicine. 

P.S(2): Clench through the last 3 years of Vet is not an option.",05Aug2019,2

That’s awesome, right? Well yes and no. Yes in that I’m with my dream girl, but no because I’m sure to fuck it up.

You see, I have depersonalization disorder and I’m on the spectrum. Which means I’m not always very socially aware. I say and do a lot of dumb shit and I never realize it until it’s too late. I know it really isn’t my fault most of the time, but I still feel guilty.

676,Hi Reddit so I'm a student which lives away from its family and for the past two years we used to call each other for a small chat every evening or so. generally I call them over the Facebook and that's our main form of communication anyway now I've been calling them for the past 6 days and they haven't replied basically they were offline all the time until now when they called me and they stated that they were mad since I haven't reached out to them despite the fact that I was trying to call them and we were exchanging screenshots as evidence anyway I am not sure whether I should apologize or not keeping in mind that to my father is off of the very strong character and he wouldn't really get into discussion too much he's just blaming me saying that whether there was trouble for me or something I would have found ways to contact them by making a phone call and not to messenger one etc etc. I wouldn't really like to apologize as I'm not feeling guilty because actually I've been calling them on our usual platform that we talked on and I was thinking that they were busy with something that's they couldn't reply on the other hand yeah I could have called them over the phone but I don't get it why they are so mad since they could have reached out for me as well if they think that is what I should have done. also few days ago he sent me an e-mail consisting of a insurance that mt father paid for and I wanted to thank him yet claims that I didn't and im rude and ungrateful as I didn't call him despite the fact that I've tried so tell me whether that's was really my fault or how should I approach it in order to restore our relations normal as I I'm completely ready to say that it was definitely my fault yet I don't think so as if they are claiming that I'm not calling them just because there is no serious things for me. why didn't they call me themselves? They didn't even try whilist I did. also I've been talking to them for like 2 years straight almost every day so that kind of neglects the fact that I'm talking with them just out of my benefit.

683,"I interned at company A two summers ago and they kept me on as a student worker until I graduated and could start full time. Well, I am not good at school so I kept extending my graduation one semester then two then a summer semester. This August was supposed to finally be it since I took July off to finish my last class. Well, I actually failed something else in spring and have to take a class online in fall. I cannot tell them for a FOURTH time that I am not done yet. My bf started at company B in June and mentioned the work I do and his company was interested in me because they are aggressively hiring. Since it seemed like I had a very good chance I went ahead and tried for it and got it. Although hard work he really likes it there.

Company A: has been patient with me and have done everything for me so that I can stay with them, will create a rotation program just for me so that I can try every part of the team to see what I like best BUT although not sinking isn't one of the highest performing companies and closes stores every now and then, doesn't have ANY team spirit at all whatsoever in my department people are loners and will hardly even go to lunch or do any team oriented stuff, will make you pay for your own training/certifications/conferences and you have to take vacation time to go

Company B: one of the top companies in country, seems to have much stronger team dynamics in my department, is very training focused with all kinds of support including financially, knows that I have a class in fall and is ok with it

I love my job now, I cannot believe how much I have learned and is great but I will not tell them about my degree thing again. If I have to stay I would be terrible and unethical and say that I won't have my degree until December because of my transfer credits (I went to community college this summer) which is also true but not the whole truth since also I need the class. The offers are almost identical. I feel so bad for possibly leaving a company that did everything for years so that I could stay and be happy in whatever I needed but I also have an opportunity with another great company who I wouldn't have to feel ashamed about my situation with. 

This is supposed to be good news but I seriously feel like throwing up. I was supposed to start next Monday at company A officially and I just got this offer on Friday. Some advice I have received is to counter offer company B and if they say yes then the choice will be easier. It just feels wrong doing it because I dont have the degree yet although not required but I do have good experience and had a very good interview. Also, someone also said they will only consider counter to match not to be higher and they are already matched. The worst they can say is no, true, but also idk how long it will take and I wont end up giving company A any heads up with time pretty much if I tell them after I've heard back from company B.

Whenever I try to get him to talk to me about it he says “you just beat the shit out of me, as if you even care”.

When he was telling me at first about it, he made it sound like no one cares about him going into  about how he was going to kill himself (didn’t say the method) and made it sound like he was excited for us to have to identify the body and how we would get phone calls finding out.

692,"Last weekend one of my childhood friends and her husband asked my husband and I if we would take custody of their children in the event of their deaths. There is nothing wrong with them and while I hope nothing happens to them I understand that they would want to have something set up.

I have a problem but first some background.

My girlfriend(21) lives at home with her mum and depends on her to get to and from work every day. She works quite far away from the town we love in and public transport isn't really an option at all to help her get there.

I have been with her now for 6 months and known her as a friend for 13 years. During our relationship my girlfriend's mother has become really cruel, and quite often. Aimed towards my girlfriend. 
Being violent with her, really emotionally abusive and blackmailing her with the ""you need me to get to work"" talk.
This usually happens when my girlfriend starts to spend more time with me than with her mother and to me it feels like bitter jealousy. 
I worry for my girlfriend a lot through all of this.

It already has started to take a toll on our relationship. My girlfriend naturally wanting to see me less, and me indirectly being upset because I feel like we are drifting apart  which upsets my girlfriend more. (But I really can't help it.)

After the last episode her mother had, me and my girlfriend decided to just find a house together and be independent without her mother involved. But it seems hard to find any way for my gf to keep going to work.
My girlfriend's mum, since learning this news has become all ""super nice"" to my girlfriend again, and keeps calmly persuading her that moving in with me isn't a good idea because we bicker. 

But to me we bicker because we don't get our time together. 

I feel so stuck. And I feel like if this continues it will ruin our relationship. My girlfriend has already said that she has started to doubt moving in together too. And the house viewing we have tomorrow, she won't even accept if we get offered the place.

707,"hi! i'm super new to reddit, so i have no idea what i'm doing but i have the general gist of how things operate thanks to a friend of mine, but as of right now, i'm really looking for some advice.

i'm in a really awful situation. i don't know if anyone else has gone through something like this before, but i could use all the help i can get at this point. moving forward is my goal, but i seem to be stuck.

i'm currently 16 and in highschool, for some background. i'll be a junior this year, and the person i'm talking about will be a senior. let's call them blue.

blue and i have shared classes ever since i entered 9th grade. always math classes, since that's how the system works (we take tests in 8th grade to determine our placement in highschool). we were only classmates at first, and blue was my desk partner. we didn't talk much (or i didn't talk at all, because i have very extreme anxiety), even when we were supposed to work together. i think around the end of the year i developed some kind of fascination with blue, but i didn't dare linger on it since i was in a relationship at the time.

but over the summer, my s/o and i broke up, and i had to endure the emotions that came along with that. they moved on and found someone new, and i grew bitter and angry with them. i moved on eventually, too, and that's when i began to talk to blue more. we had first period together, which was -- no surprise here -- a math class! they helped me not fail the class and we eventually became good friends, and that's when i started to develop feelings for them.

now, a friend of mine (let's call her green) told me some things about blue. she told me that blue had led her on before, and that i should be careful around them. i was wary of blue from then on out until it was summer again. green often gave me advice, too, which definitely helped me in getting closer with blue. she even helped me through the aftermath, and helped console me.

blue and i hung out a lot. we were always alone, either exploring the old trainyard in my town or just goofing off at the park. they made me feel at peace with myself, and were supportive of me. at some point i think i fell in love with them (which is a huge thing for me, as i've only ever truly loved two people in my entire life), and they admitted that they would have liked to form a relationship with me. everything was going absolutely perfect- i had found someone who really did care for me, and who respected the boundaries i had set up. blue didn't pressure me or force me into situations i didn't want to be in, which is what i'll always be thankful for.

blue and i texted everyday, almost all day. one of us would usually start it off with a good morning text, and one of us would always end with a goodnight text.

now at the beginning of my sophomore year (last year), sophomores and juniors were given the opportunity to check out a college campus and even have a chance of getting a scholarship there. blue signed up for it, but i didn't. so when they left, we didn't text much (it was an all day thing, with plenty of activities to do after sunset). blue met someone there (let's call them gold), and i hadn't known until they returned home and posted about them. gold was everything i wasn't: attractive, extroverted, and pretty damn smart. gold didn't live around here, though, and it made me feel awful when blue said they fell in love with gold as soon as they saw them.

blue and gold started dating and exchanged ""i love yous"" only two and a half days into their relationship. blue also told me that they only wanted to be friends after my confrontation, because i felt like i had been led on (and i had been, considering blue told me things like how they wanted to kiss me, date me, and other things). as of recently, blue and gold have posted a few pictures together on their instagram accounts, which is what i was greeted with as soon as i opened the app. another friend of mine even screenshotted them and sent them to me. the pictures kind of ruined my entire day.

but just like i had with my ex, i've grown bitter and cold towards everyone and everything. i don't want to be- i want to move on, because bitterness only managed to elongate the time i needed to get over my first love. i have classes with blue this year and i want to move past my heartbreak so we can get back to just being friends. i ruined the friendship i had with my first love, and i don't want to ruin the one i have with blue. i told them i don't want to speak to them for a while, and they understood, but i want to eventually get back in touch with them.

so, as the title states, does anyone have any sort of advice for this kind of situation? any tips at all would be appreciated.",05Aug2019,1
708,"Hi my name is Dosa Kim 

It was my dream to protect 3D assets of 3D artists. 

Our original team won SXSW 2017. I thought of this program working in Los Angeles. My neighbors fat the time were Chloe Kettell and Ray Partha. We created a company called Padeca and a program called D3CRYPT3D. From there we moved to Atlanta. I pulled a ton of money out to create a brand new office building for our team. I was the driving force behind the project. It was my original vision. Chloe just wanted to be a CEO of something, or anything for that matter. After we had won SXSW 2017 she gave a terrible speech. I followed up and immediately realized that she was not suited to be a CEO nor was she understand what the hell she was selling. If anyone can find that footage of the award ceremony I would be grateful. We all agreed that I would be the CEO. 

Chloe Kettell would constantly use the N-word over and over again. Her boyfriend is Indian and she would claim that she was not racist due to her relationship with her partner. But time and time again, she would show us derogatory videos of some white guy in blackface that would pose as some old church black lady. And would keep on using the N-word over and over again like it was no body’s business. Ugh. Makes me sick thinking about it. Saved their relationship and was asked by her boyfriend to confront her about her racist tendencies. 

The D3CRYPT3D project was using not only all my ideas but my contacts and my connections to the industry. I had worked with so many various people and I alone made all the marketing material and the ideas of building this thing. I have footage of us going to NASA and I also have footage of me debating the Amazon engineer at another engagement as the CEO of the company. 

At this time I had not had a break. I finally got to go on a trip with their blessings. As. I was away they had already filed on the patent. Without me in May the same month, I had their blessings to leave. They were already setting me up by filing the patent when I was away.  You can scroll back and see on my timeline @x\_dosa\_x on Instagram to see where I was a very big part of the process.  I also created threads here under D3CRYPT3D to promote our project at that time If you want you can see their shenanigans on Instagram @polyport.io  They claim that they are protecting 3d assets, but instead jacked my program to protect the IP for all 3d Artists. 

3d art is hard to do and it isn't easy to learn. I wanted to create this so that the work and the knowledge made by this art form isn't copied and printed out without the consent of the original artists or company that owns the right to it.  Need someone to help me piece out what my rights are and how I need to get my ideas back.  

Thanks.",05Aug2019,1
709," I've already tried posting this once on a different sub, so hopefully this works.

This is a throwaway and I hope it isn't too long. I'm 20m. I'm not going to describe the medical thing, but it should be known that my family was there from the beginning of it, and none of my friends were there when it initially happened. The medical thing will be represented as ""thing"" in the text.

They tend to stress me out by them being concerned for me. Its understandable that they are concerned, I'm not telling them they shouldn't be. The ""thing"" keeps coming up, and the same things keep happening. I feel more like an adult now then when I started, so I'd much rather check into the appointment (and all that other stuff) by myself then with a parent 3 feet away from me seemingly do it for me. I was ok with it then, but I also didn't know how to do it. I want to learn (and know somehow) how to do all this stuff like an adult.

I know they would disapprove of this, because they've rolled their eyes when I say things along the lines of me doing things for myself. Now they likely wouldn't be mean about it, but it would make them upset if I said what I said above to them.

I'm aware I have a ton of leverage, with me being over 18 (in the US) and considering it's my medical issue.

I don't know if it's worth nothing, but I'm tired of saying I've never drank alcohol just because my parents are in the room (they would disapprove). I just want to take this situation into my own hands, while still keeping my parents involved where appropriate.

Please and thank you for telling me how to go about this.",05Aug2019,1

715,"Ex boyfriend was and is hard into his drug taking. Barely ever sober, stoned all the time, took whatever he could whenever he could. Made it clear several times that he does not want to change and wants to spend his life like this. Encouraged me into his lifestyle and got mad at me whenever I refused to take anything. Was always belittling my feelings, experiences, etc.

He got along with my brother well when we dated. When we broke up, I told my brother of the things he had done that lead to me ending things with him. He was shocked at the things I'd told him, or at least seemed to be.

My brother just called me to tell me that he is coming down to the city I live in to spend the night with my ex, so I assume they'll be having a party with drugs there. My brother is in the middle of his love affair with that stuff as I was at his age, so I don't want to interfere too much. What bothers me (though I wish it didn't, as my brother is his own person), is that my brother is willingly hanging out with someone who caused me so much pain, and is aware of that. I'm also worried about the influence that my ex could have on my brother, as he had with me.

Should I talk to my brother? Should I leave him to his own decisions? Am I making too big a fuss about it?

TL;DR: Brother is spending time with my abusive, heavy drug using ex boyfriend, yet is aware of the things he had done in the relationship.

716,"So I’ve just gotten out of a fairly serious four year relationship, we had lived together for two of those years and were discussing marriage when it ended, leaving both of us devastated. This was about **three months** ago now.

Then about **a week ago** I met up with an old group of friends, including my close friend ‘E’. We both left at the same time and ended up getting the same train home together. It was then E told me that he had feelings for me, and had done for several years now, even before I broke up with my boyfriend. I was stunned for a moment but eventually told him I was sorry but it was too soon, and I wasn’t ready for anything like this.

He was very understanding and said of course I would need time to heal and not to worry about it. 

Now, that was true as I am still getting over my ex, but also I just don’t really fancy him. We are very close, we went to university together and lived together for two of those years, but I have never thought of him in that way and don’t think I ever will. I didn’t tell him this as at the time it felt unnecessarily mean to say ‘Even if I was looking, it wouldn’t be you’.

**Today** I’ve been asked out on a date by someone else, a friend of a friend, who I’ve met on a couple of occasions and really do fancy. I want to go out with this new guy so badly, but I’m worried as my friendship group is very close and I’m sure it will get back to E. I wouldn’t blame him if he felt like I’d lied to him, even if it was only to spare his feelings.

I’m not sure what to do, I don’t want to hurt E and I do want to go on this date. 

I feel like people are going to tell me that I need to talk with E but I just don’t know how this conversation will go. It feels horrible to call someone up that you’ve already rejected to let them know that not only was the timing wrong, but you also aren’t attracted to them. 

Would it be better to just go on the date and wait for him to come to me if he wants answers?

TL;DR: Recently out of a four year relationship. My friend told me he had feelings for me and I told him I wasn't ready to date, but in reality I'm not attracted to him. Now I'm considering dating and am worried about my friends reaction.",05Aug2019,3

722,"So a little backstory. I have been in work rehabilitation for the past year due to severe mental health problems.

I was discharged from rehabilitation on the first Of may because I was believed to be unable to enter the workforce for the foreseeable future which led to me applying for my countries version of disability. There were some problems with the application on my doctor's behalf (of which he has appologised and admitted fault as to make sure it didn't affect my application, he took 3 months to send in a summary of my illness and a confirmation of it when it should have taken 2-3 days and kept saying it would ""be done tomorrow"")

Well I have spent the past 3 months with no pay (I was supposed to get back pay for all these months though) but I just recently got my application denied on the grounds that my rehabilitation was not fully tried (even though it was deemed to have been fully tried by multiple professionals) because of one piece of paper written by someone I have never met.

But this has lead to me having no income until this gets fixed and even then there is no guarantee I will get the back pay so I am royally screwed...

I have 2 kids and a wife on maternity leave making less than 1k$ a month and we are drowning.. I don't know what to do and am looking for any way to make some extra cash for diapers and food... 

I am not from America so those online jobs only available to the US won't work for me..

724,"The place I work at collects the tip money out of the tip jars at the end of the day, and then divides it between all the workers at the end of the month (supposedly) by the amount of hours worked. 

This is done so that people who work in areas that don't have tip jars can also get a share of the money. I'm fine with that aspect of it and have no problem sharing the tip money.

However, I work in the area that by far gets the vast majority of the tip money, and I also work consistently more hours than my coworkers. I just received my tips from the month of July and I was extremely annoyed to see that the total amount was only $20. I made that much alone in tips this past Sunday (but obviously didn't get to keep it). 

Although a decent amount of people did work during  July and there were several events that required a greater number of employees, this still doesn't explain the low amount of tip money, since someone who worked far less hours than me still managed to receive $19 dollars in tips for the month. Last month, that same person actually received more in tip money, despite me working a lot more hours once again.

How do I approach this issue. Do I talk to my manager about it (she's usually very approachable and understanding) however I don't want to seem greedy, and she's likely already aware of how much money I've been getting since she's in charge of dividing the tips.

727,"Hello, this is gonna be quite a long post and i don’t think there’s a short way to explain everything.

i’m a 19 yr old male and i’ve always had support from my mom and dad. i stopped my education about 2 years ago when my anxiety went through the roof. a few months later i noticed i had was pretty much sad every single day and i didn’t really feel like going on. Some time after i got a mentor that should help me get out a bit more and just try to get me up on my feet again, unfortunately nothing seemed to help. this went on for about a year and i increasingly more depressed to the point where i started hurting myself because i feel like i deserve it. I have tried medication and therapy, but none of them seem to help at all. i feel like it’s a bit embarrassing but i have never had a girlfriend or had sex and it takes a toll on my mind. i feel like i’m behind everyone and that no one will ever want it love me.

Recently i could tell my mom was getting a bit annoyed at me because i’m not really getting anywhere and i don’t know what to do. a couple days ago she comes into my room and out of nowhere tells me she’s tired of looking at me and that i make her depressed and she wants me to find another place to live. to be completely honest i have never considered suicide as much as i do right now. i don’t have any money so i can’t get my own place, my dad doesn’t really respond to me for some reason so i can’t go there either. 

I’m completely lost at this point, i have been so tired of trying to get better all this time, i don’t really want to go on anymore. I don’t know what to do right now, i’ve been anxious for the last few days and i haven’t eaten at all.

ever since I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression, my parents never really understood how to deal with me. my mom has really taken huge steps to understand what I go through and help me through the process in the last 5 years or so, but my dad on the other hand, hasn't. he always asks me to this day if I'm taking my meds, if I need to go see a counselor again, and just pushing me away to professional help. I've always taken my meds and done what they say and my counselors have told me (and them when I would ask them to come to my appts.)  that they need to talk about it to me more and be more open to understanding. 

now that I'm almost 19 and still living at home (since I'm going to college) my dad still continues to bother me about if I am taking my meds and if I need to see a counselor. I don't need nor I haven't needed a counselor for almost a year now because I have all my strategies to help me understand my mental health issues, but I've never gotten him specifically to understand that I need to have conversations about how I'm doing or just to talk about anything. he never really listens to me and I feel like I am always talking to a blank wall when I try to bring up anything that is bothering me. his only responses are ""are you taking your meds?"" and ""I think you should go back to your counselor"" which really irks me off but also hurts a lot.

They are very nice people and I love them but the conditions are less than ideal and I do not know how to go about this situation kindly. 
Some examples of what I’ve noticed:
-13 year old cat walks around and has episodes of urinary incontinence. The urine has soaked through the carpet, floor boards, and hard wood. The smell hits like a truck upon entry. 
-Dead bugs in lights 
-Cobwebs and dust bunnies all over 
-jacuzzi bath tub with mold growing in the jets, lots of soap scum and other types of mold in the shower.
-mold on the bathroom ceiling. Their “solution” was to paint over it. 
-Toilets that haven’t been cleaned in so long that the white porcelain turns into a gradient from yellow-white to complete blackness.  
-A very sad roomba just doing its best with no other evidence of manual vacuuming or sweeping.
-Dead bugs between the counter and fridge
-Windows that turn paper towels black after one swipe of cleaning solution.

Back in school Ive got to meet some very nice people and we all still are friends! Part of that group was this girl. Lets call her Lea (not her actual name). She used to be that kind of girl... Well, she is not shy, but she doesnt talk that much. She rather is stuck in her own world and because of that, she rather is... special. Anyway, she is confident in her opinion and thats the point why I really like her. Lea is Lea. One cant compare her to anyone I know, maybe she cant even be compared to anyone that exists. 
The problem: I think of her very positively, but I doubt she likes me.

This year in March, I managed to meet all of them as a group. What you need to know as well is, that we nearly never meet, since our graduation. Thus this was a rare opportunity for us to meet. But as the evening continued, I got the feeling, that she really liked me. At this point you should know, that we stayed together for 3 nights. Thus I saw her the next day as well.. But she suddenly behaved contradictory. The day before she gave me the feeling that she was glad to see me and, well thats my point of view, kind of wanted to talk to me very much. Maybe I am wrong here, but it really was different to the times Ive met her before that day. Next day was the complete opposite! She didnt talk to me, she refused to even look at me and the weird thing is, the day after she kind of behaved in a manner inbetween. I dont know. It was strange. I mean, she always was a little strange, but that was kind of cute in its own way. The dreamy girl, thats not talking so much. But these days, she completely was out of role, if you want to express it that way. 

Even more weird stuff happened a couple of days ago. I wanted to invite the whole group to my birthday party. Now guess who, as the last person possible, did not react at all.. Lea. Hence I decided to message her and to find out whether she would be coming or not. Well. That was a couple of days ago, but she is kind of ghosting me. I did not try to send another message, because.. Well, it seems strange, from my point of view. Question is: What to do next? 
I know she is easily embarrassed, maybe I did something, that embarrassed her,but I am not quite sure whether this might be the answer to my big questionmark in my face right now. Thats because I am asking you guys! Do you have an idea what I should be doing next? I really want to see her at my birthday party. I mean, she is part of our group and if she is not there its not the same as it used to be. 

To come back to the headline: I really like being around her, because whenever she starts talking it reveals a great character. But... Well, I am that kind of bloke... When I am with my friends, I rather am quite proactive and like doing shit talk. I mean, its quite fun and I guess everyone is enjoying my behavior. But of course I see, that it can be stressful to somebody like her. Thats why I think she doesnt really like me and.. Well, thats the reason she refuses to answer my request. But I dont give up on her, because I really want her to come to my little party. 

I am looking forward to your ideas! Even this case turns out to be hopeless, I hope you enjoy to share your ideas! I really appreciate it!

I’ve had depression in the past, not sure if this was a coping mechanism I developed. If it isn’t great, I just can’t eat at all. I’ll gladly go all day with no food rather than lackluster food. My family will eat whatever. Expired food even. They’ll eat it. I can’t even imagine doing this. This greatly pisses them off. My family will eat leftover toast and peanut butter and jelly 3 nights in a row and then yell at me when I can’t do the same.

737,"The place I work at collects the tip money out of the tip jars at the end of the day, and then divides it between all the workers at the end of the month (supposedly) by the amount of hours worked. 

This is done so that people who work in areas that don't have tip jars can also get a share of the money. I'm fine with that aspect of it and have no problem sharing the tip money.

However, I work in the area that by far gets the vast majority of the tip money, and I also work consistently more hours than my coworkers. I just received my tips from the month of July and I was extremely annoyed to see that the total amount was only $20. I made that much alone in tips this past Sunday (but obviously didn't get to keep it). 

Although a decent amount of people did work during  July and there were several events that required a greater number of employees, this still doesn't explain the low amount of tip money, since someone who worked far less hours than me still managed to receive $19 dollars in tips for the month. Last month, that same person actually received more in tip money, despite me working a lot more hours once again.

How do I approach this issue. Do I talk to my manager about it (she's usually very approachable and understanding) however I don't want to seem greedy, and she's likely already aware of how much money I've been getting since she's in charge of dividing the tips.

741,"This is a really tricky and nuanced situation that I’ve let consume me, and I don’t know how to address it. 

I tried dating this girl a long time ago and it didn’t work out, and since then we’ve been pretty good friends. She’s the person I go to if I want to open up or rant or something like that because she’s so receptive, but she never opens up to me as much as I do to her. 

Yesterday we hung out for a really long time, and she told me something I had realized. She said that she “hadn’t found her people in high school.” She meant that she never really clicked with anyone. It then dawned on me that it was true, but I had always assumed that we at least had something, at least as friends. This made me think a lot about how I felt about her. 

I’m not sure that I can completely put my finger on how I feel, but it’s something like this: I find her insanely attractive, and she means a lot to me as a person, but she has never communicated with me enough to where I’d want to date her, but I still find her really attractive, so much so that I have to repress sexual desires for her. 

Sure, it may seem like the option is just to ask to hook up, but I have been fucking tongue tied on it for the longest time, and I don’t think it will be emotionally positive for either of us, i.e. hooking up and then leaving for college might emotionally fuck us up. 

But the fact that I’m hiding this from her seems so disingenuous, and I don’t know how to get it off my chest without saying something, but I don’t want her to think I’m coming clean just to hook up before leaving, because I genuinely don’t want to, for the previously stated reason. I feel like I have to get it off my chest because I will see her again on holidays and whatnot, and so it’s not like I can put it out of my mind forever and just forget about her.

Also, I’m usually a no regrets kind of person, but this has been festering in my mind for so fucking long that I’m really struggling here. 

Any advice on how to tell her this without having her think that I’m trying to get in her pants would be appreciated. 


TL;DR: I’ve been essentially infatuated with a female friend of mine for years, and I want to come clean before college just to get it off my chest, and though I sexually desire her, I don’t have any sexual intentions because I fear the emotional consequences of a one off thing before leaving to college.",05Aug2019,1
742,"So, I’ve worked at my current firm for 10 months. Management from top to bottom has made it abundantly clear they have no idea how to run a company. The culture we have is to bitch about how crappy it is to work there and talk behind others backs.

The annual raise is around 1%, so, our real wage goes down every year (assuming around 2% inflation). There’s no upward mobility unless a manager happens to leave. The benefits are average at best. We use to have work from home but that was cut. Now you have to call the COO if you call out. So, there’s no real incentive to stay.

We’re understaffed at all times. If someone calls out or has an off day, you are overwhelmed at all times. Even at full staff, it’s a 8 to 9 hour grind to get all your work in. People often have to skip their breaks and don’t claim the overtime.

Given it has only been two weeks, but I proposed ideas to help improve at least my department. Our managers our totally disconnected to how shitty this job actually is. We have lost more employees than we’ve gained since I started working here. In addition, we’ve brought on several new clients including a really large one. So, work load has gone up but employment has gone down. My manager is also a bully. She thinks we’re robots. She’ll act like we’re not doing enough when in reality she has no idea what is going on.

My ideas basically revolve around fostering communication. Anonymous suggestion box, weekly huddle meetings, managers checking in on work loads at key hours. I also proposed a re vamped hiring process that revolves around recruiting fresh college graduates. As I said it has only been two weeks, but judging by how previous suggestions by my co workers have gone, they likely won’t be implemented.

So, I know the obvious answer is that this is a dead end job and I should just move on but I’d like to reach a year. Do you think there’s anything I can do to improve the company? I’d like to boost my resume if nothing else.

I’ve considered basically uniting the team and doing stuff like actually claiming the overtime we work. Though, I feel that management might take this as an attack and it could potentially come back to bite me.

TL;DR: My company is poorly ran and managers don’t listen to ideas. Besides leaving, is there anything I can do?",05Aug2019,1

I'm living with my brother soon for 2 MONTHS maximum as he says he's going to let me stay there so I can quickly scrape together money to get an apartment and get my basic life in order (Which is very generous of him).

747,"Hi, Reddit. I guess you know why I'm here, so let's get to it.

I'm a 17 year old girl with Asperger's, ADHD, depression, and anxiety. I live with my mom, dad, and sister who is 3 and 1/2 years younger. We may be kinda dysfunctional from time to time, but I guess every family is like that. My sister is... complicated. For the most part my sister and I try not to get in each other's way. But she's always been angry and sad. She takes a lot of it out on my mom and me whenever she doesn't get her way and cries crocodile tears when she's forced to do something she doesn't want to do. 

Whenever we do fight, she would bring things from the past like how I would eat her food, hurt her when we got into fights (I was 7 and she was 4), etc., but stole my electronics like my ds, earbuds, switch and I'd have to get mom to help me reason with her. She also, believe it or not, stole my pasta and pulled my hair when I wouldn't give her some.


But it's gotten a lot worse now. Yesterday my mom, dad, and sister got into a fight because she wanted shopping money. My mom pulled me aside and says she might have symptoms of borderline personality disorder. When I looked it up, it made sense. Now to be fair, she isn't diagnosed yet, but once it made sense, I felt really guilty. My family wanted to be able to help my sister for so long but she wouldn't open up. My mom always cried whenever she got into arguments with her and it broke my heart. And my dad is normally a patient guy, but whenever they argued he would shout so much.

752,"Some context:  
My ex-roommate, lets call her Kelly, has always been a troubled person. We were friends at one time, but that went downhill when we got in an argument and she threatened to tell our landlord that I hit her to get me kicked out.

Needless to say things were strained from then on. I didn't talk to her for weeks. But we were on a yearlong lease together, and so we tried to patch things up. Or so I thought.

I think this is when she began to badmouth me to my friends. The same friends I introduced her to, since she was new to town. I gave her so much, and she just took and took, and she turned on me and stabbed me in the back.

Obviously there were many serious red flags. I learned that she has a dark and sad history of abuse from her childhood. Some of the worst sexual and physical abuse I have heard of. She never got the help she needed, and is deeply mentally ill because of it.

During the last couple of months that Kelly lived with me and my girlfriend, we began to find sewing needles stitched into our clothes. The first one was in my bed - my girlfriend went to take a nap in my bed and the needle went deep into her foot. We thought it was strange but not really suspicious.

The next two were found in each of our coat pockets. Stitched in such a way that each of us pricked our hands.

Went we talked about it with each other, I went into denial. I made up some stupid reasoning that maybe the sewing needles went through the wash and got in there that way. Which was stupid, because my girlfriends raincoat doesn't go through the washing machine. Not acknowledging that someone must have put them there is one of the greatest regrets of my life.

After my ex-roommate moved out, my bandmate disowned me and quit the band and said some hurtful things. Angry, I said some hurtful things in return that I regret. While telling my girlfriend about this, she confesses that the only way the needles could have got there was if Kelly put them there. Furious in this realization, I did another thing I regret. I went onto facebook to post about my ex-roomate putting needles in our clothes, without naming her. People were concerned, until my bandmate made his own post calling me an abusive liar. People really jumped on that bandwagon.

I was devastated. I went into, and still am, in the deepest depression of my life, a full three months later. I've tried antidepressants, therapy. I was able to exercise for awhile but I feel so defeated that it's hard to motivate. My thoughts of suicide are becoming more frequent and intense, though I dont think I could go through with it. I don't know what I would do without my girlfriend, she has been so supportive through this whole ordeal, and one of the only people who knows what really happened.

I made an earlier post that went into more detail, but it was very long and I don't think people read it. But it contains details of something else that is very troubling that I strongly suspect Kelly of doing.

Help Reddit. I feel like my life has fallen apart and I am struggling to keep it together. I've given up on trying to repair my friendship with my bandmate. I am trying to own my actions and be a better person, but I can't shake the deep sense of betrayal, and the fact that people think I lied about Kelly as an act of revenge has made me feel like a social pariah. I just want to move on but I struggle in a feedback loop of anger every day.",05Aug2019,5
753,"Hey there,

I come from a south Asian background and I’ve been living on my own for about 4 years. I originally moved out due to my parents financial dependancy on me becoming too much in addition to them be more conservative than me.... making dating a real challenge. I had lost a couple of relationships due to my parents being very traditional and being a little overbearing. 

My parents have since sold their home and moved into a more manageable house in terms of mortgage.... still a little high but much better than they were. They now are turning their garage into a bachelor suite and have been asking me repeatedly to move into it. The rent wouldn’t be much cheaper for me than I’m paying currently since I’m so much closer to work now and if I move back in with them I’ll be spending more on travelling into work. 

Since my younger brother has grown up he’s really pushed the boundaries of the conservative ideas my parents have so they’re more of a “turn a blind eye” to things that make them uncomfortable or they don’t agree with. 

Here’s the thing... I love the independence and freedom that comes with living alone but sometimes I get really bad anxiety and depression being all alone. And sometimes I worry about who will take care of my parents since I’m not around.... My brother is around but he has his own issues and isn’t really any help.

A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it.

759,"[i am rambling quite a lot but i have a lot of thoughts about a lot of things so I tend to over analyze ^^ ]


So I am now 18 years old and have a long history of  some minor and some mental health issues. All through my teens I’ve been weirdly clinging to any kind of diagnosis that would explain my weird behavior and always instantly freaking out if I did something weird I couldn’t really explain to myself.
When I was younger I had some issues with normal things like getting my hair brushed or getting along with other kids which somehow (I don’t know how to be honest) led to major traumatic family fights when I was about 9-12 years old. After a 5 day stay at a psychiatric hospital because of my suicidal thoughts I got transferred to their outpatient department where they first tested my IQ then referred me to another therapist who was supposed to do some kind of diagnosis with me. 
I went there about 6 times in 12 weeks without ever getting explained what was being diagnosed and only ever hearing the word aspergers once which I wrote down in my footnotes and later googled (not a good idea). Sometime after it was over my parents took me and my older sister to some kind of lady who just sat me down and because of poor communication she just flat out  told me that I have the diagnosis but she was the one who was supposed to ‘ease’ me into it, not overwhelm me and explain that it wasn’t such a bad thing.
Well, that failed. I got mad at my parents, asking them why they never told me and a “we always told you you were special” was just a touch too stereotypical and ran out of the doctors office really upset.
And that’s when the hardcore emotional abuse stopped (it still came through sometimes but the main event was over). My parents were telling me that they were sorry for what happened but “we didn’t know there was something up with you and if we knew we wouldn’t have gotten so frustrated.”

That kind of made me associate that having a diagnosis made my parents not emotional abuse me. And I used that to define everything about me, my whole life I was the child with all the mental issues and the difficulties in school, with peers and/or ever leaving the house for the most time of my youth. 
And I kind of did it without questions until I started being social again two years ago and weirdly running around using my mental health issues as a kind of shield and identity which, understandably, freaked many people out. Because at home it would protect from the worst and I was always scared that someone would hurt me so why wouldn’t it work in a new social group, too? 
I was always so invested in finding out what was going on with my mind (to be clear here, I didn’t invent any disorders for myself I just tried analyzing anything that I found strange about myself and putting a name on it, like my heavy fear of people, my depression, my selfdestructive tendencies) and with having actual issues that I never formed a true identity for myself because I always thought of myself as hopelessly disordered. 
Basically, instead of treating my obvious mental health issues accordingly I formed an identity around it, making them my shield for my parents and impossible for me to escape unhealthy thought patterns, gaslighting myself.

Now I’m concerned that because of my traumatic events I used my following mental illness to shield myself from my parents and got weirdly sucked into it. It sounds so fake to me and I am concerned that I can’t escape the victim mindest my parents put me into, get on to my own feet and start recovering and building an actual identity that doesn’t just involve me being always too sensitive and mood disorders. I don’t think that my issues are fake but the mindset of being a victim is just keeping me from getting any better and being a whole person. 

I know that they never meant to do it because they’re bad people, they’re just always worried and don’t really wanted to acknowledge that they did something majorly bad to me because they themselves can’t think about what they did. Or they’re just too stubborn to fix their own toxic behaviors.

I'm leaving the country in a month to study abroad through my college. My summer job ended about 2 weeks ago, and I have applied to a lot of places around time for a job, but havent had any luck.

762,"At the start of the school year in September last year, a Japanese international student met one of my friends. He was introduced to our table where we became fast friends. Eventually he needed a place to stay because his host family was going back to their native country for a month. Because we were such good friends, he stayed with me and my family. During his stay, he told us about all the cruel things they would do to him like steal his money, clothes, and pretty much make him a slave. He called the international student HQ(for lack of a better term) and asked if he could stay with me until he had to go back home. They said yes, and he moved in and got his stuff as soon as possible. We had so much fun and were inseparable for the most part. We had our arguments, but it was resolved quickly and we became inseparable again. He left at the end of June and we both referred to each other as brothers by that point, my family gave him a card that I had signed, and he wrote down a couple of sentences about how we met, and how when he came he had nothing to lose, but that now he was leaving behind his brother. We both cried and maintained contact until three weeks ago when he blocked me on Instagram for no apparent reason. He wont respond to anyone's messages from where I live of any sort. I tried contacting his friend and asking if he was alright and why he was upset with me. They said they would ask, but haven't gotten back to me, and when I asked if they had heard anything from him, left me on read.

763,"Hello, I'm taking encouragement from other posts on this Reddit and putting my own question out in the hopes of finding solidarity *fingers crossed*

The short of it is that I'm always dealing with this feeling that I have very limited time. So many books to read, so many stories to write, so many podcasts and informative material to consume out there that it paralyses me. I'm a huge geek and if I didn't have to worry about money I'd basically bugger off to a cabin in the woods and just read books all day.

There's even a word for it in German, torschlusspanik (sp?) Which equates to the feeling of panic as you realize the gates are closing on...something. For me, I want to continue learning and broadening + deepening my knowledge base, while also realizing that may never be a feasible goal. Hence the panic.

It may or may not be a common experience, but if it's something you have also felt or had to regulate, I am all ears to hear your ways!",05Aug2019,2
764,"Before I start I would like the following to be the goal of this post:

I have four points. The advice given need not be to all four points, nor does it need to be an all-encompassing perfect answer. A suggestion, an idea, an opinion or anything to help me take first steps to fight these are fine. (This also represents me identifying the precise problem as accurately as possible, in order to better combat it in future.)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

About me: I am depressed and all of my truly many ways to get rid of my depression have failed utterly. The standard course of action would be to get rid of the depression, because then everything else would clear up, but that does not seem possible. Accepting that I will continue to be depressed has had the highly peculiar effect of improving it: ""I am not all right, but it is all right, not to be all right"". So, at the moment this is not the problem as much...but the next thing is:

&amp;#x200B;

I am a nihilist. (And although this is a freeing view that keeps stress at bay...) I have nothing of interest to speak about to other people and they have nothing to speak to me about. I could speak about nihilism to them, but neither is that an argument I want to win, nor is anyone interested in that sort of debate.

All this leads to one result over and over: There is only one group of people who I can make friends with: The kind.

The kindest people I could ever see come to me, they speak to me, no matter how much I bore them with my trivialities, until finally I have worn out their patience, bored them to their limit and caused them to reconsider their generosity.

(It is so bad I've actually succeeded in boring other depressed people away!)

In order not to paint an utterly black picture of myself, I will state my only good quality: I am nice. If an action can objectively be seen as good, I will do it. If someone is cold, I will lend my jacket. If someone was about to miss the bus in which I am in, I hold the door for them. I eat less than I need in order not to waste food. etc.

And my other good quality I guess: I used to be intelligent. Before the depression, when I cared about doing things, I had top marks at school (how good that actually is, is up for debate...perhaps that school was to easy or something...)

&amp;#x200B;

So, here we go:

1: I do not know whether I should speak of my depression or not.

If I speak of my depression the relationship ends then and there (unless I am speaking to one of the kind people I mentioned.)

If I do not speak about my depression, I am wearing a mask.... I have not made a friend, no, now I am using a person to temporarily rid me of my loneliness, until they leave either way.

2: I fear speaking my opinion over pretty much any issue.

I live passively in any case...therefore I feel it would be unfair to interfere with other people's lives in any way. They have deemed their life important, which makes me want to step out of their way, as all my influence tends to result in a worse day for others.

For example: If someone asks if someone in the group could play music, I would prefer not to interfere with whatever I deem to be good music, for I do not think my opinion matters and they would be happier playing their own.

3: I fear I may be utterly incapable at making friends.

I do not posess the arrogance necessary, to claim that I could in any way be good enough for anyone to enjoy my company. Life has proven time and time again, that this is the case and I do not feel as though my loneliness could be deemed more important than other people's time. 

4: I fear I may never be loved by anyone.

Among the kind are girls who are so utterly pure, kind and selfless, that even I cannot blame myself for having moments in which I might consider wanting to be with them. But I have nothing to offer. I would join them on any chosen adventure, but in the end I am still a nihilist and I would be lying if I claimed to be excited about any future.

765,"I had a somewhat close group of friends in High School. We hung out at lunch, went to each other’s houses, had classes together, video games, drank together, went fishing, etc. etc. I knew I was one of the B-listers, but I was invited to get-togethers fairly regularly back then. Of those friends was a guy, we can call “Tim.” He was a cool guy and in a lot of ways I was probably closer to him than any of the other people in the group, and probably hung out with him the most.

After High School, I thought we all went our separate ways. I lost contact with all of them including Tim.

Fast forward 20 years. I have several of those old friends as Facebook friends, and have for years. I see that one of them has posted a picture of nearly all the gang of old, back together. Only people missing was me and Tim. No real caption other than “Just like the old days.”
 
I don’t know if it was the picture or what, but over the next week, I start wondering whatever happened to Tim. I can’t find him anywhere on the internet. He has no Facebook page. Then, I stumble across his name mentioned by another friend from the group, I guess one I hadn’t added to Facebook yet. It turns out that picture was the gang getting back together in 2018 to celebrate the life of Tim. The only other mention of him on the entire internet was a mugshot I finally found from 2018. There was my high school buddy, staring back at me with the dead eyes of someone utterly lost.
 
I was never contacted at all about his death, certainly not invited to the get together. I know it was many years ago and I wasn’t top tier, but it still hurts. I honestly could care less about all those people, except for Tim, who I now feel was the only one I should have stayed in contact with. Maybe I could have saved him.
 
I’m asking for advice as to whether I should reach out to any of the old gang about it. I feel they have erased me from their past memories, and I don’t want to talk to them other than to know what happened to Tim. They are my only link to him, and the only people who might know what happened. If so, how should I go about it?",05Aug2019,1

atmy daughters schools from 8th -10th grade, in PE she attends the swim unit and boys and girls have it together? Why is this allowed? Wouldn't this make girls feel uncomfortable and give immature boys an opportunity to harass and humiliate girls? And cause distractions and goofing off among everyday? Not to mention young boys will be shirtless around young girls and I think that is inappropriate especially in a school setting My daughter keeps saying she does not care but she is young and may not understand how wrong this is this just seems wrong especially at school. Giving a boys a chance to leer at girls like this this class also pretty much just gives students to look at all the other students in bathing suits. What is this a party or something? How is this appropriate for school? Why is the school providing an avenue for voyeurism? can people really say honestly that young boys and girls will concentrate on swimming while they are around each other in bathing suits and not goof off? That boys (who aren't known for sensitivity) won't use this opportunity to harass or tease girls? what reason do they have to put them together? They can easily separate boys and girls buy taking the boys of another gym class and putting them with the boys in the gym class doing the swim unit and the same with girls.

775,"So, I’m a sensitive teenage guy who doesn’t personally seem to care about anyone at one point, and turn out to be loving in the other. Love always comes first for me and one of my family members. I have a good sense of humor,  and I have a girlfriend who seems to love and care about me a lot. I’m getting the feeling that she doesn’t say anything nice about me and talks to one of her friends about some shitty moments I’ve had with her. I love her to death and all, but from what my mom told me was that she always runs her mouth as usual. Whenever I make a least favorite point about her, she gets so defensive over the fact why my mom and I don’t like the things she does and crap. 

Hell, I’ve seen some other girls who talk about their boyfriends a lot: “Oh, he’s so nice, you guys should see him!”. I never in my life got that. Before my girlfriend ended up preventing being “sisters” with her best friend, they were joking about me and shit, and she thinks that I have anger issues (which I fucking don’t). I like the idea about them joking with me, but I take that sort of shit as offense. Me and my girlfriend have four fights over bullshit since 3-4 months back, but that’s all in the past, I guess. 

I have gotten 80s in all subjects except for science, which was in mid-70s. When I started as a freshman in my new private high school, I didn’t get the honor roll. But I somehow surpassed my English final after when school is done. Before the finals, I told my girlfriend that I wasn’t smart, and she got in the finals. I’m not jealous or anything, but I’m honestly really proud of her. She said that I didn’t need to get the honor roll, and that I tried my best. I was so pissed to hear that last sentence, but you know. Live and learn, right? 

I feel like things are normal for every boyfriend and girlfriend, and there’s just me not knowing what to say, except for the fact I keep complementing her about her looks and everything else. I don’t socialize really well, and I don’t speak right either which sucks fucking ass. I feel sort of awkward whenever I’m around with her, unless we go in a conversation on FaceTime to talk about our summer or shit. When I asked her if I’m awkward over the phone, she says she doesn’t. But in the inside, I’m getting the feeling she’s bullshitting me.  I have low self-esteem and I’m not sort of an upbeat person towards everyone. I get happy all the time, my mom says I don’t have any problems. It’s just that I am really shy and overthinking too much, just like what my girlfriend says to me over the phone one day. Im getting the feeling that she doesn’t want a guy like me, but she will always love me. I don’t know why but I can feel that nobody’s gonna take me seriously at all, but it’s all in my head, you know?

Am I overthinking too much? What would i do? Is it hard to have a good upbeat personality like the others and try to change? What do you think guys?",05Aug2019,6

778,"I wanna start this by saying that my parents are actually really cool people and we have a pretty good relationship together. Also yada yada mobile formatting yada yada. 

That being said, my parents are keeping such a close eye on me that it’s not even funny. I’m a 16 year old boy with a younger brother and younger sister if that matters. It started when they installed our alarm system on our house. I didn’t think much of it, because a lot of people get them and I can see why they’d want one. However, I did find it odd that while they did arm our front and back doors, they armed my window as well (my bedroom is on the ground level). Their excuse was that someone could try and break in through the window,  but we have several other windows at ground level around my house, some of which don’t even have a screen. Yet the only armed window is the window in my bedroom. 

Another thing my parents have a have a habit of doing are what they call “text checks”. They’ll come up to me and take my phone right then and there and go through all my messages to see what I’ve been saying and who I’ve been talking to. They caught me saying some not so appropriate things to my girlfriend a few days ago, but when I talked to them about it they made it clear the checks weren’t going to stop. 

A few weeks ago my parents also installed security cameras around our house. I thought it was a little weird, but what really bugged me was that only one camera was pointed outside. There’s one with a view of our living room, the camera outside, and a third pointed directly down the hall to my bedroom. They activate every night when my parents go to bed, and I can’t leave my bedroom without being recorded on the cameras. 

However, the final straw was today. Another habit my parents have is to track where I am using find my iPhone. Today I disabled tracking for my phone and drove the five minutes it takes to get to my school to pick up my schedule for next year. When I got back my dad let me know that he wasn’t able to track me and took my phone and turned tracking back on. I was gone for a total of around 15 minutes. 

Is this kind of security normal? I feel like I’m always being watched and it’s really starting to stress me out. I’ve tried talking to them about everything I’ve mentioned, and they’ve made it clear that they aren’t going to change anything. What can I do?

It is 3 hours away from my family though. I am wanting to quit this job, it’s eating my soul. 

I recently applied to a job back around my parents (my dad told me about it/works there and I felt pressured to apply) and it pays 52/year plus a 15% bonus and 3% increase each year. The only thing is, it’s in the middle of no where (where I grew up) and I’d be moving back in with my parents for awhile.

During this time   she lost her hope in ever being able to live a normal live. Luckily after the operation she actually felt alright for the first time in years and was able to walk and live normaly again.
Sadly three months ago she injured her knee again and is now unable to walk without pain. The doctor says that this time surgery wont help and that she will have to live with the pain and pray that it gets better with time. After three months the pain is still there with every step she takes. Her whole life is more than stressful anyway and this is just too much for her. She is slowly losing hope and gives up. She is broken, she always brings me joy and supports me trough everything and now that she needs me i just dont know what to do. I live too far away to help her with errands or similiar things, so I am only able to support her emotionally. Every evening we talk over the phone, which usually was always fun or interesting before but the last few weeks every two days or so she just cries for an hour because she is so desperate and helpless.

792,"To be clear I'm used to being single, but the thing that bothers me is the feeling I'm not ever going to find love - this isn't without reasoning; I've *never* felt loved by anyone in my life. 

I feel I've not had a real relationship for around 7 years - I was in a long distance relationship for 5 years but only saw him a few times a year, and my last relationship last year was only two months before he became abusive. I've dated a bit but not the best luck, I'm dating someone now but he's an ex and it'll not become a relationship. 

All I've ever wanted is to love and be loved. 

I just don't get to meet people, I don't even have friends or go on dates (not for lack of trying, I just don't seem to connect with anyone), so the chances of finding the love of my life is unlikely. If no one wanted me when I was young then it seems all the more unlikely I'll be wanted now.

I'm 36, I've no desire to get married but I want kids and thus there's also a time factor here too. I'm trapped between feeling like I could have a tiny bit of hope of having kids (although I've been so busy surviving I'm not sure I even feel ready) and giving up...but I'm not sure what the hell I'll be without kids, womanhood isn't defined by motherhood but not having a kid to love or carry on the family line feels like a sort of death to me. 

I know there are people who were married and regret it but at least you had a chance with love, you had someone who you felt loved you at one point and who wanted you enough to want to marry you. I just feel I've not had opportunities like others have, at love or to have kids, and at my age realising time is almost gone I'm depressed.

I want to be at peace with this, but can't let it go.",05Aug2019,1

Fast forward to a few months ago, they've been talking to each other, and even developed a close relationship. I'll be honest, I was jealous at first. I felt left out sometimes and he would take her places. Sometimes, he'd tell me it was best to stay home. I just felt shafted.

This wasn't true, I love and trust him. I just felt sad and left out in my own relationship. So we used to argue because I had a funny feeling. Well, a few days ago. I was watching a video on his phone. The three of us were at a friends place hangin out.

I’ve always had these thoughts, but in the past couple weeks there’ve been multiple situations that make me think it’s time to go:

1. Love my job, but my company recently made some changes and ended up giving me 3 people’s jobs with no additional pay so I’m not as happy anymore. Also, a lot of the key people I really enjoy working with are leaving so I’m not set on staying. 

2. One of my good friends just told me they’re trying to move to Atlanta and we’d be room mates which would be great financially/socially. I also have some family and a couple other friends over there. 

3. I love my town, but it’s small and I feel like I’m suffocating at times because everyone knows each other and I just feel like there’s so much more out there. 

4. I’m an only child and extremely close to my parents/family down here and will miss them a lot and also feel guilty for leaving them as they get older. They say they’d move wherever I settle down but I feel like that’s selfish on my part.

804,"Please, help me.
My family used to life an amazing life in a middle class home. We were normal people. I went to a normal school. Recently, though, my family moved after my dad got a promotion at work. We moved into a larger house, where my family of 5 could live comfortably. We adopted 2 pets (a dog and cat), and they’re probably the reason i’m still emotionally stable. The house is in a wealthy area. I get self conscious about this often because I don’t want people to think I’m bragging about wealth whenever they ask me where I live. I hate it. My “friends” (if you could call them that) are all right spoiled brats, with a few exceptions that have similar stories to me. The elementary school my brothers go to is in a wealthy area too. It’s a really terrible place. The kids are mean to the teachers FOR FUN. The principle there doesn’t care about anybody AT ALL! I, luckily, only spent the 5th grade there. The middle school in the district is a lot better, since it’s more mixed economically. Anyway, all of that has an effect on my brothers. They’ve been going to that school for longer, and have had the spoiled jerky attitude rubbed off on them. They were amazing kids and great brothers, but now they act like jerks to me, and to my mom. And she’s emotionally vulnerable. I sometimes catch here crying because my brother yells at her for the simplest things. She can’t ask them to do chores anymore without them throwing a fit. I now do chores with no allowance because of this. My brothers use my things all the time, and don’t care if they break them. They just tell my to get mom and dad to buy another one. I USED MY FREAKING HARD EARNED MINEY ON THIS MICROPHONE TO FILM. TO EARN MONEY TO SAVE FOR COLLEGE. It’s annoying at LEAST.Today I’ve spent almost my entire day in my room because I can’t come out without hearing whining from my youngest brother, or yelling from the other. It’s ruining my life and my parent’s. I don’t know what to do. It’s given me anxiety to talk to people, because I think that they’re going to argue, or yell.

My mom is against it because she keeps saying ill die if i get it taken out but they suggested i get it taken out within the next six months to a year while im still young (18) and I'm really worried about leaving it alone until it becomes a bigger problem but im also worried about getting it taken out when im not having any problems or pain from it. I don't have enough money for the surgey because I just started working and id have to save up a lot because both of my parents are against it and would not give me the money to get it done.

813,"I know that title sounds dickish, but let me explain. 

Last year my gf and I bought ourselves a house. I was living in a shack on my mothers property before that, and as we were moving my mom and stepdad were separating. She ended up moving in with me as well as my 12 yr old brother, which already sucks because my place isnt very big. But I was willing to suffer through that to help them out. He took our spare bedroom and my mother set up shop in our living room. 

So after a lot of arguing, I finally agreed to let her smoke in her area. My gf smokes too but I don't, so I was kinda outnumbered on that. So thats the smoking room. Whatever, I'll live with it.

So here is my issues: she smokes all over my house still. I'll walk into my bathroom and it will reek like cigarettes. She will light a smoke and walk out to the kitchen and back. I know when I'm not there she smokes anywhere she pleases as well.

She also has a parrot that she lets out and he destroys my kitchen and poops everywhere. I have 8 animals of my own(ferrets, dog, cat, rats) and they are not allowed to bother her in any way. We clean up any mess they make, she does not. 

Also my brother. I know he is young and I try to be understanding but he totally disregards my rules and leaves a huge mess wherever he goes. If I ever try to discuss things he gets pissed and tells my mom who tells me to leave him alone because I'm not his parent.

Whenever I try to discuss anything with her she gets angry and calls me a tyrant. She justifies a lot of her actions due to stress, but she is super dramatic and shes been ""stressed"" all her life.  I lived with her for 25 years so I do feel kinda obligated to help her out, plus if I kicked them out the would basically be homeless cause she is unemployed. It is causing a lot of tension between me and my girlfriend because she doesnt feel the same kind of obligation as me.

Anyone have a similar situation? How do I deal with her without threatening to kick them out?

816,"Hi everyone, I (and my friends) are seeking advice about how to approach a situation with our close friend who lies/says things for attention compulsively.

To preface, this friend has had anxiety and depression since childhood. She’s told lies here and there but early in the summer it had gotten so bad and she’d lie multiple times when we hung out. It could be from something trivial (last friendships etc) to something very serious (abuse). Her negativity also started to consume her and we got worried. 

We planned to sit down with her to express our concerns but she actually ended up checking herself into a mental hospital for a week. We were worried ,but proud of her for recognizing there was an issue.

When our friend group met up several weeks later to catch up after her release, she continued lying about her hospital experience and then contradicting her lies with other lies. She’d claim she almost was sedated with a syringe, tried to escape out the window, made outlandish accounts of other patients and staff etc. It was clear these were fabricated and worst of all, every time we tried to change the subject, she’d revert the topic back to her or her hospital visit. This went on for several hours.

On social media she’ll either make statuses fishing for compliments or make statuses to gain attention from others, making others comment. 

Our issue is due to her mental health, we don’t know how to approach this situation without triggering her. We all want to be able to hang out, but it’s become increasingly exhausted and difficult. We really care about her and we want to see her happy, but clearly she is suffering.

Important to note she is seeing doctors multiple times a week and is being monitored.

TLDR: Friend compulsively lies and engages in attention seeking behavior. Due to her mental health issues, we as a friend group are unsure how to approach her.",05Aug2019,2
817,"My last relationship was with a girl (23F), who seemed very nice at first. As time went by, she became increasingly toxic towards me. She was always blaming me for everything, gaslighting me and projecting all sorts of things onto me. She even ended up taking advantage of me sexually when I was really drunk. After quite some time, I realised what she was doing, and that I wasn't to blame and I broke up with her asap.

This relationship definitely hurt me a lot and completely destroyed my self confidence, but it hasn't broken me down entirely as a person. There are still big periods of time where I'm genuinly happy, and I feel good. But there are also some smaller periods where I feel the exact opposite. They suck, but they're not the end of the world for me.

I have tried talking to some friends about what happened, but they have all sort of dismissed what happened and they said I shouldn't be looking so deep into it and just let it go. This really sucks, because I could really use some support sometimes, even if it is just someone listening. So this is why I am considering telling my parents about everything that happened.

The problem lies in that my parents don't know this relationship happened. My ex-girlfriend was afraid of how my parents would react if they knew her age, so she begged me not to tell them (which is not entirely unjustified). This meant that I was constantly lying straight to their faces about what I was doing and where I was, which on it's own is really bad, but they're also quite strict about honesty, so there's that as well ...

So, should I tell my parents? Or should I try to find a friend that is okay with listening to my rambling.

Side note: I'll also be fine without telling anyone, but it would be nice to just have someone to talk to when I'm not feeling my best.",05Aug2019,2

But I let her know I can somewhat feel that it is cold but it doesn’t hurt. After I said that she refused to treat me. She said I wasn’t numb enough. But there wasn’t actual pain?

827,"For a little bit of background, in my country everyone goes to college.Most degrees are useless but if you do not have one you are at a huge disadvantage.

I am in college studying economic informatics which is basically programming and economic studies.I just finished my first year and I have two more to go.But the thing is,I would like to go to another college, where they study computer science and none of this economics stuff which I am not interested in.I want to become a programmer and I would like to study only programming related subjects and for my diploma to say I'm a programmer.

The only reason I'm here is because to get into most colleges you have to take an exam and I realised way too late that I do not want to go to med school so I picked a college which let people in based on their grades during highschool and the final exam you take after finishing highschool.

I decided that I wanted to go and study computer science, so during my first year of college I studied for both the college I'm in and the admission exam for the other one.I had no free time but it was okay since I actually fell in love with programming and I was fueled by my desire to go to a better and more serious college.

And then I took the admission exam and I failed.I needed 0.04 more out of 10 to be accepted.I'm crushed.

I do not want to study economic informatics, I want to study cs.I dislike almost everything about my current college.I am depressed and currently the lowest I've ever been and the primary source of sadness is being in this college I do not want to go to.

I have the option to ""freeze"" my college year, which basically means I put it on hold for a year and then I can return.What I'm thinking is freezing my year, studying and trying again next year.The first year of college was fairly easy so I could study for both college and the admission exam but the second year is much harder and I won't be able to do both.If I fail the exam again I know it's time to give up and I can return to my current college.

Should I do it?
I really really want to do it but I feel ashamed.I feel ashamed because my parents always helped me financially and I failed them, I feel ashamed that I will be starting year 1(if I get in) at 21 years old when everyone starts at 19 and I'm afraid that something will happen and I still won't get in.I honestly feel like a big loser and this is really affecting me mentally.I think it's highly unlikely considering how close I was this time and how much better prepared I'll be next year but you never know.",05Aug2019,1
828,"I’m currently a 14 year old girl with two siblings: an 18 year old brother and a 5 year old sister. My mom is 38 and my dad isn’t present in my life or this situation. My younger sister has a different father than my brother and I, but that’s irrelevant.

So I was sitting in my room on my bed watching Drake and Josh (I started binging it recently) when I decided to get some food. I open my door to hear my sister throwing a fit over god knows what in my mom’s bedroom. She’s really spoiled unlike my brother and I. I continued to the kitchen and grabbed a bag of chips and a drink. As I was going back to my room, mom came out of hers yelling at me, saying she would throw all my video games away and such for no known reason. I walked into my room and turned off my tv then went over to my cousins’ house (who happen to live across the street). They’re also 18 and 14. We play CoD together a lot. Mom started yelling at me even more when I walked out of the house, saying I shouldn’t just walk away from my problems. But the thing is: she’s always told me to be the “bigger person” and avoid conflict. To walk away when someone is provoking you. Then I did exactly that I she told me not to walk away from my problems.

Is this normal? Do other kids get yelled at by their parents when they weren’t part of something? She’s not abusive or anything, but she does this kind of thing a lot. And she’s only ever like this when we have my sister;other times, she’s perfectly normal.",05Aug2019,1

Hi everyone, I'm a 18 y/o french guy, it started a few months ago. At this time i had some problems in my life that caused me to have a lack of self confidence, so i was very shy. Then, i matched with a girl on Tinder and we started talking, after a few days we called each other every evening to play online games together. It was nice and everything.

But one day, she told me she dont want to talk to me anymore, i asked her why, and she told me that i was too shy, and that i live too far away. I told her that i understand, and we stopped talking. I keep thinking of her today

Since then, i started to do sports, there has been changes in my life, so i have more self confidence, less shy, even if it's not perfect, it's better. And in a few weeks i will move to her city because my school is here.

I don't know if i should try again, my best friend told me that i should just wait until i find someone else, what should i do ?",05Aug2019,2

I’m young. I know you’re thinking this is silly and immature but I’m really at a loss. 

I’m 16F and have been dating my boyfriend 16M for a year and I really care about him a lot. He makes me genuinely happy and I love spending time with him. I’ve dealt with depression in the past which he and my mom are aware of and while my mom made no effort (despite me reaching out to her even when I didn’t want to because I knew she’d freak out or try and put me into a hospital) to help, told me to “suck it up” and “get over it” making pretty harsh remarks. It felt to me like she thought I was faking it and doing it for attention. She made thugs worse and made me feel worthless. My boyfriend on the other hand did everything he could to try and help me get over it. He made me feel important and loved. He always knew what to say and would talk to me no matter what the time of day was. I really owe him a lot. He saved my life in many ways. For the first time in years I haven’t felt suicidal or depressed and I have my boyfriend to thank which is why I feel so guilty for even considering breaking things off since he’s done so much for me. 

The reason my mom claims to not like him is because he’s “unmotivated, unorganized, and most of the time unprepared”. That’s what she says every time. I ask if we can make plans, she says no, I ask if he can come over, she says no. It’s been even worse lately. I haven’t seen him in 2 weeks because my mom doesn’t want us together. She’s tried to set me up with other guys and it’s insulting. I don’t want to deal with her bullshit and I want my boyfriend to date someone who he can hang out with and actually be with. 

I don’t want to break up with him. I love him. He makes me happy but my mom makes it difficult for things to work out. He deserves better but the thought of breaking up with him makes me incredibly sad. I have no idea what to do.",05Aug2019,1
832,"It is going to be hard to sum up everything from my pre teen days until now but here we go! My mom and I clash, and always have since I was young. She wasn’t in the picture much when my brother and I were young due to working late hours but once she stopped working those shifts, her and I would constantly go at it. My dad is super laid back and I am more like him. He would get us ready for school and make us dinner and night and put us to bed. Once my mom was home more, we fought about school related things, how I looked because she is extremely focused on her weight, she would tell me my hair looked better light than dark even though dark is my natural color and that’s was I prefer, and any decisions I made were challenged .. she claimed she just wants what is best for me but would never hear me out to figure out why I feel how I do or what my interests are. She claims she is being supportive and giving me tough love because “no one else will tell me straight up” but I disagree. There is always a way to say something in a kind manner and I am extremely sensitive. She tells me I need to toughen up. When I went through depression my freshman year of high school she told me to snap out of it and get the hell up. If I try to open up to her about anything in my life and then we fight, she will use those things I told her against me. She used to hit me but then eventually transitioned to verbally screaming and cussing. She says she is working on herself and has been much better but she has such a short fuse, is very stubborn, control issues and won’t admit when she is wrong. She doesn’t think she does anything wrong and tells me that I am manipulative and twisting her words when I repeat what she said that upset me, and that she’s been nothing but supportive. The biggest issue was when my parents said they don’t want to support me in school anymore because i couldn’t figure out what I wanted to do and kept switching my decisions even though loans were covering it. This was because they kept trying to force me to pick something, instead of exploring my interests. Many semesters have been wasted and the pressure overwhelmed me. Since then, I decided that I wanted to go for nursing and have been working on that. I took a cna course and ended up passing the written exam but failing the skills test, along with 5/9 of my classmates. I can schedule again so it’s no big deal. I feel confident, and my nerves just got the best of me. When I told my mom about this she told me that I am going backwards and I need to forget about this cna stuff and focus on nursing. (I just got a job as a cna and plan to work as one while I go to school and then apply to the nursing program next fall after I take my last prerequisites A&amp;P1 and A&amp;P2). When she said this it made me feel discouraged even though I’ve been working really hard. I find that now at 25 years old, and living with my boyfriend, things are not much better when we talk. I guess I have so much built up anger and sadness that I am not sure how our relationship will ever be good. I find myself apologizing when we fight to keep the peace because she never does. Any words of wisdom is appreciated. Thank you.",05Aug2019,1
833,"My friend admitted to me that he is a sociopath weeks ago. I'd kind of gotten over it because what else am I supposed to do. But I found out when he was younger he tortured stray cats, birds, frogs, pet turtles, dogs. I was shocked and just kept telling him to go on. Eventually I couldnt take it anymore and had a mental breakdown next to him. He hugged me and told me to breathe.

Me in my state thinking about animals asked how the fuck he could, he asked why I care and that normally people don't care about others animals. He sounded dead inside. It all felt so fucked up and told him I can't look at him. He got up and left and later I chased him down.

I have no one I can talk about this to. I'm visiting him again tomorrow. We laid next to each other until he had to go home.

834,"Quick context, I’m always the first one in a relationship/friendship to initiate a conversation, always. It makes me feel ashamed and embarrassed, but it’s never really changed until recently. I sort of vowed to myself I would do some culling of these ‘friends’ and not text anyone, wait until someone reaches out to me. The only problem is, it makes me sad and lonely and the temptation is really strong to just forget everything and carry on as usual. I want to just talk for conversation, but I also want to finally get my anger out and let these people know that they’re hurting me, whether they’re aware of it or not. It’s complicated emotionally, and I really feel I need guidance. I feel like no one cares about me, and this ‘test’ is just going to reinforce that.",05Aug2019,1

I help her around the house and do her business for her when she cannot like going to the store or taking care of the dog. I love her a lot and she is a very loving woman but she is a very very forgetful woman. She forgets to turn things off like the lights, and forgets to turn things until its too late like the food burning, or forgetting the animals outside or not opening the door and they use the bathroom inside the house. If it is not one thing it is another. I remind her but she will forget and keep doing it. It is just a pointless circle. Yesterday it was just back to back and at the very end I got very upset and I grabbed my hair and yelled half a curse word (not dumb enough to do that in her presence) and turned to her and she put her hands in front of her to protect herself as if I was going to hit her. I would never do such a thing. I felt bad and I apologized for getting upset and raising my voice. I am ashamed of how I reacted. I know that is unacceptable and I hope I never do such a thing again, and especially if I ever get married and have kids.

839,"I just moved into a new apartment complex. The first week I was here, my buddy came over with his young, very well behaved dog. She’s still a puppy, and is not aggressive AT ALL. We were outside having a smoke and letting the dog go potty when we noticed someone watching us from a doorway. My other friend (not the one with the dog) waved at her creepy tweaked ass and she started to ask us about the dog. She was mostly talking to my friend who was holding his dog’s leash and she kept asking questions like “do you live here” and “where are you going to be with the dog”. After she interrogated him for about a minute I got fed up with her and said “I live here and this is my friend. We’re just bringing the dog out to go to the bathroom.” She then continues to ask where we’re going to be with the dog and we say “Right here where we are currently.” She then tells us that she’s going to bring her dog out and that her dog is aggressive towards other dogs. We agree to keep our distance so as not to cause any problems. She goes back in to get her dog and then comes out without it, now telling us that we have to take my friend’s dog inside while she lets her dog out. I wouldn’t have been upset if it weren’t for her tone, obvious meth usage, and genera air of superiority and fucking creeping at us through the crack in her door. We politely took the dog back inside, even though she was being a total bitch. I decided from then on that I would take note of any aggressive behavior the dog exhibits, since I’m pretty sure dogs are not allowed here unless they are service animals. I may be wrong, but I think that’s what the policy is. 

Now, today I heard a loud screeching from a small dog and yelling in the courtyard. I went outside to see what was happening because it was very loud and guess who is on the ground holding her dog down? Tweak neighbor.  Standing in the doorway of another apartment is a young lady and her absolutely terrified teacup dog, the poor little thinking screaming in fear at the dog who I assume bit her or chased her or something, but they quickly went back inside. I then watched as the tweak bitch screams at and hits her pitbull in the face before she drags it back inside. 

In the future, how should I respond to her pushy demands that my friend not have his dog in the courtyard? I know she lives here but it’s her dog that is aggressive so what would you guys do? I don’t wanna go to the office because I’m not a snitch and I can usually handle things on my own. What sort of rights do you think I have to allow my friend to bring his small, clean, polite dog over?",05Aug2019,2
840,"   I work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven’t talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked away to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  👔  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and  said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she  come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled  to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone  and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back  at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.",05Aug2019,0

842,"So basically... I got fired last week from my job - it was 100% my fault and that’s the end of it.

I’ve been trying to find a job - actually for 3 weeks as I had 2 jobs, but I quit the first one a few weeks ago and have since been looking for a new job. Well.... nothing. And then last week I got fired from my other job.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t have any skill, my ultimate goal is to be a business owner but obviously I’m not really worried about that right now as I don’t even want to do that right now - just want to get a job for now to pay off my growing debt (since I’ve quit I’ve maxed out my credit cards). 

I’ve applied and called to nearly every place - similar industry - that I have experience in / that I’m interested in. But sadly, most of the places are owned by the same people / they’re all friends... so it’s really difficult to get a job. 

It’s been non-stop calls, non stop asking even my coworkers (as much as a hit it is to my pride, and even then they don’t even help me - which I never expected but I’m just saying that’s how desperate I am). I just can’t find anything...... I’ve even told my friends and they all say to keep trying and I’ll find something.

Well I don’t know for how much longer I can ‘keep trying’ because I’ve maxed out my cards, have a bad reputation, am not close to the rest of the people who are in this industry..... ugh I just feel like my life is going downhill...

843,"I don’t know if this is the right place to post this, or if I should be posting in r/relationshipadvice but I have no desire to discuss it with my friends because they really just don’t get it (which I’ll explain when I get into it.) 

A little background, I’ve had only two serious relationships in my life. I dated one person for a very long time on and off, from like 2011 to 2016, then the other I dated for a little over a year but we had a long, complicated history from when we were friends prior to our relationship. Other than that, I’ve never really “talked” to someone to where I really like them and they feel the same, but it’s not exclusive, I pretty much just (although rarely) hookup with guys that I meet when I go visit my friends at their other colleges or other situations along those lines, which stems from some “body image” issues I’ve been dealing with. I had a very hard freshman year of college, as my boyfriend and I had just broken up, and all my friends went off to college while I stayed at home to go to the local university, so the transition was really hard. It took me about a year, but last summer I became very happy, channeled all of my emotions into having fun and spending time with my friends, and was fully happy being single, until recently.
I am not the friend that guys ask my other friends “oh who’s your friend?” “your friend is really cute” etc., because I am the one that guys ask about my friends. I’ve been going through some major self esteem/body image issues for a few months that I haven’t really been able to accept/fully address until recently, and things like this just make it harder for me to be happy with who I am. What I’m basically trying to say is, how do I let myself be happy with being single, or how do I let myself accept that maybe one day the “perfect guy” will come around? Because I am beginning to lose hope, and I am very young yes, but it sucks hearing all my non single friends talk about either how sweet and amazing their boyfriends are, or about how all these guys talk to my single friends, because I don’t have that like they do. I don’t talk to any guys really, any guys I talk to are platonic coworkers or guy friends that are dating someone. I just don’t want to feel this way anymore and I’m trying to be patient, but I just need some advice.",05Aug2019,1
844,"(throwaway account)

So in February this year I matched with a girl on tinder, we went on a few dates, made out a couple times and then stopped seeing each other for about a month, no specific reason, we just sort of lost touch I guess.

A month after we begin texting again and resume going out, go on a few more dates once more and make out a few more times, never getting to sex because of a number of reasons that aren’t really important.

We continue going out but at a certain point she had to cancel our date, we rescheduled but she canceled again, and again, and again (4 times). Now obviously I get the message, she isn’t interested anymore. But she tells me the issue was that her dad was visiting and she kept having unexpected plans with him. Regardless I stepped back and we didn’t really talk much for another month.

A month later, again, she asks me if I’m seeing anyone and talks about how a few other romantic endeavors of hers haven’t worked out in the meantime (we were never really “dating” and much less exclusive), we go out to dinner just to hang out and then I ask her if she wants to go on another actual romantic date, she says yes.

Now Yesterday she text me asking if I want to go away with her for a long weekend in a couple weeks.

My issue is, I have no idea what my relationship with this girl is: we’ve known each other for 6-7 months now, went on dates, made out (although never having sex), go through long periods of not seeing each other but then seem to jump right back into it.

She might just be a very casual person but I have no idea with what attitude I should face this weekend away, are we going as friends, casual lovers? What do you think I should do and what’s your insight on the whole situation?",05Aug2019,1

I was camping with no wifi or service for two weeks so we never had the opportunity to discuss it again. On Sunday I texted them again with more official plans. 2 of my friends could make it, but the other 2 couldn’t. One friend has family in town and he didn’t have any control over that (although they’re in town for a whole week, you’d think he might be able to spare 1 hour for a close friend) and my other friend made plans with her grandma for that day despite knowing that’s when I’d be celebrating my birthday. Now, this isn’t what really frustrates me. I get it, life gets in the way. So deciding to be flexible, I invited the two friends to a family dinner the day before, which is when all of my family would be celebrating my birthday (I will be out of town on my real birthday). Friend 1 says she’ll only go if friend 2 is coming so she isn’t the only “outsider”, and friend 2 hasn’t asked his parents and keeps leaving me on read. I feel like friend 1 should be willing to celebrate my birthday with me even if my family is there, and friend 2 should just try a little harder and respond to me and ask his parents. It’s been like 2 days and the dinner is on Thursday.

These are both friends I’ve bended over backwards for. I come to every party I’m invited to, and get them $40+ gifts and they won’t even put in an effort for me. Even if they didn’t get me a gift, it’d be nice if they’d put in just a bit of effort because it would mean a lot to me.

853,"TLDR; My male friend doesnt acknowledge that his relationship is the cause of his depression and wants to commit suicide because his girlfriend is ignoring him.

I have a friend (M14) who is dating one of my best friends (F14). They are having so many problems in their relationship but he refuses to acknowledge that their relationship is the cause. His girlfriend, who we will call Ann, has talked to me about breaking up with him as he is really causing her mental state to decline. While the boy, who we will call Bobbie, really wants to save their relationship and wants it to continue even though Ann is really hurting his mental state. 
Bobbie has the mindset that he will get with Ann. He really thinks they will get back together in college if they were to ever break up. And they will most likely get married and grow old together. 
Personally I find this over exaggerated as they are super young. Many of our friends have told Bobbie that this will not happen but he refuses to believe it and will get angry, or lash out. 
Bobbie also has history of getting violent and depressed because of girls. When he was 10-11 he threatened and told people he would commit suicide because a girl didnt like him. And he is the same now, he has said so many times that he wants to die because of problems with Ann. Then the next sentence he will say how much he loves her and doesnt want to leave her.

If anything escalates I am talking to his parents. And I know this relationship is toxic so please dont tell me that. I would just like advice as how to handle him as a person. I would like to cut ties with him, however his mother helps me out a lot. It would be a bit hard as I live in a smaller town and here everybody knows eachother.",05Aug2019,0

I want to leave this state. How do people do it? Find a job then an apartment, or something else? How do you find an apartment if you’re across the country and can’t physically visit? I’ve got a little savings, but only enough to make a trip once.",05Aug2019,1
859,"I work as a Veterinary Assistant in NJ. My job is 80% wrestling with dogs and cats, and 20% lab work/diagnostics. On August 1st I was mauled/attacked by a dog on the job. I suffered a total of 6 bites with several puncture wounds from each. One on my left forearm near the crease in my elbow (which needed 2 stitches), another near the elbow itself, another on my right shin near the ankle, another on my right inner thigh, another on my right breast, and the last directly under it. Each bite came with a nice set of bruises, and a severe amount of soreness and pain. 

Needless to say I was rushed to the hospital where I received treatment (stitches, cleaning, and bandaging). The hospital asked that I follow up with and occupational health center (mine being Concentra) in 2 days. As recommended, I went on Saturday 8/3/19. I sat in Concentra’s waiting room for about 2 hours, and then saw the doctor for all of 10 minutes. He agreed that I had taken a pretty good beating from the attack, and then proceeded to write a note that said I should return to work that day with limited to no use of my left arm. 

I had a shift that day, so I ended up going in and working from 3-7:30 pm (a mere day and a half after being attacked, with the stitches still on my arm). I was told my options were - clock in and work to definitely get paid, or don’t clock in and hope the note would cover me. Obviously, I have bills to pay so I didn’t want to chance losing money. 

My chief of staff was in that day, so he took all my paperwork and said he would sort it out with HR once they reopened Monday morning. This morning he texted me saying essentially the same thing I had heard before - because the doctor’s note said I could return to work 8/3/19 I was expected to work doing light activities (answering phones, various front desk work, etc.). Only problem there is I do solely Technician work, and I’m not trained on the receptionist end. Also I am expected to use my PTO for any hours missed except for the day I was actually attacked, and for any days requiring follow up visits (which so far has totaled 24 of my hard-earned PTO). 

I decided that I needed to advocate for myself since the medical system and my company both failed me. I sent an email with photos of my wounds to the president of the company and the workers comp department. I stated that it was unfair that I was required to work with basically no time to heal physically, mentally, or emotionally. I feel as if I’m being punished for getting hurt on the job. Regardless of the fact that I could be doing other things around the hospital, I feel the bottom line is I shouldn’t have to. I’m still in pain, I still have stitches, and I’m not even trained to do the work they expect me to. Plus, I’m using up all my PTO just to get a decent paycheck. 

Does any of this sound correct?
Can anyone help or provide guidance?
Is the system really just that awful?",05Aug2019,1
860,"So I need some advice here. I (21m) had a huge crush on this girl (20f) my sophomore year. I am going into my final year of college and haven't been able to stop thinking about her since. Looking back, she obviously wanted me to ask her out in the second semester of my sophomore year. She would walk me home in the rain, snapchat me saying she loves me when she drank, and just was always real happy to see me. Because I am a bitchly, it took me until the last day of classes to ask her out. (First girl i ever asked out.) Long story short, she said she was seeing someone then and said no. 

I'm going into my senior year. I won't have any classes with her. If I'm lucky, I'll pass by her on campus once or twice. Should I ask her out over text? Should I wait to see her and then ask her? I have to tell her how I feel, one way or another. When she turned me down I tried, but never got over her. Any and all advice is appreciated. She still snapchats me a couple times a month so I know she might me thinking about me.

861,"Ok so me and my friend went travelling and it ended up me ditching him at security. Let me begin at the start we agreed to leave at 8.45am and he was late and ended up leaving at 9am. While he was eating breakfast I told him to hurry up and he continued eating slowly. At the airport the woman at the information point told us to hurry up as it was peak time at security, I started speed walking in response to this my friend strolled behind. When we did make it to security I got through fine but my friend boarding pass didn't work. The fact he was late and so laid back (and other stuff during the holiday, I won't mention it as I don't think it's important) made me go on without him.

863,"So just for a bit of context, my dad is a car fanatic and he owns multiple old/custom cars. I am 21 years old and going to college and trying to find a job that fits my schedule. I am currently living with my mom as my parents are divorced.

Last year, for my birthday, he bought me a 2013 Subaru impreza under my dad's own name and told me that as long as I keep it clean and I'm going to school/work, then the car is all mine. I keep it relatively clean and wash it every time I know I'll be seeing him and I see him once a week for dinner.

Fast forward to today, my dad got back from a week long vacation and noticed a spot of birdpoop (average sized) on my hood that was still there from before he left. He texted my mom saying that he'll be coming by tomorrow to pick up the car and that he will ""never ever give it back under any circumstances."" However he also told my mom that he intends to sell it to me at a discount or else he will be bringing the car to his vacation home
~400 miles away where it would stay. 

He claims that bird poop and other dirt in general will ""ruin the paint of the car."" I tried to verify using this using google but came up short. Without this car, I can't get to school and finding work will be difficult. I can't uber to school because it's an expensive round trip. I live at home and my whole family works. 

Is my dad's reaction to violating our ""deal"" unreasonable? Or am I at fault for violating the ""terms"" of our deal, despite the bird poop being inconsequential to the paint on the car? How do I handle this situation without setting off my dad who is already in a volatile state and raging about something as insignificant (from my perspective) as bird poop?",05Aug2019,1
864,"Just for context, I’m usually not a jealous person at all. Normally, I’m extremely happy for other people when they’re well off or in good situations that’s why I’m so frustrated at my current state.

Basically, the girl that I’m jealous of right now used to be my childhood friend. We were friends since 1st grade all the to 7th in the U.S.  I’m pretty sure our history is why it’s messing with my mind so much. 

She has everything, she has a gorgeous face, great body, smart, talented, rich, a supportive and cute boyfriend. She just has her act together and her life seems great. Granted, I know what I see at face value isn’t always the truth and there could possibly be things going on in her life that I’m not aware of.

Anyway, the reason these feelings got stirred up again is because I just got my school schedule and my ex friend posted hers as well and I realized we have a lot of classes together. It’s strange because we have more classes together now when we’re not close compared to when we were besties. That’s besides the point though.

I just wanted to ask, do any of you have tips to get rid of jealously towards other people? It’s been seriously impacting me both this year and last year. I constantly find myself hating myself and having a heavy heart whenever I have to see her and face her.

I genuinely feel like such a bad person for having these feelings but I don’t know what to do with them anymore.",05Aug2019,1
865,"One of my coworkers’ last day was last week and I’m feeling really torn up about it. We became work friends over 2 years ago and have been close ever since. He really helped me get by when I was having issues at work and was always there for me. We talked about our work and our personal lives together; he was someone who I could talk to about anything.

I’m just having a hard time reconciling the fact that I am not going to see this person who I spent 5 days a week with and who had become my best friend at work. I won’t be able to see him outside of work because he’s moving across the country for his wife’s job. I have other coworkers at work who I am friendly with, but I’m not nearly as close with anyone else. I know he was equally as sad about leaving as I was. I’m thinking about looking for a new job so I can get a fresh start.

Does anyone have any advice?",05Aug2019,1
866,"So, I met someone online through a shared mutual interest in a game. We started out as friends, and discovered that we share a lot of the same tastes in music, our thoughts on politics, similar tastes in games, similar life experiences, and many, many other things. Even the things that are different about us seem to complement each other really well. We currently live on the opposite sides of the Earth, but I do have the means to not only visit her, but also move there permanently, depending on how things go (to be clear, moving to where she is could also be a good career move for me as well - it's not just me being completely batty).

To be clear, I wasn't looking for a relationship. It more or less kinda fell into my lap, and surprised the hell out of me. We eventually admitted to liking one another, and things flowed from there. It's been a long time since I've felt this way about someone, and it's kinda exciting and nerve wracking at the same time. I'm planning to visit her soon during my time off, to see how well we gel in real life.

There's just one problem that bugs me about all of this.

I'm 41 years old, and she's 21 years old.

We've discussed this, and she insists that my age isn't an issue for her. But.. I worry about this a lot. I haven't been able to tell any of my friends about this amazing person (as much as I want to pronounce it from the rooftops for everyone to hear), because.. I know what I would have thought if I had a 41 year old friend who started dating a 21 year old, and I know how my friends would feel about it too. She's also told me that it'll take a lot of work to convince her family as well.

To be clear, she's worth fighting for. I mean... we're going to meet in person, and see how things go from there, but if we both still feel the same, then I truly do want to pursue this, and I'm willing to put up with whatever struggle it takes for us to be happy together. It feels like we have something really special here, and I don't want to just throw that away, but the age difference kinda worries me as well. I want to be fair to her, and it'd be a pretty big imbalance in our relationship.

So... what do you recommend, reddit? Am I a complete and utter creep, here?",05Aug2019,2

872,"Hey guys... 

I sincerely need the best advice that there is to offer about this situation. I am 21(F) and my ex is also a female, she is 28. Met her in college, she took me under her wing, I started to live with her rather than my dorm and eventually ended up moving in all of the way. The best and worst relationship I had ever had. I was 18 and she was 25 when I met her but we began dating when she was 26. Talking about her, looking at her, thinking about her triggers my anxiety. I love that girl so much. Basically, what caused our relationship going to shit is her lies, cheating and verbal abuse in the beginning. I accepted what she did to me and then I would cheat back to make her feel SOMETHING. She expressed that she didnt like it but she was so much mature than me and she dealt with it, because she knew why i did it. Eventually, I found out that her and my teacher were having a 3 year affair, before i even came into the picture and they were still having the affair. The teacher is married. We were still together and i was desperate to keep her and fix things because only God knows my never ending love for her. So, i decided to have a threesome with her and him so we could stay together. That did not help at all. She tried everything she could to fix that heartbreak. I eventually got over it, and I made her feel bad for a very long time too. But then we got back right. We ended up breaking up because I did something stupid, not cheating, but just something stupid, asking someone for drugs and she didnt like that so she left. I totally understand her. This was a year ago and im still fucking concerned about her. Imma loser for being so in love like this. She has another girlfriend now. I'm glad she is happy but i hate that someone else loves her. I still know her address. I planned to go to her hometown which is 10 FUCKING HOURS AWAY and leave love notes on her car door or her house door. I am unhealthy and i need help moving on.

873,"Sorry for the long post. TL;DR: very young, unsupervised children are ""playing"" in a potentially dangerous area and I'm wondering if that's normal or if I should call someone.

I live in a neighborhood where the back yard/grass area is open to the public and each home has a high fenced back patio. I often hear children playing and it's not that big of a deal. 

Today I hear some chatter while I'm engrossed in Reddit and Facebook. I think nothing of it until it registers in my mind as a child crying. I hear ""Please let me in! Please! Mommy I love you!"" Along with banging on the fence. 

Fear grips me but I do nothing about it. I'm not very strong with confrontation and probably wouldn't get too involved even if I saw where the child was. (I'm a wimp, I know)

It continues for a solid 10 minutes. I finally take a look but it seems the kid has disappeared. I'm extra scared now. 

I think it's over when I hear a mother on the phone laughing and talking loudly. ""oh great, she got her kid and it was all a big misunderstanding,"" I think. No. Not five minutes later, the wailing and banging ensues. I take a look this time. 

I see two kids around 2 and 3 years old. They are banging on the fence as hard as they can, crying and yelling. Then I see a face pop up over the fence. Not the mother, but another child. She's visibly older than the other two. 

She laughs and unlocks the fence, allowing the 2 year old boy to enter but locking the 3 year old girl out. The girl wails again. After another five minutes, the gate is unlocked and all the children move freely from the home to the back grass area. 

The two younger kids start to pick up large rocks and throw them around, even taking some into the house before the mother (still on the phone) yells for them to put them back. 

This goes on for a while. During this interaction the mother is nowhere to be seen but can be heard from inside the house every time the door is opened. The fences are ""auto-closing"" so there's no way she could see them in the grass area unless someone or something held the fence open.

My friend said I should call the police or CPS... I'm not sure. They went back inside after I banged on my window (which is what I was hoping would happen). So should I leave it be and mind my business?",05Aug2019,2
874,"By running away I mean running away from my family to another state or city, I know it’s dumb but hear me out. Maybe it’ll be a long reading.

I got my green card but I’m not a citizen yet, I’m 17 yo and I moved in April to the US with my dad (I used to live with my mom in Mexico) my dad and mom never got married but they are not together since I was 3 yo, recently my mom has been telling me that I ignore people etc etc but I swear that I’m not doing it on purpose, so she’s been threatened me that she’s the one giving me permission to study and in the US and that if she wants that I’ll come back to Mexico, the thing is that I don’t want to come back to my shitty highschool because believe me, they don’t teach anything at all, is one of the worst highschools, my mom says she doesn’t care if I get a year behind and that my dad will listen to her, I texted my dad about it, to not listen to my mom to listen to me too and then make his decision, she asked me when are we supposed to go to school to “inscribirme” (idk how to say it in english) and I said Wednesday and she told me “I don’t know if you’re go” meaning that she’s gonna think if I’m gonna go to US again or stay in Mexico.

I know this seems like she’s just telling me that to scare me but please trust me that she isn’t, I know her too much and she really means everything she’s saying, I don’t wanna go back to Mexico bc I won’t learn anything, the math teacher used to put us to draw and color the things we drew, I’m not kidding.

There’s not a legal paper saying that I should live with my mom so I know that at age 17 I can live with whoever parent I decide to live.

Also I can stay at my dad’s studio in the US, does she have any type of legal method to get the authorities make me go back to Mexico?

875,"Hey guys. To start off and put things into context, i'm thirteen, and as you can see in the title, this is about a girl. Now this girl dosen't go to the same school as me, but i live in proximity of her that i can walk to her house.

Anyways,

I met this girl in grade 3 when i came to this school. We never really talk much but in grade 7 i was put into a 7/8 split and some kids immedietly bailed out the first day. That left me with four grade 7's to talked to (gr. 8s were off the table). 

I started talking to this girl, and things took off. This girl is 7/10, really talented, (exceptional artist) fit, and smart. Now i'm a shitty person, but to some people i don't come off that way clearly, because those who do i think are exceptional people and i'm on my best behavior for them. However this girl is delicate. She's fun to talk to, we share intrests, but she has super overprotective parents. She dosen't swear, she is easily hurt, she gets sad over little things and is the ""family friendly"" type. The ""stay safe"" and ""no risks"" person. I knew if i acted like i always do she would be dissapointed and stop hanging out with me and talking to me. This motivates me to be a better person, and in the past two years i have imrpoved tremendously in every way as a human. Towards the end of the year, things really picked up and, well, you know. 

We exchanged gifts and headed on our way out the door to begin our summer. During summer, I was at camp and talked all about this girl and how much i love her to people I would never see again to the point of tears. I had been thinking about her alot throughout the summer but as they told me and my final descision was that i need to get back with her again. 

However, by the end of the summer, i had changed again and i deemed her of no value, i guess. I have always avoided making friends/friends out of random people because usually they aren't that great of a person/have a critical flaw i can't stand or the kind of thing im looking for. But with her delicacies, it became so much work to not be a complete retard and ruin it. I also don't like it when a friendship takes a long time to develop and is super slow progressing. With her, it took forever to get somewhere where it was meaningful but it crumbled became summer started. Now it was just... awkward.

School starts. We are in different, straight classes. I have no idea how to approach each other. We were really chatting at the start, because she initated it, and I couldn't back out. At this point, i know she really likes me for a person I am not. I can't stand it, it is so awkard. I never initaed a hangout with her. I never initaed a conversation with her. I was in tears some nights, and i knpw she knows i am avoiding her. I know she is hurt. 

The year came and went. I talked to her a few times, and she asked me out a few times to which I had to accept because there is no way out. Our conversations had degraded to the point where there was a month I didn't speak to her once. It is now summer, graduation was an awesome time but 95% of the students were in tears at the end. Many people were hugging me and saying goodbye because I am going to a new school, but she was really sad. She was in tears about it. I was crying too. We said goodbye.

She still texts me asking if I want to hangout, to which i all accept. But I still cease to ever start anything with her. She even texted me today.

Wtf do I do?",05Aug2019,1
876,"Basically, I’ve been in love with my friend for a few years now, and it’s been weighing on me a little extra lately, so I’m trying to decide whether or not to tell her. If you’d like the details, feel free to read on. 
We’ve been friends since middle school, but we were best friends towards the end of high school and all through college (we even lived together in college). Unfortunately, she’s been dating this guy for like 6 years. However, they probably wouldn’t be together had they both not known me. We’re all in the same circle of friends from high school, even though none of us live in the same place now and don’t see each other much anymore. I won’t get into every detail post-graduation, but essentially we both moved out of our apartment to different cities and I deliberately started to distance myself from our friendship because I was falling too hard and it was really difficult to continue to be such good friends with her. It’s been over a year since we moved out, and we barely talk anymore (probably because I couldn’t bring myself to respond when she reached out, so she eventually stopped), but not a day goes by that I don’t think about her and I’m wondering if I should confess my feelings, if only to provide her with an explanation for my actions and find some sort of closure.
I’m fully aware that telling her probably won’t change anything, and I don’t think she’d be surprised to hear that I’m in love with her, but I just don’t know if it would be worth it. It might cause us both a lot of heartache, not to mention we’ll see each other again sooner or later when all of our friends get together again, so that might be awkward.

877,"Not sure if there is a better sub for this, but long story short, my gf and I (shes 28, I'm 30) were living in Queen West in Toronto for a few years and loved it. We were in a beautiful area close to parks, forest, the lake and rode our bikes everywhere, going to markets and festivals and loved the vibe of the area. When that place got rats, we were desperately looking to rent somewhere. Her parents very generously offered to help us with a down payment on a condo. The only place we could find was in Mississauga, which is about an 1-1.5 hours from our family (though close for work for me). Its a beautiful newer building and is a great investment. 

The problem is, we have been living out there for nearly a year and a half and are both finding it soul sucking. It's only a 1 bedroom/2 bath and like 600 sq feet and we dont have lots of space. I am a musician and I have nowhere to setup, she commutes to Toronto every day, and we are basically just existing out there. Weve tried to enjoy local stuff, and explore, but neither of us really like the city.

Shes been pretty depressed about it lately and I'm feeling claustrophobic in there so I brought up the idea of renting somewhere either in Toronto close to the water, or even more east in the country where we could rent a beautoful place with 3 bedrooms for much much less. We can easily rent our condo out for $1800 or more based on the building, area and other listings I found. I know it doesnt make sense financially, but I figured if we rented our place and found somewhere that was like, $1200, at least wed be subsidizing it abit and would actually be excited about living somewhere. Selling the condo now would be a bad move since a new transit line is coming in right beside and lots of new developments innthe next 5 years will really make it rise in value.

Until finally I tag along with him and his gf again holding hands with me not his girl lol I jokingly said I’ll suck your toes 😭 so we all sitting down(I’m wearing sandals so my foot is bare) and he give me the “look at those people over there” and my dumbass looked and my foot was in his mouth my big toe and let me tell you that shit felt AMAZING and the stories not over I disclosed the fact that I had a boner like you can see it from my pants and this mans gives me a hug like dude I just said I had a boner and you never said no homo and like 2 minutes after they’re leaving it’s night time now and he’s like bet you won’t kiss me and I just stood there and he moved in kinda close but backed off  and said he didn’t like guys (probably because his girl was behind him) but he does kiss me on the cheek I didn’t like it but I didn’t hate it after but the way he’s kissing on my cheek again I was concerned I’m like chill and now that a few days passed by I’ve never been the same I’m irritated all of a sudden I’m crying lol and I’m really angry like anything sets me off because I did really enjoy getting my toes sucked but I’m like come on now you’ve done all this questionable shit and now I’m questioning my own sexuality like what should I do I can for sure tell you that I still like women but like idk if I’m straight anymore because before that evening I could tell you in a heart beat I’m straight but now I can’t even have a straight answer (pun not intended) or I’d pause what am I to do with all these feelings mind you him and his girl has been off and on for a while now even before I met them but how do I process this,05Aug2019,1

887,"Okay, so

i have something called a pectus carinatum, it's basically a bump on my chest that portrudes from my chest.  I've been begging for a brace up until november of last year, and I got one.  I thought it wasn't gonna be that bad, but i completely underestimated it.  I hate wearing the brace, and I've tried to reason with my parents to wear it less and less, they didn't give a damn up until about now when they made me take it to the beach house that i go to during the summer, slapping a rule on me saying 'i HAVE to wear it when im in the house'. At first i was okay wearing it, but it's gotten so bad to the point where I got pains in my chest like i ate peanut butter too quickly frequently.  I've tried calmly reasoning with my parents explaining what went on, they kept getting in my face, shusshing me whenever i tried to speak, I started raising my voice and my dad kept rat-tailing me with his bathing suit, growling at me to shut up.  When they left, I tried dismanteling it and trying to make it loose in some aspect but the washer was attatched to the screw at a joint, so the washer keeps spinning whenever I tried to unscrewing, slowly starting to get angrier and stabbing it with the screw, hoping something would break.  It wouldn't. I can't reason with them, I want to get it off, I don't give a flying damn if I have to live with this damn pectus the rest of my life, it's not even that bad, I want to get rid of it, it's been making me extremely miserable to the point where I've been fantasizing about strangling my past self into shutting up about not getting the damn thing. 

I can't throw it in the trash because then my parents would probably make me search for it hours on end then play passive-aggressive while simulateously grounding me indefinitely,

I can't call the doctor because they'll blow off the advice that the doctor gave me

I REALLY dont want to continue wearing it

I can't reason with them",05Aug2019,2
888,"In the modern world, the mainstream media and news are very biased in many different ways. How do I avoid this? Now, many of you might say that ""read multiple sources"", but what do I do when practically all sources are biased, not because they have an ideological agenda but because they simply want click/views/read etc.? Many outlets focus on fear-based and sensationalisation, which hurt my mental health, but at the same time I want to be updated with current global events. I want the good stuff as well but how does one find that?",05Aug2019,3
889,"I am going into my senior year of college studying music. Up until this point I thought I had it figured out that I would go to grad school for my musical concentration and go all the way through and get my PhD then try to become a professor in the topic. This summer I signed up for a study abroad with my friends, my girlfriend, and my favorite professor. 3 months ago my life made sense, I had passions, and I was content not knowing what was next. Everybody says that their study abroad changed their world and that it was the best experience they ever had. My study abroad changed my world, but I think all the wrong things happened. 

My favorite professor that was organizing the trip missed the ball on a lot of organizational aspects of the trip. Over the course of the study abroad we saw him at a very stressful time, and he didn't make most decisions with a clear head. He did things like make promises that he didn't keep, and telling us a lot of contrasting information. I felt that many of these actions left me personally in the dust, as they didn't always affect most people. Furthermore, he publicly argued with me on things that I thought I had his support on - things we had spoken one on one about in the past. It hurt a lot. In short, I lost a lot of trust for this adult that I rely on a lot academically and otherwise. He's not the only supportive adult in my life (not by a long shot) but academically he was the only supportive adult I had, and now I'm struggling with how I could've possibly thought he was as flawlessly put together as I always thought. 

Over the course of this trip I realized that the things I am studying and the things I like are not even things that I'm very good at. By my own standards I excelled at many things this trip (planning an entire week of travel on my own, speaking French and German instead of English, doing a really good job musically, etc.) but nobody recognized any of it. I did not realize how much validation I required until not a single person aside from my girlfriend noticed or was proud for me. God, that sounds so silly as I type it, but dammit I won't be able to get a job and succeed if I'm the only one who thinks I'm worth it. I didn't do these things for the purpose of being told good job, but watching the people around me get credit for things every day just made me wonder where I got it all wrong.

Since being home I have lost all passion for the things I thought were really cool about music. All passion for the things that kept me driven and kept me not wasting energy on thinking about the what-ifs. What if I don't get a job? What if I go to grad school for this then I waste money and hate it by the end? What if I can't function without the support of some kind of mentor? What will my family think if I can't shake this off and I have to do something that's not music related? I haven't even written the final essay for this study abroad yet because every time I try it makes me hate that I'll never be good at it. This next part is weird, but recently I've been getting really into the stuff I was into as a kid. I built sand castles with some kids the other day and I remembered the thrill of creativity that I got when I was a kid! I played my first game of D&amp;D (I used to be really into fantasy until I got older and responsibility took over my time), and it was great and people think I'm good at it! I downloaded video games that I love and I've been playing those and being reminded that I'm not broken, and that there are things I can enjoy. But these things are hobbies, not career things. I need to regain this kind of passion towards a life plan.

I've had these really odd thoughts that I want to be a secretary at a tech startup, or that I want to be a car saleswoman, or that I want to do paperwork in an office all day and come home at 5pm with no homework and spend time with my girlfriend and get to have hobbies. Literally fantasies of paying off my student loans and then saving money and being able to travel alone. 

In France I saw so many people living very different kinds of lives than we live in the U.S.. They have jobs that don't stress them out and they never had to save up for a car because public transport is so good. They don't have student loan payments and car payments every month, they got to just jump into life. Taking a bike ride and drinking with friends in the evening wasn't deemed lazy for the people I met. I know life is always greener on the other side, but I'm watching my friends do things confidently that they've been excited about for years and they're succeeding at that. I'm craving a stable life so bad. The kind where I don't have to rely on someone and it's within my means to help my wonderful mother and take her traveling like she never got to. I'm craving that stability and comfort so much that I'm scared any kind of resurgence in my musical passions won't be strong enough to make me less focused on stability. Part of me wants to do something stable that might be boring, but I think it will hurt to watch all my friends do exciting things. 

I've been told many times that adults aren't super human and that they can be flawed and unstable too, but I didn't internalize it until this summer. And now I'm realizing I have to make my own stability and I might not have much support in it - let alone help - from the older adults I always thought I'd have it from. But people don't always support the right people for the right reasons. And I'm struggling with what to do next. I am so grateful for all the opportunities I've received thus far in my life, and I feel like such a shit for not just being content with them. 

Would you do the stable, potentially boring thing? How would you regain your passion or find a new passion if you lost the old one? How can I strike a balance between doing things that bring me and joy and doing things that I have to do? Any advice at all is greatly appreciated. I'm sorry for the wall of text...",05Aug2019,2
890,"Hi, I am going to spend the rest of the summer in a small town where people go for vacation (there are beaches and bars mainly). I dont know anyone and dating apps are not popular there. Where and how can I meet women? People usually gather at the beach or at bars at night but they are always in groups.",05Aug2019,1
891,"Basically, I’ve been in love with my friend for a few years now, and it’s been weighing on me a little extra lately, so I’m trying to decide whether or not to tell her. If you’d like the details, feel free to read on. 
We’ve been friends since middle school, but we were best friends towards the end of high school and all through college (we even lived together in college). Unfortunately, she’s been dating this guy for like 6 years. However, they probably wouldn’t be together had they both not known me. We’re all in the same circle of friends from high school, even though none of us live in the same place now and don’t see each other much anymore. I won’t get into every detail post-graduation, but essentially we both moved out of our apartment to different cities and I deliberately started to distance myself from our friendship because I was falling too hard and it was really difficult to continue to be such good friends with her. It’s been over a year since we moved out, and we barely talk anymore (probably because I couldn’t bring myself to respond when she reached out, so she eventually stopped), but not a day goes by that I don’t think about her and I’m wondering if I should confess my feelings, if only to provide her with an explanation for my actions and find some sort of closure.
I’m fully aware that telling her probably won’t change anything, and I don’t think she’d be surprised to hear that I’m in love with her, but I just don’t know if it would be worth it. It might cause us both a lot of heartache, not to mention we’ll see each other again sooner or later when all of our friends get together again, so that might be awkward. Please let me know what you think; I need all the help I can get. I probably left some details out, so feel free to ask for clarification.",05Aug2019,1

894,"i know it’s kind of a weird question. i got pregnant when i was 17 years old. i’ve always had trouble making and keeping friends in general but now that i’m 19 and have a kid it’s a lot harder. 

i know there’s a stigma with teen moms being “whores” or “sluts” or they drop out of high school or bum off their parents ect. 9/10 it’s not true. i have 1 friend and i’ve tried so hard to make more but i can’t get past the small talk/get to know you conversation. when i bring up i have a baby things get weird.


i just really want to know, would you be friends with someone who has a baby? if you wouldn’t, why not?",05Aug2019,4
895,"this is my first post so I apologize if any of this is wrong. 

Small background about me: 

My mother had me at 15 and my dad was 20, he was also never in my life until I was 15 myself (I am now 19 almost 20). My mother was in and out of abusive relationships which ultimately effected me on how I think I should be treated by men and how I rely on them. My mother and I had a poor relationship, she was a very abusive alcoholic and as the other sister of my little brother, I would rather her hit me than him. 

Now growing up my family figured I had some sort of mood disorder, but it wasn’t until this past year (my freshman year of college) I got diagnosed with Bipolar-Depression disorder. I was also diagnosed with PTSD due to the abuse from my mother, extreme GAD and ADHD. Needless to say I take very poor care of myself. Not physically, but mentally. I still handle my business as I should, but mentally I just can’t seem to win. I finally caved and started going to therapy and that’s where she told me to work on self care. But I truly have no idea what that is. 

What are some ways to work on “self care”? Like I said I do basic things like a normal person would, but mentally I struggle to care about myself. What do I do to help that?",05Aug2019,1
