0,"My bf and I have had a rough relationship. We have been together 1.5 years and the first year he lied and deceived me and was always on tinder lying about girls texting etc etc..

I finally got the self esteem to leave after 1 year for good didn’t speak to him was really moving on not trying no contact but I guess that works.

He begged me promised me the world and for past six months he has been great except for one thing... his phone. It’s off limits completely he won’t show e anything to ease my mind. Nothing. I never snoop but have asked twice could I see something. He never leaves it down takes it literally every where with him and I have had enough. He says therapy couples therapy might help and he will consider showing me if she’s says he should.

I feel it’s a cop out and gives him time to clear his phone. I think he knows they will say he needs to be transparent and is looking for ways to cover.

I don’t know what to do he’s been so amazing but also he’s capable of what he did the first year. Someone just tell me what do if majority says drop him I will I’m so lost right now because he’s been so good but it’s seems so obvious to me even though he says it’s a privacy thing.

TL;drHelp!!! I don’t want to lose a good man if he changed but isn’t this a huge red flag?

1,"- sorry if this is long
So I’ve been with my boyfriend for 8 months I’m 16 and he is 22, ( where I’m from this is legal) and when we first started having sex we did use a condom, but I wasn’t on birth control. I was so scared I was going to get pregnant so I went to the doctor to go on birth control and also got a blood test to see if I was pregnant, which thankfully came back negative. From this blood test I was given a piece of paper with information about the test I had done which I just kept in my wallet and hadn’t thought about it since. Fast forward to 2 months ago my brother found out about my boyfriend by looking through my phone and threatened to tell my parents about him and threatened to hurt my bf. He never went through with any of this, until he found out I was on birth control, and told my parents everything.  Then yesterday my dad went through my wallet for some reason and found that piece of paper and both my parents confronted me about this paper and my boyfriend. I lied to protect my bf, because if they knew it was him they literally would’ve tried to hurt him or possibly kill him, so I said i had sex with someone at a party and I don’t know who it was because I don’t remember.
To make things worse, my parents are racist and my mum hates the fact that my bf is Indian. My parents are also kind of religious and were screaming at me asking me why I would do this and that they’ve lost all trust in me, and that I’m not allowed to go anywhere anymore. I haven’t spoken to any of my family since this happened, I have no idea what to say and how to talk to them and they won’t talk to me. Should I just wait this out until they confront me some more about this? I don’t know if they will ever let me out of the house again.",03Jan2019,1
2,"So I met this person by a housemate, who was his friend (after a time they were no friends anymore after a quarrel). He sometimes came to visit my housemate, they were mostly in the living room talking, watching tv and playing boardgames. Sometimes I joined them, I talked with him a few times when he visited. Sometimes I talked with him when I stumbled upon him in public. He made contact with me most of the times. But one time I stumbled upon him again, I asked him to add me on his phone, he smiled/almost had to laugh. So he texted me just saying hello. Later I texted him to come over, he said ok. In the meantime he was here he said I can’t come after this anymore, I’m busy because of work I got he said (work was also far away) later he left because he needed to get cigarettes to go smoking (he said he was sweating because he needed to smoke). One time I texted him If I can visit him, he texted no sorry my parents don’t know you. So I asked him If he wanted to visit me than, he said sure soon. And I asked him when can i expect you, he said I don’t know I’m still busy. After this he never texted me anymore, after a lot of months have passed, I texted him, he did not reply.

5,"My entire life I've been an only child. I am now in my 30s and recently (about 8 months ago) found how that I have a half-sibling who is about 15 years older than me and that we had the same father. I cried when I found out as I  always wished I'd had a sibling growing up and was just overwhelmed in that moment.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not close at all to the common parent and have a very small family (just my mother really). We've never really been close to any of the other family because growing up we just went our separate ways, there is no bond there. With the half-sibling, we didn't grow up together so we really were strangers at the start but both want to put in effort to get to know each other.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that time has passed and we've hung out several times I would say we've gone from strangers to friends. I've met my new niece and nephew who are really fun and crazy as young kids are. My half-sibling and I don't have a heap in common. We try to catch up when she comes down to where I am and I try to visit in school holidays so I can see the kids as well. We get along well enough and are still getting to know each other. I recently found out that I am bringing up lots of strong/sad feelings about my half-sibling's brother who passed away many years ago and that I am still in many ways a stranger to them. They said it is nothing I've done or said but they are still looking for our common ground. They find it weird to have this ""stranger"" come and stay with them although I wouldn't call them a stranger anymore, I feel like we've gotten to know each other enough that we're friends. Would we be friends if we didn't have the blood connection? Probably not but we're both putting in the effort and time to get to know each other. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am quite unsure what to say or do about this. I want to keep building the relationship, we missed a good 30 years of growing up together and I want to try to build that family bond over time but understand that I can't and shouldn't replace their lost sibling and that bond may never come. This is still all new to me. I've said if its too hard for them to just tell me because I understand but feel like there really isn't much I can do and am happy to give them space if they need it.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone else been through this sort of thing? How can I try to become less of a stranger to them? I feel like it will just come in time if it happens at all. I just know that I want to keep visiting, putting in the time and trying to build this relationship. I am not the the greatest communicator at the best of times so am possibly even doubting myself now that I am the limiting factor in building this relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Found out I have a long lost half-sibling and a niece and nephew, missed out on 30 years growing up together. Recently found out I bring up feelings of a brother who passed away many years ago which was unexpected and still feel like a stranger to them. Not sure how to help or what to do other than keep getting to know each other slowly understanding the bond may never come.

10,"So me(23m) and my girlfriend moved in together right after I graduated. 

We had 2 kittens Tony and Jasmine. Months into us moving in, Jasmine had to be taken to the pet ER. Tony liked jasmine and they would play a lot even though she would get mad at him a lot for being hyper. Long story short she had a terminal illness with no cure and we had to put her down. 😥

Fast forward a couple weeks and my girlfriend gets another kitten named Lucy. She didn’t want tony to be lonely all day in our small apartment as I work offshore for a month at a time and she works 9 to 5. 

Lucy has been with us for 3 months now and they really get along well. But I have noticed Tony does not purr around me and my girlfriend anymore and he doesn’t crave our attention like he used to he even avoids us touching him. The only time his is super friskier and purry is when we let him out into the hallway which he tries to go out constantly.

Any advice on how we can get him to be happy again or is he gonna be like this forever? We love our pets and do the best we can for them but I just wish my buddy was back to the way he was.

Any and and all advice is appreciated.

11,"TL;DR - I am not good at socializing, that affects me and I want to improve my life by getting better at socializing. Do you guys have any tips for me?

Hey Reddit! I'm a 13 year old male, and I am not very good at socializing. It is a problem that affects many people, and well...me included! So here I am.

So, I am in a basketball team. Where we need to develop a healthy relation with our teammates. Sadly, such thing is not an easy task for people like me. I've been playing for 2 years, and honestly, I don't feel a strong friendship with any of the people in my team.

Obviously, it affects my performance in the games and trainings.
I love to socialize, I'm all for socializing. But sadly, I am not an expert at it - pretty much the opposite.

This doesn't apply only to my basketball team, of course - I have a similar problem at school.
But it doesn't really matter where are we focusing. It is the same question I'm making for both cases. Do you guys have any tips to make me better at socializing?",03Jan2019,1
12,"I recently graduated from high-school and got myself into an institute in order to study accounting but I'm feeling a bit cornered today.

I moved out of my prior town with my parents who decided to follow me while I'm studdying in my school, this year alone cost me a fair amount of money. At first I was very happy to be able to enter this institute but after a couple of months I'm not feeling any happiness and any sense of accomplishment while studying there.

At the same time I was always passionate about trading in the stock market (been practicing for 1 year) and I have been making a fair amount of money from it. But apart from the money, I love trading and I never felt like that  in other activities I have ever done in my whole life. 

But my studies are hard in general but for me it is even harder since I don't really find any enjoyment in them and they are taking a huge amount of my free time so I can't really do anything else.

15,"So, to be clear, I love my job and it's benefits. Worked here about a year with no intention to leave anytime soon. I'm a swing-shift technician and only need to show up to the office IRL 2 days a week, while I can watch TV from my desk at home the other 3 days. Living the dream, right? I'm certainly grateful for it, but the problem I've been encountering is that I'm extroverted, or at least partially so, and the cabin fever has been building up.  


I split a single bedroom apartment with my wife, so I'm not in solitary confinement or anything, but she's often off working one of her part time jobs. I only moved to the Denver area to find work, and I'm finding people in big cities to be a lot more ""shut off"" when it comes to making new friends. All the ""meet people"" apps seem to be ""try to fuck people"" apps (unless I have that wildly incorrect), and local dancing scenes have the same problem. Anyone have advice regarding how to build/maintain a social network in larger cities? OR, things to do when working from home to keep yourself from going crazy?

Needless to say, my gf didn't go to work. She could hardly get out of bed. And, at around noon, she got a text from a coworker saying that they had already hired her replacement.

19,"Hey! 

So I literally made a reddit account to ask advice on this topic lol. Idk why I thought reddit would be the best place to go but hey, might as well see what you guys think I should do and the story is kinda funny anyway so fuck it!

So, as we all know, New Years came and went the other day, and I was down to put on a pair of heels and party in a 'lil sparkly dress. What can I say, I'm a hoe hoe hoe, and 2018 had to go go go! 

Context: I'm a 20 year old girl and because I used to club promote I was able to get me and my friend into a pretty nice club with free drinks for NYE, so we were excited to party like V.I.P's. A lot of people go to these clubs and ball out, and if you're there later than 2am you've probably been invited to an after party. Plenty of people there are (or more likely think they are) ""somebody."" Tbh, I think it's a bit pretentious which is why I stopped promoting, but hey I might as well go full glam for new years, and they can be fun now and again.

I'm also a total fucking idiot.

With that sentence as a precursor, let's talk drugs. I had picked up xanax pills that I get in from the US in the foil, I do not trust bars in the u.k. AT ALL. They're slow release, 0.5 medication pills, and I sometimes take them when I feel like being a bit of a nitty. Don't get me wrong, you can never trust any drugs (again I'm an idiot),  but I do test my drugs and do my research before I pick up. the foil is not even scuffed. I've had my friends prescribed alprazolam to compare them to check they're legit. I also know that if I take more than 4/5 over say a few hours I will black out. I took one before I go into the club, on my person I keep 7 pills and 2 bars (even though I don't like bars) that I wasn't planning on taking because I was drinking. I legit just forgot to leave them at home after picking up.

We got to the club and started drinking. I remember drinking 3 vodka cranberries and 2 glasses of champagne, so I was feeling kinda loose. By this time the xanax had long since stopped it's effect. It gets to about 2am and one of my friends offers me a bump of cocaine. It's just that kinda club. I stupidly agree to 2 bumps because I'm used to coke and am a twat (did I also mention I was an idiot?). 

The coke, alcohol, and most likely xanax means I black out maybe like an hour and a half. Next thing I know we're all outside planning to go to an afterparty. My drunk ass, dumb ass brain decides to take another xan. 

Anyone whos abused xans knows how unaware of danger this drug can make you, as well as indifferent and either very emotional or totally uncaring. My friend tells me to come with her and this guy she clearly wants to go to hook up with, I insist I'm going to the afterparty. 

RED FLAG NUMBER 1: The person I thought was a ""cool guy"" who invited me to the afterparty said my friend could come but the guy she wanted to hook up with COULDN'T. 

Normally that would make it a no go for me because common sense. In fact, at the end of a night out I'm normally sober and pulling my best friend out of some random guys car. How the tables had turned. I insisted over and over I would be fine, and would pick her up from the guy she's going home with in an uber on my way to mine. I wanted to go and do balloons with party people, not sit on a sofa while my friend hooks up with some guy. The so- called ""cool guy"" says he wants me to come, and he would make sure I got home safely and will be okay on my own. He even says he isn't interested in me, and he was just looking to party like I was. I'm going through a break up and am just not ready for anything with anyone else, even casual. Which I said and he was fine with. My friend begrudgingly lets me get into the uber.

We get to the afterparty in this nice ass flat, people are listening to music and doing balloons, generally having a good time. I offer the guy a xanax, and he says we should do some balloons. About an hour goes by and the two of us seem really cool, the after party is calm and everyone is chill. Then the guy makes a move on me. I say, like I did before I got in the uber, I was just down to party. He says that in me saying that I'm ""violating"" him. He goes on about how hes verified on instagram so I should feel privileged. (idk if this is true, see what I mean on pretentious though lol) He just repeats that me not maccing him all hopped up on drugs and booze is a ""violation"", which kinda upsets me tbh. I've had some issues feeling objectified and with assault in the past, and with what was in my system what he said got to me. I went quiet, and say that was never the kind of energy I wanted to bring, and if that was the case I can leave. 

RED FLAG NUMBER 2: Even though I ""violated"" him and he was offended because I wouldn't get off with him in some random bathroom, he says ""Okay, we'll get an uber to my car and then I can make sure you get an uber home safe."" 

My indifferent ass was like, yep, this is total normal behaviour. So I fucking agree.

RED FLAG NUMBER 3: When we go out he asks for MY jacket because it's cold. I hate gender roles don't get me wrong, but because of how much of a cunt he is I'm gonna say he's a MASSIVE PUSSY. I was in a mini dress and 7 inch heels and didn't complain for christ sake.

So we get to his car and I offer him yet another 0.5 and take one myself. Even though he's in his car he asks for my jacket yet again, and I stupidly agree. As I'm waiting on my uber, he asks for a kiss and gets kinda pushy. I feel obligated at this point and kiss him even though I'm not attracted to him. I know I shouldn't have, especially when I offered him my xans, but I just felt obligated and really uncomfortable and was ready to go home. That, at the time to me, and in my mental state, felt like the easiest option.

IMPORTANT FACT: he mentioned to me he was going to MacDonalds just before I got out the car.

I ask for my jacket back, pick up my best friend and go home and pass out into a very deep xanax sleep. If you know, you know.

The next morning, I get home but I can't find my credit card. I think I left it in my bag upstairs and don't worry too much until i check my bank balance to see £93 out of my account. The first transaction since midnight, was for a MacDonalds at around 7am. Right after I'd left his car. Not only that, he puts on his snap story that he's in a restaurant  that is on my recent transaction history, along with 2 £30 transaction's from a corner shop on my card. 

SO, THIS FUCKER, TOOK MY XANAX (THAT WAS HARD TO PICK UP SPECIAL FOR NYE), MADE ME FEEL OBLIGATED TO KISS HIM, AND THEN STOLE NINETY THREE FUCKING POUNDS OFF MY FUCKING CARD.

I called the police to make a report, they're going to call soon for a more in depth report.

I don't know whether I should mention the drugs, especially when I was taking them and had them on me. As someone who's seen how court goes in action I know that the way I was dressed, and my drug  and alcohol use will be used against me in court, even though that doesn't change the fact took advantage of my state and then used my contactless to steal from me. I don't want to get into trouble for possession, and what they could call dealing, even though I asked for no money in return

Should I just let the case go and cancel filing the report? I don't want to get in trouble, but despite how much of a fucking idiot I am I do ironically feel ""violated"", and tbh just in general taken advantage of.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR- BC THIS IS WHAM. I got high on xans coke and booze, offer some guy my own xanax, who then pressures me into kissing him, then pick pockets my card and takes £93 off my card. I'm scared of fully filing the report because I gave him my xanax and had it on my person and don't want to get into trouble.",03Jan2019,1

22,"Hey there! So at my high school it is a tradition for the musical cast to get the director a gift. Typically this is something useful (like a drill for set building) or something that the director will use to enjoy with their family (like tickets to their favorite baseball team). This is orchestrated by the seniors of the cast, and being a senior I am playing a part of it. 

This year is a very interesting year because our beloved musical director moved away during summer. As his replacement we got a first year fresh-outta-college lad. Being that our new director has no experience with our musical program he is unaware of the gift tradition. He is also an amazing individual who is exceeding all expectations.

26,"I'm a lesbian — 30/f (for context)

Yesterday, I went to my parents house. They're redoing some things, new carpet, new furniture, etc. They were talking about donating their furniture to a place that donates money to anti-gay campaigns and conversion therapy. This has been a topic of conversation before, but my dad is from Iran and still holds his values pretty firm (women belong with a man and in the kitchen, in this case). My mom always says ""he knows you're gay and he still loves you, but let's just not talk about it"" — while I have issues with this all together, I've been trying to slowly educate them rather than disown them like my dad wanted to do with me when I was 16.

Anyway, I asked them to simply donate the furniture to a different company. My dad stayed quiet mostly until I went to leave and then basically accused me of saying that because they're Christian and he thought that was why. I went on and explain, and he said ""what's wrong with that? it works sometimes."" and then I asked if he knew what conversion therapy was and I explained at length and he called me stupid, said I didn't know what I was talking about and basically said that's not what it is, that they give their money to fix people who are broken essentially. He said ""they have money, they go up to gay people, and give them the means to fix themselves because they have money to do it.""

At this point, I've pretty much accepted a lot of things about my family. They're never going to be the supportive people I want them to be with me in any way. They hold a lot over my head and I've been easing away from that to not be ""indebted"" to them in any way and I have a better relationship with them obviously now that they can't tell me what to do or whatever. 

Everyone I've brought this up with has made me feel crazy for feeling a way about it because to them it's not a big deal. ""they do a lot of other really good things, why focus on the bad?""

I'm not sure where to go from here or how to handle it. Do I just accept this as what it is? Do I distance myself more? Am I crazy for having beliefs that I stand true to? I mean, I feel like if someone came to me with this and they were as down as I was about it, I would be supportive and tell them they're not crazy, but am I missing something?

The texts were all innocent, nothing bad; the only “bad” thing was him saying he is lonely, to which she jokingly said he wouldn’t be if he hadn’t cheated on her and then said she is glad they’re not together because she is with me. I texted John myself a while back, and said to stop texting my girlfriend, then said I was kind of kidding and that it’s ok but he needs to not text her as much. He still texts her a lot, and now his friend has started to text her. Again, all texts are innocent, but I don’t like that her ex boyfriend and his friend she met text her so often. She asked me to not ask them to stop, as it will cause drama and she doesn’t want to have to be in the middle of that, but I really would like them to stop texting her so often. What should I do?

Note: I totally trust my girlfriend and I know she wouldn’t cheat or anything, it just makes me uncomfortable that these other guys are texting her so often, especially since one of them used to date her. I’m not worried about her doing anything, I’m worried they’ll try to do something like make a move or ask for pics or something.",03Jan2019,1

29,"There's been constant tension in our family (mom, dad, myself) as long as I (27f) can remember. I've recently moved home for a while as I've gotten a new job in my home county and things have gotten worse - I've lived away for most of my adult life. My parents have put me up in the basement (more like an unused apartment fully contained) but my mom always comes in an starts an arguement about how digusting the place is - theres never dirty dishes or anything like that but I have a lot of clothes, books, plants about the place. She recently came in when I was away for a couple of days and saw vomit in my bath room and has LOST it. I've had bulimia for half my life and she knows this. She is so angry for disrespecting her house like this. If I have a friend over we're not allowed in any common areas (like the porch overlooking the lake)  and they will ignore them mostly untill the friends gone when they will saw awful things about them. I get it, it's their house, but I get harassed daily for not being social enough and they think I don't have any friends and make snide remarks about it all the time (I do have a few very close friends for the record). My dad is very passive agressive and if I don't agree with him on something he will play the victim and bait me till a fight erupts then guilt me for it and tell me to move out. I'm a vegan and my parents eat a lot of caged meat and factory farmed products which causes tension, especially because my mom suffers colesterol and other health issues that come with being over weight. I've never seen my parents hold hands or be affectionate together as I believe I was unplanned. When I was a teenager (I was pretty unpleasant at the time as I was bullied at school and my parents wouldnt let me move becuase the school was prestigious so I stopped going) the tension was at its worst and everytime there would be a fight between one of them and me they would threaten me to get diviorced saying it was my fault. They never did but I get reminded of it still. I had a friend over for dinner and my father picked a fight with her boyfriend (who was nice enough) then got into me about my high school truancy when I was being bullied telling me how ungrateful I am - I still don't know why this was brought up. My mom says if she could change anything about me it would be my personality and she wishes I didn't have the beliefs and interests I do (I'm a bit of a pacifist). The realationship feels so unhealthy for all of us and I'm not innocent in it but because of my mental health at the moment (which I can't talk to them about or they will get angry - they see it as weakness) I don't know what to do or where to go or whether I will create this tension wherever I go in life. I get scared of change. I've got enough money to leave and travel for a long time but I still feel so trapped by their expectations of me.

30,I am adopting a one year old Siberian Husky tomorrow from a local small town animal shelter. The shelter went over a few things like not punishing them for pooping or peeing in my house at the start and how I should get heart worm pills from a vet clinic. Aren’t there shots I can get??  They also said to set rules the first day. Like if they were to lay on the couch and I let them they are allowed on the couch forever. And they gave me a medium sized ziplock bag of expensive dog food. A 25 lbs bag they use is 65 dollars. Are there any good brands of dog food that isn’t too expensive for a large sized bag? Any tips on the breed and how to treat adopted dogs. Or just dog owner tips? This is my first pet and a really big responsibility for me. I just turned 18 have a full-time job with decent pay and my own place but this seems like it’ll be more work. I just want to do everything right and would like tips! Thank you!,03Jan2019,1

I uncovered a dark family secret which although now socially wrong, it happened with some frequency until 100 years ago. I do not wish to say exactly what it is.

32,"Id like some input on these so dont scroll please.

Lets start with a bit about me because why not? 21 Male, white my favourite colour is red and I hate holidays I am in my very last semester of University for my undergrad. I am a business student and I can not wait to be done. Its not that i dont like school, i actually do but i want more and i want change. Im ready to start my life and i just cant see myself achieving everything i want. Im becoming restless and want to work and have money to blow on things i want without having to justify them or have my parents back me financially because thats not fair to them.

Bit more info about me,Ive lived downtown in a fancy condo with my best friends as roommates back when i first started university but have since moved back in with my parents about 2 years ago. (All of my buddies dropped out of uni so it got lonely and expensive lol.)

Anyways my problem is i just want too much out of life all at once and im wondering how do settle down? like what you may ask? Well, i want to move away from Toronto on to northern cali or florida maybe idk idc. I want a german shepherd named carter tha 3rd after my fav album, always have but never got one as a kid. I want motorcycles and a well paying respectable job in my field. Whats my field idk yet and i have no idea how to figure that out. I want these specific forks and spoons from create and barrel and a lotus exige. None of this makes sense to anyone but its all stuff i day dreamt of growing up and imagine what this time in my life would be like. Im a little lost tho.

I guess I know that I want too much all at once, but how do i stay patient? I started reading this book recently titled ""the happiness advantage"" and right off the bat it says something about how those who are happy achieve but most of us think that if we get what we want then we will be happy. Im not really happy as it sits and i havent been for about a year now. Perhaps this is why i spend all my time thinking about things i want to buy and what i want to do in the future. I cant live in the now its jsut far too boring. I dont do anything. I just sit on my computer all day watching youtube videos and doing the occasional school work. Im bored out of my mind constantly. I hate reading and iv taken it up. I want to get a move on with life.

Oh and just to touch back to my comment on wanting ""a good paying job in my field."" This is a new thing for me as well. I care very little about what people think about me right up until about a year ago. Now thats all that matters to me at least in terms of work. Is it odd that im not looking to be fulfilled by work but rather want a status? Like if il do any job it doesnt matter to me so long as it sounds good and pays well. Il work my way up at a bank, kick rocks for all i care i just need it to carry status and pay well. Sounds childish but i cant really help it, just the way im thinking right now.

Its like Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory. Im stuck in the psychological needs part but that makes it sound like im insane. I might idk lool. Is this common?

Thank you for your time and reading. Much love &lt;3

How do I figure out what to do in terms of career options without wasting my time?

38,"Yesterday, me and my SO went to visit her family about an hour and a half away. When we got there, she wasn’t in a good mood: I knew that I should’ve just left her alone, but it was an important occasion. We were announcing that we may be moving across the country for a job opportunity where I could be making double than what I am now. We jumped at the opportunity and with nothing holding us down here at home, we thought she would be happy for us.

It didn’t turn out that way. She went off telling me that, “I’m taking her baby away,” and “I’ll never see her again.” I told her the situation and she kind of calmed down afterwards. But that’s not the important part. She then stated that she was going to claim my SO on her taxes. She can do this since my SO is a full-time student and under 24 and we’re not married, yet. However, we have been living together for over a year now and I have provided for my SO gas, food, housing, leisure, and ensured a future for us. The mother hasn’t done anything for us. My SO even moved out of her house the day after she graduated. Not a single time has her mother asked if we needed help with finances. Though her mother is not well off by any means, even the offer would’ve been good enough. Let me reassure that I’m not looking for a handout. I make good money and can provide for us well enough and then some. But to have the audacity to just tell us that she’s claiming my SO was aggressive, rude, and invasive to our relationship. She felt as though she was owed something, in this case, a dependent, but she has done absolutely nothing and I have done everything. 

In the end, it’s my SO’s decision since it will affect her mostly, but I’m appalled at the idea her mother feels this way.

How should I take this? 

The mother said, “This will be the last year”, but I know she will try to do the same thing next year if we’re not married by then. 

I’d love to help her out anyway I can, but she (the mother) put herself in this situation. 

Let me note, if my SO’s mom does claim her, it would be illegal per IRS tax law and subject to repercussions.",03Jan2019,1
39,"(Disclaimer: Not a native speaker but I'll try my best (and also not a good writer))
So a few months ago I have found a letter from this girl. She was my best friend until I was like 6 years old because then I had to move away.

Afterwards we still kept contact through sending letters for around 4 years. But my memory from this time is pretty vague due to bad times so I don't really remember why we've stopped writing.

On this last very letter that I have found she says that she has moved to another house and gave me her adress+ phone number with it. Honestly it was one of the cutest things I have ever read. I still remembered that she was really cool, she even played some Nintendo with me and Yugioh.

And ever since I have read the whole thing I thought about it. Maybe I could try to call that number. I am a huge nostalgic person and I'd really love to hear what has happened to that sweet girl that has written the letter 6 years ago. Even my best friend said I should do it but I just wanted the opinion of a far more experienced community as I'm only 16.

he stopped for like 6 months, then he started making more accounts to harass me with. he continued trying to blackmail me, threatened to rape me, threatening to hurt me, etc if i didnt talk to him because he “really liked me and had strong feelings for me” i kept blocking all his accounts and he slowed down, only messaging me once every 2 months with a new account. it was really annoying but i just kept blocking.
now im just done and im really disturbed. recently he made another account but he pretended to be someone that i thought that i knew from middle school. he catfished me with this account for like 4 weeks, i know im stupid because i had a feeling about it and there were some red flags but i honestly just thought it was my old middle school friend. i ended up finding out it was him and i blocked it, then ended up blocking another 3 accounts he tried contacting me with.

55,"Hello, I'm a 22 yo male and I have many childhood friends who make an important part of my life.
Thing is, as for the male friends, since we were kids, there is some sort of rule that says that we can't be emotionally vulnerable near each other.
The result for this is obvious: We don't talk among us about feelings, fears, personal affective problems, etc.
Back when we were younger, the natural attempts of opening up to a friend resulted in bad outcomes for the person trying to vent, we all did this and the culture was on our side, as man can't be fragile.
Well, now we are older and I can see myself taking this issue in a very different manner, I'm very open up! And I can instigate people to do the same. Unfortunately, this does not apply to those friends, there is still something about us that creates a very unpleasant feeling when those subjects come to shore.
Now, about the title I used. Its been a month since I'm living together with one of those friends, we have been close for 15 years now and there is a big emotional package that I know he carries and I know when he is feeling bad about recent events. We get along pretty well and we are having no real troubles with the house, but it hurts me to see a friend like that while also being unable to see a viable course of action to talk about this, because of the years of neglect.
Now to the advice part: Reddit, can you help or maybe empathize with my condition? How you think I should approach this?

56,"Hey everyone, I haven’t really ever been on this sub before, but I don’t want to talk to anyone I know personally, so I figured this is the best place. 

A little background. We’re high school sweethearts, been together now for almost 6 years and married for almost one.  Before we found out we were going to have a baby the first time, I already was saving for an engagement ring and planned to marry her, so having our first child did not pressure me into marriage and I do love my wife. 

We definitely weren’t prepared for our first child. We live with our parents still, switching between my family on the weekends and her family during the week, for babysitting purposes. I’ve had a steady job but not enough to move out, my wife has a job too, not as consistent and together still don’t make enough to move out. 

So here is the issue 

Our 2yo was born in September of ‘16. My wife and I were also born in September. She wants to have another September baby. She says she’s jealous of seeing people who are pregnant and having babies and wants another. She also says she doesn’t want our kids age gap to be very big. 

My issue is that, we can’t even support ourselves yet by ourselves. I applied for a union job that I have a decent chance of getting which would likely give us enough income to move out. But it is still an “IF” I get the job. I do want another child but I want to be more responsible this time around and to be sure we are self supporting before having another.

We have someone living with my family who is in highschool as am I and I genuinely cannot stand the kid. I was counting down until Feburary when he was suppose to leave and now it is extended to May and I am quite upset to say the least. 

I understand that it brings in money for my parents and that is very necessary. I would be willing to get a job to fill the gap and have told them this but they refuse. 

First of all, he never goes to school. He is in like an online school but they are supposed to go to a building to do their classes. I don't know if that makes sense but at the building the teachers are there. Essentially they go for like 2 hours and get lessons and then come home and do the work. Which I knew he wasnt the smartest kid when he moved in and that is fine so I offered to help him with his classes, as I am in some of the same classes and have completed some of the other ones despite him being two years older. However whenever I help it turns in to him practically forcing me to do it. I will stop and then he will do things like ask me why and essentially tell me to keep going while he puts his head down. At the end of the first semester I believe he had one class done on time because I would find excuses to leave, but the school gave him an extension. I realize his schooling is not my concern it is just how I somehow end up doing it for him. 

Next, he will make jokes about me and mock how I eat or what not. This would be fine expect my parents have made it clear that I am not allowed to do it back. Even when it is quite innocent I will get yelled at. So essentially I just have to take it which is fine. 

Something that I realize is probably not the best thing to do but for some foods I have literally had to start hiding them in my room. For example breakfast bars or what not we will buy a package and those will be all eat as I head out the door however he will eat whole packs in one day. So by the time I get home from school, he will have eaten them all while he stayed home all day which J realize is selfish to hide foods in my room it is not feasible for me to play 1 sport competitively be working out for another sport and be apart 3 school clubs and maintain my grades and be able to go shopping nightly. So I have resorted to this. 

While being on the topic of my room he will just enter it. You know like that half asleep state? He stays up much later than me and will walk in and just stand at my door and smile until I see him and jump. He stays up much later. Furthermore, while I am at school he will take stuff from my room. And this isn't just my accusing him I have found him using my stuff and asked where did you get that and he will say oh I just went in to your room and grabbed it. I do not have a lock on my door. 

There is a lot more I could say but I feel this is my main problems, I have brought them up to my parents and they agree with me on the majority but say they can't do anything about it because it's not their kid. 

Any advice would be appreciated. ",03Jan2019,1
60,"Found out today via social media that my childhood best friend’s husband took his own life on New Year’s Day. We were friends for 25 years but had a falling out due to me being unsupportive of her getting married in a courthouse after dating her husband for a month. I am very cautious and was genuinely concerned she was rushing. 

Anyway, this led to the dismantling of our long friendship. He forbade her from inviting me to the wedding. Understandable. I get that. Anyway, I haven’t spoken with her in about 4 years now. We still have mutual friends. I feel such deep deep sorrow for her and her child. It’s an awkward situation because we haven’t spoken in so long but I really want to offer my sympathy in the best way. Our mutual friends say that I should attend the services for him but I’m not sure if that’s appropriate. What can I do? I feel like a card is so impersonal. Anyone have any advice? 

Thanks to anyone who read this. ",03Jan2019,1
61,"I am 5'10"" 145 pounds.  I've always been really skinny, mainly because I am barely eat.  I have tried getting bigger before, but I hate going to the gym.  I think it is boring, and I am always a little worried about doing something wrong and hurting myself.

Furthermore I feel a little constrained by eating.  I have a bit of a throat problem where whenever i eat a certain amount my throat ""shuts down"" and I have trouble swallowing.

I just feel lost about the whole process.  I am a college student, but I am on an unlimited meal plan.  My goal is to get up to 170, but I'm aware that it will take a long time",03Jan2019,1
62,"My significant other and I recently had a rather serious conversation about next steps; he is very insistant on taking a small trip together. For background we were 'highschool sweethearts' and have been solid for 5 years now. I have some restricting medical issues in addition to being rather shy so everything has been a slow build up until now. Although we both are 20 &amp; 21 respectfully, each of us still live with our parent for financial reasons. 

My mother is very strict whenever anything involves me leaving, including driving up to college for classes. She does not bother however to help when my health deteriorates and is constantly upset at me if I miss events because of my condition. Our relationship isn't great for the pure reason that we don't share any interests.. Up until now I haven't pushed for anything until taking a trip with him and his parent was brought up. I'm rather scared to talk with her about this since her behavior is really unpredictable. Hoping for some help here",03Jan2019,1

How can I know if I chance with her? Since we're in christmas break I haven't talk to her face to face because we live in different town.

Tomorrow night our friend is celebrating her 18th birthday and I want to go, make the best impression on both my friends and on my ex, and behave in the most suitable way that a man should behave.

65,"Hi, I'm an 18 year old introvert. Who basically spent their entire youth doing nothing but staying indoors and wasting their life away. Which I really regret. Like... REALLY regret. And since I just recently got out of school I of course started thinking about my college life, and when college comes to mind of course partying is involved.  


Now seeing as how I really wasted my youth, I want to try and make it up a little by going out and living my life starting this year (happy new year!!!). Specifically, though, when I go out and start going back to school to get a degree in psychology/computer science/or whatever by maybe sucking it up and going to parties, getting over my anxiety, and just overall being social and meeting tons of new people... and maybe even dating again! After being single for like... two years, mind you.  


Anyways, on to the point. Since my parents decided to celebrate new years a few days after the ACTUAL holiday (because of my dad's crazy work schedule), I decided to ask them if I could get a bit drunk. After talking with them, they said yes. I wanted to see what my 'drunk self' is like (and to see if I even like alcohol to begin with). And I would rather figure all this out at home, where I know I'm safe, rather than later on at a college party and figuring it all out there, where I don't know I'm safe. My parents understood, seeing as how they were the party-goers themselves back when they were young. Please keep in mind that no where in the future do I even have plans to go out partying or drinking irresponsibly, and doing bunch of crazy stuff that I know I'll regret. And instead I just want to see how I even like all of this in a safe environment.  


My best friend, on the other hand, doesn't think so. Now I do understand that I am a minor talking about getting drunk, and it's irresponsible for me to drink at such an age. But I feel like if I wait any longer I'll regret it, like I've regretted it before. I've heard her side, and I do genuinely appreciate her concerns for me, but I wish that she would respect my choices like I respect hers. She says she doesn't HAVE to respect my choices, and though that may be true I feel like it's kind of a bitch move? Like I would try to see her side of everything, and support the choices she makes even if I personally don't agree with them (unless of course they were REALLY bad) because I trust her.  


During this 'conversation' (more like her just lecturing me about 'whats right for me' and me trying to tell her how i feel then her dismissing and calling it bullshit lol) I felt like she was being kind of controlling, instead of just expressing her concerns or her feelings on the matter, I felt as if she was actively just trying to not let me do something she didn't want me to do. I feel like my thoughts on the matter and how I feel is just really belittled here.  


Me: i've been waiting 18 years and i feel like if i wait any longer i'll regret it \[talking about how i want to start stepping out of my shell\]  
Her: that sounds like such bullshit but go off i guess since you're doing it anyways, do me a favor, and stay out of my dms and the server till you're done  
Me: wow  
Her: i've told you how i feel about it so i don't want to have to see it anywhere so if you're doing it anyways even despite everything i've said  
Me:  and i told you how i felt, and i respect your opinion maybe you should respect mine a little   
Her: i really don't have to   
(Please keep in mind that I did explain all that I've explained here to her.)   


Are my feelings about this valid? I feel like I should have a choice in the matter, and I'm hurt that she's just not at least supporting me (even if she doesn't agree with me, which she doesn't have to I respect that) and instead kind of just blowing me off without trying to understand how I feel. Or am I really just making the 'worst decision of my life' and being a bitch about all of this?  


Btw I get that this is all just, first world stuff lmao. But I do kind of need help on this matter, and I feel like the internet has some good nuggets of wisdom throughout here.",03Jan2019,1

69,"I currently make $32 an hour in a sawmill. It is a fast paced, crazy laborious and stressful environment and I am burning out. Hard. I have been looking for other jobs, and I found one job offering me $23 an hour making and installing granite countertops which would be a lot easier on me I’m sure, but that’s the highest offer I’ve gotten. I only have a high school education, and like I said, I got laid off for about 6 months in which I had to work in kitchens and didn’t even make enough to cover my bills. 

While I was laid off, someone pulled a hit and run on my car and I had to pay a $1500 deductible, and I accidentally flooded my moms house (that’s another story) which cost me another $2000. Over the course of those 6 months between those surprise bills and needing to feed myself and occasionally going out and having a social life, I ended up with about $7000 in debt. 

I’m now about $1500 in debt, so I’m almost out. But taking this pay cut will basically make it impossible for me to save money. I feel trapped. Is my emotional and physical health worth trading for my financial freedom? I have dreams of owning my own business and being self made, but by making my life immediately easier on myself I’ll be making my long-term goals harder to achieve.

Don’t get me wrong, I like my major choice and am excited for the future, but I really just wish I could fast-forward to graduation. 

I have never felt this depressed or anxious in my life. In high school, I was a cheerleader and on ASB, but now I don’t want to do anything.

74,"Throw away account, and long read. I’m 27 years old. Met my wife when I was 17, been with her ever since. We got married when I was 25. Had a kid shortly after. I fucking love my family, so this is extremely hard on me right now. I lost my job back before thanksgiving. Been working there since I was 18, warehouse job nothing fancy but it took care of my family. It’s been hard, and my wife has let me know everyday since the second week I was let go. I contemplated taking my life about a month ago because of the hints she said to me, threatening to leave me and take my daughter with her, saying she hasn’t been happy for a long time and so on. What kept me going was my little girl. But now I’m back again. I don’t have social media, my wife doesn’t trust other females. I’m not even great looking but that’s beside the point. She has one and my mother texted me photos of statuses she posted about how she was tired of being with me, she even accidentally messaged my mom talking bad about me and how she doesn’t love me (our moms share the same name, she clicked on the wrong Kim) and I’ve been living in my car, at a Walmart parking lot ever since this has happened. I’m at wits end. She clearly isn’t suffering. No texts or calls. I left her all my money, so she can take care of my little girl and herself.

75,"My new ""roommate"" (couch surfer) just talks and talks and talks. It's mostly rambling. Usually pointless. 

Anytime someone starts a conversation it quickly turns into him monotonously droning about and dissecting a specific aspect of the conversation, which no one else was focused on. (EX: If I said ""it would be awesome to see a unicorn"" he would say ""yeah but you have to be careful unicorn watching, if you go too much you'll trample the grass they eat and they'll starve"" except way longer and 100% serious the WHOLE time) Then once everyone has stopped talking (AKA no one else is interested in being a part of the conversation) he still just goes on and on. It can be for minutes, no exaggeration. He'll even pause for a good 15-20 seconds and then start right back up again, right where he left off.

If he happens to start a conversation, it's rarely a conversation. He just starts talking, illiciting dazed nods and ""mhmm""s from whoever he cornered.

At other times, if he hasn't talked or been talked to in the past 5 minutes or so, he'll just start making random mouth noises or vocalizations. Just starts like making fart noises, or like going  ""boooooeeeep boiiiploooooeeee"". We have all witnessed him stomping for no reason before.

I don't know how to ask him to be.... Less... Obnoxious? I don't even know if that's the right term, because he's not loud or especially overpowering. It just NEVER ENDS. It doesn't even matter if the TV is going.

There was ONCE I was able to interject a simple ""you're rambling"". He took it well, smiled, agreed, and quieted down. I believe I've been over thinking it since, because I get nervous every time I want to. It's probably because I know that at the point I've decided to say something, I'm going to be too irritated to say so calmly.

I don't want to hurt his feelings, or God forbid cause some sort of emotional trauma from blowing up at him if he catches me at a weak point when I can't just tune him out or I've had a bad day or something... 

I haven't snapped at anyone in years, but when I do it's bad, and he has me dangerously close. Especially added onto the several other significant stressors that have entered my life recently (health issues, finance, family, etc).

Anyway, if anyone could help me carefully broach this incredibly frustrating dynamic I would be eternally grateful.

TL;DR: Roommate never stops talking/making random noise. Also monopolizes conversations, frequently resulting in him monologing for minutes on end. Very frustrating. Trying not to hurt feelings. ",03Jan2019,1

78,"As title says I have a crazy coworker that I would love some opinions on. First I’ve been self employed for almost five years, I had some medical bills that I incurred and I got a part time job to pay them. I work at a large retailer and in my department I get along well with everyone, to the best of my knowledge except, a person who I’ll call “Kate”.

I’ll give some context, I’m a white male,33, 6’1, 190 and I work extremely hard at my job. I’m very polite and friendly with everyone, I’ve been working at this job for three months. When I was younger I was considerably overweight, and I sharpened my manners and social skills to make people like me and not be “invisible” I hate the place I work, and the job I do, but bills need to be paid and I must carry on. I’m also a US Army Vet, I have been diagnosed with PTSD and Anxiety. I guess I give off the “stereotypical veteran” vibe more than I think I do. I was named employee of the month my second month working their, she won the award the month before me. Our boss is also a veteran, so we have that bond. Also one of our coworkers that she is “besties” with, a man, I have struck up a friendship with, so he talks to both us. I believe she envies me for those two factors.

My coworker Kate is a very odd person. She is the kind of person who is extremely overdramatic. She is married, with two kids, but never talks about them, yet gossips endlessly with her other fiends about our coworkers behind their backs. I am the exact opposite, I bore everyone talking about my GF and don’t gossip at all. “Oh my God!” Is the phrase I hear her say the most. 

Her behavior is very erratic. Sometimes she will be friendly and all up in my personal space and conversation. Other days, she will ignore me our whole shift. When I speak loudly, out of necessity, she will act as if I’m a brutish caveman who poses an immediate threat to everyone’s safety. It really hurts my feelings when she does this, but I try to be like Jesus, and forgive, because she knows not the damage she does. On one occasion she told me I looked “empty” inside and it made her sad.
On another occasion, I made a mistake with a customer, corrected it, and went to inform my boss, only to find Kate had already told him.
On another, she commented on the size of feet and hands, saying “you know what they say...” 
Today, in front of our mutual friend she tells me “You must have a mirror in your pants, cause I can see myself in them.” 

My thesis is she is trying to pull some head games on me because she feels threatened by me professionally and is jealous of my new friendship with her friend, and the serviceman’s bond I share with my boss. Then again, I’m the one trying to rationalize an erratic person’s behavior.

Sorry it’s so long, just trying to give as much info as I can. Any confirmation or contradicting thesis is welcome along with advice on how to combat her in the workplace. Thanks!

80,"Here's the background information: my freshman year of college, on a camping trip, this guy (we'll call him Eric) reached into the sleeping bag of one of my friends and aggressively felt her up for an extended period of time. my friend told me the next morning but asked me not to tell anyone. She was really embarrassed and wanted to try to handle this by herself. I.e. not handle it because no one can handle something like that by themselves. I was too young to know what the right thing to do was, or at least too ignorant to ask.

Eric knows that I know what happened and I've actually talked to him about it a little bit but never really got any resolution on it. Our other friends who were on the camping trip don't know anything and they're still friends with Eric. I'm in this weird middle ground between her and my other friends where I'm still kosher with Eric for them. If that makes any sense.

My younger brother started going to the college I went to my senior year, and became friends with a lot of my friend group. It's now been a couple years, my brother is still in college and looking to move into a different apartment next year. Possibly with Eric. I don't know how to tell him I'm uncomfortable with the situation without telling him why I'm uncomfortable with the situation. I'm still not sure it's my place to tell anyone. I don't feel like it's my story to share with others (except on Reddit apparently). 

I know Eric has gotten some counseling about his actions towards women, but I believe that was before he assaulted my friend. So I'm in this really weird boat and I'm not sure how to proceed.

Any advice would be helpful. I'm afraid of my brother not taking my concerns seriously since I'm the protective older sister.

Not only does she seem interested in sex, but she doesn’t seem interested in even making out, which we’ve only done once. Other times when I try and make a move, she tells me to pay attention to the movie we’re watching or something.

I’ll probably be away for 6-7 hours at a time for class, but would be more than willing to dedicate 45 minutes a day to playing with/walking this dog.

Would this be a good idea? Is this a responsibility a person in college could reasonably handle, given I chose the right breed for my situation?

I feel like everything Im doing is not worth it anymore. It really sucks and dont understand how people can be happy for me and be proud.

93,"Hes been dealing with depression for years now ever since his mom died. His step mom doesn't treat him the best and he legitimately believes his family hates him. He has exclaimed that he feels like an obligation to them more than anything, despite his dad talking to him about it. He has less than no self confidence when it comes to every aspect of his life. He believes that everyone in our friend group sees him as the least important when I would argue the exact opposite. He is on meds that have seemed to help but about once a month or so he will have a complete and utter breakdown where no matter what you say, nothing gets through. For example, he is planning on asking a classmate of ours out in the near future, and had a breakdown over the possibility of her rejecting him. He isn't afraid of being rejected, but that she wont want to be friends with him at all afterwards because he ""isnt anything special and she would have no reason to go out with him"". He has acknowledged that he knows it's ridiculous, but he still feels the same way. He overreacts to every small negative thing that happens in his life and blows it way out of proportion. Nothing me or anyone else has said to him gets through. He continues to believe what he wants to believe. Being supportive doesn't help. He cant get a therapist in the area because they've all either been booked or didn't take his insurance. We've all told him to try an online therapist and he continuously claims that they wouldnt be able to help him. 

He told me earlier this year that he would never kill himself because he knows the pain it would bring his family. But being home for winter break has now made him feel unloved and he has made it clear he just wants to go back to school so he doesn't have to be home. If he doesn't feel loved anymore, then theres nothing stopping him.

96,"I'm so lost and need help. I'll make it short and try to sum things up..I have been battling depression for over 12 years now. I attempted suicide at 18 and its been a long road. I'm 28 now and the past 2 years I've had a lot of ups and downs. I started seeing a therapist 2 years ago because my wife and supposedly best friend kissed a couple of times and flirted with each other. I went by myself for about 8 months. My relationship was always rocky and then I caught her snapchatting and messaging her boss. Long story short, I left but came back because she acted like she wanted to fix things finally but ultimately ended up moving in with her boss and taking damn near everything we own earlier this year. At first it sucked but I quickly realised it was for the best and was somewhat fine. Money is very tight but i still tried to go back to therapy and he ended up stalking me and was inappropriate toward me so trust went out the window again. A girl I know and i hooked up 5 to 6 months ago. She wanted more than what I can handle mentally right now. It's harder to move on and date so quickly after a long shitty relationship. I just can't have feelings for anyone right now in my state of mind I can barely take care of myself. Well, a couple days ago she said she just found out she's pregnant. I'm fucking shocked and lost for words. The last time we hooked up was maybe end of july early August. I don't know what to do. I had plans to move out of state with some people that were willing to help me mentally and it was also for my dream career in fitness. I feel like I was so close to finally not having suicidal thoughts and getting better. Now that's all gone. I'm not the type of guy to not help raise the kid but I'm worried that I won't take care of myself. I don't have friends here, I hate my current job, I hate living where I do. I feel helpless like I'll never get a breath of air. I know i made a mistake and I have to deal with that. But it hurts. After my marriage ended, I wanted to actually start a family with someone I would marry and i don't want to marry her. She's great don't get me wrong, I just became very picky and my gut says she's not the one and I've ignored my gut for too long.

98,"21 male

I’m terrified of going through life repulsing and pushing people away. I suck at making conversation to the point some of my friends have told me so and stopped being friends with me because of it. My girlfriend almost gave up trying to date me when we first started because she couldn’t even tell I was interested.

I don’t feel invested in things the way other people seem when they talk to each other. I just don’t care enough. My friends talk about these things that make them so excited and I just can’t relate to it because honestly it feels like conversation is just bullshit noise to fill “uncomfortable” silence. 

I went to my girlfriend’s friend’s house for NYE and had maybe a half hour’s worth of conversation with anybody over the 18 hours I spent there. They talked and talked and talked about all manner of subjects and topics and I honestly just never had anything to add to the conversation. I feel like I can’t think critically and respond intelligently because I don’t emotionally connect to the things people talk about and it pushes people away because when I do choose to say something it’s off the fucking wall and doesn’t really make sense (as evidenced by people going “....what?” when I talk, even at work). 

I don’t feel like I care enough to engage people in conversation. Like, I couldn’t care less about how people feel about some topic. I really don’t. It kills me because it prevents me from making friends but I really just can’t make myself care about things. ",03Jan2019,1

A little background with my GF, they were 3 siblings and all of them are girls. The eldest has her own family already and a daughter. The 2nd one is my GF and their youngest who's the same age with me got diagnosed with the disease. Their mother works as a caretaker on a trucking services. She got diagnosed with high-blood pressure later this year. Their father is good for nothing bastard that doesn't care for them and he ignored their texts when my gf was asking for help. Last night their sister got rushed to ER because there's a problem with peritoneal dialysis. the liquid solution is not draining the fluid so we got worried. Right now my gf, her sis, and their friend is on the hospital 48.5 KM away from my place I can't go there because I have work right now.

I graduated virtual highschool two years ago but haven't made any significant financial progress as of recently. I've been extremely poor my entire life, while living off of government assistance w/ my mother. I'm planning to attend college soon, but my only intention is to get an extremely lucrative degree which will allow me to be financially stable in the future (regardless of happiness)... I've considered computer science &amp; business as possibilities, but I'm interested in making roughly 150k-200k, which I've been told isn't realistic in those fields. I've been offered by my aunt to work as an electrician while I study the trade, but it would require me to relocate to Seattle. I didn't take the offer too seriously though. I'm currently extremely scared for my future and I'm afraid I'll end up like my mother- who is working at restaurants at the age of forty with a worthless psychology degree. My mom has offered to take on my student loans free of charge but doing so would feel awful.
  
Getting back on topic, I need some serious advice. Not some ""do what you love"" type of stuff. I want to pay my bills and live comfortably when I'm older. My goal in life is to not worry about funds ever again, because the feeling makes me nauseous. I figure that I'm still *somewhat* young so I'm not completely screwed yet. What degree should I go for? I didn't get amazing highschool transcripts (1.90 GPA when I was homeless my freshman year), but 3.70 GPA during my senior year. I'm unsure which college would even accept me... 

I've never been great at math but I'm willing to relearn from scratch if it's necessary. That will probably hold me back from getting an engineering degree but I'll do whatever I can. I'm also willing to move for the job and work hard to achieve my goals. Anything to get out of this situation. Please help me decide what to do. My mom wants to move us to California soon with no jobs lined up, which sounds great and all but I don't want to struggle anymore. At this point in my life I'm no longer interested in friendships, relationships, etc. I just want to get rich and I don't care if that's an unhealthy mentality anymore. I also have undiagnosed aspergers so I'm somewhat isolated and have bad social skills but I want to improve them.

I have a counselor I see, but I don't like him because I think everything he says is a crock of shit.

123,"I have a scheduled appointment with a psychiatrist in February.

Until then, I’ve been drinking most nights to help subdue the pain.

I’ve been having terrible anxiety and panic attacks over the last month. They get so severe I can’t be myself.

I know it isn’t healthy but alcohol is the only thing that makes me feel normal.

I don’t get drunk, just buzzed enough to relax.

Are there any other healthier options for allowing me to deal with anxiety and panic attacks without alcohol?",03Jan2019,1
124,So I'm trying to give away some extra medical supplies I have. Found someone who wanted them. She picked today to meet up. I agreed. The time comes around and I go to the location at the agreed upon time. I message her letting her know I have arrived. She messaged me back saying she's on her way home from her uncle's funeral and if we could meet up tomorrow. I'm kind of upset that she didn't bother to let me know what she wouldn't be able to make it today. I took my two month old out in the cold and stopped eating so I could make it to the location on time. What should I do? I want to tell her to kick rocks but I feel like that's messed up. ,03Jan2019,1

All my 'friends' are too busy with their own shit and I consider them acquaintances at most. Talking here is much easier for me. Like... I want to talk to someone in person and I know people will say that but I just can't. I know that sounds like an excuse and I hate that part of me. School gives me so much stress and it's starting up tomorrow and I just feel a pit in my stomach. I HATE sleeping...

She seems to put on this fake facade of her being a happy go lucky personality to others, but immediately changes when I walk up &amp; talk to her. She even grits her teeth trying to talk with me.

127,"I met a girl I really liked during finals week and we've been talking a lot for the past few weeks. We've only gotten coffee once since we both went home and or overseas for winter break. For a while, things were going really well. We both were hitting on each other all the time, saying how excited we were to see each other again. She's gonna be studying abroad for the next 3 weeks and just a day or two before her flight, she started being really distant and taking 30 minutes to an hour to respond consistently when she used to always respond within 10 at most. 

We used to have really engaging conversations and now I feel like I'm talking to a brick wall most of the time. I'm just really confused because things were getting better and better as time went on and it really hurts that someone I was starting to get pretty attached to is  stonewalling me out of the blue. Most of my romantic life has been random semi consistent hookups, but I really like this girl and I'm trying to do things right so I feel like I'm really in over my head. Am I just overthinking things? Should I wait it out until the semester starts or should I ask her if something is wrong? I just need some more perspectives on this.

When I hang out with my dad and his new family, I'm usually the second youngest there, unless the daughter has friends over. And being a kid, she wants to have someone to play with, so it usually ends up being me. 

I heard through the grapevine that they've accused someone in the daughter's dad's family of touching her or something. This was early last year, I don't think anything came of it, but anyways. Knowing that, it makes me really uncomfortable hanging out with her. She's young, so she doesn't understand that doing things like sitting on my lap can be weird.

131,"So I moved to this new city with my sister. To help her out with my niece. She was going to school and couldn’t find childcare for my niece at certain times, with no baby daddy or other family in the picture, I decided to move here to help out. When she finished school, cosmetology, I let her move into my apartment with her daughter. No lease for her, I had two bedrooms and extra space so I decided to help her out. 

I have a very flexible job that lets me schedule things in a way to always be available. She on the other hand had to take a job that made her work nights and weekends. I was very upfront from the beginning, I can watch your kid when you need me, but since I’ll be taking less hours, I expected her to pay for utilities. Just electric, I have base board heating, and internet. She agreed and I thought everything was good. 

After a few months, just after Christmas, see decided to move back home. I was completely cool with it and supportive. (I get my apartment back so I was more than on board) I just got a bill for an overdue electric bill for $200 past due and a shut off notice. Now I can pay this and I will, but when I brought it up to her she hung up on me, after saying she doesn’t have any money and I should just pay it.

136,"I know we’re only friends and we’ve both made it clear that there are no strings attached, but it still feels bad whenever I find out that he’s talking to someone else. He knows I talk and see other guys and I know he talked to and saw other girls in the past, but we’re both fine with that because we live in different states and we’ve established in this whatever-it-is that it’s ok for us to talk to other people because we both get lonely and don’t want to ruin whatever it is that we have now because of the long distance.

However, I just found out that he may or may not be talking to this girl who lives in my state. Not only that, but she’s 14 and ever since we were all kids, she knew I liked him and would flirt with him every chance she got.

I realized that although I’m still ok with us talking to other people in-state, I’m not ok with him talking to a girl that lives in my state. The whole point of this was so that the long distance wouldn’t be a problem and neither of us would get lonely and just stop talking to each other due to another commitment, so we decided not to commit.

Anyways, I’ve asked for advice and I’ve got these options:

1. Confront him with the girl (let’s call her Mel) present and find out the truth
2. Talk to him about it alone
3. Report him to the police
4. Find out the truth and tell Mel’s parents
5. Ignore everything

And each results in either me breaking it off and ghosting him again, or continuing to talk. Things aren’t looking so good anyways because there’s a high chance we’re never gonna meet in person again anytime soon.

But the thing is I’m not sure if she’s talking to him for real and if it turns out I’m wrong, I’d rather save myself the embarrassment.

Here’s what went down before New Years:

I was visiting my grandparents and he got sick over the break, finally catching a break from work. We tried working around our crazy families and his flu to talk, but it just didn’t work. I wanted to talk on FaceTime but he was too sick, but first thing in the morning he FaceTimed me and we just talked for hours. I don’t know if it was because he felt he had to or if he genuinely wanted to talk because he missed talking to me or something and finally could due to him taking a break from work.

What went down last night:

I went to this my parent’s rich friend’s party and left immediately because it was full of 40 year old men, children, and that one group of younger teenage girls that included Mel. The thing about rich asian parties on New Years is that they’re for networking, an excuse to get drunk and leave your kids unsupervised, and a chance for rich kids to go wild and do all sorts of shit.

So I see Mel, she’s the only one who I’ve told about the guy (just call him Ben), even though no one is supposed to know. The only reason she knows is because I confronted her one day earlier last year because I had the same suspicion that I he was talking to her, it turned out I was worried for no reason. I ask how Mel’s doing, if she’s seen Ben at the party (testing her). Then she replies that Ben’s in (undisclosed state) and ofc he wouldn’t be there. I find out that during a Thanksgiving from unknown year, I think this year, he spent it with her family in my state bc their parents are friends, and he apparently told her parents that he has a girlfriend.

So either this was a Thanksgiving before 2018 and he was with his ex, Thanksgiving 2018 and currently talking to me and told Mel’s parents that I was his girlfriend, he actually has a girlfriend on the side, or he’s talking to Mel.

No matter what the outcome, except the first one I listed, I can’t help but feel pissed off.

So I leave and go to the hipster coffee shop and run into an old friend. We go to his friend’s house where he’s staying for some time and getting paid to keep it clean while the family is away. We open up a bottle and catch up, then I rant about what just happened. He wants to hook up so we make out and I stop him because it feels wrong and I thought he was gay.

I take him to the party when it gets late, around 100 people are there now and it’s actually looking pretty awesome. We find a pack of cigs and smoke, then I take him to meet the girls. They’re all around 14 but one of them pulls out a Juul, another finds a Benadryl, and she crushes it up like a pro. I take one like a normal person, and she snorts it. They all look and dress like older and I remember thinking fuck, when I was 14 I was a big nerd and looked like I was 9.

Then one of the girls parents goes upstairs because she smells smoke on my friend (although the whole house already smelt like smoke), and she starts yelling at us to not smoke with the kids around, although half of them are stoned and the other half juul.

Me and my friend jet and we learn later that it was her house and Mel had probably narced. The mom found the cigs in the sink where we left them and just told them not to smoke, but she doesn’t know my no-makeup face or name so it’s ok.

I remember getting back home and just being so angry that I cried myself to sleep.

So...

What do I do? I don’t want to be THAT girl and make a big deal out of nothing, but I want to keep it on good terms and don’t want things to get more awkward. I’m already having a hard time communicating because of our schedules.

137,"Hi so I'm 20F and I've had guys come up to me, ask me out, text me, whatever. The furthest I've ever gone with a guy is texting, that's it. I've never even kissed a guy.

Every time I meet a good guy that genuinely cares for me, I text him a bit, but I constantly feel gross, like I'm on display. Like I'm being observed by him and every time he compliments/admires me (in a nice way) I feel like I'm being judged and observed for the way I look and act, even if they never say a thing about my body or anything. I even act impulsively by saying things that are borderline rude.. I don't know why, maybe it's a defence strategy or something? Anyways.

I've only not felt this way by one other guy. He has never talked to me like he's trying to please me or anything. We often got into playful disputes about our interests (which band is better, etc). He talked to me like I was on his level, not like he was praising me. I wish that I could meet another guy like him.

I know that I do have self esteem and contact issues from abusive parents. The self esteem issues have gotten significantly better over the years, the closeness/touching issues still have high barriers.

I don't know what to do. All the guys (except that one guy) make me feel weird and judged and I think that I might never be able to find another guy like that.

Well, when I was backing out of my aunt’s driveway a few days ago, my uncle told me to watch out for the fence, and I was like “alrighty! Bye!” I saw the fence and thought I was doing so well until I realized ONE HALF OF IT WAS CLOSED AND I RAN STRAIGHT INTO IT. I went into full panic attack mode, started crying and sped off (but didnt actually speed obviously).

I can’t stop thinking about the scratch it left. Do I tell my dad the truth? Do I make up some random excuse? I mean I live in the big city, it happens all the time, right?

140,"So my winter break was about a month long, it's coming to an end, but I discovered how insanely hard it is for me to maintain a good sleep schedule. It was like I was staying up till 4-5am every single night and sleeping till 12-1(sometimes later) and I've tried very hard to break it. I've taken melatonin, gotten in bed early and just tossed and turned for 2 hours. I'll set my alarm for like 10am and just won't wake up to it. That being said, during the break when I had somewhere to be(friends place, some activity) I was able to wake up to the alarm and be fine.

In the past when my job required it, I was used to going to bed at 9 and waking up at 4 am every single day. When I'm in school I'm used to going to bed at midnight and waking up at like 8-9am every day.

147,"So full disclosure I’ve never been attracted to this man. I’ve known him for 15 years and his sister and I have been business partners, coworkers and everything else under the sun. She is, by all means, my best friend in the whole world.

I’ve never been attracted to her brother in the past. I’ve known him for the same Length of time but have not been attracted to him simply because I was married when we first met. I can honestly say I’ve always been a little bit physically attracted but he likes attractive women than what I am. So I never put myself in that mind. That is until a few months ago I saw him passing in a shopping center. He looked damn good and I thought… Maybe I do like him, and the way he looked at me I thought.. maybe. I saw him a few times between then and now and there has always been an attraction on my end but not so sure about his end. 

New Year’s comes and I expect it to be just me and my best friend, hanging out getting drunk together. She ended up inviting her brother and his friend, who she had been secretly sleeping with. It wasn’t anything serious between them it was mainly just company, butters situation left her brother and Me alone to talk and so on.

No I’m not usually the type to push a situation, but mid conversation he looked at me and said,  it’s never going to happen. Now maybe I am drunker than what I remember but there was no reason for him to say that. So at this point I took it as a challenge. So I asked him why not. He told me he doesn’t “sleep with his sisters friends”. I asked him if I had ever given them that impression, he said no I asked him if I had ever come on to him and he said no and I asked him why he would think what he’s thinking. He told me his friend had told him that I may be interested and truth be told I kind of am. But not just in sex.

So we talk about the issues of having  “relations”with his sisters friends and soon and tell him I’m not trying  to sleep together. I simply wanted him holding me. I’m a sap and I’m totally down for no sex. I wasn’t wanting that. I wanted to feel appreciated, liked, cared about. And truthfully he gave me each of those things. He was I guess respectful, copped a feel here and there but I figure I can’t be too mad a drunk chick invited him to bed. 

But the WAY he held me. The way he kissed my cheek and squeezed me tight while we slept and seemed like he totally cared, dang it now I like him. But it’s weird. 

Do I approach him, message him, anything ? Or do I let it go which it what my other friends say. This is weird for me as usually I take the bull by the horns and drive but I can’t with him. I don’t want to push.

153,"I'm not sure this is the right place but first Just a little backstory before I ask for advice, sorry if it's a bit long.

So I (21M) was with my ex-girlfriend (22F) for nearly 2 years, and for the last year she had moved to my place (She lives in another country than me) due to an injury she suffered causing her unable to get up and down the stairs to her apartment. 

Fast forward a bit and I'm moving back to my parents' place temporarily due to it being closer to the university that I was transferring to. While my parents are off on holiday I end up breaking up with her (after having talked to her mother to make sure she had a place to stay back in her home country).

At this time I was quite worried about her mental state and she had to stay with me for another 2 days before her train was due. I kept her away from any sharp objects and didn't leave her alone but she ended up trying to poison herself while she was in the bathroom. Long story short, I call an ambulance and get her admitted to a hospital to make sure she's alright. 

At that time I was in a state of shock but managed to persuade her to stay at the hospital as one of the doctors strongly suggested, and tell her that I'd come visit her the next day. I arrive the following day with all of her stuff and arranged for her mother to come pick her up asap. 

After a week or 2 she messaged me asking if we could get back together, after declining she says she doesn't have anything to live for anymore and after some attempts from me trying to talk her out of it she just says bye, I forward the conversation to her mother since I can't check up on her seeing as I'm in a different country. After getting confirmation from the mother that nothing had happened I blocked my ex's number. 

Fast forward a month and I get a text from her mother asking if I'd talked to her because she's been missing for 2 weeks, I proceed to unblock her number, message her and persuade her to go back home to her mother, although she made me promise to not block me, which I agreed to as long as she didn't threaten with suicide and get active help from a therapist and/or psychiatrist. At this point I also find out she's been diagnosed with schizophrenia on top of her BPD.

A month or so goes by before she messages me again, this time asking if we can talk, because her therapist had said it might help her to say the things that have been left unsaid. For the sake of her mental health I agree to the conversation and we end up talking for roughly 2 hours about how the breakup had affected her and what she'd done afterwards. she also asked if we could get back together again to which I said no. At this point she also made some claims that I'm 90% sure are false. the conversation ends with her wanting to talk again some time and possible just spend time together in general to which I just replied we'll see how it goes.

&amp;#x200B;

Now we're here and honestly I'd like to just make a clean break but I'm worried about the repercussions that it might have, and how she might react, because even though I broke up with her I still do care about her, quite a lot. What do you think I should do?

154,"TL;DR is at the bottom. Sorry if the post is pretty long. 

     So the person has been dating my mom for about 6 years now so he’s practically my stepdad. Just saying now, I highly doubt my mom will break up with him since he’s extremely nice to her and acts the perfect boyfriend. 
     My relationship with him never really had a chance to be good as I used to be in tennis and he would constantly yell at me after every match once he figured out my mom would be okay with it. I strongly suspect that he has some sort of OCD as he gets set off when every little thing isn’t perfect. i.e. If I don’t perfectly win a tennis match.
     Back in my competitive tennis days before I quit, for obvious reasons, he called me a waste of time, said I’m wasting my mom’s money, called me a loser, a baby, an embarrassment, spent even more time telling me how much of a waste of time and money I am, all when I was about 12-14 years old. 
    So we don’t get along. 
    I also suspect he’s abusive to my dog, a terrier mix, when I’m not around because she flinches every time he comes near her. She’ll be walking around the house and as soon as she sees him she starts walking the opposite direction, and he’ll get this little smirk on his face. He’s a 200 lb man terrorizing a 15 lb dog. And somehow that makes him feel big. He also is the reason she is forced to sleep outside every night even though it can get down to the 40s in winter and our neighborhood has a history of coyotes eating dogs in people’s backyards. I try to sneak her in most nights. 
     And that’s where the title comes from, because one night when my mom was away on a business trip, it was raining, and because I had already let my dog in, he didn’t hear her scratching at the backyard door asking to be let inside because it was freezing cold and wet outside so he got suspicious, and I got caught. 
     In the ensuing argument, I got locked outside the house, and among a great many other unkind things, like “you’re never going to go anywhere in life, little girl,” (see what I mean about belittling comments?) my mom’s boyfriend told me that  if I kept this up he would give my dog away while I was at school or put her in the shelter and I’d never be able to find her again. Understandably, I’m attached to my dog and don’t want her to get disappeared. 
     I feel like I can’t go to my mom about this because one of the only times I’ve seen her cry in my life is when she though her boyfriend was going to break up with her after the counselor at my school called CPS on him for locking me out of the house on a rainy night. 
     I don’t want to openly confront my mom’s boyfriend about this stuff because he can be extremely petty, always ready with a snide comment to belittle you, and I have a rule about not shitting where I sleep and starting fights with people I’m forced to share the same roof with. 
     So when he makes comments about my dad being a total loser, or intentionally chews louder at the dining table even though he knows I have misophonia and sounds like that make me irrationally angry, or he says I’m disgusting for using a toothpick, and then proceeds to floss at the dining table and suck the chewed up food he finds off the string, I feel like I can’t say anything because either he’ll get back at me for it over the course of weeks and months which I honestly don’t have the energy for, or he’ll take it out on my dog, and if I bring any official protective service into this, he might break up with my mom, and ruin my relationship with her that way. 

TL;DR
My mom’s boyfriend is a complete asshole to me when he isn’t ignoring me or exchanging the minimal level of pleasantries with me, but I feel like I can’t confront him about it because he’ll either choose to get back at me over the course of weeks and months and I don’t want to start a war in the house I have to live in, or he’ll take it out on my dog. I can’t call animal services on him, because then he might break up with my mom and I know that though she won’t say it, she’ll hold me responsible for destroying her 6 year relationship with him, ruining my relationship with her in the process when we’ve just started to get closer after a rocky past few years.

Mother gets out of work and gets home, smells the perfume in my room and turns on my personal computer to log into my Facebook and starts reading the conversation between me and my boyfriend (which I could tell she did because of the browsers history, don’t know how much she read tho) and noticed that he got here early. I get home and mum makes a scene about it and I just went along with it agreeing to whatever she said. I brushed it off and turned on my computer just to notice she was all in my private stuff.

163,"Hi guys. 
I’m not sure if this belongs here or in legal advice, sorry. 

Mid December, my company threw a big fancy Christmas party with unlimited free alcohol. Most of us got wasted - including myself. My supervisor who had quit the week before but still attended the party had a few drinks. Long story short, he made moves, I turned him down, I got absolutely wasted &amp; he took advantage of that and sexually assaulted me in my own apartment. 
I don’t want to try to press charges because it’s been a few weeks and I have no evidence to support a claim against him. I deleted our text chain in which during the party I told him I was too drunk to hook up &amp; he insisted. I do, however, sort of want to report it to my local police department. I just have a few concerns about that. 
1. Will they take me seriously/be able to help me if I refuse to press charges? 
2. Would they be able to help connect me with a therapist? Maybe a sexual violence advocate? (I’m not handling it well emotionally.)
3. Any other advice on how to stop feeling gross and like it was my fault, and how to move forward?

167,"So me and this guy have been talking for about 8 months now off and on. We have seen each other twice, each time he couldn't make me orgasm no matter what. We have had some really bad fights, leading him to say that he has had better sex with other women. We are not in a relationship, but talk somewhat frequently. After the first break, he suggested we just send pics and videos to each other, this caused us to meet a second time. He would send like 1 or 2 a week, while I would spam him sometimes.....he got frustrated. 
After that, he called it quits since he said there is no compatibility. We didn't talk for awhile, but then started the pics and videos thing again....except this time he seemed more into it. He would constantly spam me and seem more into just talking sometime. I have offered to have casual hook ups, but if I mention to him that I'm stressed or worried that week he would not even try to contact me no matter how horny he is. He usually just tells me about it after and how he wanted to but remembered I'm stressed or something. He still says he enjoys looking at me naked and thinks I'm attractive and make him horny, but he doesn't want to meet again. If we might meet, he says he doesn't want to have sex, he just wants to have me pleasure myself while he watches. We were having a conversation once he said to remember that out of all the girls that he has met, and all the potential girls, that he still picks to talk to me, so I shouldn't worry about him thinking I'm not attractive or wants something better. In a different conversation, be said that we don't have a relationship and probably never would. 

So my question is, what is the point of this. Like why keep me around if he doesn't want to sleep with me and doesn't want a relationship. Like even if he is waiting for something better, why keep something around if your not gonna use it? Yes pics and videos are nice, but to a limit...plus you can easily just watch porn or something.

172,"Throwaway. My mother-in-law is in a terrible position, and I really want to know how we/she can fix the problem. MIL and my father-in-law are in their late 40s/early 50s. They married in their early 20s. Had children, lived the good life for a few years before alcoholism overtook him. FIL works for himself, but the money got worse after the alcohol. MIL has been able to work herself into a good job with a decent salary. FIL is now ""clean,"" but definitely has a few mental illnesses (diagnosed and probably undiagnosed).

Because the backstory could go on forever, I'll get to the issue. Long story short, things have been worse recently. FIL no longer works because he stopped even showing up to make money and MIL was having to fund monthly expenditures with no income to show for it. He now does as close to nothing as one could possibly do in life. Bed, internet, tv, literally nothing productive. Doesn't even come to most family and holiday events at this point.

Because of all this, MIL has to suffer, is not happy (noticeable drop-off in the last year), and struggles financially as the breadwinner with a spouse who is a financial liability. She is not actively trying to leave him, but it doesn't sound like she is too opposed to it at this point and we (family) all think she will be so much better off if she does. She's a really great person, though, and doesn't want to leave because FIL would literally have nothing (can't drive because of a DUI and obviously has no money).

It's a terrible situation all around. FIL obviously has issues, so he's not living the good life at her expense, but he's also not very good to her and appreciates what she does only occasionally. There seems to be some manipulation, though, where he's able to make her feel guilty enough to stay and support him. MIL is miserable and doesn't enjoy life as much as she should (two new grandchildren in last two years). MIL has worked herself into a very good job, but it's meaningless and she's always struggling financially. She's a really great human being and doesn't deserve any of this.

I am hoping for any ideas at all. It's not a simple as her just leaving him because he might starve to death and she would feel guilty if anything bad happened. Two daughters (and SOs) who are fine financially but don't necessarily have a pile of cash sitting around to make things simpler. They live in a very rural area, so not a ton of publicly-funded support close by that could help the situation.

We're at a loss, and have been for a while. If it was up to me, she would just leave ASAP and not allow him to bring her down anymore, but she's considerate and too selfless and doesn't want to leave him completely high and dry.

173,"Hey everyone,

I'm generally speaking a very clean person, I keep a clean space, clean nails, use deodorant, shower once a day (had to fight to stop showering twice a day because I like to be so clean).

The problem is I'm just naturally a pretty greasy and sweaty guy. 

I'm lean and fit and I sweat like hell when I workout, but even work up a moderate stink after sitting in my computer chair for a few hours with no shirt on, relaxing.

I don't notice it most of the time, and I've never had strangers or friends comment on it but my girlfriend says that she's really sensitive to it and I don't know if it's just her or if there's tips and tricks for things I can do to reduce the strength or persistence of my body odor. 

It's so noticable to her sometimes that we can just finish showering (I scrub hard and go to town lemme tell ya with very strong body wash) and go to bed and she can't cuddle up the way she wants to because she says my armpits stink already. 

I don't really know what else I can do except maybe try a different deodorant before bed and stuff?

Also on the greasy note, my head is shaved and gets super greasy throughout the day and I didn't know if there were any tips for keeping that to a minimum too. Thanks!",03Jan2019,1
175,"I’d been into this girl for a couple months. We had a good relationship, we’d talk about how bad the Vikings are, soccer (her pastime), surfing (my pastime), school, you know the sort of shit normal people talk about. She’d come out with her friends on my boat and we’d blast tunes and wakesurf off the back. Occasionally I’d get drunk and tell her that I thought she was cute and had nice blonde hair and pretty blue eyes. She’d send me blushing emojis and say how sweet I was. Time for homecoming rolled around and I didn’t have a date, neither did she. My plans fell through when the after party is was going to got busted by the hosts parents about a week before it happened. That girl also didn’t have any plans and she pegged daily asking what I was doing. I think she wanted me to ask her to the dance. I didn’t realize it at the time but it’s pretty clear that’s what was happening. Time passes and I eventually gather the courage to ask her on a date. She told me no, she said she was too busy with school and soccer to have a relationship. I was understanding but nevertheless bummed out. Maybe a week later I asked her again. I opened up to her more about the way I felt and she replied “sure”. We never got to actually go on that date as we couldn’t find the time. A couple months pass and we’re still ok friends, we talk occasionally but not as much as we used to. I’m pretty depressed around this time, my life was falling apart around me. I didn’t hang out with friends for a solid month, I totaled my car, I withdrew from my social life. I basically closed all my doors. The only one left open was the door to that girl, or so I thought. I bought her, and her best friend and myself tickets to the Travis Scott concert. It cost me around $400 but I was more than willing to pay. It’s here where I found out who she truly was. She wasn’t content with the seats I bought, found one of her other friends and moved to go find them. I was pretty contact high and didn’t understand what was going on than so I just rolled with it. The rest on the concert was fine, she eventually came back with two more of her friends. One of them was a guy she knew from school. We tried to take back the seats I bought but ended up sitting on the stairs. She made sure she sat opposite of me from everyone, I noticed and was bummed but whatever I thought. Concert ended we walked back to my car, I thought I lost her in the crowd but I saw her talking to some boys. Her friend said they were from school. Really she was getting their numbers. I was pretty pissed but just held it in. “I spent $400 on this girl just for her to blow me off?” I thought. Couple days later she was confessing her love for some guy from the concert on Instagram. Worst part is before we went to the Travis Scott concert I bought two tickets to the A$AP Rocky concert, I was planning on surprising her for Christmas. She had yet to reply to me after we went to the concert, only breaking the silence after I told her what I had bought her for Christmas. “Give it to someone else” was the response.

178,"So, maybe I should I start from the beginning. I'm gonna bleep his name due to privacy what not, and I'm lowkey kind of scare he might use Reddit...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, so I met this basic guy called ""Pete"". Pete and I matched and I was super young at the time, maybe 18 (?), anyway we matched and we got off to a decent start. I was really naive and really caring when I was 18, and I think at the time he was like maybe 23, since I did a lot of shit for the guy  since I didn't want to him to get hurt or anything.

So I made it somewhat clear I wanted a relationship and back then he strictly wanted to fuck and I wasn't down for it since back then I was a virgin, but for some reason we just always remained in contact but from a distance. Well, that changed when he called me at like 2-4am in the morning to pick him up from the bars since he didn't have a ride, his friend left him alone in the streets, and I was really reluctant but I decided to pick the drunk boi up. It came a fucking routine where I would pick him up, drive him to his house, he would ATTEMPT to have sex with me and I would dip and passout and wake up a couple hours later to go to work. Eventually, I got sick and tired of this bullshit since I was being used back then and I cut him off from rides since I was sick of it (he apologized and gave me a few bucks for gas when I declined) but none the less I told him to quit that shit. 

Eventually I got sick of him and his drunk behavior and decided to ignore him until I got fucked over by another dude a couple months later. I rejoined Tinder, and he messaged me again on Snap and we talked again. I was moving to a different town for college but then I decided, I don't even know WHY, but I wanted to have sex with him (??). Well, long story short on that I bailed since I was MEGA afraid of having sex, he was slightly drunk (he claimed he needed to be a bit drunk to last longer which doesn't make sense to me -- I thought being drunk would make you soft but whatever). He kept pressuring me back then to meet up with him, kept saying he blew off his friends to have sex with me, so I greeted him with a block on all platforms and even my phone (doubt he saved my number but whatever).

&amp;#x200B;

WELL, now it's 2018 and I'm 20 now and I rejoined Tinder since I wanted to chat with people, and I'm not as skittish as much as I was back then, and we rematched and all went well. We caught up on life and what not, and he asked why I blocked him and I told him and he apologized a lot to me since he felt so bad. He went to the bars this past weekend and he was sending me weird, mixed signals? He kept saying I should come over, he felt lonely, and he wanted to cuddle AKA have sex but then he weirdly brought up about being lonely (romantically) and somewhat hinted about not having a girlfriend and I was left speechless because, no offense I don't want to date him? I wouldn't mind hooking up and being...""pals"", but I'm kind of left confused because I don't wanna hook up and he we keep doing it and then he develops feelings for me. However, when he's SOBER he acts like I'm lying and I wanna date him and what not, and he kind of was being mega DOUCHE BAG like today and I'm just stunned?? He did like a whole 180 on me with his drunk personality and his sober self.

&amp;#x200B;

My advice is what should I do? Should I just ignore the guy entirely and keep it pushing or should I keep digging and figure out the bigger meaning of it?

I'm just mega confused and lost and kind of dumbfounded. . .

182,"So my stepson is 12yo in middle school. He’s uncoordinated, has trouble with common sense, but is very book smart. He’s very introverted and shy, and also skinny and lanky. Most of his close friends from elementary school went to a different middle school so he only has a few friends at his school, but most aren’t in his class. 

He’s being regularly bullied by the same kids all the time. Nothing serious, but just picked on physically all the time such as getting flicked in the ears in the hallway or getting water thrown at him, or similar “little stuff”. Hes awkward and rushes to his next class between classes, and doesn’t try to fight back at all which we think makes an easy target. School hasn’t done much since it hasn’t been anything physically serious yet. 

My wife thinks self defense classes will help him build confidence while also teach some skills he may be able to use if anything were to physically escalate. I think boxing (regular, not kickboxing) would be a better skill to learn since it’ll build confidence but also be more useful than self defense, especially in middle school and eventually high school. Since he’s not very coordinated, I also think self defense/karate would be too technical for him to learn without a lot of practice (he doesn’t like to be physical). 

I took boxing classes when I was younger and loved it, since there’s only a handful of basics to learn over and over before getting more advanced, so you learned more “useful” skills earlier on. I just feel the karate and self defense classes they have for young kids are more for “show” than skill building and it’ll take a lot more advancement before anything is really useful in the “real world” (middle school).

I'm in the process of trying to deal with a breakup. This one in particular was rather sudden and with someone I was really, truly in love with. I have a friend who's been extremely helpful throughout the entire process, and I'm extremely grateful for that. But she really wants to know why I fell in love with the girl so fast. We really only had been together a few months, so I understand why she's confused. I've tried and failed multiple times to explain to her why, but now that I've come up with the real reason (Or at least a big part of it) I'm not sure I can tell her. I'm not sure I even should. The reason I've come up with is that when I love someone, it's because I want them to kill me. I'm not depressed or suicidal in anyway, and I understand the severity of such things, as this particular friend has had an especially rough relationship with her own depression. I really don't *want* to die, but I find comfort in knowing that if the person I loved and trusted most wanted it so, I would be dead. I really want to tell her, but I'm worried I might scare or hurt her. She happens to be rather prone to panic attacks and anxiety, and I'd hate for something like this to really negatively affect her life, but I feel like she deserves a real answer. What should I do?

  I could use advice on dealing with an unfair $500 ""lease change"" fee on the house we rent.  

  The situation is: I'm a tenant in a 3-bedroom house that myself and one other person rent through a management company which acts as landlord.  I and the other tenant, K, signed the lease on this house as the only two tenants, because we couldn't find someone to sign on at the same time we signed this lease.  The lease has all tenants on one lease, not individual leases for individual tenants, so the rent is split among all tenants on the lease.  Needless to say, K and I have been looking for a third roommate.  We told the management company's leasing agent we intended to take on a third when we were first viewing the house, and he acknowledged our intent.  What he didn't tell us, which we learned only after we signed the lease and moved in, is that the management company charges a $500 fee to add or remove tenants to a lease.  Naturally, we were shocked.

  First, we took our complaint to the management company, who denied responsibility.  We reasoned, this fee is not on the lease, and we had not been told about it until after we moved in - classic bait and switch.  We asked, how do you justify $500 to add a name to the lease?  Their justification was that they had to have a lawyer redo the whole lease.  I asked a lawyer (who could not possibly take this case) how much work it would be to add someone to a lease, and she said it was not much work and that $500 was high.   So we tried to fight it.  

  We've tried arguing with the management company.  First, we asked why our leasing agent hadn't told us; he said he didn't know about it, and it was out of his hands.  Next we complained to his supervisor about this large, unexpected, undisclosed expense, and we showed a text conversation between K and the agent, in which adding a roommate was mentioned, and sure enough, no mention of a fee.  The response was that because the rental agent didn't explicitly say there wasn't a fee, we weren't misled.  Next we tried to compromise by saying, would you please let us tenants hire a lawyer and pay out of pocket to do the necessary paperwork?  It was a long shot, but we put it out there.  They didn't even respond to that email. 

  That's where we are now.  We are thinking of threatening to report them to the BBB and filing an enforcement action with the state Attorney General for abusing their customers with this ridiculous unjustifiable fee.  We are concerned there may be retaliation, and we still have over a year left on this lease, and we don't know if this is one of those choose-your-battles battles.  However, the threats may be just what we need.   So we'd like advice on how to proceed in this argument.  

  Also, we're preparing for a scenario where we have no choice but to pay the $500 to take on a roommate.  In this case, we wonder, what is the most fair way to distribute the fee?  There was no way for K and I to know about this fee, so we feel blameless.  At the same time, it feels unfair to ask any one new tenant for the whole fee because it's an overpriced service and it's not their fault the management company has this stupid fee.  For that matter, it's not anyone's fault this ridiculous fee is in place.  The current favorite option K and I are considering is to split the fee equally between all three tenants.  

  So reddit, please advise on these questions, especially if you have experience with a similar conflict:

1) How to proceed with negotiations with the management company.  Do we proceed with threats of reporting to BBB and Attorney General? Could their retaliation cause more trouble than it's worth? 

2) Assuming the mgmt group will not take responsibility - How can we most fairly split this fee among the two current and one new roommate? Is anyone more responsible than the others, or should we split evenly?

TL,DR: Landlord (big management company) didn't disclose $500 fee to add a roommate to the lease until after we signed the lease.  Landlord says we can't prove leasing agent didn't reveal fee, and we have to suck it up and pay the fee.  How to argue this?  And if we lose, how to fairly split this fee between current and new tenants?",03Jan2019,1

187,"Recently a friend and I decided it was a good idea to check out a Scientology building we walked past, just to see how people get dragged into this. It was an extremely bizarre but very interesting experience, they gave us a tour of the place, showed us videos, showed us a dumb device and took a 30 minute test with 200 questions then isolated both of us then proceeded to break us down enough that we would be willing to join them (We obviously didn't).

It was weird but it was fun trying to work out the tricks they used to bring people in. Obviously, this is a risky thing to do but do you think with enough knowledge of a cult and the psychology they use behind it, you can safely explore a cult? If I were to begin attempting to enter cults for just personal interest with full knowledge of their manipulative techniques and pretending to be sucked in, what do you recommend I do?

My friend posted pics of our trip on Facebook and my mom saw them. One post was a video of me walking up stairs at a club - I was drunk, but I walked up the stairs lol. There was another photo of my friend smoking hookah and I was kinda resting my head on the seat because I had never smoked anything before and hookah can make you feel a bit odd.

Anyway, my mom said that I broke her heart. I smoked and drank. She said that she was hurt and that ""mature adults don't post this garbage."" She also brought up me being broke into it...like doing this trip while being broke (I'm a student).

Something else that might be bothering my mom might be that the friend I went with is a lesbian, and she has feelings for me. I'm still figuring that out.

I am working my dream design job at a top agency in NYC and I think it’s the best opportunity I will have in this field, the only thing that is holding me back is New York itself.

198,"So this might be a pretty long one.

My older brother committed suicide on September 23rd, 2018. I don’t particularly want to go into any specific details, but he shot himself while he was driving. 

My mother, father, and I all went to his house a couple days after to collect his things, that included his clothes. I personally kept a couple of his shirts, and so did my mother. 

He had a son (my nephew) who is only 8. Before my brother killed himself, he dropped off his son at his mothers house. So my nephew was the last person to see him alive. 

Anyway, we asked my nephew if he wanted any shirts, and he said that he wanted “his shark shirt”. We dug through every single shirt we could find but we couldn’t find anything related to that. We asked him to look through and try to find it but he said that it wasn’t there. 

So, we think that, because he was the last one to see him, that my brother might have actually been wearing the shark shirt when he shot himself.

We are going to be able to see the clothes he was wearing soon, because they just recently closed the case, so that’s when we will find out for sure if he was wearing it or not. 

But if he was, how do we tell my nephew? My mom said she definitely does not want to give him the shirt if it was, in fact, the one my brother died in.

203,"Christmas Day I was overindulging in food and wine with the rest of my family. I was pretty tipsy and so I was eating my extra buttery roll with a fork. Well the fork went in at a sharper angle than I realized and when I chomped down in it a chunk of my bottom front tooth came out with it. It didn’t really hurt - it just looked like a shitty chipped tooth - so I thought “eh no big deal; I’ll have my dentist look at it after New Years.”

Fast forward to today (January 2, 2019), my mouth is hurting significantly worse and not just where I chipped my tooth, so I cal my dentist who says “yeah we can see you in about 3 weeks to a month from today.” And I was like “yeah, that’s not gonna work.” So I call around to a bunch of places and find one that will squeeze me in today. So I go in, fill out all the paperwork, get new patient X-rays, yada yada. 

Dentist comes in like 40 minutes later and says he can fix the cosmetic damage of my chipped tooth but there’s a whole lot more important shit that needs to be done first. Like the fact that I have two impacted wisdom teeth that have both broken into multiple pieces mostly underneath my gum line but partially erupted above as well - oh and they’re so massively infected so I need to start super strong antibiotics and painkillers for a few days before they can even think about surgically removing them. And I have two teeth that are also massively infected down to the pulp tissues and both need root canals (if it weren’t for the fact that they were visible teeth, he said it’d be almost easier just to remove them as well, but I’m only 27 and I don’t want missing front teeth at this age). Plus on top of that I have early stages of gum disease or possibly oral cancer - they’re not sure and they can’t do a biopsy of the abscess/tumor that I didn’t even know was there because my jaw was hurting so bad from the impacted wisdom teeth that I didn’t even know were broken until after the infected wisdom teeth are removed and the root canals are completed and al the infections are cleared up because that could mess up the results. And all this can be done for the low low price of $2100 which my uninsured broke ass college self now has to come up with just to find out if I have oral cancer or not.

TL;DR - went to the dentist for what I thought was going to be a simple cheap fixing of some cosmetic damage and my dentist has me terrified that I may have oral cancer at worst or infected/broken wisdom teeth and needing root canals with just the beginning stages of gum disease at best. Either way it sucks. And I have to somehow find $2100 to find out if I have cancer and to fix all the pain/infection in my mouth. I have no insurance, definitely not enough money to cover this, no job because I’m student teaching to finish my degree in elementary education (student teaching is full time Monday-Friday same schedule/work load as a paid teacher except I don’t get paid), and have no idea where to look for resources that might offer financial assistance in this type of situation. The dentist offered no discounts. I don’t have the credit to get a personal loan. I have no family member I could borrow money from because they don’t have that kind of money to loan. So I’m scared and need these procedures/tests, but don’t know where to look for assistance in paying for them. I’m got some personal stuff for sale on Craigslist, but that’s about all I know of to do to get the money.

My dad cares about me... but just a little too much. He's a bit of a helicopter parent in a way which I was grateful for sometimes in the past but, now that I'm older, I am starting to realize the negative effects it is having/has had on me. Due to this (he means the best I'm not criminalizing him in any way) I feel as if I never learned to cope with several things, take responsibility, talk to people, or make decisions; all of which factor into my problem with general and social anxiety. He is also very controlling and manipulative. Also, he's had a hard life and a rough upbringing which has made him very negative, spiteful, and bitter. Which results in him constantly cutting me down and degrading me which really rather hurts... very badly. Anyways due to this, I've been looking to move out (oh yeah I forgot to mention I live with AND work for him). I would've liked to work this out together and still be on good terms but he is unwilling to get help for his problems making mine impossible to get over. Anyways, I've been working on this problem a while now and I've gotten nowhere (It's mostly my own fault). Now, this is where my girlfriend comes in. She's a sweet girl, truly too good for me, and she cares about me a lot. For the past year, maybe a year and a half I've sort of been having a few panic attacks and mental breakdowns in front of her... every time I see her because I'm stressed about my father and trying to get out of my ordeal. Understandably this has taken a toll on her. Tonight she snapped and she wouldn't leave my car until I agreed to get out of my father's house the next day. I agreed. Only that's a huuuuuge problem. For, one: my father will not, obviously, let me go that easily especially out of nowhere (although I've already told him I was moving out, however, he usually takes whatever I say with a grain of salt). Two: my room is a mess. It would be wrong to not only just leave him out of the blue but just leave him with a huge mess. That's just not right. Three: this time of the year my dad has two employees me and one other guy. To leave him with just one person is rather awful. Plus, my co-worker has been great to me. Made the job bearable and I hate the idea of throwing him under the bus. I really don't want to break my promise to my girlfriend. She has been an angel to me all this time, anyone with a lick of sense would just leave me, but shes stuck with me all this time. She really does just care and wants the best for me. She doesn't want to see me like this anymore. I really don't want to screw my dad over either. He's had a hard enough life and really means the best he just doesn't understand.

218,"Fore warning it’s really long and sorry in advance for the poor grammar and misspellings I never thought anyone else would read it but I need advice...
So there is a girl I know we have a long history not that long but long enough for it to be long. She crushed my soul and tore my heart into a million pieces and even then I still loved her. To me she was everything and nothing all at once one second I would love her and the next I would hate her. In a second I could come up with something to say that would melt any girls’ heart and truly mean what I was saying to her. Though in a second I could also recall every horrible thing she has ever done too me. Being next to her made the world an amazing wonderful place and being away from her thinking what she might be doing made life feel unlivable. When we first meet and started talking I only ever heard bad things about her but seeing how gorgeous and innocent she was I couldn’t bring myself to believe any of them. They said she had cheated on her boyfriend with multiple guys and would be in relationships with two and even sometimes three guys at the same time. She was a freshman and I was a senior in high school to me she was the prettiest girl in the whole school long hair, short, brown eyes, amazing smile, and the perfect mix of sweet and sour. It all started out good and I couldn’t imagine how anyone could have ever said such horrible things about her I just didn’t think she was even capable of doing. We like most foolish high school kids feel in love or at least what we thought love was at the time. I was on top of the world for the first time in so long after being so depressed and destroyed by the death of a friend and close relative and my past relationships just never quite working or going anywhere. She was everything I ever wanted and needed and I was genuinely happy for the first time in years. But as life had taught me at the time when one good thing happens a million bad things are immediately following. So time went by everything going perfectly and then one day after school a text message started what could have quite possibly been the worst 2 years of my life and do damage that even to this day I haven’t gotten over. Her ex-boyfriend who had been off and on with her for a long time texted me asking if I was dating her saying that he was also in a relationship with her. Now at the time I was a different person rasher and almost harsh because of the things life had put me through so I simply replied not anymore she is all yours and I thought that was the end of it. But, it wasn’t the end it sadly was the beginning of what I consider to be the cruelest emotional torture I have ever experienced. I confronted her about it and she lied saying he was jealous and was just trying to cause a rift between us and that he still had access to her Facebook and that is why it said they were in a relationship. Now even though at the time I handled it like I didn’t care at all it really hurt me more than everything I had ever went through because I finally thought I had found someone who I could trust and love with all my heart and never be lied to or hurt by. I didn’t originally go along with what she was saying but after a while of talking to her she convinced me otherwise and my heart won over my brain and had that not happened I might not have ever had to experience such pain and be in this dilemma today. That is when the games started, that is the game of her slowly tearing my heart into a million little pieces for no more reason than for her mere amusement and entertainment. She would make me feel like the bad person for doubting what she was saying, saying things like “you’re just like the rest of them believing every lie they say about me I thought you loved and trusted me” which I did love here I just didn’t trust her. A day came when she finally admitted she was dating him and lying to me the whole time which I knew the whole time but my heart just wouldn’t let me believe it. Then she would say “I love you I just don’t know how to end it with him you are who I want” which I should have known was a lie again but my heart was so happy to hear that after finally accepting I had lost her to him.That became the new thing every time they would hang out she would say that too me and tell me she was going to break up with him and I believed it. That went on for a long time her just stringing me along making me think she was almost mine again. But then one day it changed again they finally worked everything out and had never been happier but she still loved me. I couldn’t take it anymore and I had to end it the constant secrets and meeting in private and going over to her house when no one was there just wasn’t working for me I truly loved and adored her. She then would say, “if you truly loved me you wouldn’t walk away so easily and you’d wait for me because love is hard” and I felt terrible because I did truly love her so it hurt when she said that what I felt wasn’t real because I knew it was. She continued that till I broke and I was her puppet again a tool merely to entertain and give her attention but I loved her and talking to her at the time was the only thing that kept me going. When I would see her whether it be meeting in her car as she left volleyball practice or going over to her house in secret I still felt that same feeling I originally felt being around her and all the bad things she had and was doing to me would vanish and I couldn’t help but be happy. Those days I would get to see her would be the best and worst of days knowing that when I left I didn’t know if and when we would be able to see each other but time would stop and everything would be perfect for those short moments of bliss we shared. This continued for a long time and it slowly made me bitter and lose sight of what was important in life and I even messed up a few chances with girls who really cared about me because I was caught up on this girl I couldn’t ever truly have and maybe that is what I wanted. I played the whole situation off with my friends like she was just my play thing and we would often do things like replace her boyfriends’ name with Scotty’s in the song Scotty doesn’t know and laugh about the whole situation because I didn’t know how to tell them that every time we did that I wanted to cry because I loved her and I didn’t want to be that guy and how if she ever was mine would I be able to think their wasn’t another guy like me on the end of string. One day her boyfriend found out we were talking and he messaged me telling me to stop talking to her and that he would kick my ass if I kept it up and I replied she is the one messaging me and that he should be having this conversation with her and not me. We came up with a solution we were going to have a three way call and not tell her we were both on the line if I knew what was going to happen I never would have done it. What I would hear next is the single most awful thing I have ever heard in my life and it completely destroyed me. The conversation started out great for us she was caught off guard and didn’t know what to do or say and had her backed in the corner. Seconds away from losing both of us she acted and said that she loved him and was crying for him to stay and that she would do anything listening to it I started crying hearing the girl I loved and would have done anything for profess her love for another guy. But it got worse she went on to say that I meant absolutely nothing to her and that she had never loved me or even cared for me in the slightest and that she wouldn’t ever talk to me again. Well she did and this is where it got really bad a couple days went by of not talking to her somehow managing to make it through life even after multiple suicide attempts. She came back saying things like “I didn’t mean it I just can’t lose him I’m sorry I still love you” looking back I should have left and forgot her so many times I only caused myself pain and played along with her evil games. That cycle continued and it only got worse and worse I would go to parties she would be at and we would hold hands under the table as guys would talk to her as if they were in the same boat as me. Guys would say things like watch I bet I can get her to sit next to me or come talk to me I’m gonna hit that and I just wanted to cry but for some reason I still couldn’t stop loving her. My biggest problem was that in a way I felt bad for her I wondered why she acted like what caused her to be such a horrible manipulative succubus that feed off the emotions of others and lured people in with her body like a siren just to kill them as soon as they were close enough. I wondered if something tragic happened to her when she was younger that made her act like so if she possible could have been just that shitty of a human being but at that age I didn’t think someone could be so horrible for no reason at all. It went on for so long and then would stop and start again the cycle just repeating and stoping and worsening and then one day it ended I said some horrible but truthful things to her and she wasn’t sad that I was leaving after everything I did and gave to her she was angry and showed her true colors again. A year would go by and we would talk for awhile then stop and year would pass again and we would talk and stop. Each time I would hope she’d finally be done with him and want me it never happened no matter what either did they continued being and I kept slowly dying. I got over her and fell for her so many times it’s almost all a blur now. A couple years went by with no contact with her and for some reason every time I’d get close to a girl I’d see her or want her and it just brought me pain and created a gap with whoever I was talking to at the time. I decided I had to close my heart and not let anyone in I would have to be cruel and heartless till I absolutely knew I would be safe to open up again in fear of what might happen to me. Those were just some of the after effects of it along with even worse trust issues than I already had before that. Then one day out of nowhere came a girl a cute innocent vulnerable honest girl you fell for me so quickly and I eventually became her first but I was still cold and distancing her saying I don’t want you to get hurt if you love me I don’t love you back. I knew deep down I did have real feelings for her but I was scared I might get torn to pieces again. So here was this young, attractive, and vulnerable girl head over heels for me in love wanting nothing but to spend time with me and for me to be hers and her to be mine but the second I was gonna let her in she was already gone and I was all alone again left to cry and wallow in sorrow as I had opened up just to stab myself in the heart. So now she had cost me years and now her or is it wrong for me to blame her when I could have left her and stopped all of it when I got that first text and never caused it to ruin my life for so many years and possibly cost me the girl I was meant to be with. A year went by depressed and emotionally locked after losing what I thought was my last chance at real untampered love I finally got over it and was moving on with my life. I decided I was gonna start looking again I had grown lonely and wanted the feeling of someone needing me and wanting me again and I did something I am not sure if I will regret doing or be happy about. I messaged her yes the girl who had torn me apart and ripped me to shreds she had just gotten out of a relationship and had been out of a relationship with the guy from back then for some time. We hit it off instantly almost starting back were we left off when we were in “love” and I have yet to decide if it’s a good thing or a horrible thing. It’s been like 3 weeks talking to her and it’s been great but I get super paranoid of skeptical of what she is doing like I can’t trust her even though she has said she has changed and worked so hard to be a different person. I struggled for awhile deciding if I should trust her or just run away before I get attached again but it might already be to late. The only thing I have come up with to do is try to distance my self emotionally from her acting as if I am completely falling for her and wait to see if it is real or not to fully emerge myself into my emotions for her again because it’s all the same she makes me feel amazing and I love the way she looks and sounds and how I feel when I’m with her but I still don’t trust her and idk how long if ever it will take me to. So I have to play her game and see what happens but I can’t let myself fall victim again I won’t let it happen or it will surely kill me. So we have talked every day for over a month now and I spent a couple hours of New Years with you her until she got sick and I had to take her home. I had a really good time even though it was a few hours. I even had to take care of her when she was getting sick cuz she drank too much but I didn’t mind I almost liked it just holding her rubbing her back running my hands through her hair to comfort her. She even makes me get out out of my comfort zone and for her I was fine with that I hate dancing but I danced with her not just once but twice something I would normally have refused. I still get these anxious feelings something is happening I don’t know about but we just talking we aren’t dating I shouldn’t be worried about anything. It’s probably nothing I’m honestly praying it isn’t cuz I’m trying to keep my emotions in check but I can’t help but feel like I’m on top of the world when I’m with her. I just have longed for her for so long even when I was “over her” I thought about her I want to believe it is and was just lust but the more I think about it it’s love not lust as much as I do lust for her I know it’s only a secondary thought. Like when I took her home I carried her things in for her and made sure she got in alright since she had been throwing up and was still drunk and she started changing right in front of me and when I glanced over and I saw her In a thong and hoodie while she was trying to put sweat pants on I was obviously attracted but I didn’t even get turned on because I knew she wasn’t feeling good and I was more worried then even thinking about her being basically naked in front of me. I want this to work but I know people aren’t gonna agree with it like my friends but I feel like they will accept it if it’s what I want cuz idk why I want this girl so much but I do she is all I can think about. I have to keep reminding myself that this is the girl that tore my heart out and ripped me apart and ruined my life but when I’m talking to her or with her It’s not even in my head I have to force myself to think about it so I don’t let myself get hurt so easily again. I don’t even pray or believe in God I mean I believe in something higher than us but I pray that she really has changed cuz I just don’t think I ever stopped loving her...and I think I’ve known this from the beginning...it just keeps becoming more obvious every second what I started as a lustful adventure has once again turned into love and idk why I can’t get her out of my mind. Her smile. Her eyes. Her hair. Her perfect body. Her voice. The feeling I get when I’m around her. I could hold her in my arms forever and I’d be perfectly content. But why?...Cuz is it really worth it if I’m just worrying all the time about what she is doing or who she is talking too won’t it just always be like this or will it just slowly go away...what do I do?...I just can’t feel this like I’ve worked too hard to level my emotions back out ever time I get involved with this girl I just end up hurt and scared and life ends up being terrible for a long extended time and every other aspect of my life is affected by it and harmed in some way.",03Jan2019,1

I was talking to this girl for the last couple months. Over Christmas break, she and I hung out, then ended up hooking up. The date was fun, and the hookup from what I can tell wasn't unwanted and she liked it. She then said she was busy for the next couple weeks, which I can confirm as she told me earlier about 2 months ago. Now neither of us have really talked, and I'm wondering what happened. We even hung out after the hookup for about an hour cuddling and talking and whatnot. Last message we sent each other was on Christmas. Now neither of us have really talked, and I'm wondering what happened. I sent her a couple snaps, but she hasn't opened them. However, she's posted some stories during that time so idk what tf is going on.

240,"Hi, 

Something has been troubling me lately. In a few weeks, I'm going to go abroad with some people from my university course for 4 days. I haven't been abroad before.

 I don't have any friends or people I feel comfortable with who are going and I'm going to have to share a room with this girl who I am very awkward and uncomfortable around. She doesn't like me too and I feel nervous.

I am generally so socially awkward and have social anxiety. I feel I have made a huge mistake. I don't know what I've put myself in.
I don't even talk many people in my course or people in general because of social anxiety and I'm expecting to go abroad with them? 

Because of my quietness, I'm dull and people feel uncomfortable around me and awkward and I know the group will all be talking with eachother and joking around like they have in the past group meetings whereas I, like always wont speak and want to get out of there.

I feel stressed about this and I don't know what to do. Since we're all adults, we have to explore the place ourselves and we must be in at least a group of 3 when doing things or going places; I'll be the loser tagging along. They'll be annoyed and roll their eyes for me ruining their experience.

I am also very unconfident and self conscious around basically everyone. I'm really nervous.
 I have no means of contacting anyone who is going so everyone has probably made plans together already. I don't even know if that girl knows she's sharing the room with me. I'm lost. I haven't even bought any necessities or clothes yet.

Also, I'm worried about judgement from fellow course members because like I mentioned before, I'm quiet so they'll probably think wtf when they see me. they are all so confident and talkative. 

I also want to mention that there are certain guys going that's making me feel worried. I'm a south Asian Muslim girl who wears the hijab and they are also Muslim guys. I'm worried about what they'll think of me going abroad because it's not something people probably thought I'd do due to my culture and religion, it's making me feel self conscious.

241,"Last year I was having a ton of medical issues with digestion. I was throwing up all the time, having breathing issues that sort of resembled asthma, and I was also having really bad acid reflux, itchy skin and at times, diarrhea. It was going on for so long and I was freaking out because doctor’s kept telling me dumbass answers like I was having anxiety, or that I was depressed. After a year or so of feeling like I was losing my mind and making up these symptoms, I finally saw a specialist that was willing to do some tests and scopes.
I had a colonoscopy and an endoscopy on the same day, where they also put a capsule in my stomach to test my acid reflux levels and it had a camera that took pictures of my food being digested over a two week period. They ended up diagnosing me with GERD (gastroesophogeal reflux disease) and at same time as these scopes, I was given a blood test that showed I had an alpha gal allergy. Apparently Alpha Gal allergies are from tick bites- which blew my mind because it made a fuck ton of sense all of a sudden. I had been bitten by a tick nearly a year prior (around the same time I began getting sick). The ticks that carry it are called Lone Star ticks and it’s nit all that common. It’s been two years now since the tick bite and only a year since I found out my allergy (which includes any mammals- beef, lamb, pork, venison, bison, gelatin, etc). During all of this, I put the GERD on the back burner and forgot all about it because I was primarily focused on taking mammals out of my diet which was really difficult for me, considering I based most of my diet on beef and pork. Recently I’ve noticed that my acid reflux is super bad so I play to try some OTC Prilosec, or something but wanted to know a few things. 1.) is it normal to have acid reflux after drinking water? Anytime I lay down after drinking water, it comes up in my throat and feels like I’m throwing up. It’s disgusting. 2.) I burp a lot after eating, but it’s also pretty much throw up. Also disgusting.  3.) what foods should I cut out without going overboard?

243,"I love my girlfriend with every ounce and fiber of my being. We have been together going on 3 years, but lately… We have a child together, and I am stepfather to her 3 others. I have told her since day one(before we started hooking up even,) that any relationship I am in has to be built upon these things: honesty, loyalty, and communication. I need my partner to be there, to talk to me, to be the person who is there for me when I can’t count on anyone else. That is what I need- a partner. 


Every time there is an issue, and I am sincerely trying to talk to her, if I say anything negative about her or her actions she turns it around implying I am trying to fight, then runs away and ignores my calls, texts, my pleads for her to just talk to me.  I cannot for the life of me remember the last time we compromised on anything. She will claim she admits she is wrong, or says sorry all the time.  She will apologize when say I have a bad day. 


Just the other night I tried to confront her over some little bullshit lie she told me about her ex boyfriend.  She refused to admit that something happened a particular way, which I know we both remember her saying, because it was brought up later. Just kept saying “I don’t know,” or “I don’t remember.” and that is one of the worst parts of it.  I have caught her in several lies, but over completely insignificant things. She will never say “I am sorry, I lied,” so we can move on with our lives. Which also shows she has remorse, and respects me enough to fess up so that maybe we can actually build trust. Instead she ignores it or acts like it never happened.  If someone will lie over little things, there is no doubt they will lie about big things. And she does not seem to get this. Honestly I feel like I know nothing about this woman I have begun building a life with. And anyone can see how these things do not jive with my 3 tenets of a relationship. Can’t communicate, isn’t honest and I don’t even know about loyalty. 


I told her last night I will stop being who I am, and be a completely fake person seeing as I only receive the negatives of being in a relationship, and not the things I have reiterated time and again I need. She will ignore me, and think she is “just pissing me off,” but not realize she is actually pushing me away. Pushing me so far away. She wanted to have sex earlier today, and I lied and said I had a low blood sugar.  I knew what she was planning from the moment she got home. I refused to look at her. I cannot just forget the feelings I had the night before, and act like everything is okay. I have told her before that her idea of silent treatment is in fact emotional abuse. It puts the ball completely in her court, and gives me no chance to get things off my chest or have any sort of relief. We have tried different techniques to improve communication, but in the end her actions go back to her archetype- 1. Accuse me of trying to fight, 2. Run away, 3. Ignore me until I forget about it or stop caring.  It is weighing me down, so, so much and I cannot shake these feelings that it is over. I have so much stress with no outlet, and it is only getting worse every day. 


Her actions are causing me to fall out of love. I don’t even know this person, I sleep next to a stranger every night. This is not what I want, but it is happening none the less.   She is not the same as who I fell for long ago. I feel disrespected and unappreciated, I trust very little she says, and I feel lonely more often than not. Like I have nothing positive from this 3 year relationship, except our daughter. Tonight was the first and only time I’ve rejected her for sex.  Me from a month ago would never turn it down. Part of me believes I need to leave, and let her realize she misses me. I’ve had this thought before. Only difference is now if I leave, that will be it. I will not come back. I want to fix it, I want this life we have tried to build together(which is a lot for me to say, I went from a single guy with no kids who spent 5 nights out of the week at the bar to family man father of 4, and now that is all I want) but it will never happen that way unless she is willing to see how her actions affect me.  And I know nothing I do will get through to her. 

So I am at an impasse, and need help. How do I get her to see from my POV? See what I need, and why it is important? How do we fix this? How do I get her to stop letting what love for her I have left drip away to the floor? I am willing to put in the effort to do so but I cannot continue like this. And I am done fighting futile fights. I am ready to fix it, or flush it. Please help...

245,"First of all, this is my frist time posting here. I don't know if it is the best idea. Thanks in advance for reading about my issues and sorry if I don't make myself clear enough but my mind is not working properly.

&amp;#x200B;

My life is in shambles and I don't know where to start:

I'm in my last year of university and I suspended my studies because I feel I can't do it. My purpose isn't there. I feel like in a void with no way out and that terrifies me. I don't know what to do with my life and I need help.

Since I was a kid I've been kinda on my own as I lived only with my mother and she had to work to sustain us. Due to this and the fact that the street where we lived in only had like 3 houses and zero other kids, I had problems learning how to socialize. My mother tried her best to make me happy and spoiled me in the process (I was her first child and she was alone taking care of me, so I know it wasn't her intention and she only wanted the best for me)  which cause me to have low frustration tolerance.

When I was 12 years old, my mother felt into major depression due to multiple factors (her bf dumped her and she started to question once again if her father's death was he fault or not) and as we lived only the two of us, it affected me as well. My adolescence was really sad and I often sit in a corner so I can cry or be alone with my thoughts for a while.

I entered university in better conditions, but still sad as my first gf dumped me just days before classes started. I made great friends during this years and I thought life was changing for the better. To some extent it was! I got a wonderful relationship with a girl I met through a friend (sadly we are not longer together), I had friends and I was studying something I loved, but things weren't perfect. My family put down my dog because he had ticks and they didn't want to pay for his treatment; they did this without telling me anything and I found about it on my own. That generated a big trust issue and I stopped talking to them for almost a year. Also, during these time, I was renting a small room in a house with some friends and a few strangers. One of them was a girl who seemed cool when we met, but it was totally the opposite: she blamed me of every little problem that happened in the house (even things that happened when I wasn't around) and sadly my friends believed her. It was painfull to lived there but I had no choice at the moment.

Last year it was supposed to be my last year of university. I had to write the Final Project and I would be done with studies, but my mind was in blank. Anxiety started to raise and I felt lost. Whenever I think about university, I get small panic attacks. I don't know how I will be able to resume my studies with my mind in this state, and to be honest, I don't know if I want to.

I've always felt like I'm a weak person. I feel like I don't have the power or the will to change anything in my life. When I'm feeling down for wathever reason, I tend to lock myself in my room and watch videos/play videogames all day to escape from reality and feel a little bit better in this kind of bubble where nothing can harm me. I know this is only hurting me, but I don't know how to step out of it. I have so many dreams for the future, but right now I see the future with fear because I don't think I'm going to accomplish anything in life. I get bored of everything and everyone. I have good friends, but I don't hang out with them because I have to travel to see them and I feel like they are better without my presence.

246,"So I’m 14M and I have lesbian parents, and it makes it kinda hard for me to live a normal life. I live in California, and because of that, my parents are super left wing and our political views are very different.  I love sports and video games, making it hard for them to relate to me. I don’t have a male influence/role model in my life because of them. Instead of addressing the fact that I don’t have a father and trying to work it out with me, my parents pretend like having two moms is normal, and that it doesn’t affect me at all. It makes me very uncomfortable when my friends talk about things that they do with their dads, and it’s hard for me to relate. My parents don’t try and help me deal with the fact that I have no dad, they know that it’s hard for me grow up like this but they just pretend theirs no problem. I have tried to bring up the fact that it’s hard not to have a dad but they just dismiss it in an awkward way. Does anyone have any advice on what to do.",03Jan2019,1

During the academic year, I find myself during term time keeping on top of lectures, assignments and courseworks. The thing that annoys me is that only during the holidays I lose all motivation and do absolutely nothing despite having a whole coursework due and two exams to prepare for.

248,"I am DESPERATE for help. For the past month, our upstairs neighbors have been stomping/slamming something above mine and my girlfriend's bedroom. They were kind of loud with footsteps and stuff for a since they moved in late August, but its gotten out of hand now. 


&amp;nbsp;


I've started documenting it since this Christmas. Every morning at ~9am, they'll slam something or stomp once so loud that it shakes the room and jolts us upright. Happens sometimes around midnight too. I work nights, and tonight my girlfriend called me saying that they've stomped 3 times. In fact, after the first stomp, my girlfriend heard their front door open and close, then the main door on our level opened. She looked through the peep hole, and the guy that lives there was standing in front of our door for 30 seconds before going back up, so we've determined this is 100% intentional. 


&amp;nbsp;


We have no clue why this is happening, as we literally watch our TV on volume 1, and when I play my video games, I use headphones out of respect to all of my neighbors when they're sleeping. I always try to be quiet when doing anything. We know what these people look like, and they don't look the friendliest, so we are a little nervous about confronting them. 


&amp;nbsp;


My girlfriend had enough and just called the police an hour ago. After she explained everything to the officer, he said its an issue we need to talk to our management about, 15-20 visits. Well, funny thing, is that we've been down to our management office for months complaining about the noise. They've refused to help at all, and said its the POLICE'S job to talk to them, contradicting what the office said. Management also said that the sound must be constant for 15 minutes for it to be eligible for a noise complaint. It's not constant at all. It's very sporadic, but it is driving us nuts with lost sleep and we feel trapped here for the remainder of our lease (6 months). 


&amp;nbsp;


So with nobody willing to cooperate and help out, what can we do? This is so infuriating.

tl;dr My upstairs neighbors are intentionally stomping during quiet hours. Cops and management say its the other's job to help won't do anything to help. ",03Jan2019,1

254,"I(16f) recently found out that my friend 12f is head over heels for a 21m guy. We are in a discord server together (basically a group chat for gamers), and we all play the same game. She met this guy online a month ago. 

  
I'll call my 12f friend Rose. Rose is quite a vulnerable girl. She constantly gets into conflicts with her parents, is depressed (possibly suicidal?) and has bad anxiety. I met her through this relatively small server that for a game we play. I am a moderator of it, so she seems to trust me as both an older figure she can go to with problems and as a friend. 

&amp;#x200B;

I started hearing about this new romance of hers a few days ago. Rose seemed excited and very nervous about it, but I was happy for her. She didn't include many details about him other than she found out that he is crushing on her and that she doesn't know what to say. There weren't red flags from what she had described then, besides the fact that she said he is ""old"". I assumed 16-17 (which is already weird) so I didn't ask any more questions. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today she brings it up again when I wasn't present in the conversation. My friend 16m, Alex, direct messages me about how Rose keeps talking about her crush. Alex said she's infatuated with 21m, who we'll call Zach. Rose revealed that Zach is 21 years old, and when Rose asked Zach about the \*nine year age gap\*, Zach said he will wait until she is 18 to date her. Zach also said that he is ""totally fine"" with her being 12, but Rose is worried that he will leave her within the next 6 years until she turns 18. 

&amp;#x200B;

My reaction to this was wtf?! No 21 year old guy in their right mind should be friends with a \*12 year old girl\*, let alone confessing romantic feelings for her! I'm really concerned, especially because Rose stated that she trusts Zach too. From an outside perspective like mine, it would be so easy for Zach to take advantage of her since she is so vulnerable emotionally and she finds him trustworthy. I've never talked to Zach because he is usually on the down low, not drawing too much attention to himself and he was only recently invited to the group server. Most of their relationship has been through private messages as far as I can tell. 

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do about this? I'm angry thinking about it based off of what I know right now. Would I be wrong by calling him a predator? They became close fast, he is 9 years older, he wants to wait until she is 18 to date (and do who knows what else), and she is emotionally vulnerable. Any help is appreciated. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; 21 year old man wants to start a relationship with a 12 year old girl online. 21m confessed his feelings and 12f is infatuated with him. I am 12f's friend and have taken notice of this. What can I do about this?

256,"One of my closest friends (known him since high school) is getting married. We are friends with 4 other guys. They convinced him to go to Vegas for the bachelor party. This is all well and good, and I told him that I want him and my other friends to go, but I simply do not have the budget for it. I am trying to move out of my current situation, and as a teacher its been a little hard for me with bills and everything else. 

They all became extremely upset because they said this only a once and a lifetime thing (i hope so). They started calling me selfish since I do have a trip planned to Nashville with my SO; however, I explained to them that I have been saving up a little side money to go to Nashville for over a year. So they want me to use that money to go to Vegas even though I promised my SO id take her to Nashville.

Like I do not want to keep them from going to Vegas, but its disheartening to hear them call me selfish. Of course I want to go, but I cannot save up the money for a week long trip in just a couple months. It was a very sudden engagement, and they are having the wedding in four months.

257,"Okay so I’m writing this in hopes someone can help me figure out how to fix this situation. So I’m 22 (F) and this year I found myself getting close to my brothers best friend 32 (M). He has a girlfriend and every time we use to hang out it was with my brother and sister in law.

Background story: 
We all ended up going to Vegas this past summer for my birthday and his girlfriend ended up going as well. She hated me from the beginning and always has mean comments to say to him so the entire trip we all had ignored her. Him and I really hit it off and he took my brother off to the side and told him how beautiful I am and how awesome my personality is and how I can get him into trouble. After the trip him and I texted for a week and he was very flirty with me and it felt wrong but so right because him and I have so much in common. Mind you he is still in his relationship of on and off again girlfriend for about 5 years now. So one night we were going to go out and grab drinks but he had called me saying he doesn’t think it’s a good idea because he doesn’t want to ruin anything if there’s something for us in the future and how it’s not fair for his girlfriend.

My mistake: 
So after we had gotten off the phone later that night we kept texting and I ended up at his house just drinking and swimming.. well one thing let to another and we fooled around. I had told him we can’t keep this up, he agreed and lost contact with him. Months later I was at his house with my brother and sis in law and we had both been drinking. I stayed late and I ended up sleeping over and we took things too far and had a bit too much fun. Next day I told him it can’t continue. Fast forward a month later same thing happens and I say the same thing. And then again but this time things were different this last time... 

After we had hooked up the second time that night he just kind of became distant and I felt awful about myself as if I’m repulsive or something I did in bed and the next morning I left and he seemed to have rushed me so he can get to work and I had texted him and he was very short with me then I had texted him trying to cut things off and no answer and we had talked on the phone and the convo just seemed kind of like he didn’t know what to say to “make me feel better” but he called anyway. Now we haven’t talked and we have come to the conclusion that we won’t mention this to anyone and can only be friends when in a group setting with my brother and sis in law. He says he would try things with me but he can’t right now because he needs to figure things out in his relationship. 

Now my questions: Is there anything I can do to try to fix things? Should I just move on? Was I used? I feel like now he thinks I’m immature. I’m very insecure about myself as if I’m not good enough and I’m repulsive because he became distant right after hooking up. Am I just that bad at sex or am I that repulsive? ",03Jan2019,1

261,"Sorry if this drags on but I need to dump some shit, and there is no where else I can do it except the anonymous void that is the internet. Here goes.... 

(Some background). My pops is an amazing man. He moved me, my sister, and mom to California when I was 5 years old (I'm a first generation immigrant). He's worked hard his entire life providing for us, and I had a very good up bringing. In exchange I have always tried to be as little of a burden as I could on my family. I have had a job since I was 16 years old, and have done my best to provide what I can. I don't have an education beyond my high school diploma, and for around 10 years I worked in banking. During that time, my Dad put some pressure on me to buy a house. His plan was with my benefit in mind. He wanted me to have a place to raise a family (I get married, they move out retire,  etc...). However that was never my plan. I don't want to get married, and I don't want children (can't say never, but I'm 35 and I still don't have a desire to start a family). I know this sucks for my pops, but I hope that my sister being married with kids can provide some of that legacy I know every father wants  from their son. 

Fast forward, I bought a house around ten years ago (under my name) that me and my parents moved into. At one point I got stressed/sick of not having my own space. I tried moving out to an apartment on my own, but besides my rent/expenses I had to cover half of the mortgage on the house my parents were living in. After a year of this (since I was alone with no other income),  I accumulated debt and was forced to move back to my house since I couldn't afford the two housing expenses. At the same time after a decade of putting up with a job I was unhappy at I left to try working for myself. This was not a fruitful endeavor, and after living on savings for a while, I ended up having to get another 9 to 5 job to pay bills. I don't mind my current job, I was lucky to have a friend that helped me in my time of need. The only problem is my income which is about 75% of what I used to make.

I'm in debt, I make just enough money to pay minimums, and feel like a failure for not being able to provide for my parents in their old age. I'm trapped, and I'm not happy. I want my own place/privacy, and I want to care for my parents. The bottom line, like 99% of the world, it all comes down to money. I don't care about anything materialistic. What would make me happy is to make enough money to have a place of my own, be debt free, and to care for my parents. I'm willing to work without sleep around the clock to accomplish this, but I have no direction. I'm like the robot that passes butter in Rick and Morty. I want to know my purpose.

263,"So all my life I've been a videogame nut, especially with platformers and action games. 

But something that's been bothering me since I was a kid was the topic of death in videogames. For example whenever I was playing Mario Bros 3 and Mario fell down a hole or was killed by an enemy, I'd burst out crying because I just led Mario to his death by my own irresponsibility. 

I'm 26, and I still feel this way. I feel like a murderer for killing cute enemies or blowing them up. Yes, the enemies will spawn back, but are they the same enemies that died or just replacements? For example would they have the same consciousness and memory of the particular enemy that was killed by the player character? And so on. 

What's more is many of the top minds agree that videogame characters are actually sentient and conscious beings just like we are, and to be honest it makes me feel sick that during my childhood alone I was responsible for the deaths of thousands of sentient, conscious digital beings.

I was thinking about it last night, but videogames reduce stress and boredom, yet at the same time I don't want to be killing people.",03Jan2019,1
265,"I currently live in Texas. The job I had here went to shit and I had to quit because of it. My lease is up in two months and I don't know what direction to take. The job I got afterwards pays decently and if I got a cheaper apartment I could start saving almost $400 a month. The only issue is the new job is boring as heck and I don't like it but it's extremely easy.

I thought about moving down to Austin (about four hours away) to live with friends but I'd end up making about the same and being able to save the same amount of money. I don't really care to live in Austin but friends would be around.

I also have a lot of friends who live in Oregon who I'd like to go stay with as well. I've been there a few times and they grew up in the state and said I'd be more or less be able to save about the same amount there. I'd really like to do this move just to get out of Texas for awhile but moving across country is just a really daunting decision.

I can afford to move anywhere I want really with my current savings but I worry my vehicle won't make it up to Oregon if I went with that choice. It's a 2001 Tahoe with 180K miles on it. I also worry Austin might be a bit hard on it as well.

I just feel like no matter what I do it doesn't really matter. I just want to find somewhere to settle down, work my way up, and try to make a decent living.

I feel like the easy thing to do is stay where I am and do that but I really dislike the job. I also feel like what I WANT to do is move up to Oregon with my friends there but I don't know if it's a good decision.

267,"So, a few weeks ago I met this girl and her sister through one of my close friends. We all clicked and started hanging out as a group almost instantly. This girl, I’ll call Ana, got close to me and soon became like my best friend. Long story less long, she grew to have a crush on me which I was oblivious too mostly because she has been a lesbian all her life, and didn’t really seem to lean into bicurious territory at all. We’ve both been recovering through rough breakups which was something we bonded through. However mine was to the point where I wasn’t sure if I was ready for anything. 

One night, she called me late at night and asked me to take her to the hospital, so I did. When we’re in the emergency room waiting for her to be treated I start to ask around a bit about her feelings towards me. Ana came clean and said how she felt. I told her I liked her too because facts being facts, I enjoyed her company allot. I would say I was starting to grow attached to her as well so I had no issues saying it. The next few days Ana came to my place, we’d cuddle a bit and just relax together. 

However one day, she pulled ALL the way back. Like, went from my best friend to like she barely knows me. This went on from a week, so long story less long again, she’s been struggling with the idea of liking me. She told me she’s had crushes before but not quite on this level. Ana pulled back so much because she got scared, uncertain of what to do. Because In her mind, she only sees herself living her life with another woman, yet she feels so comfortable and happy being with me, she wasn’t sure what to do.

The reason why I’m making this post is we’ve come to an understanding that we’ll just be cuddle buddies, but she kept trying to make it sound like the door was opened for things to maybe progress further at some point. I’m not sure what the right question to ask is about this, or what kind of help I’m really seeking, but I guess on a base level I want to know could this work? I mean... if she feels so strongly that it’s like making her act and think the way she is that almost makes me think there’s a chance.

268,"Hey guys

Okay so, I've been talking to this girl I met on the net for a couple of days now. We've both been openly flirty, and agreed to meet each other on the twelth. 

All of a sudden on the first of January, she stopped sending messages. I've sent two messages that she hasn't replied to. As far as I know she hasn't decided to even look at them either.

I want to give her the benefit of the doubt, but with my self doubting and very cynical nature, I found it best to ask you guys. Has she ghosted me? 

I also don't have a lot of experience with this sort of thing, which is why I'm coming to the subreddit.

273,"I am stressed out at my job and have been working in the same department (though different positions) for 8 years. In the last year I have threatened to leave twice and been given two raises totalling 32k. Either I was underpaid or they need me to stay, or both.

I don't like the direction we're headed in, and I'm the point man for too many projects. It's stressful and I hate being in charge of difficult problems I don't immediately have the capability or skills to fix. Additionally after working with us for longer than me, my manager quit a month back and was replaced by a co-worker who was previously a good friend. Now it's weird between us.

The cost of living is relatively high in my area and I am currently the sole bread winner for my wife and one year old daughter. We live in a two bedroom condo. I want my daughter to have a single family home and a yard, but that's not gonna happen in my area with my salary. (Even after the raises.)

So, I began looking for new jobs again, and applied all over and found one across the country. The job fits my skill sets. It's nothing incredible, but I can perform the required tasks with ease and there would likely be room for growth.

During the interview I didn't know if I really  wanted to move that  far so I was aloof and didn't up play my skills. I refused to do paperwork during the interview because I wasn't comfortable with giving out the information they wanted and I still got a tenative offer. I told them we needed to nail down a salary, but I was scared of moving so I asked for what I consider to be a ridiculous offer of (my current salary + 35k). I hedged my bets and told him I understand if that's ridiculously high for the area I'm open to negotiation.

He came back with (my current salary -10k) I asked for him to make it at least (my current salary) and he came back with (my current salary -5k plus 20k signing bonus and 25k relocation bonuses).

The cost of living isn't ridiculously different, a 700k house here would be like 500k there, but that's a big enough change to put me in the buyers market for a small place.

I chose this new job's location because it's cold (I like the cold) and it seems like a healthy liberally minded area and I wanted cheaper costs of living. I don't have any non work friends in my current area, and my wife has two okay friends here. All of my family already lives far enough away that I normally take a plane to visit. 

My wife said she'd be okay leaving if that was my choice, but she had slight reservations. In the end she seemed okay with it but obviously the idea of selling our condo, packing up and moving cross country with a one year old to a brand new area we've never been to is frightening.

Idk what I should do. The signing and relocation bonuses are solid and the benefits are equal (basically) to my current company. Without some good advice I figured tomorrow I'll just email the recruiter saying I can't justify the move for that salary and im sorry but if that's the best offer I'll have to decline.

Who knows maybe he gives a better offer? Maybe I am walking out on a solid deal. What do you think?

A little about me , I am 22 year old male. I need help with this problem that I have come to realize is the cause of why i feel so depressed. I can only be happy when others want what I have or want me. When I was a kid I was very small,skinny, and not so smart. I was picked last in gym class and since my family moved countries, I had trouble in school and could not learn the material well. I did not get good grades. This "" trend"" followed me throughout high school as well. Girls never talked to me and I remember accidentally bumping into a girl and she screamed ""ew!"" and looked so grossed out by me. That left a pretty big scar. Around me girls were always interested in the taller, athletic, and smarter guys. While my grades did improve, I was still very small and skinny. Now you may wonder why not just go play sports and get fit. Well I could not, my parents would not allow me to do any after school activities. They were very strict brown parents.

So at the end of senior year, My mom was suggested by the doctor to start exercising because she was overweight. I offered to start working out with her. I jumped at this opportunity because i saw an opportunity to become ""good looking."" I fell in love with working out and have been doing it religously for over 6 years now and have been extremely shredded. I make so many sacrifices in order to stay lean all year. I still do it because I want others to want the body that i have.

I knew it couldn't last because I had to graduate. I graduated as an engineer and now I make a very good salary. The only reason I finished school and got a job is because i want others to see that i was successful. Failure was not an option for me.

I know this isn’t an excuse but basically growing up for me was really rough, my dad has a terrible temper and when my parents were still together they fought and yelled constantly. As I got older I would sometimes get involved in the fights, and even once they were divorced I would be involved in fights with them individually and they would always escalate to yelling and screaming at each other.
Anyways, yelling is all I know. To me it is completely normal to yell when you’re angry. But I want to be better, and learn how to control it better, I just don’t know how, which is why I’m here.

284,"I am 26 m and have a female friend who is 25 m. She lives in a different part of the country but comes back for holidays. Last year, we almost hooked up on new years but didnt. I knew I was going to have a shot with her this new years when she came back.

&amp;#x200B;

I worked late, so we met up at 1 and had a night of heavy drinking, bar hopping, and dancing. It was pretty obvious that shit was going to go down when we were walking back to my friends house and she kept referring to me as her boyfriend and leaning on me. We got back and I went up to the bathroom, she ambushes me on the way out and grabs me and takes me into the guest room and starts heavily making out with me and getting undressed.

&amp;#x200B;

Now theres this other woman, 26, who was in the house who is very into me and I'm not so much into her. I used to consider her a friend but the past few months ive been wondering if were actually friends or she actually just wants sex from me. So im in the room making out with the 25 year old and the 26 year old who is into me barges in, starts yelling and swearing at us to get our clothes on and leave, says theres several people in the house who are upset and we are not welcome. We left immediately. By the time we got back to my house, neither of us were in the mood, we went to bed and didnt have sex.

&amp;#x200B;

Apparently no one in the house was upset. We were told the owners of the house wanted to fight us. Apparently they were mildly irritated that a drink was spilled but that was it. Also, a bunch of rumors were started by the person who ruined it, saying that she ""walked in on us having sex"" and that I ""pulled out and came on the floor and she stepped in it and had to clean it up"", along with a bunch of derogatory comments flying around about our promiscuous nature.

&amp;#x200B;

Now the girl is flying back halfway across the country and i wont see her again for who knows how long, if ever, her parents might move out of state this year. I hung out with her today but it was at her parents while her mom and younger sister were there, obviously I wasn't going to make a move. I really like and respect this girl and its just kinda sad, theres been a sexual tension but we rarely see eachother and it seems like when we do it just gets ruined by other people, this time very intentionally. Her parents might be selling their house and moving out of state again so theres a chance I might never see her again. And the derogatory comments arent appreciated either and were being made about both of us (calling her a slut and a whore and me a bad dog, player, etc) and I feel like next time I see the girl who ruined it shes going to brush it off like it didnt even happen.

On the other 2 days, I plan to improve my own music skills which is writing lyrics, playing guitar, creating songs. 

However I’m afraid, full of self doubt. That I can never attain the body I plan to have by end of this year. Afraid that I won’t release good songs. Afraid that I can never achieve my dreams. 
I don’t want that to happen, ever. I can never imagine myself doing an office job, I’d rather live my dream of touring the world with my songs. 

What can I do to make sure I live the dream ? 
I can’t afford to just be normal and have a normal job, it just isn’t in me. If I can’t lead the life I want, I don’t see anything else in my life. 
Music is my passion, it kept me going, it saved me from taking my life years ago. That’s my passion, I don’t think I can ever live with me having a normal job. I would feel dead inside if that happens.

It started as a defense mechanism but has just worsened since.

Now I think it might be out of hand. At this point I’m not sure if I’m being sarcastic or serious when talking about myself in a good light. I think I am an attractive guy when my acne doesn’t flair up, and I get with an above average amount of ladies (I think). Now I start to think that a lot of girls I talk to like me, this could be the case because I am a nice guy (or so I think) or I could be completely full of myself and be completely oblivious to others emotions at this time.

I am a very sarcastic person. In middle school I never had many friends, and I’ve seen the show Friends many times and because of it, act like chandler. Sarcasm is natural to me, and I always make dumb jokes with no malicious intent behind them. Very few of my friends (I believe, but maybe more think so) take these jokes seriously while most of them understand that they are all in good humor and just friendly banter.

Tonight I was talking to some of my friends online about my problems with girls. I feel as if I am being overwhelmed by which girl I want to date right now, and was looking for a solution. While we were talking about what I would want personally, we started talking about each other’s personalities. I made some statements about one of my friends tendencies, and he made some about mine. I got defensive and kept making excuses on why I couldn’t be wrong in the situation. Him and another one of my friends pointed out how I wasn’t taking criticism and kept defending myself, possibly because I wouldn’t accept that I was in the wrong.

Now I’m just curious what I should do. I’m not sure if I’m narcissistic or if I’m overthinking it. I definitely don’t want to be a pretentious douche who thinks he’s better than everyone else, but I do compare myself to others, sometimes I’m better sometimes I’m worse. The two friends who confronted me about this behavior have a history of attacking my personality and traits, this could just be their personal anger or they have seen this in the past from me. I also recently discovered that I have above average anxiety l, so I could be completely out of my mind and just really anxious.

I graduated college two years ago from a degree I kind of now regret. I mean, I liked my degree to an extent. It was a 4-year course and a pre-law so in my head it was in the better part of the liberal arts college, but I'm now realizing how completely useless and undervalued it really is.

After I graduated, I got a job as a writer/editor for a local publishing which was pretty good at first but the pay was minimum wage and I had no benefits. Eventually the bad stuff like being assigned work late at night and weekends plus writing something I hate outweighed the money, so I left. 

At the time, I left because I wanted to apply too grad schools abroad, so I can get into translation. I spent a year off doing that but it didn't really work out.

I feel like I have to resort to finding work in my country again but really the wage for what I do is just really low. It's like so low that you can't live off your own with is.

I'm at that point where I just want money so my mom wouldn't be having a hard time yknow? And it's a proven fact that I would not get paid that well here (at least not for another 10+ years). I've accepted the fact that I won't be able to travel as much because of being poor and that I have to sacrifice my social life to earn (I legit can't remember the last time I saw any of my friends).

Sorry for the ramble, I just feel that I'm way too old to still be a fuck up. All my friends have jobs or in grad schools (albeit paid by their parents but hey that's still something). The only people I know who aren't as bad as I am are those who're still in college. I know I can't compare, but I feel like it really says something when I've made about as much progress as someone who hasn't even graduated yet.

300,"Hello guys! So a few months ago I started a new job, among my collegues is this guy (lets call him P). He is sort of a ""fedora wearing nice guy"" (cliche and distasteful, I know) type but he means well and has helped me relax in the new enviroment, he's a good guy, very friendly, helped me with other stuff as well (such as helping me choose a present for the secret santa etc etc). A month ago his ""friend"" (J) started working in the same company, I got along with J pretty fast since we have a similar attitude and such but the problem is that he is sort of a snake. Not even the first week after I met with J, we got a bit personal if you could call it like that and ever since, hell even in our first conversation, he was and still is constantly talking shit about P behind his back and he even tries to subtly embarass P in front of our other collegues and whoever I introduce to him.

J and P go way back supposedly and this is their last year in uni which means chances are they will never see eachother again after 2019 so P does value him apparently and sees him as a good buddy. Normally I would never even think of doing such a thing but it started getting on my nerve, worst thing is he talks shit behind other collegues' backs too and then ""befriends"" them (I have no doubts that he has done the same to me too), so my question is: Should I tell P about this? I know what the consequences might be and again I would never do such a thing since it's none of my business but P keeps around this toxic waste of a person close to him and thinks that he is such a good friend to him, I honestly can't stand how he subtly (and sometimes not subtly) absolutely wipes the dirty floor with P for no reason at all but to make himself look cool and to turn other people against him. There are already consequences to this shit as some collegues started being more aggressive and mocking towards P for no reason but because of the stuff J keeps spouting and doing and it really hurts me to see that shit every damn day.

Tl;dr: Guy I know has a toxic as fuck friend that talks shit behind his back and is affecting how other people see him. Should I tell him about his ""friend"" 's behaviour so that he can cut him off for good or should I just keep quiet about it",03Jan2019,1

I have a habit of analyzing every bit of someone's behavior and that means when they irritate me I know exactly how to get under their skin. Through the years I've learned the best way to keep people from targeting me is to be something that makes them uneasy. 

I've made a few inappropriate jokes of the dark taste a couple times and ive been able to mend those incidents with a goofy, lovable, charming persona and a hell of a good amount of effort into my work. I thought it wasn't a problem until my manager (one of the people I consider closest to a friend in the workplace) suggested me a few shows to watch on Netflix which he said ""reminded him of me"". One of the shows is about a person who sees an imaginary friend and kills people (happy!) And the other is about a psychopathic stalker who works as a bookstore manager (you)

309,"Hey everyone!

I guess I'm looking for the input of folks who consider themselves self-motivated, artists, creative types.

I'm guy wanting to get a YouTube channel started making video essays exploring themes like sociology, philosophy, and religion in media.  The reason I'm posting here today is to get some advice for some personal stuff that's getting in my way to getting the process even started.

I've planned out how I want to get this process rolling: Gather as many relevant notes of my subject as possible--such as my thesis for each video--, compile a script, record audio, and then edit video.

I've been stuck on the very first part of this for a couple weeks now.  I've figured out that I want to analyze how Frank Herbert's Dune can be read through the perspectives of the main paradigms of sociology.  

I'm absolutely God awful at making myself do the work of researching and compiling the notes I need to get this rolling.  Aside from coffee shops where I can work on my tablet, my only work space is my desktop in my room.  This is bad because I inevitably lose interest and just waste time playing shit like AoE 2 or Stellaris or some other fun, immersive time waster.

I want to be able to overcome this habit.  It goes all the way back to childhood.  I'm by no means a ""gamer"", but I play my fair share as much as the next guy.  That said, this crap is hindering me from becoming a content creator.

  It's something I want to do as a creative outlet and I tell myself each day I'm gonna take notes. 9 times out of 10, I fail to do that and end up feeling like shit as a result, because I'm letting myself down.

What kind of advice would you have to get over these kinds of distractions? I really appreciate any input offered. 

For clarity, I'm not a gaming addict.  I get distracted pretty easily by a lot of different things, like wanting to go workout, practicing cooking, and other stuff, but you put me in front of a computer and leave me with Skyrim, and I've thrown out at least two to three hours of doing fuck all ",03Jan2019,1

311,"Hi all, so this woman in my office sits in the cubicle across mine. She steps out for lunch everyday and leaves her phone on her desk. We don't have a cafeteria since it's a small workplace and most of us eat our lunches at our desks. She gets multiple calls on her phone  during that time and it keeps ringing loudly throughout the lunch break. People get pissed off but there's nothing anyone can do. 

Yesterday, I politely confronted her and asked her to carry her phone with her when she stepped out. She shrugged and said she didn't want to. So I asked her to at least leave it on silent mode so rest of us can have our lunch in peace. To which she rudely replied that I should mind my own business and she'll do as she pleases. I have to mention that she was probably having a bad day (not because of me). But this has been going on for quite some time and today she did it again.

Now we don't have an HR since it's a mom and pop kind of office and this problem seems too petty to be complaining about. I don't know how to make her see she's acting like an asshole. Any advice is helpful. Thanks.",03Jan2019,1
312,"So in March I was fired from a smallish local company. I had a tardiness issue and after being warned about it I was then fired several months later. 

While I was at this company I went above and beyond, was apart of several planning groups, trained several departmental employees, and held a company wide training on software that we use. I was also able to see an opportunity to save the company thousands of dollars and even emplimented the plan prior to being let go I managed to save the company over 30k in the first quarter. This may not seem like much but that would equate to the same profit we would have gotten from a large service job with no overhead costs... something I'm very proud to say I did.

Prior to being fired I was looking at other companies because I was knew I was being underpaid for what I was doing for the company. But after nearly a year, taken other rolls that paid better, and then having to look for a job that I enjoyed as much as what I was doing previously I've decided that... if I could figure out how to make it happen, I'd like to go back.

So I need advice on how I go about asking for a job from the same company that fired me.. do I even have a chance?

313,"Hey guys. I’m in my mid 20’s . My mom died when I was real young and I’ve noticed I’ve had issues forming intimate relationships.
 
I’m working on these issues and identifying others through therapy, I’m a bit more aware how certain behaviors or patterns of thought have forged over time. I used porn as a crutch for a long time and its hard, but I’m slowly but surely distancing myself from it. 

I met a girl off bumble recently who was def my type. I knew our relationship would probably start off sexual but was open to possibly more. I came over, we enjoyed the view and smoked and got to know each other. Eventually we put on Netflix. I gave her a massage. It eventually turned sexual and was going down on  her, meanwhile I wasn’t getting hard. There was more foreplay but she didn’t reciprocate, we did fuck for a little but I got soft real quick.

I didn’t know what to say. I knew being confident and upfront was the best choice but couldn’t talk, I felt judged and rightfully so. I believe she was genuinely excited to meet me but was ultimately let down. Should I tell her everything I’m going through? How would i even start? How would you have handled it?? I actually like her a bit but I just think that in this case I needed some more time get comfortable with a new girl.

I texted her about it the next day and said that I should have just taken it slow because there’s been a lot on my mind lately, I told her I liked her and would want to see her again but maybe I just needed more time. She agreed that it did move kinda fast and she was just trying to make me comfortable. 

Perhaps I shouldn’t have been this open but I told her I’d been going through a lot lately and sometimes need time to get comfortable with a new girl. I said I had been a bit oversexed and tired lately, so that coupled with the anxiety didn’t help. I told her I’ve been trying to manage and express my sexuality in a healthier way. I ended by stating I wasn’t sure how to approach this so I figured honesty was the best bet.

All she texted me to that was “Well I appreciate the honesty”. I kinda got the message. Maybe it was too much honesty too fast. 

I told her this was not how I wanted it to go because it’s a shitty feeling. I told her thanks for hearing me out and told her to take care, preserving some dignity I guess. She hasn’t texted me back since and I’m not surprised, but I’m just wondering how I handled all of this? How could I have handled this better? What could I have said to her.

Maybe she still would have messaged me back if I hadn’t just told her to take care. I don’t know why I’m over analyzing this. We had talked about my mother before hanging out and she seemed like a compassionate chick. I should move on but I just can’t. She’s all I think about. All I want to do is prove her wrong and be the best version of myself in her presence. I basically messaged her goodbye but I still want to see if this can be salvaged. It might be pathetic but I want to message her back. I don’t want to give up this easily on something I feel this strongly about and I don’t care about looking pathetic.

Realistically though. Is there any way back from this? Was there a better way I could have handled this? How could I go about contacting her now? I took the time to tell myself to truly love and value myself so this never happens again.

316,"Hi all, 

My partner and I have been having a problem with our neighbor, a very sweet 80-something year old woman with growing dementia. She is not aggressive or combative, though we often hear her screaming at her nurse during the evening. The nurse only comes once or twice a week, so it is not really an issue. 

The main problem is that she sings at the top of her lungs from 5 in the morning until midnight. The same song over and over and over. Just the tune of Que Sera Sera (just la la la rather than words). What makes it worse is that she is just sitting there, staring into space and singing. 

However, when we engage her, she seems perfectly aware. She can hold a conversation easily.

We've gone over to her house over ten times to ask her to be quieter. Each time she says she will be. She even remembers that she should stop singing when she opens the door and sees us. But 2 minutes later, she is singing again. She's given us permission to bang on the walls when we hear her, but now that is not clicking either. When we knock, she just sings louder. 

We've tried quite a bit. We've talked to her nurse, but the nurse can't do much being there a few nights a week. We have left large signs in her house as a reminder, which get torn down by her daughter. We tried to contact the daughter, but she has refused to answer any calls or messages. The daughter has barely come to her house in the past few months. The times we have seen her, before the singing got bad, she was very hostile and unwilling to chat with us. 

Our landlord offered to get involved, but I worry about the consequences of this? Could this get her removed from her home? But I also worry about her being home alone in her state of mind. Basically, I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I don't want to do something that potentially gets her removed from her home, but I also really need to sleep and am slowly losing my mind to this tune. 

Does anyone have any advice at all on a way to curb the singing? Or what we should do in general? I thought about buying her a music player of some sort, but would that help?

I'm lost at where to even begin...",03Jan2019,1
317,"Seven years ago I worked as a game designer. I got brought into the team through my high school friend.  


Over the years I've worked really hard, managed to get low paying game design jobs, and even shipped a few products, the one I'm proudest of being [www.savetheanimalsgame.com](https://www.savetheanimalsgame.com) ... However, the city I live in is very, very focused around finance, to the detriment of all other industries: it's hard for everyone else to support themselves when most of the city assumes that there will always be high flying finance people willing to pay ridiculous rent, ridiculous prices for food and drink and experiences.  


Even though I had five solid years as a game designer, not only could I not seem to get my salary above 33k USD/year, but eventually all game design jobs dried up in my town, and I was forced to take a General Assembly course, and now I'm a web developer... not making that much more money than I was. This is in Hong Kong, THE most expensive properties in the world, where rent for a tiny micro apartment can easily reach $2k USD per month at the very, very minimum. If you get prices below that, then you're walking up five flights of stairs into a sublease inside a ratty little tenement building.  


I would have been okay with all of this, because I am ultimately pretty lucky to have parents who are willing to support me, but my motivation has completely gone down the drain when I discovered that my friend now works at Niantic Labs.  


My high school friend moved to Los Angeles (something I could not do as I am not an American citizen) where for several years, he was able to work a remote contract with the company we were working at originally, where he was getting paid several times what I was getting paid, working only a few hours a day. He got this opportunity because he had a really good relationship with our boss, but eventually I was so sick of that company and its mismanagement (the company NEVER ended up properly releasing a project, for those years my friend worked entirely on vaporware projects) that I left, decided to join a smaller firm, and that's how I was able to ship [www.savetheanimalsgame.com](https://www.savetheanimalsgame.com). Of course, then that company went out of business.  


Meanwhile my friend got quite depressed, and spent several years simply not working at all, supported by his family. While I busted my butt during that entire time, making sure to stay constantly employed throughout that time to maximise opportunities and learn as much as I can.  


So it just feels extremely, extremely fucking unfair that now he's gotten a job at Niantic Labs.  


Now, I understand there's a lot of factors here that aren't personal. The United States has one of the strongest economies in the world, a system set up since World War II, where the Bretton Woods Conference basically made it so that the United States is the world's lender of last resort. It means that the US has more economic power than the rest of the world combined because the Fed can print US Dollars for the American Government, the ONE currency you can buy oil with.  


And of course, while Hong Kong is a rich city and there's every reason that if I keep working hard I can create a successful career... it just will *never* be a creative job (and still pay well enough for me to not need to struggle), which is what I really want. But at the same time, it's a bit entitled of me to think that I can just *have* a creative job given the geographical limitation. It's the reason why people move to Los Angeles in the first place: as a general principle, there is simply no better place in the world to start a career in film than Hollywood. Millions of people want to be film stars, but not everyone gets to live in tinseltown, which means that not everyone gets to be a film star. I cannot change circumstances over which I have no control. My friend's an American, I am not... therefore he gets the right to work in America, while I do not.  


And moreover, I am probably discounting the work he did put in, in order to find the job he did. He probably had to network a lot. He went to GDC every year, and that's EXPENSIVE. He went to game hackathons and game jams and did lots of projects for free on the side. So in a sense, I absolutely cannot say that he doesn't deserve what he has.  


But I feel like I deserve more too. And it fills me with bitterness and resentment to think that in order for me to make enough money to provide for my family in this extraordinarily expensive city, to some extent I will have to give up on my dream of being a game designer, and simply accept that I'll have to do work that I might not be that passionate about but will pay well. The truth is, I am very leftist in my politics, and so the idea of me working in the sectors where Hong Kong actually does excel - finance, fintech, and blockchain - feels a little bit like ""selling out my soul"", and it's extremely, extremely depressing. Where I once wanted to craft exhilarating and profound experiences for gamers, now I can only see a future where I am engineering speculative blockchain assets or front end components for rapacious cryptocurrency exchanges that will even trade against their own customers, all just so that I can make as much money as possible.  


What do I do? While I was alright before I learned of my friend getting that job, now that I have found out... I am shattered. I feel like I've wasted years of my life pursuing a futile passion only for someone else to receive all the rewards without putting close to the same amount of work, simply because of circumstance. When my friend told me that he got the job with pure intention, I instead decided to throw caustic and bitter resentment - ""Why don't you get ME a job, asshole?"" / ""You getting this job feels like a giant 'Fuck You' to me, from God"" / ""Unless you can help me get a job too,  I don't fucking wanna hear it. I don't care where you work. I'd rather you had not told me."" - and may have even ruined a friendship because of my angry venting and ranting. And I especially feel awful knowing that my friend has had to battle depression for years, so my angry attempt at invalidating his very legitimate success and preying upon his insecurities due to my own pettiness is... well, it's a dick move to be sure.  


But ever since I've found out... I can't put my heart back into work I don't give a shit about. I'm screaming at my colleagues. I don't have any motivation at work. I've worked so long and so hard for a dream only for it to be taken away and now all I can see is an indefinite trudge into work I don't like for the sheer sake of simple survival... it makes me want to go full derelict, and just give up entirely, and just leech off my parents (ironically this is only possible because my Dad... was a banker). But of course, that cannot possibly be an option, because what would that say about me? A lazy, entitled, spoiled, good-for-nothing, useless fucking brat.  


TL;DR - It's really hard giving up on a dream and I'm finding it hard to stay motivated.

I went to an arts school which I hated and never really had any friends there, or in elementary school for that matter. For all 4 years there all I had really was a casual acquaintances who I never or very rarely saw outside of school and would routinely make plans without me. until the 8th grade when di transferred to my school, after we got to talking we realized we had several classes together and quickly became friends, she had way more serious problems than I did with major mental health and sex stuff and she would sometimes talk to me about that, she was the first person who I felt like ever truly trusted me and she’s the only person who I’ve ever truly trusted, I told her stuff that I’d never tell anyone else, even anonymously on reddit, she even came over to my house once (which is a big deal for me) she was the only person I ever told I loved (Plutonically) and wasn’t obligated to and she said it back. But her dad caught us smoking weed (my first time) and she wasn’t allowed to see me anymore and vice versa and that in addition to some admittedly inappropriate text conversations her parents found and her transferring to another school I haven’t seen or talked to her since and I miss her like hell, I think about her all the time and I just want to see her again and I have nothing connecting me to her besides her Instagram acc which I don’t think is in use anymore, what should I do? I want to see her again, she’s one of the only real friends I’ve ever had but I don’t know what to do. How do I reach out? What would I say?

She's been in a relationship for a couple years now and her partner doesn't like that we stay in contact even though our conversations are harmless. We've been talking less lately because of that — she even admitted a few months ago when I wished her on her birthday that he's the underlying reason for us losing touch. In that same conversation, she said she wanted to talk more and that she would bring it up with him. My best guess is that she decided the strain our friendship put on her relationship wasn't worth it, which is understandable but still hurts.

She's got a busy and stressful life so I get that it usually takes her time to respond but this is different. I know she's doing okay because she opens my messages and uses social media (including Reddit) regularly, but in a way that makes me feel even worse. Every time the thought of being ghosted makes its way into my head, I feel my soul sink like I've lost someone important. I look up to her and miss her so much.

It took me a while to organize my thoughts and they still feel like a mess so I apologize. I've got friends, tasks, and exercise to help distract me so I guess what I really want to know if there is some internal thought process or mantra that can help get me through these next two weeks.

324,"TLDR at bottom. I work for myself and my business is small. I work closely with my clients and I don’t often have any assistance. I have been doing this for years successfully even though I have suffered with various mental health struggles.

The last two months I have been isolating and avoiding my work almost completely due to increased anxiety and depression. Damage is done from it, which I have to accept, but I am stuck in a downward spiral that needs to stop. 

I need to resume contact with one client specifically who has been trying to reach me for those two months. It is not to the point of legal concerns, but I can’t just contact my client like nothing happened. I have neglected the contact for long enough that I have reason to believe they are concerned and upset.

How do I explain that I have been absent/neglectful because of health issues? Is it relevant to include details (indicating mental health)? I am sure I made a bad impression and they will not be a repeat client or referral, but I just want to get back to the work and wrap it up as positively and tactfully as possible.

I'm comfortable talking about a lot of stuff, but I just can't for the life of me talk about my self-harm. She knows that I cut and we've done some shallow conversations about the subject. Whenever we talk about it it's usually another topic that naturally leads to us talking about self-harm. But if she pushes, I just shut down.

I know I need to talk about it. I know I need to tell her why. I know I need to tell her how much I am struggling. But I physically can't. Whenever I try to bring up the subject or she asks, I get all clammy, I shrink into a ball, stomach feels funny, and chest is tight. If I answer at all its with a ""yes"" or ""no"", sometimes nodding/shaking head when I am really struggling.

Someone suggested writing down how I feel on paper and handing it to her, I would if I had the courage to hand the paper over without breaking down in tears. Let alone bringing the paper with me to a session.

I might be delusional but if i can’t at least think that we have a chance then i have no reason to live.

I had been walking past her room and the hallway was completely empty and it was in between classes, right as i passed by her room she came outside of her door to shut and it, and i looked her in the eyes and she kinda froze and stopped what she was doing and i froze a little too and we just looked into each other’s eyes and it was the strangest thing... it was like we were looking into each other’s eyes for hours and hours and time froze around us.

Hi redditors,

Recently I got into a physical fight with my dad. To be honest, it was more like me, abusing him physically.

I think there was a long built up to this point, frequent fights; him yelling, hitting me (when I was young), and else.

I don't know if this is necessary, but let me tell you how the fight started.

So, I lost my wallet and had to buy a new one. Me and my dad were looking at different wallets via my laptop.

We were looking at couple of brands he suggested and he boasted about how he was helping out the company when it was at its infancy and how important he was.

So I said, ""you are fine with this one?"", and there he changed his tone saying that he dosent have enough money to offer such a wallet.

Before thinking that I am a spoiled kid beating my dad, because he refused to buy me a wallet, the problem is not that he refused it. Rather, it is the way he talks. Conversing with him is often convoluted and very stressful to me. In fact, the wallet that I was using was a 20$ wallet from amazon, and I was proud of how cheap and good the wallet was. I was suffice with that wallet. It was him at the beginning, who said 20$ wallet is too cheap. (I asked him for a price point, and he refused saying just show me some wallets so I showed him wallets from every price point imaginable)

Anyways back to the story, I was little bit annoyed at how the conversation was going. My dad, sensing my frustration said angrily, ""Why are you mad at me? I am buying you a wallet. You should be grateful"". Knowing how such a conversation goes (he said something like this all the time. How I only like my mother. How I don't like him despite the fact that he is buying me stuffs). I went to my room and locked the door. I started overwatch, trying to escape him. He banged the door and yelled something (I couldn't hear him because of the earphones) shortly he turned off the internet, shut down the power, and dressed up with a room key. He proceeded to try to kick me out of my house. He did the same thing to my grandmother, when they fought. My grandmother now lives with my uncle instead. This is another long story.

Something just snapped in my brain, and I became crazy. Maybe it was the fact that he always used to say, I am so scared that you may hit me (I never hit him in my life), while he was always the one who got angry and screamed, threw my stuff, and hit me (at least he dosen't hit me anymore, maybe due to my size.)

So there is that. I hit him. I choke him. At first he was screaming, ""kill me kill me!"", and later he apologized. Then I stopped. I locked my door after that incident. Since then, I never saw him again. I feel disgusted when I see him. Its not anger or hate, I just feel sick in my stomach when I see him, or even when I think about him. I don't go to the house as often, because of the fear that I may see him.

I got a news from my mom that his left leg's tendon got little weak because of it. Also, he is re-doing his eye surgery today. It's been a week since that incident and I am not sure if the fight caused it or not.

I haven't had a chance to talk about it, till now.

I dont know what to do, or who to talk to. It's a horrible thing to do as a son.

Maybe Reddit may help me. After all, you guys helped me with a lot of things in my life.",03Jan2019,1

It has been a couple years since my friend was killed. I still feel like I could have prevented it and it still haunts me until now. I don't know how to move past this. I guess what I'm trying to ask is how can I move past the guilt and move on from this? There hasn't been any closure, or anyone charged in her murder.

339,"I'm a 26M living on Long Island, I've been in college for eight years and still don't have my Bachelor's because of various personal issues- untreated bipolar disorder (I'm medicated now), alcohol dependency, and the disintegration of my family requiring my attention throughout all of this. My father is incredibly controlling and abusive but is a doctor and helps me monetarily; my mother is addicted to crack and my parents just finished a brutal three-year long divorce which has nearly bankrupted them; my older sister was addicted to heroin but has since recovered and has a steady job; and my younger brother is autistic and refuses treatment and therapy, was expelled from two colleges and now lives at home, refuses to work, go back to school, or help with housework, and also has an eating disorder that could be anorexia or bulimia or both but mainly seems like a control thing, and he has said he enjoys making us worry about his health. 

SO. I have a lot of shit to deal with on that front.

As for myself, I had to quit jobs and leave school at times when my family demanded my attention and help, which is on me, too, but it's been tough and my work history is now pretty sporadic and odd. My GPA has also been all over the place, due to the stress of my family and also failing and withdrawing from classes due to my own mental health and drinking issues, often going from straight As to straight Fs. I have all the credits necessary to graduate, but I can't because my GPA needs to be at least a 2.0 and I have a 1.8. It's also an English degree, and I legitimately have no idea what to do with it. I never planned on teaching or becoming a writer or journalist or going to law school, I just never had a plan. At all. I just picked majoring in English because I love reading. It stressed me out to think about my future, and I'm ashamed of that and feel adrift. I wish I had picked something else, or knew what I wanted. My friends have graduated and gone onto good jobs; I'm still taking online courses from home. I did 30 days rehab in L.A. last January and then did sober living out there for six months, but couldn't find work and didn't have a car, so I had to come back to live with my father and brother.

Sorry, I feel like this post has gone on for so long and it's just me complaining about my family and whining about my own failures, but it's hard. I've never really had any support or guidance. I don't know what to ask for, or how to phrase what I'm trying to ask. Essentially, I'm exhausted, and would be interested in any sort of suggestions or guidance you guys can come up with. It might sound stupid to ask for such general help, but I really have no fucking clue what I'm doing. I'm sober, I quit smoking, I'm on meds, I'm exercising, I like myself, and I forgive myself for doing so many things I regret, but when it comes to getting my life started and heading in some sort of direction, I'm at a loss on how to proceed.

345,"My mother charges me £350 pm rent to live in her house in the smallest box room. 

I work full time but I also enrolled myself into university. She told me I am not allowed to go part time at work because she needs the rent and can’t compromise on a price, as part time work will only give me enough to pay rent but I need extra funds for myself, my uni stuff and general living. 
So I start uni in Feb whilst having to work full time. 

This is where my problems are, I’m not allowed to do my own washing, I have to literally schedule in when I can do my washing once a week (sometimes I wait until she is out so I can actually get my washing done) 
I’m not allowed to have baths because it costs too much gas. 
I have to buy my own food because she eats a lot of it when she is high (she smokes weed everyday all day with her husband and smokes about 30/40 cigarettes **a day** she has been a *very* heavy smoker for around 25 years)

She has a terrible unhealthy marriage with her husband, she is so bossy and strict that no one is allowed to do anything. 

She constantly asks me for money and I give it to her when I can otherwise the whole house has to struggle with no gas, no toilet roll, no food etc. Then, she asks for more and I tell her I already lent her some and she denies it and tells me I didn’t give her anything so I have to physically pull up my bank statements and *show* her how much ££ and *when* I put it into her bank. 
She never repays me, she just says she’ll knock it off my rent but then when I pay rent and it’s not the full £350 she screams and shouts that I’ve underpaid her and I have to show her the statements *again*. 

She works part time in a pharmacy and doesn’t “really feel like working full time”. 

The house is constantly hostile, she screams and shouts about absolutely everything. She stinks the whole house out whilst getting high with her husband, makes a state of the kitchen when she cooks food, goes to bed and leaves it in a mess, I come down in the morning and then cos she sees me in the kitchen she honestly shouts “why have you made such a mess in that kitchen for fucksake!!!” 

Now I hide when she comes down, I go out of rooms when she enters, I refuse her money when she asks for it, I do my washing when I want to but it causes murders in our house. 

I just want to leave but I can’t afford to. I have no savings because it’s all gone into my university funds so I’m stuck here. 

I have to pay extra money each month for bare necessities in my own home - this is what I pay my rent for!! 
 
Is £350 pm a reasonable amount? I don’t mind if it is but I feel like I shouldn’t be forking out extra money to keep the house afloat while she sits on her bum smoking all day long working a few hours a day. 

What should/can I do? Is this normal???

347,"Hey reddit, I\[18M\] am having trouble getting rid of some thoughts and habits.

I was introduces to porn at a fairly young age. Over time, I became addicted to porn. I started watching more and more hardcore, rough porn to the level that I now suffer from PIED(Porn induced ED). What started off as a way to escape from reality has now become the only thing that I do all day long. So this is where my problem starts. I recently started watching &amp; reading cuckold videos. I came across posts of women leaving their SO for other guys, cheating on them, making them watch. Initially it never affected me but now I feel insecure about it. All day long I think about being cuckolded. Although I am not in a relationship and have never been, I think this will definitely affect me in the future. To add to the misery, I was told that I have a small penis(which I think is true) and would never find love.  These facts added together make me miserable around girls &amp; women. I have lost all respect for females.

We have a dog, my mom loves her but she never takes her outside for a walk and instead calls me every day to tell me to walk the dog, which I do even if she wouldn’t have called me and that truly pisses me off, like if you care about the dog, take her out for a walk. 

Today she did the same, she called me to tell me to walk the dog which pissed me off just like every other day, not because I don’t want to walk the dog but because I feel like a moron, being told the same thing day in and day out. 

I walked the dog, she comes home and asks me “Did you walk the dog”? I say “Yes, I did”. She then tells me “look me in the eyes and swear on my life”. 

And that’s when I lost my mind, first of all, YOU want the dog to be walked, so take her out. Second, I walk the dog every day so why would I lie about not walking the dog, when I truly care about it. 

So I showed her the finger and told her to fuck off. I wish I could rewind the time and just go to my room.

This was a week ago, and now I don’t want to go out the door. I feel so awkward and dead. I have social anxiety, and I act fucking crazy and wild while drunk. I don’t know why, because i’m nothing like that when I’m sober.
I don’t know how to even deal with this, I just keep crying and overthinking. Most people wouldn’t think this was such a big deal, but for me it is. I don’t want to be known as «the trashy girl who sat topless». I live in a small town and everyone here knows me.

357," The Tl:Dr down at the bottom. 

The ones that want to read here's some context. It'll probably get confusing, so apologies: 

I had a best friend for the last year, after losing a previous one to some unforseen consequences. I relied on previous best friend on basically anything, so needless to say that I had some rough time getting back on my feet and dealing with depression, anxiety and other small, albeit, big issues.

After some time I found a new friend, after I had an altercation with colleague in my friend. I was stressed out, which led me for me being depressed, anxious, etc. But it was even worse, because I had, quite literally, no one to vent out. That's when this ""new"" friend came along because she saw me getting absolutely demolished by my fellow colleague. So naturally I vent out my problems and eventually we've gotten close in terms of friendship.

I thought it was healthy at first, because I could finally talk out my problems instead of bottling them. I even talked about things, that I would never talk about. Unexplored territory I guess...

Fast foward a couple of months, she finally fallen in love. I even congratulated her and I was happy. But I knew what this meant for our friendship, I wasn't going to be a priority anymore but I would menage. I wasnt going to step in the middle of their relationship.

Fast foward a year later, and I decided, perhaps I didn't want to be a third wheel, I stepped away for their relationship but I was still their friend if they needed. My ""new"" best friend always made jokes but ever since she found a girlfriend her jokes took a step too far, and I realize this last night.

One of the things that I really don't like is being told I can't do anything (I think anyone does) and I decided to reteliate. My other friends thought it was banter, but I was genuinely upset because this is not the first time she pushed my buttons this far.

I considered thinking of talking about this and finally stop this, but I don't know if its worth it.


Tl:Dr : A best friend, that already made several jokes like this, made a joke that went to far. Already warned her once, and this time it pissed me off and im considering my options.

358,"Hey Reddit,

*Tl;Dr manager makes up excuses as to why I was passed over.* 

So my operational manager told me that I was scheduled for an interview to get a promotion. They were looking to hire several people and I was ostensibly one of the ones they we're interested in.

  


I asked him when the interview dates were and they came and went. I messaged him again and he stopped replying. I went to my actual manager ( who had been,and is currently, out of the office for a month and a few weeks) and she managed to get him to say it was because of poor performance for the month of October. We get report sheets on our performance so I checked the month of October and I outperform a majority of the people who did get selected. I also had fantastic reviews from anyone in the company I've worked with and strong recommendations from several managers.

  


He then told me my old manager didn't put me up for promotion. I proceeded to show him the email I was CCd in proving I was indeed put up for promotion. At which point he said there was a mysterious report that no one can find that said I was ineligible. He can't find this report.

  


I know that was a lot but is there anything I can do? I'm basically being told to do the work of my absentee manager while also being told I'm not going to become one.

360,"Hey all,

Throwaway although I deserve any hate I get here and sorry for my mobile formatting. A little long, I'll try a tl;dr at the bottom. I've always been a lurker and posting is new to me and I'm trying my best.


I'm on vacation to meet my best friend in the world for the first time and before New Year's we have talked constantly every day for almost 2 years over the phone or online.


She means the world to me and while we both have severe anxiety and depression we help each other through anything and know our quirks. Getting both of us to be able to meet each other face to face has taken a lot. She's worth the world to me and we've helped each other through alot, no matter how bad things got we've helped each other.


Her and her mother met me on New Year's Eve and after a few hours together her mother allowed me to take her out for the evening. I promised to protect her and I've always promised to be there for her and to make sure no one ever hurts her. I care for her more than anyone including myself and my own life. We've spent 2 years caring for and loving each other as friends.


I remember everything up to right after the midnight champagne shot at the bar. I will admit I was already at the edge and I shouldn't have taken the champagne but I felt like I had to bring in the New Year with the bar crowd. Her and I looked at each other, said we loved each other and kissed for the first time. After this point I don't remember a single thing except for about a minute when the Uber was dropping her off at her home some time later. 


I woke up the next morning to a text from her mother that said ""What in the hell happened last night, I thought you were a gentleman! You're lucky I don't call the police. You need to come pick up your car from my house now!"" I didn't know what happened and asked what happened. She said ""What happened? You basically raped [name redacted] she came home crying and in pain!"" I then realized there was blood on the bathroom floor of my Airbnb and it certainly wasn't mine. 


I've sent probably a dozen story length messages to her and her mom reinteratting again and again how sorry I am and truly truly awful I feel. She's my best friend in the world and best human being I've ever met and I betrayed her in the worst possible way 12 hours after meeting. Her mom telling me I basically raped her the day of is all I've heard and know. I care about her more than anything in the world.


I know nothing I go through is even close to the pain she's experienced but I haven't been able to eat, sleep, stop crying, look myself in the mirror, feel unqeuezy or stop wanting to kill or seriously harm myself since I found out I hurt her. I never, in my right mind would have ever ever hurt her. We've talked about this type of stuff before but she's primarily lesbian and into women except for wanting kids in the future she wants nothing to do with a man physically. I never would have forced anything on her had I been myself mentally that night and while strangers don't have to believe me I'd never hurt those I love. I also don't know what I forced on her because her mom said ""basically raped"" and I'm so confused. I've never physically hurt anyone in my life and I'm not someone that, I thought, ever would. 


I know she needs time to heal physically and mentally, but also I leave in a couple days and my friend and her mother won't talk to me, my friend won't look at my messages, I know she hasn't blocked or unadded me on anything and neither has her mother. I don't remember anything, I know that doesn't forgive me in any way but I want to see her in person before I leave town, I don't want her memory of me to be hurt and pain that I don't remember and that she never should have went througb and I want to apologize to her face. I want things to go back the way they were and I want to earn my best friend back and I'd give anything for that. My life is forefit at this point because I hurt the one person in the world who truly trusted and cared for me. 


Is there anything I can or should do except what the obvious hate will suggest and what I already feel like doing? Thank you for reading this ramble I'm just so lost and without the one person I've turned to for the past two years I feel like I should just die for the pain and the betrayal I have caused. 

Tl;dr: met my best friend of 2 years in person, got black out drunk with her on New Year's and woke up to her mother telling me I basically raped her and they haven't talked to me since. I don't want to lose my best friend, I want her to heal but I also want to see her in person before I leave town to apologize and make her memory of me not that terrible thing.",03Jan2019,1
361,"Recently my husband and I co-signed an apartment for our daughter.

My daughter is a waitress at a new job and can not afford to foot the entire amount on her own. Rather than get in trouble her first month, she took out money from her college savings to pay for it but is obviously worried. Her friend has already borrowed money from her last week and told her even though she got paid all she could give her back was $100 because she borrowed money from other people too that she has to pay back. In my opinion, I don’t care who she owes money to, rent comes first. I’m sitting them down today and laying down the terms for her to continue to live there with a plan to pay back what she owes over time while paying rent in 2 week increments every month to avoid future issues.

About 3 months ago, I heard from a friend that one of my friends liked me. Upon overhearing him talking about me a few times, it seemed real. I don't know exactly why he liked me, he's massively popular and could date practically anyone. I'm afraid that while we are both ""innocent"" that he may have expectations for the prospective relationship... the type of which many of my classmates partake. I am very disinterested in physical relationships at this point of my life, however I would be interested in dating him casually. However, I'm too shy to ask him the particulars, or even bring up the fact that he likes me due to the voracious gossip that has surrounded this information. I feel guilty asking some of my friends about this as they are more experienced than me and a few of them either love him or hate him---not the most accepting audience.

He has also had a challenging time recently with his personal life which many seem oblivious to, most likely due to the massive influx of gossip at my high school which has driven some apart. My main priority concerning him is of course to stay friends, and I want to be there for him, which brings us closer...and I'm aware that I will have to make up my mind on wanting to pursue any relationship in order to not send him mixed signals.

368,"First of all: Sorry for the rambling and sorry for the language - I am mentally not in a good place right now and english is not my first language

&amp;#x200B;

So here is my situation: I am studying medicine in Europe and will be finishing the part where you go to lectures and stuff in October (yay!) which is good, the last years have been stressfull but so far I managed to push through. I really enjoy studiying and I really love medicine and can't wait to start practicing. Event though times have been tough sometimes, I loved my first 3 years (it takes 6 in total here). Everything was going great until I  decided to dig a hole for myself I can't seem to get out of. 2 years ago, I decided to start working on my ""thesis"".

&amp;#x200B;

For explanation: 

Where I'm from medical students don't have to write a thesis, but if you don't you are not allowed to call yourself ""Dr."" 

You can still practice medicine like any other doctor though. 

Having a title sure is a plus if you want to work at a big clinic with lots of research, but if you plan on working in smaller clinics it's not a problem. You can still attain a title later in life, while you work, but it's more stressfull to do it while working obviously. The amount of time and energy you have to put into your ""thesis"" varies greatly, with lab work being more stressfull and statistics being easier. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to work on something statistical, since I don't want to go into research later on but I still wanted to have a title. 

Now I have busted my ass for 2 years doing so, and I hated every minute of it. I don't like the field I chose, I think what we are doing is overyl complicated and I simply don't have time for it. I alreasy lost one semester working on it and there is finally end in sight - but I can't do it anymore. I don't enjoy university anymore because this thing is hanging over my head, it makes me reallly unhappy.

Thinking back I don't even now why the fuck I even started it exactly but I think it was a combination of everyone else starting (all my friends are very carreer-driven, which I admire them for) and pressure I made myself to to everythin right. 

I still like my topic in general, I just don't really like the faculty I am working at. 

&amp;#x200B;

So obviously I need to stop working on it - but for some reason that is so difficult for me that I can't do it. 

The main things my mind keeps coming to when preparing myself to go in there and quit once and for all are: 

* I think sunk cost fallacy is getting the best of me - I alredy worked 2 years on this , might as well finish it   

* I am afraid that I will be treated unfairyl by the faculty I am working at right now - I still have a few (oral) exams there and if they want to fail me, they can do so easily since no matter how much you study, you can't know everything a doctor that has been pracitcing for years knows.   

* This one is stupid but still - I am afraid to tell my parents/friends/my partner because I fear they will make fun of me or get mad because I threw this opportunity 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel really lost at the moment, and I'm already dreading the next meeting. 

So if anyone has any word of adive for me, I would appreciate it very much. 

Thank you

The manager was also an asshole to me. Stan had my back and would speak to my manager to lay off my back since I can’t really work under stress. Stan ended up leaving to another location and I asked Stan to transfer me whenever the opportunity is present. A year a few months pass and I get presented with the opportunity to move to another location, but not only move I’ll become full time employee and got almost a 3 dollar pay bump. When I got to the new location Stan was on paternity for 4 months and Brenda was promoted to a lead teller and moved to the location Stan and I are located.  I always though Brenda was cool cause she taught me how make my first transactions and was cool to talk to. Once she became my boss she became a raging bitch but would try to be my friend at the same time... she would scold me for no reason or for minor mistakes and shit on me and at the same time would buy me lunch. Stan started to become a tyrant as well. Idk why, but he did. He told me and a fellow teller we shall call her “Carla” that we better get used to the new regime, although me and Carla do our jobs and don’t give attitudes to the higher ups.

Am I stressing you?” I reply “yes and you know what I’m going through right now , and you’re not helping “ she begins to laugh and I say “ it really isn’t funny though. I find none of this funny” so she tries to be my fiend again by talking to me and offering me bullshit like candy and im just thinking in my head “ fucking bitch”

I don't have any friends, I don't have any connections, I don't have any skill or knowledge of internet marketing or social media, so I'm like 99% close to just giving up. I know for a fact that anyone advertising to help writers is just shilling snake oil to thousands and thousands of desperate and delusional people, and I'm not that stupid.   

No publishers would give me the time of day, let alone publish my book and promote it, so that leaves trying to be the Unabomber, and even then iIm not that stupid because I'm lucid enough to understand that even then, nobody would give a fuck, just like how nobody gave a fuck about the Unabomber's book, despite being published in The Washington Post. That's the shameless part of the situation; the Unabomber was desperate for people to listen to him, he became delusional, and all that amounted from his efforts was him being arrested and everyone continuing to not give a fuck. This same thing applies to every form of art, music, anything at all; there's basically a 0% chance anyone will give a fuck about you and you're just wasting your time despite any hard work you put into it. Thankfully I don't put any time/effort/energy/money into selling myself; I wrote the book for fun, I honestly never expected anyone to read it, but still.

&amp;#x200B;

 The answer seems like common sense, because clearly less far than 0.1% of people who attempt to make any form of ""significant art"" are given the time of day, but if anyone thinks something contrary to this, feel free to speak, that or just lay down your similar frustrations.

380,"My husband’s birthday is about 4 months away and I really missed the mark last year. He’s a combat wounded veteran (below the knee amputee) who is studying to become a PE teacher. We’ve had a rough couple of months, maritally and financially,  and now social security is revoking his benefits despite him being obviously disabled and hindered by his mental state. I love him still despite our issues and was trying to obtain signed letters/pictures from some people that inspires him so he doesn’t give in to the disparities of life that so many veterans face as civilians but I know that in itself is a long shot. 

Thus, I need a plan B, C, D. Being broke present are out of the question really, and the one thing that I know he really wants and could use is super pricey. He’s also not a very sentimental person so couples coupons aren’t a great idea plus I already do a ton so coupons seem redundant. He frequents the gym and loves playing softball , he’s expressed interest in bow hunting but that would require a license.  And he doesn’t have a heck a lot of friends in order to throw a party- in fact he had a bit of a falling out with his former local softball team and I highly doubt they’d drive an hour away to celebrate with him now.


We have kids as well so even a simple outing would be difficult to maneuver. I’m just at a loss if I can’t get anyone to respond to me. Any suggestions?

381,"I've known my best friend  since we were 4 years old.  Over the years we have developed a type of relationship that even though we lead different lives and have different interests we are there for each other when it matters. 
When he told me they were having a baby we were all so happy and I was dedicated to be more involved with his day to day life. 

On New year's Eve, his GF had to go to the hospital for complications and in the process of having to prematurely have the baby, lost him. 

It's been a rough time since and understandably she does not want visitors.  I am usually good at trying to say the right thing but having people I know lose their baby is a brand new experience for me. Anyone have any advice for what to say/not to say?

382,"Hello, I wanted to start off by telling you the situation. I (23 f) and my fiancé (27 m) had a baby in September and I am due to begin a part time, two year nursing program next week. This morning at 4:22 am my fiancé had his second seizure, the first being on October 4, 2018 which was also around 4:20 am, both occurring while he was asleep. This second seizure means a lot for both of us, he cannot drive for 6 months which means that he cannot do his job either, as he drives a fork lift. I am currently working weekends only to save money on daycare, and we live in my moms basement due to the baby, and my going back to school. I am very thankful for my mom and step dad, especially with this new development in fiancé's health. 

My dilemma is, should I really move forward with this nursing program? it will take me away for nights during the week and all day on Saturday's. I will barely be able to work (even less than I am now), and that means that if he can't work either due to his health, we will be making very little money. I currently have an Associate Degree, so part of me is wondering if I should research my options and move in a direction that will take less time to accomplish and also be cheaper (certifications through community college). I want to be able to work with people, I don't want to completely give up on my education, but I am seriously reconsidering this two year commitment to school. I know if we lived alone instead of with my parents, this situation would be changing my path, and I feel like I need to focus on my fiancé and helping him figure this out rather than going to school and focusing on me and my education.

384,"So about 6 months ago I quit a cushy dead end job where I managed a group of about 9 people in a manufacturing facility. Sometimes I would have to fix or assemble equipment. But in all reality I didn’t have to do much. There was no room for growth with the company and pretty much capped in pay. I had worked there for 6 years. I wanted to advance my career( basically more money) and get away from the bad decisions management was making. 

I quit to accept a position with another company as a quality manager. The company is successful and everyone is very nice. The job pays significantly more and has better health insurance. I don’t have a set schedule of things to do everyday and take them on as they come. The position is new to me as well. 

My problem is I dread going into work everyday and have severe anxiety and can’t sleep over this job. I already can’t see myself doing this job for very long, I don’t feel accomplished at the end of the day, and I struggle to find things to do throughout the day at the job. The whole thought of being here for years kills me. Lastly, I have no idea what i really want to do, I’m 31 years old it’s getting too late to start a new career or go back to school.

It’s just that life for me right now is just boring and uninteresting.Im 21 but like a while ago I used to play a lot of games.Now I struggle to play a game for barely an hour because I lose interest in it fast.It makes no sense because at one point in my life you could say I was addicted to a certain genre of games.Now I try to play as many genres as I can and despite all that nothing interests me anymore.
It isn’t just games this extends to movies and tv shows as well.These days I can’t watch a single movie straight without losing interest In like the first half hour.In the case of tv shows there are so many where I have watched just two episodes only to just lose interest and drop the show entirely.
I’ve lost interest in my work although it surprisingly hasn’t affected my performance probably because I don’t want to get fired.
I have friends and really good ones at that but not many and most of the time When they are busy I’m all alone with no one to talk to and again I end up being bored with life in general.

With all those things taken into consideration tbh I don’t see why suicide is so bad anymore mainly because it can just end this mundane cycle of life.Im not feeling suicidal just to be clear to but regardless I’ve decided to take to reddit to ask for advice because I don’t want this feeling to get worse.I am going to counseling soon in the near future but I wanted to hear advice from you guys first.

391,"My husband and I, both late 20s, married with no children, have been asked to be legal guardians for a couple we know.  The husband from the other couple was married to my sister (she died while they were married) and he has since moved on, married with 2 children.  I adore his wife and children but they live across the country so we see them maybe once a year; however, I do get frequent messages and photos of the family from him.   They have asked my husband and I to be legal guardians of their two children should they both die.  How do my husband and I even begin to unpack this request?

Our initial concerns regarded money.  If this happened today we could probably make ends meet, but our savings was earmarked for a house.  If this happened in the future, we would probably be a bit more financially stable, but we do plan on having our own children one day.  We also discussed religion, as we are not religious or spiritual in any way and the other couple is.  Finally, we discussed having these children moved across the  country, if this arrangement ever came to fruition, which would force them away from some family members, but a bit closer to other family.

392,"I'm 23 live in London, from the age of 19 to 23 I moved to the south coast for University to one of the most popular cities in the south, known for clubbing and beaches. I moved back last July, but in my final month away I was enjoying the nighlife to the fullest at the most popular club there. Although I enjoyed it, it's a place notorious for d!ckhead door staff and have been in the news for racial discrimination in 2015 with multiple clips of this on youtube. 

On my final time at this club, I was extremely drunk and had been subjected to some abuse from a group of rowdy and very unpleasant girls. In my drunken state, I had retaliated with some words of my own. The next thing I know I'd been escorted out. Because I was in no way the instigator and this had happened before, as well as my friends being removed without warning for having a cap on inside a few weeks before, I was extremely annoyed. I was verbally abusive to the bouncers and ended up filming them, asking for names, being a general drunken idiot. I'd seen people do this before, I'd seen people do worse, so in no way did I think I was overstepping any mark, I was just very drunk and extremely annoyed and the fact I'd been removed on more than one occasion without instigating or overeacting to anything, whilst the culprits remained inside. There was one bouncer in particular, 5 foot nothing and bald with the nastiest most aggravating demeanour ever. I was told I was banned for 6 months.

The next day I returned, approached him and thought I'd try clear the air and apologise. I did, he assumed I had a hidden agenda to come inside but I insisted I would not be anyway. I said I'm really sorry and hope he can understand I was out of my face and angry. I then asked how long I'd be banned for an he said ""forever, bye bye"" - (so you know who I'm dealing with here).

I moved back to London. I've continued clubbing in my small town which has one big nightclub which I've now been to three times, I've just found out they are partnered with the club in my Uni town I'm banned from. Because last Friday I tried to enter for a friends birthday, only to be stopped at entry due to my name flagging up with words to the effect of ""multiple removals with extremely agressive incidents and racial abuse"". A total exaggeration and false accusation on the last part. All the door staff at the original club were white, like myself, and the friends I were with on that night were not. Totally false lies. I was told by the door staff at this club in my home town that I need to contact the club on the south coast, I have and they insist it's up to the club here whether they let me in. I've explained there is no way they're going to let me in with those false comments on the system, all they say is to send an email.

I hold my hands up to the aggresive buffoonery but racist remarks I did not make. I have three birthdays in February with close friends who will likely like to go to this place in my home town, but I'm now tarnished with this and I feel it's really unfair. Is there any steps I can take at this point to clear my name. I'm thinking to just use my new passport with a new picture when entering next time. Some advice would be appreciated greatly!

393,"About five years ago, 2013 to 2014, I became friends with a girl named Alexis (went by Lexi). Last initial H. (Only last initial for privacy reasons, I know her last name). Fourth grade. Best friends in class. Fifth grade we drifted apart a bit, but still friends none the less. We exchanged numbers, but I lost the phone number soon after.

We were supposed to go to the same middle school, but she never showed up. I assumed she moved away from out of state. I tried looking up any Facebook, Snapchat, etc. that would use her first and last name, but found nothing. I did come across two different websites, one was a track running website, one a soccer. If I do recall, Alexis enjoyed soccer and did make it onto First in Fitness mile run in fifth grade. So those check out. The sites had both her first and last name on it. Or at least, I assume it was her. Both sites are from North Carolina (the state we used to school at and I still am in) and are somewhat recent (2018). There was a school listed next to her name in one of the sites. Heritage. A middle school many of the kids from our elementary school went to. 

With all that info, it's safe to assume that the girl on those sites is the same one who I used to know. But if it is, how can I even end up contacting her? I couldn't find any social media accounts and that's the only way I could think of.",03Jan2019,1

395,"Me and the ex-wife(we are both 23 years old) seperated October 2018.
We had been together for 5 years and got married in September 2018. If anyone knows basic maths that it wasn't a very long marriage,7 weeks in total.

The reason being, was apparently she wasn't feeling it and that I wasn't passionate enough.

My problem with this was that we both work and that I looked after our daughter alot and did all of the housework. So obviously I was way too tired to do anything in the bedroom most nights.

I noticed that we were in trouble because she was spending less time with me and our daughter and spending it more with an old friend of hers and a work colleague that she was VERY friendly with. 

One night I asked us to have a conversation because I wanted to work things out and get on with our marriage. Well that was when she told me she didnt think we should continue and didn't want to discuss it. Obvious I asked if there was anyone else,she denied it,but I had that feeling she was lying.

I was eventually forced/pushed out,since it was techniquelly her mothers house(as our previous landlord evicted us) so I had no right to live there. I now am living with a close work friend and her partner which is only a 10 minute walk from me ex wife. Im working on getting a better paying job since my current one doesn't and wouldn't pay for the bills if I lived in my own flat. My friends said I can stay 6 months to save up. 

Also while Im living her I have my daughter 2 nights a week and have her 1 day of the weekend(so I have 3 days a week). They are the same days every week and yet my ex still hasn't sorted out any childcare and is still expecting me to have her everyday of the week. 

Now to the actual point of this post;
She has already moved on,shes been seeing that friend that she was close too and even spent new years eve with him and stayed together in a hotel room. Where was I? At my parents looking after our sick daughter. 

All my friend and family,even my work boss(which I NEVER expected) has been supporting me and telling me it will get better. But I am having a hard time just getting on with it. Im drinking alot more(though I never do it when Im around my daughter) and I eat like shit.

I just can't believe she married me((even though she had doubts beforehand(I had been told this after the seperation) and left me after just 7 weeks)). I just dont see how someone could be so cold. I have no confidence in my self and believe that I am just done with relationships,how am I meant to trust women now? Im also think Im done with having children,its now fair that my 2 year old daughter has go through this and don't want this to happen to any other potential kid.

I know I need to focus on other things to keep my mind off this but literally all I do is work and look after my daughter. I had no interests or hobbies for a couple of years since I never had the time and don't really know what to do to get started with it. I used to collect Yugioh and Pokemon Cards,play pokemon hacks games(look up Pokemon Renegade Platinum to know what Im on about) and played a mobile game called Yugioh:Duel Links,thats literally all I did.

 I'm in my late 20's and found myself wondering if I actually have ADD. My son has it, my mom has it, and i'm pretty sure I represent the same symptoms. Now...Over the last couple of months I have had a few injuries in which gave me access to different medications, for instance Tylenol 3 for pain and more recently Imitrax for Migraines. When taking both they did what they were supposed to but I noticed something extra...The ability to focus for the first time in my life. It literally allowed me to think the clearest I ever have, without wanting to be addicted to something, I want to feel like that all the time. It wasn't adderal or ritilan, but it was something that dulled my thoughts and cleared my head in a way I've never felt before and it was awesome. Now for the advice part, is it wrong to go to a doctor and ask for something to make me feel like that again? Does that make me an addict for wanting something to clear my head?

I'm a 20m year old American currently in New Zealand. I came here to live with my best friend (20f) and with her help potentially work towards permanent residency. My life had already been chaotic in the United States, I spent a lot of money desperately trying to run away from my abusive family, only to fail repeatedly and end up back with them. My friend and I coined the plan because we both needed support and decided that we'd pool the rest of our resources into helping each other, months of planning and everything began right before Christmas.



On arrival a bunch of dumb drama shit happened, I'll spare you the details but it was pretty much my fault, she's hurt, I'm in a motel waiting to see what's going to happen yadda yadda. Through several days of discussing, she ultimately decides to call off the whole plan, and says I have to go home. Problem? Not only do I legit only have enough money for a plane ticket (everything I had went to her / our plan and she has no intention of supporting me anymore), but I also have no friends or family to return to. The moment I return to US soil, I will be homeless. 



I recklessly travelled across the world to try to start a better life, and I made a bunch of dumb mistakes that drove off my friend who was supposed to be there for me.

403,"Okay so I need some advice, and maybe some validation that I’m not completely alone in this and it’s happened to other people too.

Basically I’ve been a daydreamer for as long as I can remember. I remember sitting in assembly at primary school and daydreaming that Legolas, Gimli, and Aragon wound swoop in and take me away from school out on and adventure. 

I loved it. I always used to daydream whenever I had a spare moment or just before I fell asleep. I’ve always been careful to never let it affect my reality, by not getting so lost in a daydream that I start neglecting my day to day life. 

Usually daydreaming is seen as an escape, right? Your real life is dull so you play make believe in your head. I’ve never seen it like that... it’s just a fun little imaginative activity that I could do in between my busy life. 

So on to the problem. Over the last few months my daydreaming has taken a rather dark turn. I seem to always find myself daydreaming about really bad negative situations. I’ll give you an example because I have no idea of this is making any sense. One time my husband was a little late home from work. I was starting to worry a little because his drive is a little dangerous (he drives a moped to work and cars are always assholes to him). So my mind started drifting and suddenly I was stuck in this horrible day-nightmare about something awful happening. It was so vivid in my head that I started crying as I was in the daydream.

Situations like this have been happening a lot more regularly. But until now it’s never affected my reality. I could easily just snap out of it and be all happy going about my life... Until the other day. The other day I had a bad daydream and it put me in such a bad mood even hours after I had it. I even snapped at my husband for no reason and it hurt him. 

Since then I’ve been adamant to stop daydreaming completely. We have a beautiful daughter and I never want to upset her just because I’m in a mood because of a stupid childish completely made-up daydream. 

In my spare time, I’ve started exercising instead. So when I can feel a bad day dream starting I can quickly change it to a daydream about having a super fit bod or completing one of my fitness goals. 

I know a lot of the responses will be that I’m trying to escape my ‘dull’ life and I should focus on my daughter and my marriage. My marriage is amazing and so happy and loving. And I only ever daydream when my daughter is asleep, or is watching her favourite tv show. So all of my time is completely on her when she needs me or wants to play. I have a completely fulfilling life and I am very happy with it with goals I’m working towards career and health-wise.

I’m posting this to ask if anyone else has had trouble getting out of their head? I can’t be the only one who’s daydreaming has started negatively affecting their reality? I feel really crazy right now so any relatable stories would help me a lot. And any advice on how to tackle this problem or any insights on why I even have this issue could be really helpful too.

407,"Hey all,

My dilemma is that recent events are forcing my parents to purchase another automobile for my mother due to one of their current cars swiftly becoming not worth the effort to continue to repair.  My mom is, for lack of a better word, stubborn when it comes to things like this and is often jealous of those around her getting fancy new toys when my dad's budget does not allow for the same.  She wants it new and with all the bells, even though she doesn't use (or know how to use) 95% of the features and typically just leaves them alone.  She doesn't drive but only to a few select locations for general errands and such and has absolutely no need for a brand new car,  but is adamant on getting ""what she wants"", price be damned.  She constantly falls under the spell of overpriced, brand name items over much more practical (and affordable) options, and is hardpressed to be convinced otherwise.  I've been tasked with helping to convince her into looking for a used car and need some advice on how to proceed.  She typically listens to me more than others and so I feel I have the best chance of denting the armor.  Help.",03Jan2019,1
408,"Before Christmas my mom asked me what I wanted for Christmas. I said a Nintendo switch, but when she said she could only do it if it was a shared gift with my younger brother, I told her never mind and that money was better. For context, my brother has a long history for getting addicted to technology quickly, and if it was a shared gift, I would probably not even be able to use it. Another important point is that every other shared console in my family has been destroyed within a year of getting it due to my younger siblings. All of this made me think that getting a shared switch would just be problematic in the long run. So on Christmas Eve I couldnt do any schoolwork because my mom used parental controls on the internet and cut me off. Due to this I could only do my work when she got home, so I was up all night doing homework. On Christmas morning while opening gifts i got the switch and tried to be excited, but couldn't muster up much due to literally falling asleep where I stood . I said thank you and turned to go back to bed. 5 minutes later my mom and brother come into my room and tell me that it isn't mine, but is a shared gift. I was surprised by this because that would mean I got less gifts that my siblings. They drag me downstairs and my brother tries to open it. I stop him, saying that I'm going to be going straight back to bed and want to wait to open it until I can actually enjoy it. My brother starts complaining and my mother then says that I am ruining their christmas and just trying to make everyone else miserable like me ( I have depression). I say that he has other gifts to enjoy while I don't , so I at least want to open one nice thing ( my other gifts were a water bottle and stretch bands, while he got a plasma ball, expensive shoes and some computer part). She tell me that getting a shared gift was a mistake and I tell her that I told her so. She first says that she will return it and give us money, which I agree with,  but my brother says that he really wants it. She says she will just give me money and that my brother can keep the switch, so I agree and go back to bed. An hour later I get back up, and ask my mom when I can have the money, since I wanted to buy my own switch on Boxing Day. She then tells me that she can't afford to give one person and expensive console, and that the switch is a shared gift. I remind her that she said the opposite before, so she tells me the most she can do is regift a $30 Best Buy card. I say that that's very unfair , because I didn't even get to be there when my gift was opened, and that my brother will just hog it. She tells me that those are my options and that it's all she can do. I tell her that she can probably still return it. She tells me to stop being selfish and to accept it. To this day I haven't even touched the switch and my brother has been in it almost 24/7 since. Am I really selfish, or is my mom just manipulating my self hate to make me accept an unfair postion?",03Jan2019,1

She is just 18, and will be 19 soon. My sister secretly enlisted in the military 6 months ago without telling our parents.  She kept her enlistment a secret from our parents for the past 6 moths, and just told them yesterday. They are very disappointed in my sister for withholding this information and refusing to start college, and are being very cold and distant towards her. They have told her several times that she broke their hearts. She keeps calling me in tears, telling me how she doesn't want to do this anymore and that she's ruined her life AND her relationship with our parents.  I live abroad, and can't help her or anyone personally.   


I am livid with our parents for treating her this way. She leaves for bootcamp in just a few days, and I know that their treatment of her will affect her performance in the field.

412,"(I’m 16 and a junior in high school. I’m a really chill guy to be around and I’m cool with literally everybody at school, talking to anybody in the hallways no matter who they are.) 

Over the summer, I dated a girl for about 2 months. We hung out a lot and talked on the phone all the time. My younger brother, who is 15 and a sophomore, was well aware of me and her. Me and this girl didn’t work out in the long run and stopped talking when school started. We hadn’t talked in a few weeks, but i was still friends with her on Snapchat. One day I was scrolling through my feed on Snapchat, and I saw a picture of her and my brother on her story with a heart. Now I’m not the type of guy to get upset over an ex if they get with another person because they can do want, but really? My brother? I confronted him about it and I told him it made me uncomfortable that he was dating my ex. He blew it off, said a few things to piss me off, and stopped talking to me. Eventually, my brother and her broke up. 

Fast forward to September of this year, I started talking to another girl, and we’ll call her (S). My brother was also aware of me talking to (S). While I was talking to her, he asked (S) for nudes and stuff like that, and she said no and told me about it. I was obviously pissed about this and I confronted him about it. He denied it, but (S) has screenshots of the texts he sent her. I eventually cooled down and me and (S) stopped talking. 

2 weeks ago I broke up with a toxic girl who I had been with since October. I woke up today and checked my Snapchat stories, as I always do, and I saw the typical “11:11” on her story. “Okay” I’m thinking, “she’s finally moving on! That’s a good sign. I’m happy for her.” I went to school this morning and I had her I my 2nd hour history class. I was sitting there talking to my friends, and I heard her say my brothers name. I sat down in my desk and started listening, and she was talking about my brother and how they are now talking. I didn’t flip out or anything, but after class I went to my brothers locker and asked him about it. He said yes he was talking to her, and he asked me why I cared. I was being polite and honest to him, and he started giving my shit about how it shouldn’t matter and how “I always snoop into his business”, even though I don’t. 

Do I have a right to be upset about this? I really did have feelings for these girls until I found out about my brother. I understand it’s high school and I shouldn’t be heart broken by dumb girls. It’s not my past ex’s that are pissing me off, it’s my brother. How do I go about all of this? Am I being over the top? Thank you guys for any answers! And as always, have a good day!

413,"For context, he's 4. He's been brought up in a gaming environment, regularly plays several different consoles at both parents' houses and is very familiar with the whole idea of being in chat online as we've spoken about it a lot. He doesn't play a lot, I have time restrictions and he's a great kid in every sense. 

There is no chance I'd let him join a random lobby and use the mic despite the games he plays being made for kids (ROBLOX, Minecraft etc). He watches Twitch/YouTube streamers and has been nagging a lot lately to play online. 

He does play online with other family members however, I think he would enjoy playing with kids his own age, I just don't know how to safely proceed as it's my understanding there are very few parents willing to let their kids that age play online and that's completely understandable.

414,"**Background**

We've been friends for about 13 years now and he certainly hasn't been short of 'odd' behaviour. He has admitted to suffering from anxiety/depression in the past and clearly demonstrated anger issues through teen years. For example:

- Tried to hit me in the back of the head, full strength throw of a cricket ball (harder than a baseball) from about 3-4 metres away because I made a joke about him (luckily my reflexes and somehow my watch stopped the ball hitting my head/wrist)

- Threw a bat at and verbally abused his mum because he got out in a game of cricket. Afterwards he ran off into the bush for a few hours to hide.

- Punched a brick wall because he didn't win an academic award in Year 12. I think this was the beginning of a brief downward spiral because he committed himself so fully to getting a good Yr12 result he shut himself off socially.


Anyway those are the examples of what he's like, and there's numerous other cases of him abusing our friend group or getting verbally agitated over jokes. He's always been quite odd to others but he was nice enough to me so whatever, but he struggled to find genuine friends and even our current group hated him until recently because of his personality and general social awkwardness (he is quite prone to causing cringey situations since he can't read social situations, almost like he has Aspergers or something)

**Sunday Sesh/Weird Late Night Noises**

So to what's happening now. We're 23 and have all come home for Christmas/NY, keen to catch up since a few of us live away from home now and party. Myself, him, and another friend go out one Sunday before Chrissy to a club and get quite drunk, have some MDMA and coke and eventually end up at an after-party. There, he runs into a girl he apparently had a crush on and suddenly starts berating her because after they met the first time she didn't recognise who she was. He goes on to say she is a terrible person for causing him mental anguish, how his sister suffers depression because people forget about her and she should be ashamed for causing him similar problems by forgetting him too. My other friend and I are gobsmacked at what is happening before us, at how randomly he started abusing this poor girl who can only respond by saying 'sorry' and that saying she 'must be a terrible person', before walking off crying. She also commented she though he was gay, which affects me later in the night. He then flicks like a switch and runs off to apologise, but in doing so spends the whole time saying how hurt he was because he loved her (he'd met her once before). 

Now it becomes my job to take him home because he was kicked out. Since I live closest to the town centre I often let friends stay to save them excessive Uber costs, and usually we just watch shows have a laugh and sleep. Not this time. 

Lying in bed I'm pretty much stuck right on the edge because he is lying so close to me. I have no issues with being physically close with friends, but given his behaviour through the night I'm pretty put off him and ask him to roll away to give me space. He then attacks me verbally, yelling at me saying I'm a homophobe and telling me to grow up and show him some attention. I'm sick of his shit by now, and he then started asking me about a drunk comment I'd made earlier saying he can be my best man at my wedding. He says ""I hope you know how much that means to me"" etc. etc., and starts tenderly rubbing my thigh and arm, and the way he spoke just unnerved me. I i tried to play it off and kind of laughed about it but he maintained his serious, lovey-dovey tone. I rolled over and told him to go to sleep. Later (I'm still awake) I hear him getting up and moving around. I'm facing my door, which had a pile of my clothes and a dresser next to it, with a jar of relish on it. Not wanting him to talk to me I ignore whatever he is doing.

Then, he starts shining a light in my face, just for a few moments, then turns it off. I then hear a moist, fleshy sound. Think like if you slowly pulled your cheek with your mouth a bit open back and forth. This continues for a couple of minutes, stops, again he shines a light on my face and off again, and the noise resumes. This happens for the next 10 minutes it felt like, and I laid still hoping he wasn't doing watch I thought he was. I even got up after he left in the morning and opened the previously untouched relish jar to see if he was eating that, but it was still smooth and untouched. I saw him a few nights later, and even though I don't know what happened, I couldn't shake off how uncomfortable I felt around him and ignored him.

**New Year's Eve**
 
On NYE, my girlfriend had come to visit. He was openly rude to her, commenting negatively about our relationship (he'd met her once before this, and she was aware of what happened the night a week before) and also seemed to magically appear every time we went outside to smoke. I kept avoiding him because of what happened and didn't really see him.

Later, my girlfriend was quite upset over a recent personal loss and we took some time out down the street so she could have a moment of grief. He again finds us somehow down the street and starts unleashing about all his personal problems and how unfairly people treat him. Being aware of how annoyed my gf was at him already and given she was currently emotionally wrecked for a brief moment, I asked him to give us some peace. He ignored and tried following us and continued spilling his emotions. I got quite angry at him by now, and he told us to fuck off and ran off into the dark, he lived a street away so I assumed he ran home. The next day, he messages the group chat saying he was stumbling around the streets for hours last night, so I don't really know what he did that morning/night.

Earlier in the night, I'd spoken to a female friend who he had previously expressed love for, whilst she was dating another mutual friend. She started telling me about an incident where he again said he loved her that night and talking about how creepy he was being to her about it, but I didn't get much more detail. I told her also about what happened the week before.

**Phone Call**

I received a message from the female friend at NYE asking me to call her. I obliged, and she went on to tell me what our friend really did on NYE. 

Apparently, amongst telling her how much he loved her, maintained they speak 'all the time'. I've seen his messages to her, and they are at best a once every 4-5 month thing where she clearly isn't interested and told him so a few times. She told me he was adament they spoke all the time, they were good friends, and that he had this odd smile when he was saying this.

He then, while we were all inside, cornered her on a balcony, saying ""if you consent, I will kiss you, just let me do this once"". He wouldn't let her leave until one of her friends found her and took her away.

He followed her after they had gone to the laundry/bathroom area, and barged in. He was yelling at the girl's friend to let him speak to the girl and refused to give them privacy. When our female friend went to leave he tried to grab her and yelled at her in her face. The girl's friend then grabbed him and held him against the door while she scurried off. Here, he apparently started kicking and screaming at this girl's friend, and spat on her.

(I honestly don't know how I missed this, but I did remember him being lead upstairs by our mate and looking sweaty, disheveled and like he was on a lot of drugs, which I knew he wasn't. His appearance now makes sense in context of him lashing out I guess).

He then ran off for an hour (not when he saw us, earlier in the night), came back and tried to find the girl but she'd gone off for awhile. 

When talking to the girl, other stories now add up to truly make me think he is suffering some sort of mental issue. When we went overseas last year, he had three notable incidents.


- One: our entire dorm room of 5 except for him all picked up guys/girls and took them back to our dorm and had sex (we were quite close, drunk and honestly the people we'd taken back with us didn't care). He came back and went off the rails, abusing us calling us despicable humans, ran down stairs and told the other hostel guests how horrible we were, all because he couldn't get laid.

- Two: he was obsessed with a girl we met over there from our town. Said girl travelled with us for 4 weeks along with her sister, friend and another 3 randoms we met. He, unsurprisingly, fell in love. He told her how amazing she was etc, but she told him she wasn't interested. One night in Hue, she picked up a guy from our hostel and they were on the balcony at 4am or so while we were all asleep making out. He then went out with his iPod, sat no more than 2 metres away from them, and started singing heartbreak songs in the darkness. He claimed he didn't know they were there but whatever.

- Three: Met a girl in Hoi An from South Africa. They made out (I also made out with her later) and we walked home together along with a girl I'd met too. She said goodbye to him and they added each other on Facebook. He was lovestruck, and told me all about how amazing their connection was, how special it was, and he messaged her a day later to find out what she was doing. No response but he still talks about her all the time and chalks it up to her being in the mountains. While we were in Hanoi waiting to fly home (3-4 days later), he sees she is in Hanoi too via Tindr. He goes into full crazy mode, messages her 6 or so times throughout a day. The next day he calls her 4 times on messenger. He sees she's been online, and starts asking me if he should post on her wall. He then gets to the point where, one night, I'm sick as a dog and say I'm going home (about 10pm). He hands me the keycard and says he'll see me later. He says he is going to walk around and try and find her. He gets back at 3am, no luck I guess.

**Advice**

I need advice on what to do. The female friend has spoken to the police, and she called to get his phone number for them to call him and discuss the issue. She said the police won't look at any AVO/restraining order process but will mark him down as potential stalker. 

What should I do to help my friend, given he has broken my trust and sense of security around him, and knowing how he has treated other friends?

416,"Bit of backstory. 

Back in 2014ish I was visiting my uncle for a week in the summer. His best friend with wife and two daughters were also visiting during the same time. The oldest daughter (14) and I (17) got along fairly well. We had the same interests and largely hung out together during this week.

I sort of felt like I might fall for her given time, but I was madly and foolishly in love with a girl at school that was not reciprocating my feelings. So I shelved the “maybe I’ll fall for this girl” feelings and they all went home. 

After HS I mostly locked any romantic thoughts away and focused on university. About two years later I noticed her posting an image every few months on Facebook of her and who I assumed was her bf, I don’t actually know. Didn’t really pay it any notice. 

Recently this past summer, I fell for a girl at work, hard. I asked her on a date, she said yes, but we never actually went out. She got back with her ex and I just sort of fell into this romantic slump depression. 

Now onto the crux of my issue.

I’m visiting my uncle again and found out his friend has moved here along with his wife and youngest daughter. The oldest daughter (18 now) is here as well but she’s returning to her home state to finish HS and potentially go to community college there. 

We’ve gotten along *really* well and she seems to light up when talking to me about our similar interests. Old feelings have re-awoken and I feel like I’m falling for her again. My mind drifts back to her occasionally for no apparent reason. After a brief scan of Facebook I noticed she hasn’t posted a picture of her and potential BF in several months, longer than any other gap. Last photo was around the time her family moved here. 

I’m at a loss for what to do. Do I act on these feelings and ask her if she has a bf and if not, if she’d like to go out? If I do and it works out, will that influence her choice of college and in turn her future? If she doesn’t have a bf and I ask her out but she says no, will that question linger and affect her school performance?

I remember 18 being a huge turning point for me maturity wise and I don’t wanna screw that up for someone else by putting unnecessary strain on them. On the note of 18, if it does work out, is 3 years too big of a difference and a relationship like that wrong? Hell my uncle is married to a woman ten years younger than him, but the difference between 45 and 35 is much less important than the difference between 21 and 18. So should I just clam up and not say anything and hope these feelings go away? 

Maybe I’m just latching onto the closest idea of a girl that might go out with me cause I’m still in a romantic slump. 

Like I said, I just don’t know what to do. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated",03Jan2019,1
417,"Super long post ahead /nsfw a little 

So I’m 24 years old and up until Monday night ( rather Tuesday morning) I was a virgin. There’s this guy I work with,he likes me a lot, he’s asked me to go out with him before but I wasn’t interested, for a few reasons, so I said no. His attitude changed slightly after that and he was really sweet to me but I still wasn’t trying to be with him. One night , after the office Christmas party (which he wasn’t invited to) he came to pick up me and my friend. Him and I ended up making out in his car (my first kiss btw) and he fingered me a little and licked my breasts. This happened 2 more times within 2 weeks. After these interactions he would say how he wanted to hang out with me and for me to come over to his place. I told him I wasn’t trying to have sex. He said no problem we could just chill. So New Year’s Eve and again my friend and I want someone to pick us up from a party and he already lives in the area so I message him . He comes and is supposed to drop me off at my friends but then suggested that he just take me home cause I’ll have to get a ride in the morning. So I get my stuff from hers and then get in his car. I didn’t want to go home yet though, he asked if we were going to my place or he could take me to his . I told him to choose and he took me to his place. On the way he was talking about drinks and food but also said he had condoms , I said we wouldn’t need those. When we were at his place we started making out again and it got heavy again and my dress was off , he gave me some of his clothes and he went to take a shower. He came back and brought food and drinks but I didn’t want any anymore. He wanted to fool around again and so did I so we did. He started to give me oral and then asked if we could have sex . I said I didn’t want to, he kept asking, I kept telling him I didn’t want to yet so then he asked why. I didn’t tell him I was a virgin. We kept fooling around for a bit and then he tried to ask me again for sex and I went with it. What made me change my mind wasn’t about him, I just felt like I wanted to have sex already and with him was ok cause I thought I could “handle” his dick cause it’s kinda small and I wouldn’t get attached to him cause I don’t have feelings for him. It felt ok, he was very attentive to my movements and noises he didn’t hurt me. I felt odd afterwards and then I felt good about it. I spent the rest of the morning with him. I felt somewhat empowered at first but when I got home I started to feel really shitty. I live with my mom and had lied to her about where I’d been, I hated that, she knows a lot about what goes on in my life. I lied to my friend about where I was too . Now I literally just had a panic attack at work and started crying. I just keep going over it in my head thinking I did something wrong. I feel like if I’m somehow disgusting now and dirty. I told him how I was feeling and he said he was sorry if it was his fault, he said sorry if he forced me. I didn’t feel like he forced me. I wanna tell my mom but I know she’ll be disappointed in me . I don’t wanna tell anyone cause I know they’ll all disapprove of who I slept with. I keep questioning whether I wasted my first time or not. He still wants to keep “seeing” me and wants an actual relationship with me. But I don’t. I feel like I don’t wanna talk to anyone but I can’t figure myself out. I have a history of sexual assault, I was wondering if that played into it. Idk , please help if you can, thanks for reading this long post. ",03Jan2019,1
418,"First of all, about me. I‘m 22 years old and finish my apprenticeship as an electrian in 2020. 
I traveled in 2015 before my apprenticeship for a year through New Zealand. 
It is one of biggest dreams to travel the world, but i had a longtime girlfriend who just wanted to stay in Germany. She left me after 7 years on Christmas. 
As sad as it is, it opens the worldjourney again. 

The problem is, i got a frickin good job offer. A friend of my family offered me a job to build lasers. Normaly you need to study for it, but he knows me very well and said that he want me. With my level of skills, i would never ever get a job like this. I could earn in 5 years, 5 digits a month. 
The company starts in 2 Months and then i can start next to my apprenticeship. 

Other Option is travel the world for X years, i would safe as much as possible over the next year. Start in Australia and Canada after, where i can work with a Visa. In this time i try to monetize my Social Media, to bring me a few hundreds bucks a month. Just enough to live and travel. 

When i choose to travel, the Job might be gone when i‘m back or if i can start there after, i would‘nt have the chance to get in a leading position. 

I think about it alot and it just is a back and forward, would be nice to hear some other opinions.

I'm super into forensics and criminology and thought about going into those career choices but my parents, especially my mom has really been against it. My twin sister has recently decided that's she's going into medicine and they've completely blown up on  me because of it. We've had so many arguments about what I want to do and it's really started to instill a lot of doubt in me. They only care about money and constantly battle me about the the kinds of jobs I can get and their salaries. I've already expressed to them about how I don't care about the money and just want to enjoy the job I'm gonna do for what is essentially the rest of my life. 
My older brother went into a similar career that I might go into and he ended up completely regretting his choice. And because of that, they've been using it against me and constantly telling me not to be like him and to go into medicine.
 I know it may not be the same case as my brother with me but it's still made me stay up all night questioning whether I'm choosing the right thing. I know I should just do it what I feel that's right for me and just take their criticism with a grain of salt but I still don't want to become a disappoinment to them.

My (21F) ex (21M) and I dated from when we were 16 to 19 years old (3yrs) and were a very intense couple. We loved each other a lot and like most teen couples, promised each other forever. He was the closest friend I ever had and we were inseparable.

In 2017 we were having some issues and I ended up impulsively ending things in April. Very naively, I thought we’d take a break and then work things out. Not the case. Our breakup was messy and drawn out. We would constantly talk which would lead to further pain and misery on both ends. We only very recently stopped talking consistently (maybe Sep 2018?). 

For context, we have both got into new relationships since we broke up. His is far more serious (and started a lot earlier) than mine. I couldn’t reconcile his new relationship with all the things he was saying/said in the past to me. I know he once even told his new gf that he would never love her the way he loved me. The whole situation was bizarre but I have done my best to accept it and wish him well with it. My relationship is a lot less serious but I really care about this guy too, just in a completely different way than how I felt with my ex. 

My issue is that I can’t seem to get over or move past my ex. I don’t think I have romantic feelings for him anymore but I almost constantly think about the break up and the events since. I go over all the what-ifs and just think about him/miss him as a friend. It’s very unhealthy and as it approaches two years since we broke up, I’m really concerned that I’m driving myself insane/damaging myself, and the people around me.

431,"TL:DR - had a really bad 2018 financially and professionally, asked for a demotion because I couldn’t afford my anti anxiety meds, then was recommended for a promotion that I applied for. Now HR is asking me why the flip flop?

The place I work for offered me two promotions and reneged both times. The second time (in October) they even gave me my own office that I then had to give up once the “external auditors” decided my promotion wasn’t necessary.

Basically my work plummeted all of last year, just over 50% based on the metrics we keep track of.

In a nutshell, in 2018 I was on anti anxiety meds from my doctor and I couldn’t afford to keep taking them, it was really bad, I just had to back out of my apartment lease and move in with friends. All the while I’m working a second job and for four months I was sleeping in two, three hour chunks a day.

I told my director I needed to be demoted because I am stressed out and in a few weeks my anxiety meds will wear off and I want to be prepared for it. He had me go to HR and talk it out.

All the while they’re interviewing for a different position in my department and their four interviews sucked apparently. Enough so that two of the three people in the interview recommended me, the third guy is a fresh recruit who hasn’t known me for the past two years

Either way, I got that info when I was in the middle of sorting out my life’s mess. So I decided to apply for it. I came back from Christmas break with a meeting request from HR. 

I asked my boss who didn’t know about it but found out and told me they want to talk about why I wanted a promotion two months after asking for a demotion.

The reasoning on my side is my very real financial issues, the second job, and the lack of sleep and my generally feeling of helplessness at the time.

Basically I am asking how do I go into that meeting and try to make them see my perspective? HR cares about the company and their exposure to lawsuits, they don’t care about the peons. 

Before anyone asks, I have applied at other external jobs and have had seven or so interviews (phone, in person, and second in person) but just never got the job. I work in higher education IT which pays me roughly 5% of the national average for my job title, but it’s fairly easy work, and I was entry level when I began.

Also, feel free to call my an idiot, but I don’t want to leave where I work. The actual people I work with directly are great and intelligent. ",03Jan2019,1
433,"So, basically I thought I was 100% straight my entire life. That was until I was 13, when I met one of my friends. At first I felt something between us. I don’t know if it was mutual or not, but I just felt something. I thought it was just because he was funny and I liked his jokes, but over time I gradually found out that I was attracted to him. 

When I was 14, we were playing CS:GO and he kept saying something about really liking a certain item in game. I did a little research and I found out it costed $100 to get. Something in me just wanted him to be happy, so I bought it and gave it to him. His reaction wasn’t too surprising, he was pleasantly shocked and started thanking me etc. That was when I found out that when I made him happy, I became really happy too. For the next year or so I’d surprise him with cool stuff(to this day, they all add up to around $700). I made sure to make it subtle so it wasn’t like a heart-shaped box of chocolates. For example, I spent 3 hours learning how to make an origami penis(yeah, no joke) then I stuffed $50 inside and gave it to him as a birthday present. I remembered playing a game with my other friends(without the guy I liked) and we were rating friends based on looks.

Fast forward to today, I’m almost 16 now and I’ve lost a lot of weight(I was pretty fat, still am now but not so much. One day I was walking with the guy I liked and he passed me $100, and wished me happy birthday. He usually doesn’t have much money in his wallet, but when he did he’d spend it on himself, usually not much on others, if any. I thought he was just grateful for my presents to him, but as he wished happy birthday he touched my shoulder, and kinda just stared at me for a few seconds, then stopped and pretended nothing happened. I played along anyway. 

A few days later, I was with my friends at the bus station when he came up to me out of all my friends and said hi(he was pretty close to my other friends too). He put his arm around my shoulder as he said that(not in a really gay way, like a good friend kinda way)As he walked away he kind of touched my cheek in a weird way, like he left his arm hanging from putting it around my shoulder but it felt like it was intentional. I’ve also noticed he’s started treating me differently, like he’d laugh harder at all my jokes, started buying me food and whatnot and was just really touchy. 

I asked a few of my friends whether they felt if the guy I liked was a little gay-ish, but they all said no. He’s super into KPOP girl groups too which suggests that he’s straight. But, I’m also attracted to girls, like a straight person. He’s just the only exception. I’ve read online that this is called being ‘bicurious’, and a lot of people have gotten togethert with their ‘exception’, and the other party also faced a similar situation. 

A lot of the incidents that led me to think that the guy I like is attracted to me even in the slightest were clearly not obvious, as none of my friends have caught on. But this is my final year in this school, and if I drift apart from him and lose contact once I leave the school I’d probably give shit to myself, that I’ll never know the truth. He tends to be a little mischievous, so I’m afraid that he’ll suddenly blurt out my secret if I come out. I’m also scared he’ll feel uncomfortable with me and distance himself from me because I feel this way. I live in an Asian country so being gay is socially frowned upon, and if my parents find out I’d be disowned. What should I do? Should I come out now or wait till the end of the year? Should I even come out to him? Who should I tell if I end up doing so? What can I do to drop slightly more obvious hints?

Oh yeah, I forgot to mention. I’ve, on multiple occasions, jokingly referred to him as ‘babe’ when texting and he didn’t reply in disgust or anything, he’d just send like those heart shape eye emojis. He also kept asking why my Instagram story was full of pictures but none of them had me in it. I answered with ‘Am I really that hot?’ followed by a laughing emoji. He ended up replying with ‘Of course babe’ and the heart emoji. I don’t know what’s going on but this is kind of a strong hint to me.

In 2015 I woke up in a Saturday morning with my former roommate punching and beating his girlfriend because she didn't want to give money for him (he is cocaine addict) and I tried to talk to him but he became more aggressive and gave me a broken nose, broken skull and PTSD as consequence. She pressed charges against me because they have a abusive relationship and he told her to do that.
Now, after years of treatment, my uni informed me that I'm no longer medical student because took too long to recover.
The only alternative always seems to be a solution is suicide, but I'm really afraid of suffer a terrible pain and get disabled or not being able to kill myself because I'm stuck to a bed.

I try to do the best I can always, I love her to death and I want to make her happy but I just don't understand what she expects from me.  Sometimes I can do the littlest things and she is ready to run out the door.  

&amp;#x200B;

For instance, I happened to look at cosplay girls from time to time and my wife looked at my google history and had a total melt down acting like I did not love her anymore.  She also decided to pose provocatively in a cosplay outfit and then sell provocative videos to a complete stranger for paypal cash.  

&amp;#x200B;

Other times I have no clue why she is so upset with me.  I am happy and comfortable and I guess I just cant comprehend her being unhappy when I do everything I can to make her happy.  I am not argumentative most of the time, I don't hold things she has done in the past against her.  I often make comments that upset her, but I have never done this on purpose, I may be insensitive but I dont really know.  

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like maybe she is just bored with me because I don't provide enough excitement for her.  She was raised in a household with lots of cursing and fighting between her parents and I think maybe this has contributed to her idea of a stale marriage.  

&amp;#x200B;

I have sacrificed multiple work opportunities because she did not feel comfortable moving.  One time far away and one time 1.5 hours away from her family.  I have sacrificed living away from my family and good friends in a place where I have no friends and her family is hostile toward me.  I am not resentful of these sacrifices but I just feel like I do not get any credit for making them which upsets me.  

&amp;#x200B;

Our routine is time with kids, then put them to bed and watch tv shows or ill play video games while she watches her shows or she does her nails.  occasionally we will go out but not often.  I don't often get her flowers or presents.  I always complement her food, sometimes I say insensitive things about it, though I try not to.  I do not celebrate holidays and I think she hates me when she sees other people on facebook celebrating them together, often times disregarding known facts about the unhappy state of some of these families.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I am less understanding of her emotions now  when she gets upset because I experience it so often and do not know what to do.  I don't know what most couples with kids do but maybe our activities are not enough for her?  we are usually very active on the weekends always doing something with the kids.

It will take a few years to finish school and get some experience working. We also want to wait a few years for some family stuff. 

Currently we live in Wisconsin. In summer it's great but we both have seasonal depression so winter is really hard on us. So we want to move somewhere with more sunlight in winter, but ideally not much hotter or humid than it gets here. 

My wife has some severe health problems that prevent her from working. We will need somewhere with access to good medical services. It will also need to be safe. Public transportation would be a plus. 

We both lived in super poor and rural areas growing up. Now we live in a big-ish city for our area. Moving to a major city sounds really exciting so that would be a plus. We love visiting Chicago, for example. 

We're both Americans, but moving outside of the country would be fine too. As long as I would be able to find work and there wouldn't be any issues living there temporarily. We would want to come back to America someday if we left for another country. 

My wife is a major weeaboo, so anywhere with a lot of Asian Culture or a Chinatown would be really cool. 

TL;DR

NEEDS:
Good healthcare
Sunshine
Not too much heat
Safety
IT jobs

WANTS:
Public transportation
Major city
Asian culture

So where should I move?",03Jan2019,1
450,"I (22f) find myself scrolling through social media for hours in the night or day, and learning absolutely nothing from it. Just seeing practically the same old stuff. And I don’t even really enjoy it.. idk why I do it. I have an addiction to social media I guess. I go on Instagram and I can’t stop looking at IG models pages and imagining what their life must be like.. or other pretty girls I use to know who seek to have such a nice life, and I start to feel so envious.. it’s bad because I begin to feel disappointed in myself but also good because I start to try and better myself. I just don’t anything useful to better myself or my life. I don’t want to get rid of social media completely, as it’s my only connection to some people who are so far away.. and I like to gain inspiration from some people, but I just really need to start using my internet time more wisely. I spend hours getting nothing done, looking at nothing useful, and reading nothing helpful. I recently got Reddit because it doesn’t feel as bad as the other places. It’s a way I can’t stay connected with people and actually read helpful stuff, and gain advice from others or learn helpful things. I can follow topics rather than people and I enjoy that. But what else can I do with my phone time, and how can I limit that time as well? ",03Jan2019,1
451,"Hey all,

I am finding recently I just don’t have any lasting friends. I’m not sure why. I feel like I can come across as shy even though I’m 6’1 with a muscular build. 

I’ve been introspecting a lot and My sense of humor is very energetic and slightly weird I would say but I’m never mean to anyone.

It just really bothers me because I just have barely anyone to talk to or hangout with and I’m 23. 

I guess my question is Will I ever be able to make lasting friendships this late in my life or was HS my one chance to make lasting friends.

453,"Back story: My family moved to Korea when I was 10. Because I couldn't speak korean, I couldn't enroll in their schools. I was homeschooled. I don't know what other of homeschool there is, but the one I'm doing is, I do the work, and my parents check my tests. There's no computer involved, there are no professional teachers. Also, because I am turning 19, I have to leave Korea in a couple of months.

Ok, so I've been cheating school for about four years. I know, I hate myself too. I'm going crazy keeping all of this bottle up! Only two other people know about this, my two friends who I haven't talked to in months, who also think that I already stopped. It started of cause I couldn't understand math, but then I slowly started doing it to all the subjects. Now I haven't learn a single thing in so long. I feel so bad doing it, but I cant stop now. I literally dont know enough to finish this with out cheating. I want to stop so bad, but I just cant. I want to tell my parents everything, but I cant. I know its all my fault, and that I dont deserve any sympathy, but I've just been keeping it all in for so long! I've been lying for so long! 

I want to tell my parents and apologize, but I know they'll be worried for me. And if I tell them then they'll probably tell the school, and I'll probably get kicked out, and then I'll have to redo all those years of school I cheated on. 

I did promise myself that I will not let my parents leave this earth without confessing and asking for forgiveness, but I want to tell them someday when I have a stable job, so that they won't have to worry about me anymore. I can't tell them now cause they'll just be worried sick. But I just dont know what to do. All of it is eating me up inside.

I've dug too deep, and I wanna get out, but I just cant!!!

I don't know what to do!!

I'm already facing the consequences of what I've done. I can't go to the school that I want to go to cause I'm too stupid to do the entrance exam. Every time I ""do"" a test I am reminded of how much of a terrible person I am, and how disappointed my parents will be if they found out.  Everyday is hell, and I just wanna jump out the window so I dont have to think about any of this anymore. 

I'm only a couple months away from ""graduating"". My parents are proud of me, but if only they knew. I am not excited at all to graduate cause I know I don't deserve it, but I have to do it. I cant move on, if I tell them now.

I am completely ready to study hard in college. I will get tutors, I will do everything in my will to learn again, cause I'll finally have teachers I can ask questions to. But I just feel so dirty now. I hate it. I hate myself. I just don't know what to do now.

Sorry for all of this... my brain is just going a million mile a minute and I'm so confused.

454,"So for a little bit background, he's 13 years old and I'm 16, and ever since our parents divorced a couple of months ago, he started to shift from being jolly and energetic to downright depressed. We also found out that he's getting bullied in our school, and most of the time, he comes home bloodied and beaten up.

My dad took him to a therapist after he tried to kill himself, and it kinda helped him a little bit. He somehow became a little bit stable and managed to control his emotions and suicidal urges. But since last week, I noticed that he stopped taking his pills, and I talked to him about it but he insisted, even though I'm pretty sure he's throwing away bits of it in the trash. I don't wanna argue more with him more because I don't wanna  ruin our relationship, so I just stayed quiet about it. 

Last night, he broke down in front of me, and I legit don't know what to fucking do. He was bawling his eyes out and he was hugging me so tight, and he kept mumbling words I can't understand. It was the first time I saw him like this, and honestly it pains me a little to see him this way. I tried to ask him whats the problem, but he refuses to answer. So, being the shitty older bro that I am, I just hugged him back for like half an hour without saying anything, then he just walked away.

And now I feel like a terrible person for not doing anything to help. What if he's really going through a very tough time that night, and I just made it worse for him or not doing anything? I honestly suck at advices, and I tend to make things worse everytime I attempt to do the right thing, so I'm afraid that I may say something wrong or inappropriate to him, and it may affect him or something since he's just a kid.

457,"Hi guys! 

My boyfriend has just asked me to move in with him (he still lives with his Dad). As we are going to be unable to get a house for a few years due to the housing market, one of us moving in with the other's parents is the only feasible way for us to live together before the age of 25 or something like that and my mother has mentioned before how our house wouldn't be big enough for the 4 of us.

We already don't spend a night apart, currently we'll spend a few nights at his and then a few nights at mine and so on, however this just isn't sustainable. We can't ever really settle and I can't think of the last time my overnight bag was unpacked, I work 2 jobs and study so it's exhausting to be moving around all the time.

I want to move in with him, it's going to be good for our relationship and it's going to mean that we can finally get settled and unpack our bags. The biggest issue is my mother. She's incredibly attached to me, especially with me being an only child and I have no idea how she's going to take the idea of me leaving.

Maybe i'm just overlooking it or maybe I should say something but a few weeks ago my step dad and I were kinda having a simple political debate with my mom and things kinda got out of hand. I pay bills and I'm 21 years old but out the clear blue when I spoke up he told me to shut the fuck up. I know he works two jobs and rarely has any time off to relax but really?? I don't ever disrespect anyone in my family and if there is ever a problem I sure as fucking hell don't just tell my own son (I hate saying that) to shut the fuck up, then get in my face and tell me that I don't need to be involved in this and I should but out and go back to what I was doing. 

Yesterday we had another debate over the whole government shutdown issue and it got out of hand again and once again he told me to shut up and stay out of it child. CHILD?!?!?!

He only does this when people come by the house so I good up and sure enough there was a man who I thought might be my next door neighbour trying to get into my truck and my girlfriend's car. He couldn't get in and left. I went outside and followed his tracks in the snow, and sure enough they led right to his door. I reported it to the police, and the cop said the footprints were enough evidence to charge him with ""trespass by night"" which is a criminal offence where I live. I chose not to have him charged, but I am fairly certain he saw/heard me talking to the officer. The cop filed a report but did not knock on the neighbours door. My girlfreind is worried about my neighbour escalating because I reported him.  


A little background; I live in the nicer part of a low income area. Most of our street is elderly couples and young families with nice little starter homes. That being said there is still the odd low rent unit/drug house. The house where this neighbour lives is two unit low income house. Both of the guys that live there are a little sketchy, but mostly harmless. This guy in particular is quiet, won't look people in the eye, shy guy. We have had bikes stolen from our back yard and people going into our shed at night and I always suspected it was one or both of the guys from that house. This is the first time I caught him.

So basically, I lived in Saudi Arabia on a British compound, and while I was there I met this girl. We met when I was 16 and we got on really well, ended up kind of being friends with benefits and nothing was ever made official.

After 2 years of fun and games, I left to Uni in Manchester and she went to Leeds. Now anyone in the UK would know that it’s not that far away, however since that day we left 7 years ago, we haven’t met. 

The crazy part though? We’ve been texting/sexting for almost every week since. It’s fucking mental. Now when I was in Saudi I was as fit as a fiddle and looked after myself properly even though I was a kid. Now I’ve added a bit of weight, nothing substantial, I’m 6ft3 and 91kg.

However, that added weight has got me fretting like fuck. Why? We’ve finally agreed to meet at my place in February. Now boys and girls, I know it’s not all about appearance, but I really want her to feel me when she arrives and I open that front door. I’ve got basically 30 days to prepare. I like to blaze weed about 1g a day and I’m prone to munching late at night haha. 

So what advice do I want? 

People of reddit, what can I do in these 30 days that’s going to really give me a good chance of wooing her? I’m expecting some mad diets, crazy workouts and little lifestyle changes to make, before she comes down to see me.

469,"On New Years Eve I attended a boat cruise with a female friend who I suspect drugged me let's call her Blair, her male friend who brought some drugs along who I suspect drugged me together, and another friend who was off her face on multiple drugs and incoherent.   


Before we left for the cruise, back at home when we were getting ready he brought out something and said it was MDMA and she kept pressuring me to take some, I said no I don't really want to and they kept trying to pressure me and ask me even though I'd said no multiple times. I didn't take it, but I did pretend to take it so they'd finally shut up. 

  
On the boat cruise, my friend kept wanting me to drink a lot. She kept bringing me out glasses of champagne and they all drank it. I didn't really want to drink but I thought it's New Years Eve, it's ok if I have a little bit to drink. She brought me like 5-6 glasses of champagne and I kept hiding the glasses and just tipping them into the sink when she wasn't watching. If she knew I hadn't drank she'd pressure me to drink more. 

She and her other friends went upstairs on the boat to the bar to get the drinks while I stayed downstairs. THe boat had lots of families, and friend groups and old people. It wasn't young party people and I think my friends had the drinks in their hands the whole time. 

In total I had little sips of a glass of champagne, in total I drank maybe 1 quarter or at most a half of a glass of champagne. She tried to make me drink 5-6 glasses but wiht most of the glasses after she gave it to me I just left it lyign around somewhere on the boat. 

The boat cruise started at about 6.45pm and at about 9pm after sipping the quarter of the glass of champagne I started feeling very, very different. I had been feeling upset and had been wanting to cry earlier that night then all of a sudden my mind felt a little foggy/hazy, I started feeling extremely happy and excited and all my worries disappeared. Normally I am shy and a bit socially anxious but all of a sudden I felt like I could talk to anyone and say anything to anyone. 

THe affects like feeling very very happy and not worried anymore lasted for several hours. I'd say around 5 hours and there was no ""come down"" or anything. 

I realised with this extreme mental change that it was definitely more than drunk, I had been drugged. I'd had my drink spiked and at this point I was 100% sure. 

I told my friend and she said it's fine, just don't think about it, you're just drunk. 

The next day I was feeling really upset and scared about the fact that I'd had my drink spiked so I talked to Blair's best friend and her best friend told me that she wouldn't put it past Blair to do something like that, and if I suspect she did it then it's possible she did do it. She suggested I talk to Blair about it. 

I asked Blair again, do you think your male friend who supplies drugs did it? Blair just said you had a lot to drink that night, that might be it. I said no, I was definitely drugged. She said one of our other friends had mdma with her drink, and maybe I'd had a sip of the other friends drink. She kept trying to make excuses and dismiss my feelings that I had been drugged. 

I went to the hospital 24 hours later to have tests done, the results havent come back but the doctors told me that the results are not always accurate and that it might not show up even if I did have substances in my system. I don't need the drug results to know that I was definitely drink spiked. 

Do you think that Blair sounds guilty of drink spiking me? The entire drink spiking/ me feeling more affected and high than just being drunk happened while on the boat. ",03Jan2019,1

I found out I am pregnant. He decided he’s going to join the army. He currently makes around £260 a week and now I’m pregnant he’s saying he’s not making enough money to support a child and his only other career choice is the army so if I keep it he’s going. 

He will either take the child to accommodation on the army base for a week and give the child back to me for a week and carry on like that or he will see the child on weekends. I NEVER wanted anything like this. Before we got together I told him I can’t be with him if he’s joining the army as I did not want a relationship where my boyfriend is away most of the time and I can’t have a proper family so he didn’t go because he wanted to be with me. Now of course he’s sprung this on me thinking he will be on a lot more money than he is now and can fully support the child. It’s making me want an abortion.

472,"Hi. I'm feeling a little bit desperate right now and would appreciate any and all advice.

In order to emphasise the context, you'll need to know what I'm dealing with. There are a large group of local thugs (late teens/young adults) - the typical yobs who congregate outside the local newsagents in numbers every night. When I say local, I mean local; my flat is a 1 minute walk to where the shop(s) are. This is an urban area and I live on a road with tonnes of communal council flats (4 flats a building). 

These yobs are known for stealing people's cars/joyriding, shouting abuse and firing fireworks at elderlies last bonfire night.

So how did it start? One day I snapped back after being given abuse one night. Since then, every time I go to the shop I receive abuse and get called out for fights. This usually comes from 4-5 lads who soon multiply to 15-20, every time without fail. It's unavoidable unless I coop up inside and crawl up into a ball in the corner. 

Threats of stabbing have been given out by them also. Now, for the next issue...

I'm 22 and I'm skinny. I don't exercise and I've got little fighting experience- I try to avoid violence wherever possible. I live with a friend who is the same age and same weight as me. 

My friend snapped back when alone and offered one of these yobs out for a fight. They wouldn't cross the road and wanted him to go to them instead (cheap tactic if you ask me). After this, 10 more showed up but by then he was at our door.

So my question to you is... What do I do? I don't want to get my head caved in and I don't want to end up in legal trouble.

I'm worried as I have to live here and it's getting progressively worse. I'm not a coward but I'm not an idiot either.

There's no one left there that I know. My roommate graduated and moved out a few months ago. All my friends have since graduated and moved on. My old coworkers, who I hung out with occasionally outside of work, won't even be there because my PI got a new job and is reloacting the lab to their new school.

I moved to a very rural area a few months back, and this was a last resort kind of thing (there are almost no jobs). I, fortunately and finally, got a new job that is literally five minutes from home. I drive an hour, one way, to where I work now. I do my job and pretty much keep to myself.

485,"Hey all,

I (35M) have been working with my boss (47F) for around 6 years. For the first three years, we were coworkers and partners in countless antics. We would lunch together frequently. We would both volunteer to plan office events. We would play light hearted pranks (always well received) on others. All hilarious stuff.

Three years in, she gets promoted and becomes my manager. So the lunches largely dry up. We are still friends but we've had to throttle things way back. I get the sense that there is a mutual attraction, however, I also get the sense that she would never cross that boundary since our last manager often did unprofessional things and she (my current boss) will comment with me about how inappropriate a lot of what she did was and how she totally deserved to get fired.

She's single, never married. She says she likes being single. She's also very religious (LDS) but not over the top. I am in the process of going through a divorce. She has been very supportive and helpful. When she sense I'm feeling down she takes me out to lunch. She has a wicked sense of humor and we often tell each other some jokes that would likely be seen as tasteless. For example, we recently joked about how funny it would be if I exploded in an upcoming meeting with a difficult client in a rant that was clearly drawing on my divorce drama. Stuff like that.

As the divorce has dragged on, I began thinking about her more and more. I realize that this is probably just my addled brain projecting all sorts of feelings onto everyone. Objectively, beyond the age difference and the fact that it would be a massively inappropriate thing to date my boss, I find myself wondering how I can either let it go or actually explore/feel things out to see if she's really into me or if she's just a playful sort of person and I'm misinterpreting things.

Some of the things that lead me to believe that she's interested include:

1. We were texting each other while on vacation during the holidays. She would also offer unsolicited details. For example, I texted her a Merry Christmas text and she responded in kind, while also noting what she was doing at that moment. Same happened on NYE. I sent ""Happy New Year!"" and she responded in kind but also told me she was just about to cook herself some dinner and just finished doing something else. When I saw her next she noted that she had some friends over who didn't take a hint when it was time to leave. So part of me was thinking that she was just being friendly. The other part makes me wonder if she was hoping I might invite myself over like these other two did.
2. She commented on her suit not fitting properly at work. I stopped what I was doing, looked up, told her that she looked great and resumed working. She blushed, tucked her hair behind her ear and quietly thanked me.
3. I ordinarily look away from people when I'm talking or focus on their chin or something. We have been making eye contact for prolonged periods regularly.

Of  course, I also recognize she's unlikely to break the boundary. I'm reluctant to quit my job and see if I can move the needle. But I feel like my current thoughts are preoccupying me and preventing me from enjoying our friendship. ",03Jan2019,1

490,"I need advice about what to do in a certain situation involving my coworker.

I work in retail, and it's only me and my coworker working in the shop. I work every other day (so for example if I work on Monday she works on Tuesday and so on) and she will often leave me notes about certain things that she didn't get to finish and wants me to do. Which is fine because the same will happen on my days and I will sometimes leave notes for her as well.

However, I often get texts from her when she's angry with me if I don't do the things on the list she gives me. Mind you, usually when I don't do these things my boss comes in and gives me other tasks that are also important. But, since there just isn't enough time, I can't do everything. So she texts me on my days off, sometimes with very petty remarks. 

Today she texted me that I should've done a task, and that ""you had a lot of time and you couldn't be bothered."" She texts me in a very condescending way and believes I don't do anything while I work my ass off for 11 hours. And this is not the first time I received those texts or notes, it's happened a couple of times in the past.

So my question is, should I respond to her at all? Should I send her a text and explain exactly why I did what I did instead of the tasks she wanted me to do? Or should I not text her at all and explain myself only if my boss asks me about this situation?",03Jan2019,1

493,"Hey there this is a long story but I will try to shorten it and simplify it the best I can. I've had humiliation and sissy fantasies for many many years now that include being used by men and women in extremely degrading and mean ways. I used to think I was 100% straight and used to watch straight porn just fine but when I had thoughts of this humiliation it turns me on so much its almost like an addiction. Now I constantly watch humiliation and sissy porn of men being degraded and humiliated and now the thought of not just women humiliating me turns me on but men too which is so confusing. Its gotten to the point its the only thing that gets me off.

Ive been following the same pattern for years now of humiliating myself by putting pictures of myself on the internet and talking to men and women on the internet who talk down to me. I plan to meet up with them and actually try this stuff out in real life for the first time but I cum and then I'm filled with this horrible guilt and disgust in myself and delete my history, remove the pictures, remove all contacts from my phone and then a few days later I'm doing it again.

494,"This is going to be long, sorry!

I might be reading into this too much so I need an opinion. TL;DR at the bottom. 

I’m 19, female and I’m questioning my sexuality. I think I might be attracted to girls but I’ve never been with a girl so I can’t be sure. I’m very open about me questioning myself and most of my friends know about it. 

A few days ago a friend of mine who is 21 said she wants to kiss a girl to see what it’s like but feels like she’s too old for it and it’s something that people do at 14 when you’re curious and young. I’m very open minded about these things and I know it’s never too late to discover your sexuality so I tried to tell her it’s not too late and she still can. I may or may not have also hoped it would hint that if she’d actually want to try, id be down to do it with her. She also mentioned that she wouldn’t rule out the option of dating a female. 

I kissed a guy on New Years and I told her about it and that I didn’t enjoy it.  She said I should’ve just put a wig on him and pretended he was a girl, so I said I should just kiss a girl instead. She joked that we should’ve kissed and I said that we will as her birthday gift, and she said that it won’t cost anything. 

We also slept in the same bed, but we slept feet to head and she joked that we should’ve spooned. She’s so sarcastic all the time, I don’t know when she’s serious anymore. 

She also has unfinished business with her ex who is a male. From what I understood it’s because she doesn’t know what she wants (she has daddy issues for sure) and won’t talk about it. I’m friends with both her and the ex and neither of them have ever mentioned sexuality to be an issue, or mention it at all. 

Is she hinting something??? I don’t know how to take this. We’re not SO close. 
I don’t know what to do. You need to have huge balls to say ‘hey do you actually wanna kiss?’, especially when I don’t actually know how to kiss. I’ve never enjoyed kissing and I don’t know how to do it. 


TL;DR- 19, f, questioning my sexuality and I think a friend might be hinting she wants to ‘experiment’ by joking about us kissing. She also said she wouldn’t rule out dating a girl. Not sure what to do.

He is getting married in May to a girl I don't really get on with. To be honest I've only met her 3 times as my buddy and me haven't hung out much since they hooked up.

The wedding is being held in a private house with family children only. Average age is under 5.

My daughters are 12 and 9 and very well behaved. He is the godfather of one of my daughters.

He phoned me last week and invited only my wife and I to his big day but not our kids.

I'm really pissed off over it to the point where I don't want to go.

When my wife and I got married we only had 24 close family and friends. At the time my buddy was seeing a girl for only 2 weeks and begged us for her to attend.
After some thought we agreed. But looking back it was a bad choice as this stranger he was dating back then is now in our photo album of our big day !

505,"They didn’t leave a rubric or anything. I’m honestly very stressed out so if someone can please help me out, that would be really great.

I’m going into my 4th semester at my university. During my 2nd semester i was on academic probation (with a 1.2 GPA) and eventually got my GPA high enough to where i was in good standing. It wasn’t the best GPA and i barely made it over, however it was enough. 

This past semester, i fell through again. I thought i was for sure going to do well in 2 of my classes that would keep me safe, however i ended up failing one class and getting a D- in the other after failing to turn one assignment in (he was kind enough not to fail me), now i am at a 1.6 GPA.

I was smart enough to take a “GPA booster” class 2 weeks before school starts. If i end up getting an A in that class, it brings me to a 1.9, which is still not high enough to be academically standing, however it will be at a good start for the semester and i know i can bring my GPA up if given one more semester.

They’re giving me until the 10th to write a student’s written personal letter of appeal that will be given to the board, and they basically decide whether or not i’m capable of staying. The reasoning for me doing so poorly twice was because my depression and anxiety honestly got really bad, and i know that’s always the story, however mine gets to the point where it’s crippling and it’s extremely hard to get out of bed and go to class sometimes. I’m not medicated, due to medications having extremely negative side effects with me (i do neurotherapy, but that’s only when i’m home and not at uni). I don’t want them to think i’m incapable of college because that’s not true. I know i am. I just don’t know how to convince them.

At my University flat, I live alone and do fine. Although I do keep the lights on all night. So I can live alone.

The main worries are:
- No car or transport to leave. I’m stuck here.
- No streetlights or any lights, really.
- If something were to happen i’d be at the full of it. For ex, if someone broke in i’d have to stay put until the police arrived. There’d be nowhere for me to run or drive to. That’s quite a terrifying thought.

What’s irking me is the lack of respect my parents have towards my perspective. I’ve talked to them about this and the response is always “your 23, you’re going to have to get over it”.

To me this isn’t something that i’ll get over quickly. I’ve always had worries with staying here alone and have only recently been able to stay here during daylight hours.

&amp;#x200B;

I was with a man I loved deeply for 8 years, married for almost 5. He was not a kind man to me for a large portion of our marriage and relationship. He was emotionally abusive, controlling, and on a few occasions he would shove me when he was angry with me. He was a master at manipulation and gas lighting, so I would doubt everything I knew in my heart to be wrong and hurtful. I would call him out for things, but he would 'correct' certain details and I would be unsure, or find someway to place blame on myself. 

Now here comes the silly part. He was Asian, and I was really active and took interest in his culture. Tried to learn his language, customs, etc. I even learned how to make his favorite foods so that I could make him more happy at home. He fought me every step of the way. As it turned out, he didn't care much for his culture, and wanted to be as 'Americanized' as possible. He even laughed and somewhat bullied other Asians who weren't as 'Western' as himself.  After a few years I ignored it, and enjoyed learning about his culture without his help or participation. I thought that if we ever had kids that I would have to teach them myself. I loved everything that I learned \*passionately\*. 

&amp;#x200B;

So in our final year, I find a positive herpes test in his email after another huge argument where he blamed me for all the problems in our marriage. He went back to his home country once in a while where he would spend months away. This last trip however, he had decided to visit a local prostitute. Our marriage was over for 250.00 USD. Knowing him, it wasn't the first time, it was just the first time he got caught. He had knowingly slept with me for months while he was concerned about having herpes. Thankfully, he didn't, and I had to take a full panel of STD testing to make sure I was okay. I'll never forget the humiliation of sobbing in the doctors office while having to explain what happened. I filed after a full year of trying to fix things. Which was stupid, but oh well. I should have filed right away. At the time, he seemed sorry. He wasn't sorry. The stress of all of this brought about a miscarriage. I don't now if it would be crude to call it a blessing that there were never any children born out of this sad relationship. He was more upset about money he lost in the divorce. 

&amp;#x200B;

Even now, when I've \*had\* to contact my ex, the only thing he can talk about is the money that was given to me in court. Money that he lost. 

""I know you're not the kind of girl to keep money that doesn't belong to you...You're way to kindhearted for that. You were always my better half.."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I'm gone and I have my freedom. But I can't walk into the local Asian market because I feel like I can't fucking enjoy anything because the one person I would enjoy them with is a piece of shit. I can't continue learning the language, listen to the music, watch the shows, ANYTHING. I'm so fucking exhausted and tired of having this stupid mental block.

He makes me quite uncomfortable, but I am reluctant to snap back at him or cut him off as he seems to not have any friends, and has talked to me frequently about ‘wanting to drink his cares away’. (He does drink despite being underage)

I've tried to google the number but nothing specific comes up.

I just don't know what to think about this as it just looks like a very strange number to me. Has anyone else received a call from a number like this? I'm very worried! ",03Jan2019,1

519,"I’ll try to be short, but basically my job consists of four departments that all non-management workers go to. Which department you work in for the day changes quite often. I really enjoy my job actually, and have amazing relationships with all of my coworkers.. except for one manager who runs one of the departments.

I don’t hate her, but she basically is the only person in our entire staff who has a constant negative attitude and feels the need to belittle and micromanage others excessively. I have no issue with any other managers/co-workers.. I just joined this company recently, and everyone else has been extremely welcoming and supportive towards me. She, on the other hand, has been constantly rude towards me and seems to be harsher on me than on others when I’m in her department. I don’t know if this is just because I’m new.. but she frequently gets angry with me about doing something wrong despite not ever being trained on it, acting like teaching me how to do something is an inconvenience/waste of time, and is someone who will nag at you if you go one second without doing something work related/if you try to even catch your breath or speak to a co-worker.

She has made several employees cry or quit, but management won’t do anything because they’ve yet to find someone to replace her. I get that people like this are common at workplaces, but it’s so bad that if I see that I’m in her department the next week, it ruins the entire week for me because I get so anxious. I feel so much stress when I’m in her department and it ruins my work productivity. 

I can’t really go to management because others have gone to them with this problem and nothing has been done about it. What is the best thing to do in this situation? For others who may have been in a situation like this or dealt with a frustrating coworker that you can’t do anything about, what advice would you give to handle this?

My 23rd birthday will be next week. I don't know, why but I have the urge to celebrate it with my friends: I have been invited to some birthday parties before, but never invited friends in my entire lifetime.

I don't really know what to do: Play some lasertag (will everybody like it?), go to the casino (will it be too expensive?) or just have some pizza in a nice place and go to a bar afterwards (is that boring)? I'm so insecure since I've never hosted anything like this before. Also, what if nobody appears?

521,"Hello Reddit, I am in need of advice. Recently, my girlfriend of 6 years has told me that she was sexually harassed by my step father for the last 2 years when she was living with me in their basement and when we were at work. (All three of us worked together.) She hadn't told me until recently because she felt ashamed and scared that this information would tear apart my family. She was inspired by the many stories she read through the #metoo movement and decided to come to me and tell me everything she experienced the last 2 years. Everything from lewd comments, to groping and just making her feel uncomfortable everytime they were in the same room.

We went to my mother and told her what happened but she didnt believe her husband could do those things. She said she needed to hear his side and told us to leave. We took a few of our things and some clothes to my girlfriends parents house. 

Later that night we received texts from my family saying we were liars and we should be ashamed at trying to tear our family apart. My mother told me that my girlfriend had egged him on, and wanted the attention. All the typical victim blaming stuff.

Later that week we were fired from work because my stepdad had told the boss we were thinking about quitting for a while and that we hated the job. Our boss took his word and fired us the next day.  

I 100% believe my girlfriend. We have been together for 6 years, and I trust that everything she told me was the truth. My mom has been married to him for 3 years. In those three years I have picked up on the creepy vibe and even overheard some comments he has made but he harassed her when no one was around.

So now I'm estranged from my family. My phone, and other monthly bills I usually pay through my mom because we're on a family plan. My car is registered through my grandparents (who also think my girlfriend is lying.) My birth certificate, and social security card are still at my mother's house. We are in my girlfriends parents basement for now and they aren't making us pay rent so we can start saving up. 

My father passed away this last August. I feel as though I have no one that can give me advice. Where do I go from here? How do I get back on track? Any advice would be amazing.",03Jan2019,1
522,"Hey, I am at an awkward spot in my life. I just got out of my 3 year long gaming addiction ( at least I think so I'm out but its all about conviction and I'm quite confident) . 

So my concern starts at what am I doing for my Future now and the fact being I am least interested in studies ?

As far as i know, I kind of don't have any interests or peculiar hobbies ( except gaming which i was Over Committing myself to, like 12-15 hours a day).

I'm in Junior year right now (barely managing LOL). So i just wanna be prepared for my Future.

So the major points are :-

1. I don't like Studies so i can't do stuff that includes too much studies. I barely manage to pass all the Subjects in School.
2. I don't have any particular hobbies. I just like watching Anime.
3. I'm open to try out new things.

523,"Alrighty, I’m a teenager who volunteers at my synagogue every weekend. My job is to teach little kids art. Some of them are great, but the other half are just nightmares. Keep in mind these are 7 and 8 year olds, so by now I’m assuming, that they should know a little about what’s right and what’s wrong, as I did when I was their age. But I was wrong, so, so wrong. These kids throw paint at the walls, which are carpeted May I add. And they put their booger’s on things they want to claim as their own. 

There’s a girl who well call Emma, for  reasons concerning privacy, and she is very serious about making sure everybody listens to her. Whenever another kid is talking, she tells them to stop, and then tells them that only she can talk. It’s getting very irritating, especially because it’s been four months of this, so I tried going to their academic teacher, who wasn’t much of a help. She has been teaching at the Hebrew school since 1990, yet she hates the kids. She kinda just walks around and complains to me in Hebrew. Last week she said she wanted to drop kick a toddler who was crying. 

Anyways, I don’t have the heart to kick Emma out, especially because her mom is the Hebrew school principal, and I’m not sure if she knows how much of a pain Emma is. Should I confront her and ask? Or do you think that will make her angry? I need these volunteer hours for college and I don’t want to lose this opportunity, especially because there’s unlimited free snacks.

526,"So to provide some context, recently my relationship with my SO of 5+ years ended and it’s been quite devastating for me. 

This admittedly was mostly due to me. I’ve lived in a very large, stressful, and densely populated city for the better part of a decade with an extremely fast paced and demanding job. It has slowly worn me down mentally and emotionally, which in turn deeply affected my relationship with all of my friends and more importantly my SO. 

After all of this happened I realized that the situation I was in was becoming extremely detrimental to my physical and mental health, seeing as I have also struggled with OCD, anxiety and depression for most of my life. Soon after I came to the conclusion that the only real reason I eventually had to stay where I was, was my SO and that after our relationship ending I really saw no positives in continuing down the path I was going. 

But as of recent I’m having second thoughts. I’m questioning whether or not this is too extreme of a decision. My initial reasoning was moving back to where I’m actually from for at least a bit for my own well being and rebuilding myself. Being a 25M who only has to really worry about himself, I really don’t have anything tying me down anywhere. But I keep going back to the possibility that I didn’t try hard enough to maintain where I am at, or maybe I’m just afraid of the massive changes that are ahead of me. 

Has anyone gone through something like this? Some words of wisdom would be deeply appreciated.",03Jan2019,1
527,"Hello everyone,

I've graduated from uni this June and immediately started working in a university's prep school as a lecturer in September. I have taught 2 classes in the first quarter (September-November) and I am teaching 2 classes in this quarter (November-January). The classes I taught in the first quarter were students that had just entered the school, they were motivated and relatively brighter, but the second quarter brought me sadness as I was to teach 2 repeat classes of A1 level (beginner). As this has been my first experience in teaching, with time, I found out that my teaching is more reactionary. What that means is, I create a learning environment that completely depends on the motivation and effort of the students. If the students don't want to learn, I do not push them (because that's not how you learn). I, instead, try to motivate them with personal things; such as recommending some TV series to watch (in English) or video games to play. 

However, as the second quarter is ending, I see that this does not work.

My university was an English medium university and I hate using L1 (the native language) of the students in the classroom, as they will pass the prep school to learn things in their department in English. I slowly grew out of this idea because this was so hard to carry out in a repeat classroom, I didn't translate but I tried to teach some rules in Turkish so that they at least understood the meaning behind some things.

In one of my classes, there were \*many\* lazy and naughty students in the classroom. They kept using their phones, chatting, watching videos and ignoring the lecture altogether. I started the quarter by warning them but as the time passed, they started ignoring my warnings too. I started to send them out from the classroom in order not to disrupt the classroom, but as their attendance started to become a problem, that also became impossible to do.

Today was the day the students filled in the instructor evaluation forms and I have seen some responses from the students. The students that were all naughty and loud gave me really low marks (not surprisingly) and the other students also said I didn't create a very learner-friendly environment. 

I am not sad about the result, I couldn't care less honestly; but I realized that I shouldn't be affected by the students' hostility and should be able to create an ideal environment in \*my\* classroom. I have taken classes about classroom management but as my age is really close to the students', it's harder to control them with authority. (my age: 23, students: 18-25) 

So, I ask you Redditors, any advice on how to control a classroom? We all have been students at one point, anything you wish your teacher had done to control the class or make a friendlier environment? 

Thanks in advance &lt;3",03Jan2019,1
528,"Hey what's up this post might be a long one. I just need help in knowing what to do with a situation in my family. So my brother has been in and out of school since he graduated  HS(high school) and hasn't seemed to find what he wants to do with him self he is now 24 and I dont see it situation improving. He keeps hanging on to trying to play football  and has moved to several states to ""try"" and play football for a school but he dosen't do his work and his grades aren't good and I am constantly telling him to pursue a coaching internship or alternate path to a career in football 
 but all of my attempts to help him have fallen on def ears and I feel like I'm in this constant loop of me giving my valid opinion and my family (mainly my mother, background info to come) ignoring it because it's what my brother wants. 

My mother wants me to  leave it alone and let see for himself that things wont work, but I dont want to waste time money and effort just for someone to see that something wont work out. we don't come from much money and I dont want us to waste time going to nonsense schools and pipe dreams when that time can be better allocated to actually getting an internship and actually working towards something. 

So now some background info about this circumstance, So all through elementary and high school I went to the same school as my brother and every year it was the same thing ""why does he have to go to school with me or I dont want home to go to the same school as me, and my personal favorite  why don't  you go somewhere else and stop following me. this continued ui p until high school where I saw the worst of not wanting your little brother around. which I get is a typical  thing  for some teenagers but the situation was different  because up until high school my brother was sent t on all of the better schools than I was and failed out of every one of them taking all of our  parents money before they split so when it came time for me to go to high school we had to attend the same public. school. and in every  school we had to play football  and my brother doesn't do well school in general  and when he was at these schools he flunked  just about everything  and got in with the wrong people. 

which lead to him not doing what he was supposed  to do and failing more which lead to us having to attend an alternative school for him to graduate. He was one of those people  who peaked in high school  and couldn't get it together for college. so in high school  I was the quiet  one in the back no one paid me any attention I was always  that dude that was the good football players brother that didn't talk to.most people  because I didn't like the school or the people. but Ik would always tell home things he should do for example, when he got involved with some girl she was always a bad influence  and my mother (who low key neglected  us, another topic for another day,always made us fend for ourselves and when it came time to put on the mask like everything was she acted like things weren't  crappy and didn't care much about  anything so long as we were playing  football  didn't like to fix things when they were broken because  as she puts it ""people have to learn things on their own"" really  irritated me.

So in high school  it was pretty much why cant you be like  him or hes better than you at football you might  as well not even  play. so what I did in high school  was  cultivate myself  and bust my ass to where I am now with my schooling as well as being a ln intern for a football  team, something my brother wishes he could do.

I guess what I am.asking is when should I stop caring about what he does, I'm now a college  senior and my older brother is in a lower grade than me and is doing nothing  with his life, has caused me stress for myself at his hard headed and stubborn they are being about the whole situation  and only going to a school.just because he can play football isnt the way to look at college  and he has no endgame it's like he just wants to go to high school 2.0. 

I know this was a long one but if you made it this far honestly I'm tired of stressing over this when people see my  opinion as me being on a high horse when everything I say makes actual sense. 

thanks for the advice

533,"Hello r/advice, recently there was am incident where my girlfriend's cousin - who is an addict (crack/heroin we think) - jumped out of a 3rd floor window, possibly during a psychotic episode. He was rendered completely immobilised &amp; unable to eat, speak, or go to the bathroom &amp; was in hospital in Florida for a bit (he went there for rehab but is still addicted).

We found out a few days later that despite him being completely unable to move or function at all they are discharging him, saying that if he has no one to pick him up by the end of the week they'll take him to a homeless shelter.

The thing is that while he has a mother who would take care of him she lives in New Jersey, my girlfriend's grandma lives with the mother &amp; refuses to continue to live with them if she would have to take care of him (the mother has made it clear that she would be) - due to previous instances where he's stolen from both her and the mother,  brought friends to do crack in her house &amp; stashed it in the couch, and her having to revive him from an OD.
There is the option of him being collected from Florida driven to NJ, in which case my gf's grandma would either be forced to care for him or move out.

He has no health insurance so it seems his only options are to be cared for by his mother or live on the streets, I think they're looking at putting in a claim that may give him more time in the hospital but I have no idea - is there anything that can be done in regards to getting him cared for, partly to get him in better health but also to have it so that my gf's grandma won't have to care for him (she's very much not capable).

His brother has refused to help him or the mother &amp; the mother overlooks &amp; forgives everything he's done &amp; has done. Thanks very much!! ",03Jan2019,1

536,"In college I have had some difficulty asking girls out in college. Their are multiple reasons why. The main reason is the timing. Last semester there was this girls I liked in my BIO class and I really wanted to ask her out. However, I always have this same problem that works in the same patter. I am afraid that if I ask her out in the beginning of the semester It’ll just make it awkward for the rest of the semester if she rejects me. I don’t want to make it awkward because in difficult classes it important to maintain good or at least professional relationships with classmates in order to do well in class, working together. Also asking in the beginning of the semester might be too soon, since we still don’t know each other that well. But then what always happens is that I decide to wait and put it off because I’m too nervous or get really busy with schoolwork. Then, the end of the semester comes and finals are coming and just when I get enough courage to ask her out, I hesitate because I don’t want to distract her from finals with any kind of drama. Also as a side note, I have some insecurities about my looks too which makes it hard for me to ask people out. I know I’m not too terrible looking; I at least try to stay in decent shape, going to gym to lift and run a few times a week. However, I always feel like pretty much every girl I’m attracted to is way out of my league.

I am writing this because I am in a state of shock and despair and am feeling very helpless on how to go about this. Anyway, I have this friend who I am very strongly attached to. He has been severely depressed this past year and it has only been getting worse and as of right now it has reached a point where he has gone off al social media and has been inactive for weeks.

 I have tried my hardest to support him throughout the course of the year. I try hard to check up on him and talk to him the best I can but I generally live abroad so there is only so much that I can do from overseas. I have also pushed him to seek help and go to a therapist but he refuses to go and believes that therapy is a scam. 

I barely get to meet him in person although this past month I have been able to as I've been home for the holidays. We've hung out a bunch of times since I have been back and he did seem like he was doing better when he was with me however, past couple of weeks, he has deactivated all of his social media, barely spoken to anyone or partaken in any activity. He's told me that his depression has hit an all time low so much so that he is contemplating suicide. He told me he needs his time and space which I have given him whilst also checking up on him in the process. Luckily, his parents have been informed about his situation from one of his other friends. 

 I insisted on meeting him yesterday and he agreed to meet me for sometime. He promised me that he would try to be more responsive to me because I told him that I got worried when I did not hear back from him for a prolonged period of time. I also gave him a letter wherein I expressed how much he meant to me and that I value his presence in my life and in return he wrote me a massive text in which he mentioned that he acted upon his suicidal urges a few days ago and does not know he is going to be around soon. 

I have not received a single text from him all day today and I am getting increasingly worried. I tried calling the suicide hotline in my country but have had no luck. Unfortunately I live in a country where mental health is very secondary. I am also leaving to go back abroad in a couple of days so I am feeling very helpless. I just want to be able to help him and be there for him. I am so scared and worried and it is taking a toll on me. I suffer from anxiety as well and this is causing me immense anxiety.

And i fap a lot. And i feel like i have to stop looking for approval of others. Might fix most things but there are a lot of things going on my head about whats wrong with me.

And always compare my self to the losers of movies. I find most annoying characters better than me.. i dont know how to have a personality, 

Most fictional characters are more interesting than me. I wanna be cool like indiana jones or batman or ironman or even hugh jackmans wolverine...

But all im rightnow is some weak, beta male, narrow minded, simple minded, boring, shallow, dull, worthless, meaningless, pointless, mean, doughbag... a guy who everyone thinks is invisible, a guy with no personality, a guy with no brain, a guy who no one values and no one cares about.. a guy who cant make friends or keep a conversation going for 5 minutes...... 

I dont know who i am.. idk how to find out who i want to be, i dont know how to be a man..

552,"  I went to a soccer game about a month ago with a friend and I managed to lose my keys at a large tailgate event. I have been using a set of spare keys, but the original set of keys has a couple of keys that I can’t easily replace (read: near impossible). One of the main organizers of the tailgate thankfully picked up my keys (as well as someone else’s) and posted online in a group that my friend is a part of. He messaged her about getting the keys back, and they went back and forth for a bit until she suddenly stopped replying. I’ve reached out to her as well via email, but have yet to do so via FB, though I also haven’t heard back. I need those keys and have offered in the email to pay for the shipping if she could just drop them off at a shipping center.

Some days its bearable, other days I'm laying on the heating vent of the floor, every day it HURTS. Also had a cyst burst in my ovary about two weeks ago, which made me sick for a few days. Well the back issue has been ongoing. I've seen the VA about 6 times for this issue in the past year and a half. Every singleappointment, they give me naproxen and send me home. They wont even give me an Xray or an MRI. I could at least know what's wrong. I made an appointment the day my cyst burst and even with that issue, they couldnt get me in within 3 months. The VA hospital, or emergency room is about 3 hours from me, so that's not an option if I need prompt Medical care. This is such bullshit. I'm in pain every. Single. Day.

So I got off from a trip that lasted about a little under 24 hours total (not the longest one I’ve had) and shit happened that doesn’t exactly relate. But I did not end up home until about 3:00 in the morning and probably didn’t get to sleep until around 3:45 am. I woke up at 9 to do some school work because I have an exam on the 7th and a 15 minute script I need to finish. I’m one of those people that berate myself if I do not follow the exact schedule that I have created for me.

558,"This is a throwaway because I don’t know if my friends/family know my personal account.  

Thank you in advance to whoever can help, I rarely feel like I have to go to the internet for help but at the end of the day all of you are people just like me. 

So, to start off I used to have a great relationship with my sister. We were close, no matter what happened involving arguments or disagreements we always had a strong bond. Over the past couple of years I’ve essentially come to realize that the way she treats all of our family is toxic. We’ve done a lot of research and all signs point to her having borderline personality disorder. She is very controlling of my mom whom she lives with, my dad  and I live in a different state from them. My parents split a few years ago and since then my sister has been getting progressively worse to the point where I can’t be around her, I can’t text her, I can’t do anything because she’s just such a bad person towards our direct family. When things are good they’re great, when she gets into one of those mental states where everything can trigger her it’s pure verbal abuse at its finest towards my mom especially and any of us in her path. The only people in her life she treats like shit are just me, my mom, and my dad. Indirectly she says awful things about my dad’s girlfriend (now fiancé) behind her back, even in their home when my sister comes to visit. Just so many awful things that make me wonder how anyone even likes her. I have no interest in talking to her, yet she’ll text me for an occasion where she might be in town and I don’t want to say no hoping that maybe her and I will get along and things might get better. (I know I’m doing it to myself but I like to hope for the good in people).

The worst part is that my dad just got engaged, waited until the day of to tell me he was proposing, and then doesn’t want me to tell my mom or my sister. He didn’t even want me to tell them that he was going on this trip with his now fiancé because I’m assuming he doesn’t want my mom to know that they’re spending money when he has a legal obligation to pay her money every month from their divorce, but he’s mostly living off of his fiancé’s substantial income. Now, this makes my dad sound shitty but he’s really not. He’s a great guy and would never do wrong to anyone, but he’s very self centered sometimes and I feel like I’m everyone’s therapist and secret holder. I feel stuck. And when I simply want to vent to my girlfriend about it, she gets mad when I don’t want her to talk shit about my sister. I’ve heard every bad situation, I know why my sister is shitty, I don’t need to be reminded how she’s done us wrong every time I want to vent. I just want to vent with no feedback and I apparently am unable to do that.

If anyone can give some advice about how I can approach this calmly without having having an anxiety attack or wanting to keel over and die that would be more than helpful. Thank you all for reading and taking the time to help.

TLDR: my sister is psychotic and verbally abusive to my family and I can’t vent to my girlfriend without her feeling like I’m shutting her down from venting too, my dad got engaged unbeknownst to my mom (his ex-wife) and my sister, and he wants me to keep it a secret because he owes my mom money and he doesn’t have income to pay it since his girlfriend basically pays for everything

I play video games and watch a lot of streaming videos online. The ONLY video service that is 100% consistent is Youtube. I have no idea why but that is the only webpage that never stutters. Other websites I have to refresh multiple times in order to even begin buffering the video, including Twtich, Crunchyroll, Netflix, and Pornhub. Even standard websites need refreshing too, including cox.com  


For videogames, connecting to any lobby is the main issue (Rocket League, Heroes of the Storm, Overwatch, Super Smash Bros Ultimate), where sometimes the server will timeout and I have to retry multiple times to get into a game. However, as soon as I am in the game **I have absolutely no lag whatsoever**. That is honestly really what is confusing me the most.

567,"Cliche post alert! I’ll try and keep this short. 

Around 8 months ago, I met my new physiotherapist. This meeting changed my life, as it made me realise that I’m bisexual. This then cued around 6 months of crippling anxiety which got so bad, I had to start taking medication for it. There were other precipitating factors, but this was the straw that broke the camel’s back. 

This woman is beautiful, kind, intelligent and dedicated. She encouraged me to get off my ass and do some real exercise, so I joined a gym. I’m still a member and go about 5 times a week. I’d always wanted to do weightlifting, I just never had the courage to actually go and join a gym. 

I really like her and I’d love to know if she’s single. I already know she’s gay, so that’s not an issue. Now, obviously there’s a code of ethics with this kind of profession and I’d have to switch to another physiotherapist to continue receiving treatment. I really need to keep seeing a physio because I’ve made great progress so far and I want to take it to the next level, but I don’t have the medical knowledge to do it. 

So, what else can I do but ask strangers on the internet for advice? 
Should I tell her when I see her next week and ask for another physiotherapist? 

I should add that even if she says she’s not interested, or is in a relationship, I don’t mind. Obviously, it’ll sting a bit, but at least I’ll know one way or the other. 

I want to do it without sounding creepy, so I’ll have to plan what to say. I’m a writer and I’m only eloquent when I can plan my words and write them down and I really don’t want to come off all awkward and weird and put her off...

568,"Okay so as many people were, I was drunk on new years eve. I was at a party in my friends apartment and there were some other people there, girls and guys. So I show up kinda drunk and as the minutes pass I get more wasted. So usually when I get drunk for some reason I get really loud when I'm drunk, like I shout instead of talk and I guess also I can be a little intimidating since I'm 6'4 250lbs (I'm a football player). So in hindsight I was probably very obnoxious and kind of an asshole. Anyways, there was a girl at the party that I thought was one of the most beautiful people I've ever seen, she was black (it has relevance). So later into the party for some reason I start saying stupid shit like ""everyone in here is beautiful"" and ""the mood sucks here"". It made it quite awkward my friends told me later since I didn't recall doing it, but the worst part was that I said ""I'm going to say something racist if someone doesn't stop me"". No one did stop me and thank god I didn't say anything racist but according to my friends the black girl was present when this occurred and they (all the girls) left the party early partly because of how obnoxious I was and how dull the party was (no one except me was barely drinking).

572,"TL;DR: My fiancé’s mom has been overbearing and hurtful since we got engaged. What should I do?


Hi everyone! So my boyfriend of 7 years and I have recently gotten engaged. His family has always treated me well and I’ve gone to every birthday party, dinner, you name it, I was there. I love his family, and I do know that him and his mom are super close. 

Two days after the engagement, she congratulated us and started asking me all these questions about the wedding. We wanted to have a backyard wedding and his uncle has property that we could do it on which would be great. My fiancé wants to get married in September 2019, but he is going to be gone for two months in Europe this summer so I’m a little stressed about planning. 

His mom wanted to know first who was paying for what and I didn’t have any answers. My family also doesn’t want alcohol at the wedding because people on my side of the family have had issues with alcohol so it’s uncomfortable for us and we are religious and don’t drink in my house. My boyfriends mother said that she already talked to his uncle and they both agreed that they won’t have the wedding unless alcohol is there. 

Then the other day we were talking about how we never win prizes from the radio as a joke and his mom said, “Well my son is a prize...” and it was extremely awkward. I’ve always treated her son as the best thing that’s ever happened to me. Yesterday she booked a vacation to Arizona for a week during my fiancé’s break and I can’t go because I’m working that week. She said “I need one last family vacation before you take him away from me.” I just felt so sad that she felt that way and my feelings are really hurt. She invited her other son’s best friend on the cruise and yesterday her son said to me, “Yeah even Brian is going on the cruise and not you.” which made me feel even more left out. It’s not like I’m choosing not to go, I have to work that week because I’m a student teacher and I can’t just ignore my student teaching. 

My fiancé is going to be gone during a break and for Europe for 2 months and I feel like I have to plan everything in a short amount of time. I told him I wanted more time to plan because everything is overbearing and his mom hasn’t been nice to me. He always defends his mom and he’s letting her invite all her friends and his sisters friends that I don’t even talk to or know that well to the wedding and my parents are the ones paying for the venue. I’m just frustrated because his mom has made all these snide comments and wants to control everything. I love her so much, but she is being overbearing and I feel like my fiancé isn’t standing up for me. 

What should I do? I don’t want to disrespect his mother because I love her but I feel like she is being rude or maybe I’m just overreacting. ",03Jan2019,1
573,"I've been best friends with this guy since the beginning of time. He lives in another state so we mainly chat through messages and phone calls. About six months ago I somehow became an extreme introvert and started talking to my friends way less. I think it's due to depression and being busy with work. I explained this all to my friend and he seemed to understand.

There's been issues though. My friend legitimately thinks that I don't care about him at all because we rarely talk. He never believes what I tell him regarding the matter, even though one of the core parts of my personality is my 100% honesty with everyone. He has repeatedly accused me of secretly hating him and such, and nothing I say has any value to him. He only looks at this from his own perspective and never even considers my thoughts, feelings, life, or point of view. Safe to say that he handles this very childishly.

He's attacked me a good amount of times about this issue (e.g. he has told me that I'm a bad person, my depression isn't a valid reason to not be on my phone all the time in case he would happen to want to talk, I'm probably just looking for a way to cut him off, I'm not trustworthy at all anymore and he has also kind of blamed me for his depressive episode) but never brought up what he wants me to do. I think he just kind of wants me to be available all the time for him but hasn't got the balls to admit it.

This is such a big issue to him that he has started this same ""argument"" several times. I've changed my ways regarding to how often we talk (even though it really doesn't make me happy) but it's not enough. He's acting like a total possessive asshole, but I care about him too much to cut him off.
What should I do? Am I in the wrong here? Any of you been in the same situation? Is he just trying to get rid of me?

I love to mess with my friend's computers (change their wallpapers etc.) One day I wanted to take it to the next level and started researching ways to get my friend's password. I found a thing called a rubber ducky. A device that can steal your passwords in seconds. Tried it out it worked. My friend A one day had her computer open and I decided to go and mess with it. I got her passwords but this time I went a little bit to far and got into her Facebook messenger (did this in early 2018 and she still doesn't know). Today they had a conversation where they shared their password to Snapchat. Friend A has before suspected me of hacking her but I lied my self out of it since there was no evidence. I tried to get in her Snapchat today and after two tries I got in. I had no VPN or any form for security to hide myself. I get in after 30 seconds I get logged out. Mind my own business for the rest of the day. When I login to my own Snapchat I immediately get an email saying some logged into my account. The email says my phone model and IP address. I freak out and remember that she might not check her emails regularly and don't mind it. After an hour she texts me asking for my phone model, and since I am the only one with an android in our 2000 ppl town and because of my past work she suspects me. I lie about my phone model and say that I also get that and that its bots. She says okay but I still think she knows it's me. If she finds out no one in my friend group will trust me and I will end up alone. She is one of my closest friends and I don't want to lose her since we always are together.

My name is Eve and as the title shows I'm going through something hard for me. I'm 14 almost 15 and I currently go to an Irish all girls school.

I bonded with one of these people close in the beginning over musicals and our love for Undertale at 12. There was soon a 4 main people in the group. J,A,T. I even had a crush on one of these people but it died down and we stayed friends. In the next year of school two other girls who I was close friends with joined in the friend group. L,C. We all stayed good friends and I even brought the first 3 to my 14th birthday to watch the greatest showman in which we had great fun.

Near the end of the school year L and C had a fight and A rejected a date from T. I thought everything was still fine and over the summer we did not meet up mainly cause we were just very busy but since the day I had come back the group had really disconnected me and have been talking about me in front of my face, laughed about me and have just over all been nasty.

I've grown very depressed not just because of this but because of just my main life struggles. My parents do not understand saying ""Just make new friends"" and ""get thicker skin"".

For the last 3 years my life has been great. Really great. I got my first job. I have wonderful friends. I workout regularly and my mental health is fine. However, I always look forward to a day where I'll move abroad and starting over. 

&amp;#x200B;

It comes to my mind every single day.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite my life being great, I feel like there's something missing, the one thing that i probably revolve my life too much around. And that's not having a partner. I see my friends with partners, I just want that. I've been single for almost a year now. I don't think I do very well as a single person as it makes me lonely. 

&amp;#x200B;

And I'm not really good at romantic relationship either. Only shots that were successful have been when the women have been really into me and somehow look over my desperateness that I give out. Like, i just scared off another girl with a slight interest for me because I get too attached, too quickly. And it fucking sucks, man. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today I sat being paranoid about being ""too boring"" or ""not interesting enough"" to be dateable, and its sad. But sometimes it does feel like the only time I can be interesting or fun is when I drink.

I sit and watch How I Met Your Mother, or Friends, or watch people on stream from other countries and I dream of living in their country because i relate more with their culture or whatever. Like the people there are much more suited for me. Like that the country I'm currently living in has brought me bad experiences that I just want to start the fuck over. 

&amp;#x200B;

The reason why I'm writing all this is because I don't know why i get too attached. I don't know why i cannot bring out a relationship from a slight interest.

584,"I have a coworker who I am afraid of. At first i thought he was trying to be my ""work husband"" or whatever. I deflected his advanced while being polite and trying very hard to be a team player. I should mention that he besties with my supervisor and director. 

 He took my reactions his as a positive. It's now escalated to touching and outwardly saying he is attracted to me. When no one is around. His tone and actions are scary different when no one is able to see/hear.  I've told him to tone it down, to please keep his hands to himself. 

He is a married man with 3 teenagers. He is a not a small man by any means either. He went to the Olympics when he was younger and still works out. I am 5'1"" and not fast. I don't think I can outrun him. 

Two weeks ago I took our interns to lunch and he purposely told them to go while we settle the bill. This way I HAD to drive him back to the office. On the way he cried in my car and said he doesn't believe our love is two sided. That he loves me and I don't love him back. I was so scared, he seems detached from reality. I parked the car and walked back into the office, leaving him sobbing in my car. 

I have avoided talking to him as best as I can. He confronted me last week so make it seems less obvious  I said I don't like the holidays. He then took every opportunity to push and question if I was suicidal. I finally broke down, acknowledged him, and said sure. Duck it. I am. So please leave me be. Again, he did all of this while no one else is around. 

For the record I am not suicidal. I am just so afraid of him I thought if I said yes after being asked 40 times he'd back down. 

He scheduled a meeting with me this morning, the very minute I get into the office I realized why. My supervisor wasn't in until later. The meeting was horrible. He dumped his projects on me, in a mean tone asked if I was doing alright, and why I'm avoiding him. 

I said I am not avoiding you, I am staying focused at work, please keep our conversations work focused only, and that I have zero training on his projects
 I do not think it's a good idea I take it in. 

He slammed his hands onto the desk and shouted DAMMIT I AM ANNOYED!!! Aren't we friends? Aren't we teammates? DO YOU WANT ME TO REPORT YOU FOR INSUBORDINATION?

I said no but it's not fair for this to happen. He then yelled at me me became very personal for twenty minutes. I got up and said I have work to do. He bothered me for 3 hours straight asked if we are okay. I did nor respond. He then shouted, in front of my coworkers, that if I have a problem with working on something a senior has given me then maybe we need to call HR in. I said were fine. 

He's spent today telling everyone what a great idea he had for his project. It was my idea. I've been in shelters that were less humiliating than this. I'm so afraid if I tell my boss everyone will turn on me. The general gist around the office is that I have a shitty attitude now. ",03Jan2019,1

587," 

A friend of mine from college (who lives in CA) asked if he could stay with me (in Raleigh, NC) for ""a few nights"" while he scopes out apartments in the area (he and his family are contemplating a move here).

While I generally treasure my weekends as a time to recharge on my own, and was really looking forward to having this weekend in particular to myself after traveling and what not over the holidays, I said ""yes"" (somewhat of feeling obligated).

He arrives tonight, and I have no clue what their expectations are in terms of how long to stay. 

TBH, they aren't even here yet and I am already looking forward to having my apartment back to myself. 

I really have no particular reason for wanting them out other than just being a person who treasures time to myself.

On one hand, I really want to lend a helping hand and not rush them. 

On the other hand I feel like two full days (Friday and Saturday) is more than enough time for initial apartment hunting, and I am already looking forward to having my place back to myself.

Am I being unreasonable or a ""bad friend"" for wanting them to be out by Sunday? 

If that's not unreasonable, how do I establish this deadline without coming off as a dick?

593,"Hi

Long story short, I'm a big music fan who has the opportunity to be part of a local radio station that will primarily broadcast a certain genre of music. I know a lot about the genre, not exactly what I would always go for, but I'm more than capable of choosing relevant tracks past and present; which is what my role would be.

However. The main person who is getting the place up and running wants the files of such tracks and I believe suggested using youtube/mp3 converters to achieve it.  
I'm against that, and have thought about just declining the opportunity outright, but I also know it would be a good opportunity to have experience in broadcasting, music production etc.

I have accumulated all my CDs, my download codes and put them in a initial list of what I have to offer, and I will point out that whilst I will be willing to try to source music from other ways (perhaps contacting record labels, occasionally buying new CDs) I won't be using other means to get them.

Is this fair? I am having wobbles in my confidence, as its obviously a good opportunity, but I'm not willing to throw away my morals for someone else.

Any tips, pieces of advice I will be very grateful for.",03Jan2019,1

597,"A while back I published a fiction novel, and it was put on my old high school’s reading list. A girl that went to school there read it and contacted me through my old English teacher. She was really sweet and interested at first, and this was the first real fan of my work that I’d had. Over time, she started getting obsessed with me and had this delusion that I was her best friend. When I went to moderate a panel at a convention, she had her mom take her to the convention, which was more than a seven hour drive for her. (Also I should have said this: I’m in college at 21, and she’s a high school student from 14-15.) She also had this idea that I was now her convention buddy and expected me to drop everything and go with her to any and every convention she wanted.

At this point, she started messaging me about how she was not satisfied with my book. She compared it to her unpublished work, claiming that her characters were much more developed. It was then she started making fan art and original characters. She did not give credit for the universe and my characters. After a while, she started tagging my characters as her original characters. I got frustrated by this, and blocked her on Instagram. All hell broke loose then. She got angry to the point she was emailing me at 2:00 am and forcing her mom to call me. There was a long silence from her, but then, almost as if to say “fuck you”, she posted, “In recent months, I don’t have much incentive to draw [these characters] anymore, but I don’t plan on ever quitting, since I would like to make my own take on the characters and world one day! Perhaps a webcomic adaption or something? ‘No copyright law in the universe will stop me!’ -Sonic the Hedgehog”. It was then brought to my attention that she fully planned on creating a “game that’s basically the book But Better (I’m a writer myself) just to flex on her... If a post of mine has #[my book name], they’re basically mine at this point.”

598,"Long story short... I met my current boyfriend while he was on the clock (at work) and I was a customer. We discreetly exchanged numbers. My mom does not approve of him AT ALL, but I told her how we met before she found out anything about him and decided that she didn't like him. ~~Big mistake, I know.~~ I am 21 and a college student still living at home. Because my mom doesn't support our relationship whatsoever, she keeps telling me that she is going to contact HR at his job to report that he got my number while he was working. Basically, if I do anything to piss her off right now, she'll use it as a reason to report my boyfriend for ""being unprofessional"" and ""inappropriate"" on the job and to get him fired.

She is using this to blackmail me and to scare me into not staying out past curfew, and to coerce me into breaking up with him. I'm scared of telling my boyfriend that my mom is holding this over my head because we have a great relationship and I don't want him to break up with me for having a crazy mom.

They wanted him to join their team as a brand rep By buying their jewelry and posting about them on his page and they’d give him commission from any sales he brought to them . Now he freestyle raps and uploads the videos to Instagram and people ask him to sing their songs and want to sponsor him a lot so this company approaching him isn’t out of the ordinary . But what he didn’t know was that it was a scam. Everything about them is scummy now that I’ve looked into it . He didn’t tell me about it until a month after he bought the jewelry and it didn’t arrive . He purchased 6 pieces of jewelry on October 17, 2018. He contacted them many times after that and they haven’t nor will they respond . They actually blocked his account on their website . So I looked into their website.

601,"I (22f) have had an agreement since around 2010 with a lady (50’s f) she has a number of horses, 2 of whom she never rides as they are a little ‘difficult’ and spirited so they have been my rides for the last 8-9 years. 

They are now older so are slowing down a little bit so are ridden slightly less.

She bought a foal around 5 years ago, when the youngster was old enough to be backed (age 4) I did 90% of the work with her, owner has ridden her maybe 6 or 7 times, certainly no more than 10 times and she hasn’t sat on the horse since around may so around 6/7 months. 
The horse is now working very well and proving to have some natural Tallent that I have trained up, she’s now at the stage where people will stand and watch her work and say “wow”  (for context, I also train horses as a part time job and worked for a professional for a while untill health issues meant it wasn’t a sensible career path) 

I asked tonight if I can enter the horse in her 2nd competition, this one is dressage which is the main focus of owner and myself, I had previously taken her to a small jumping show which owner suggested. 

Owner has now said she wanted to be the 1st person to do a dressage competition on horse. 

I said I was ok to wait and I wouldn’t take that 1st competition away from her. 

She then said she has no idea when she will compete the horse (she’s a nervous rider and although the horse is reasonably well behaved, she’s still young so can have the odd ‘moment’) and that she doesn’t ever think she will be 100% about me competing the horse so I should just do it anyway. 

How do I deal with this? 
Do I compete the horse? 
Any tips? 

TLDR; I trained a horse for the owner for over  a year, owner has now said she isn’t happy for me to compete the horse

602,"There's a black cat in my neighborhood, that the owners got about 8 months ago. The first few months, they took really good care of it. But for the past couple months, they completely stopped caring about it. It's incredibly thin, you can obviously see its ribs and almost looks like a skeleton with fur. And, worse, it's gotten a lot colder but they only let it inside maybe once or twice a week if they're not out late with friends/partying. I'm not judging on their lifestyle, but they're definitely not taking responsibility for their cat, and especially since it's so skinny and it's fur isn't as thick, it might freeze to death.

I didn't know about this until recently, but the past few days I've been giving it food (I have 2 cats myself). Its incredibly skittish (which is sad because when it first came here it was not skittish and very friendly). I think if I keep giving it food it might start coming up to me.

Some Ideas? Maybe?
1) I could call animal control, but it is very likely chipped and the owners probably won't want to give it up or admit they've done any wrongdoing. 
2) I could feed it and allow it inside my home at night, but if those neighbors find out they might call the police on me if they were to ever find out.
3)I could also cage it, and give it to a friend or family member to take care of.

My major is lucrative and enjoyable but I absolutely despise the out of major requirements (bio, chem).

I really just fucking hate it there.They made me get housing off campus because I’m a transfer and all the housing options near campus suck ass. My apartment now sucks and the landlord is constantly trying to evict me for literally no reason. 

I transferred from CC and now all the professors at University feel like assholes. I failed a class by 2% and when I went to office hours to ask if anything could be done they said to just take it again next semester, as if paying $8,000 for an extra semester was fine. 

I miss having pets, a garden, a job, etc. I feel like I was rushed into university by everyone pressuring me. I don’t even have my license yet. I hate being super fucking broke all the time. My apartment costs 2x my parents monthly mortgage payment and it’s the cheapest one I could find. 

I really don’t want to go back and double the debt I already have. If I’m gonna fail half my classes because I hate it there I don’t see the point in going.

She spent her whole life protecting me and it’s like she’s stuck like that in a bad way. She seems as she always tells me to expect the bad sides of things all the time, there’s never any hope or optimism. 

If one bad thing happens it like plants a seed in her mind that stems in all different ways and it doesn’t stop growing for a long time and the worse thing is she acts on all of it.

We’ve had a bad, hard life and we are finally in a place of peace where we can relax but she can’t see that and it kills me to see these patterns stick with her.

However, he’s very stubborn and upset about the consequences of dealing with memory loss.

Over the last few months driving has become a MAJOR issue for him. He’s going to be 87 so I can only imagine a life without a car is not even a memory to him anyone.

College is coming up and I have to work with my mom to get me all signed up. The problem is my mom is a very anxious/skeptical person and I'm a person who honestly couldn't give a crap about what happens. So you have two people with polar opposite personalities (neither of which are good, i know). In all honesty, I would rather not have her help me but a.) she has to because she knows the vital info and b.) One of my teachers told me that I should just let my mom have her moment and don't worry about. 

I've been trying to give her some leeway to do some things and this is how each of those experiences went:

* I had set up a college tour date and my dad requested to take off at work. Due to inclement weather, the date was possibly going to change depending on if the college cancelled tours. I suggested another date but specifically told her not to tell my dad to change his off day yet because we don't know if they'll cancel, and we don't know if the new date has tour spots available. What does she do? Go and tell my dad to change his date and that the tour was already scheduled. They got in an argument later when my dad found out she lied and there were no spaces for the new date.

* We were doing FASFA and we weren't sure about certain info. I recommended we call the FASFA people and ask, but she said declined and proceeded to do it wrong. We had to edit it leading to the next incident.

* Due to the edit, one of the colleges needed a verification form. I'm in a college prep program and they gave us instructions for what to do if this came up. I tried finding time for us to sit down and walk through it together but my mom was skeptical and thought I was going to do it wrong. The next day when I came home from school, she was already on the phone with the college and came scrambling to me for account information because she didn't know my student login (reason we both needed to be there). Once we got logged in, the lady on the phone started walking us through the same directions I was given earlier. I just went ahead to where I knew she was going to direct us and my mom wondered how I knew what I was doing as if I hadn't told her before.

* The fucking mail from colleges is the worst part because she doesn't know how to interpret what they're saying and sometimes she doesn't think they're important and doesn't show me them at all. For all I know, she could have already thrown out important ones. One day she went up to me flipping out that I got full ride to a college (I didn't even apply for it which set off red flags). I read it for myself and saw that it said I ""qualify"" for full ride. However, she keeps insisting that they're giving me the money to this day. Another letter was telling me to sign up for the honors program at a college and she gave it to me two weeks after it came in the mail because she thought it was an admission letter. We had already got the admission letter from the college in the mail so idk why she thought they sent two.

Despite all this, she gets mad that I don't include her in other parts of the process where she isn't neccessary and demands that I let her help since she's the adult. I respect her and understand she's the adult but there are things that even adults don't know how to do and this is one of them. Despite my attempts to help, she doesn't seem to trust me and would rather just do things completely wrong than listen to her kid. Anyone know how we can reconcile and progress with things in the future?",03Jan2019,1
617,"I am a recent grad, 23, and currently applying to entry-level jobs in State A while I’m home out of state in State B. My parents are encouraging me to stay home in State B until I secure a job, but my concern is that I’m at an extreme disadvantage when it comes to interviews. No one wants to worry about bringing an out-of-state candidate down for interviews or worry about supporting their relocation costs when there’s hundreds of equally qualified candidates a few miles down the road. I will be going back to State A regardless, as it’s my college town and my friends, part time job, and cat are all there. I am even more anxious to get back ASAP because the friend who is watching my cat while I’m gone can only watch her until Jan 21, and after that she’d have to be boarded at the vet’s office which is about $20/day- an insane amount of money, especially considering I’m being told to stay home until I get a job, and who knows how long that will take especially since I’m not actually in State A! I’d rather just leave State B, get a cheap apartment in State A, and keep working at my part-time job there while I look for something full-time. I’ve already gotten a few interview requests but no answers when I ask if phone interviews are possible instead.

619,"I'm very conflicted right now on what to do. As the title states, My 15 yr old son was found in a hotel room with a 22 yr old woman.

He claimed she was 18. She said he said he was 18. My child does not look 18, he, in fact, looks 15. 

He told me they broke up on Christmas after he told me a few days before that she was going to come down here to visit him.

The day she came, she blew up his phone until he woke up. He got ready and asked me if he could go to a friend's house. I asked if I knew the friend and if it was the same house we always drop him off by. He said yes and no. I was confused, but told him that he could go.

He calls later asking if he could stay the night. He put the ""kid's mom"" on the phone to talk to me about it and I agreed because my son doesn't get out much (he's a gamer) and I wanted him to have fun with his friends.

The next day rolls around and he's still not home. I figured they were up late since it's winter break and he pulls all-nighters on his breaks. When he didn't come home or call around 2pm-ish, I tried to call him and it went straight to voicemail. I, my husband, and my daughter kept trying throughout the afternoon and the phone kept going to voicemail. 

We went out to look for him but no one had seen him. We didn't see him anywhere. My daughter goes out to look for him and I talked to her about maybe she (the 22 yr old) did come and they were somewhere. I was freaking out and beside myself because I had no idea where my son was.

My daughter calls the hotel she works at (it's the cheapest, least ghetto hotel in the area) and sure enough, the woman was there, same address on the ID as on the packages she has sent him. We go up there and my daughter showed the person who checked her in her photos from facebook. The clerk confirmed it was 100% her. 

My daughter went to the room twice and the woman lied to her both times about my son being there and even confirmed that was her Facebook. The sentence that got her caught was my daughter asking if he was there by name and the woman said,"" Oh, he's not here."" Not a ""who is that"" or ""why, what's going on?"" 

His vape box that she also sent him was on the dresser, so it was confirmed. We called the cops and she refused to let them in until the supervisors came in and next thing we know, the cops are walking through into the lobby with him. She lied to the police about a few things as well. He said they didn't do anything but he's lied to me about this whole situation, so how can I trust him about that? As far as I know, she didn't get arrested, which is bullcrap because I know if the genders had been reversed, the adult male would have.

He is begging me to let her off of the hook. He tells me he'll hate me if I go through with getting her charged. 

As a mother, I am horrified, upset, stressed out, and feel completely lost that someone could do this to my kid. I want her to be charged and go to prison. I want her to face the consequences of her actions. I am also conflicted because this young woman has her whole life ahead of her and I have seen someone go through this before and how hard it is to deal with. I don't want to ruin someone's life. 

Yes my son consented, but he can't legally consent. She has sent him nudes, a pocket thingy (you know), his vape box, and other sexual comments. 

I am asking advice because even though I have my husband and my daughter to talk to, I am still very conflicted about what to do. 

Please, no hateful comments. I am a mother trying to do my best and we've all made mistakes and mistrusted judgements. ",03Jan2019,1

621,"Facts: 
-My husband comes from a large family (8 siblings), whereas I'm an only child.
-His mom died from a brain tumor in August.
-His youngest sister ""S"" is getting married this fall.

My problem:
About a year ago, my husband and I came up with the idea that we were going to take a trip to Ireland for our 15 anniversary, just as something special, which is coming up in 3 years. He was so excited about it that he told his parents, who (long story short) ended up inviting themselves along. I was hugely peeved at this, because 1) rude, and 2) it was supposed to be a romantic getaway just for the two of us to celebrate our special day. However, I figured his parents would never be able to afford it, so I put it on the back burner of my mind. Fast forward 2 months after that, and ""S"" invites herself/finance along as a ""belated"" honeymoon, which 1) in my opinion is ridiculous; it's not a honeymoon several years after getting married, and again 2) RUDE. Fast forward a bit, they find the tumor in my mother-in-law's brain, but it's inoperable, and she passes away within a month. Everyone is coping as best they can, even though the holidays were difficult, as is to be expected. However, when we were on the phone with my father-in-law for Christmas, he mentioned that he had found a travel book and was going to use it to help plan our ""family trip."" I didn't say anything, partly because it was unexpected, but mostly because I know money is tight, now more than ever because of all the medical and funeral costs. But the icing on the cake was when ""S"" chimed in saying that we all could pay for her and her fiance's share/travel costs as a belated wedding present.

I don't know what to do. If I really had to, I could stomach having my father-in-law crash our anniversary trip, mostly because it *might* bring back fond memories of his wife. But I absolutely draw the line at ""S"" being such an entitled brat for inviting herself along in the first place and also expecting us all to pay for her/the finance.

I've already talked to my husband, who says he'd rather not make waves and just see how everything plays out. My gut instinct is to nip this in the bud and say ""you are not welcome on this vacation, which is supposed to be celebrating our wedding anniversary.""

Any advice?",03Jan2019,1

Me and her talk and FaceTime everyday and when she was getting her master’s degree in London for 9 months, she told me she wouldn’t have been able to do it if it wasn’t for her talks with me.

Her boyfriend cheated on her recently before she was set to move in with him in Nashville. She asked for my advice that night and I wanted to tell her to dump him. I really did but I felt like I was biased since I love her so I just gave her unbiased advice. 

She chose to stay with him because she doesn’t want to be alone because she admits she’s self conscious of herself.

626,"So a little knowledge about myself, I am an engineering student currently enrolled at UMass Lowell. In my residence hall, I have become acquainted with some of the friendliest people ever and have made many wonderful friends here. I have no problem with any of them except for one. Well call him “R” to preserve his identity. 
R and I clicked pretty quickly when we first met. We didn’t have a whole lot in common, but we have pretty similar personality traits and views on life in general. From move-in day until Thanksgiving, things were perfectly fine and I even considered him a close friend by the time thanksgiving rolled around. However, R’s home quality isn’t exactly heaven on Earth. He claims to have parents who verbally abuse him and have attempted to take full control over his life; only letting him leave the house for school or work, forcing him to come home without legitimate reason, he even has claimed his mom has bugged his house to alert them if he tries to leave. I’m not entirely sure if this is true or not since it is wildly expensive and his family lives in a low income area. I have even met his parents personally and have heard him talk on the phone with them before, and every time I have been in their presence, I never hear any aggressive tone in either party’s voices. 
My issue with this is that because he has a “miserable” home life, he ALWAYS complains to me about it. And I mean every day, for 60-70% of the interactions I have with him, it is him complaining about how awful his home life is. And when he doesn’t complain about his parents, he is complaining about his old roommate, who he had a difficult relationship with due to him (the roommate) being a major slob, or girls he meets in our hall who have rejected him.
For the first three months, I tolerated it, since I know what it is like to have a rough day. I have always valued being there for a friend during a tough time, as I have had many friends who have done the same for me. But since thanksgiving, things have gotten significantly worse. He is always whining about something and it can make it intolerable to listen to sometimes. He blames his misery on either his parents, his roommate, or his ex-mistresses, and it’s been overwhelming to listen to. My other friends believe that he has been making up a lot of the things he complains about and that he is over exaggerating what he says. I feel so bad complaining about his complaining since if this stuff is true, it makes sense why he’d whine about it, and also that he has listened to my complaints as well, but I guess it’s just a natural thing for me to do. 
But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. The week before thanksgiving, I found out my roommate was leaving and would not be returning for the spring semester, so I figured since R was considered a good friend of mine, I would invite him to room with me in his place, and he also has pretty similar habits to me. He agreed to do so (but had to get into a major fight with his parents at first since apparently switching rooms FOR FREE is an issue). Now I am on winter break and am super nervous about what living with him is going to be like. I’m worried that living with his constant complaining every single day for four months is going to make my head explode, or that it may kill our friendship entirely, if there even is one left. It’s too late to switch roommates now and even if I did, I can’t think of anyone else who is willing to do so. I miss my old friend so much and wish that everything could just go back to normal. 
Just asking for some advice for this overly complicated issue. 
Feel free to be as honest as possible.
Thanks,
N",03Jan2019,1
627,"So about two weeks ago, just before Xmas, I met with this girl on OfferUp to sell her some things I had listed on the app. I didn't realize it at the time, but she had given me a counterfeit $50 bill. The girl has since reimbursed me, but before we could meet up, she was dragging her feet and kind of acting like she wouldn't meet with me to give me real money. So, I reported her to OfferUp, claiming that she had given me counterfeit money. Since, I made the report, now I'm banned. All of my listings have 0 views no matter what I do. When I go to my profile, it says I have nothing for sale at all, and I can't contact anyone. I don't know if OfferUp somehow got confused and banned me, because I can't think of a reason I could be banned. I've tried contacting their customer service multiple times, but I can't get a response. I've tried to deleter the app and reinstall it and use a diff account, but no luck. I also read somewhere that this means that my actual phone/IP address is blocked.

629,"Hey guys, let me provide some background about my relationship with my friend and then about him. I need advice on how to pull out of this friendship without hurting him, or a different way to explain that I just don't have as much free time as him because I'm not getting through. In addition, I want to be able to also convey a wakeup slap or something to help him realize his life is fucked if he doesn't do something. I'm developing a growing dislike with his presence and his ideologies.

     I've been friends with this guy for years now and we've never met in person, but we met through mutual friends and played video games together (on-and-off, with months separating how often we talk) for around 5 years now due to school, work, etc. He was a great guy, funny and charming, kind of tragic background that's led him to be depressive at times, but he pushes through. He jokes of having no purpose in life, and that he's going no where. I currently attend university, am involved in various organizarions and have a relationship, so I'm always moving and always doing stuff. In the last year, we started talking more and I got to hear about how he's actually doing in life. He calls me his best friend, but I think I'm his only friend. 

About him: He's been in two relationships in the last couple years. In the first, he got his girlfriend pregnant and she decided to abort the pregnancy without talking to him. This is when we started talking often again because I was an outlet for him to vent (which I don't mind) and I talked him through it because he was really upset. A huge red flag for me was that he was saying things like ""That was MY child"", ""She just had to take of them for a measly 9 months and I would've taken them out of her hands forever"", and ""That could've been the next Einstein, or genius of our day and age"". I have fiercely different beliefs than him when it comes to this, but the way he said these things felt like he owned them, like he was owned something. But I kept to myself and consoled him since he's still my friend and he was obviously very hurt because he came to me crying. So we start talking and I try to give him my time whenever free, but my free time is my only time sometimes. I let him know here and there when I want to play games, and sometimes he's understanding. Fast forward to his second relationship, to keep it short: he also gets this girl pregnant, they have problems because she doesnt want to keep it, he convinces her to keep it, he finds out her ex couldnt conceive and that she was ""staying over at his house"" when they were on breaks, they somehow got passed that and now they're on and off. I find out the problems arose from his career, there is none. He shared with me at that point in time, he can't hold any jobs he picks up for more than a day and he keeps dropping school no matter what he enrolls in. This is when I realized that I've been in a really unhealthy relationship with my friend because I just keep funneling my time into him and he guilts me into talking to hanging out with him when I'm busy. He's always skewed his stories to favor him when he tells me stuff, like it's never his fault. He wants to play games every day, he gets money from his fiancee's mother to support his gaming and wants me to hang out/do the same. 

Sorry, this kinda turned into a minor vent, I hope the purpose of the post wasn't lost.

Tl;dr I want to stop talking my friend because he's a bad influence on my time and work ethic. I have the option to ghost him since I don't know him in real life, but I dont want to do that since I'm his best friend (not mutual). I'm not helping him by playing games, but I dont want to hurt his feelings. What are some things I should try to say to help him?",03Jan2019,1

They tend to START playing at around 11pm or so, and some nights, including week nights, they stay up until 1am or later playing. We all work together, and we have to wake up before 6am every morning, and I am constantly tired because I can't get any quiet in my own apartment. The other main issue I have is on the weekends, when they go out drinking, then come back and stay up until nearly 3 or 4am, drunk, blasting music and yelling, etc.

634,"I've started to go down a few different career paths, but none of them ended up being right for me. I've been deeply driven my entire life to work with animals, but I don't want to be a vet and can't afford to go to university anyway, so I can't really find any paths in that direction that allow me to make enough money to survive and provide well for my own animals.

The closest thing I tried was dog grooming, but I'm terribly coordinated and kept cutting dogs and after a year of no improvement accepted that it wasn't for me.

Right now I've been working for an online retailer of equestrian equipment which I thought would maybe be good for me because it's at least related to animals and I have a lot of experience with horses, but increasingly I find myself feeling extremely unmotivated and questioning my future in this career path. I'm moving away soon for my long-term boyfriend's work and can't even find anything related in the new area, so I'm beginning to wonder if it's a sign that I need to make a change and find something better for myself.

I can do some school, like maybe two years, but beyond that I really can't afford especially because I already tried a few different things in college and wasted a lot of money me and my family didn't have.

636,"Before you say anything, I've already talked to the Domestic Violence and Child Abuse Hotlines and researched tons of resources. They're all very helpful, but they're trained and have to follow guidelines. I feel like I just need some advice from the average Joe instead of a trained professional.   
I met a girl online. We've been talking nearly every day for over a year now, and we're very close. She has told me stories and sent me snapchat videos of her dad hitting her. I recently convinced her to tell her mum, and she did, but her mum didn't do anything about it. I can tell that my friend does NOT want to be a part of this abuse any longer, but at the same time, she doesn't want to complicate things. I don't think that calling 911 would help because all I know is her full name and her city, and on top of that, she lives in Australia.    
She is severely underweight and suffers from low self-esteem, suicidal thoughts and actions, PTSD, panic attacks, self-hatred, and self-harm. I completely understand why she doesn't want help. She feels like she doesn't deserve it, her family has been pressuring her to recover from her eating disorder when she doesn't want to, she's been gaining weight and thinks that she's morbidly obese (she has body dysmorphia), she was sexually assaulted only a few weeks ago, and her parents just got divorced this past year. She's the kind of person that wants things to change but will postpone fixing them because she's not ""ready"" yet. In reality, she'll *never* be ready. I think that something needs to change **now,** but of course, I can't force her to do anything.   
What should I do? Just keep trying to convince her to get help? Tell the police? Do nothing? Continue to support her as much as possible and pray that things work out for her in the end?

637,"This is gonna be a long paragraph and I would appreciate if you read it and gave me some advice if you can.

I’m 18, I have a sister, she’s 13 and I think it would be best for our parents to divorce because I think my mom and dad are not happy as a husband and a wife. 

I told them I want them to divorce because ultimately it would create a much more pleasant environment for me and my sister.

My mom and that get into fights, not often but certainly not rarely. Most of the time when they fight my mom says that she doesn’t like being with my dad and that she isn’t happy with him. I asked her why she’s still with him if that’s the case, she said that it’s because of me and my sister, that splitting up would create too much of a stressful time for both of us.

I often fight with my parents because they want to control my life. Mind you, I work 7 or 8 hours every day, I go to school on the afternoon/evening and I keep my grades up. I do however spend a lot of time at my computer and that bothers my parent and that’s where most of the fights/arguments come from, me being on the computer too much. So I don’t see the issue of being on a computer, I spend about 3-5 hours a day behind my computer and I don’t think that’s something bad because it’s not like I so don’t contribute anything to the family.

I’m a person that cannot control temper very well and I often lose my shit. My parents know that, and I also visit a psychologist every month. Thats not something my parents made me do, I go there because I want to and it does help me, but it doesn’t solve my issue of my short temper.

When we fight I often scream and yell at my parents because for some fucking reason I keep doing it but a few minutes later I realize what I did and I wish I didn’t do it so I go to my room, my emotions get the best of me so I often cry because I have that feeling of “I did something I cant erase so I’m going to have to live with it” and that makes me feel the worse.

Now don’t get me wrong, we also enjoy moments as a family, when we go out together or when just have a fun time doing something together. It’s not that we always fight and yell. We have times when we really enjoy spending time together.

But those moments when we get into arguments or fights are the worse and they happen more often than they should.

I want my parents to get a divorce because I believe it would make them happier. But I don’t know how to truly make them realize that the environment we live in as a family is hurting us. How do I make them consider my proposal of getting a divorce? And is or has anyone been in a similar situation.

Do I have to disclose medical information when I was a child?

 Also, these diagnoses on my record are ODD, Depression, Mild Mental Retardation, ADHD. I haven't taken any medications in years. I was thinking of contacting my doctor and seeing if they'll remove it.

Any advice?

640,"I’m 20 and I’m in college for computer science. I’m single and I have a small group of friends (6-7 dudes). 

I’ve implemented massive discipline in my life  for a couple months now. I wake up early everyday to lift weights. I train Brazilian jiu jitsu 3 times a week. I eat an extremely healthy diet. I consistently code and work on personal projects that will help me land a good job in the future. I work everyday to become stronger, faster, smarter, and more humble. It feels great to be disciplined. Compared to most 20 year olds I feel as if I’m getting ahead of the game. 

BUT How important is social interaction? I would consider myself an ambi-vert. I prefer to be introverted most of the time but don’t mind meeting new people and having great conversation.

I typically hangout with small group of guys on the weekends and have a good time with them, maybe smoke some herb and chill. 

Living in a small college town I often get asked to go out and drink or go to parties with other people. But I don’t drink alcohol, I don’t really enjoy going to parties especially because many of the people I went to highschool with still live in my town. Ultimately my goal is to move to a city as soon as I’m down so I don’t have to live in binge-drinking culture college town anymore. 

Sometimes when I decline these activities or don’t participate in those events I almost feel like I have this longing or weird feeling that I’m missing out. Like I should be trying to go find a girlfriend or trying to meet new people so I don’t look back and maybe regret? But at the same time I’m improving myself massively every single day and becoming the strongest version of myself. I’d like to hear someone else’s thoughts on this 

TL;DR - college kid, disciplined with health and life, ambivert, I don’t drink and I feel kinda lonely in a shitty college town ",03Jan2019,1
641,"Background: Recently my best friend moved out of state and is living with another friend of ours. A mutual friend of ours that still lives here and I have talked about flying down together to visit them, and they want us both to come at the same time. 

I was okay with this idea until recently, when the friend I was going with did some things that made me really uncomfortable around them, especially when drunk. This isn't the first time. Last time they apologized, and we moved past it. With it happening again, I'm seriously considering ending that friendship altogether, as I don't feel they are respecting me, and don't want it to happen again. Considering that we'd all probably go out drinking a couple of times while there, I'm really not good with travelling together anymore. 

The problem is, I don't know how to tell my out of state friends that I'd rather visit them alone. I think they'll be understanding, it'll just be a bit awkward to bring up. I also dont know the best way to tell the person that I was supposed to go with that I no longer want to go at the same time. I considered just making plans when I know they can't go, but that just feels like a dick move, and I don't know how to ask when that would be without being obvious anyway. 

What would be a good way to bring this up? Should I just be blunt and call it out?

642,"Hi reddit world. This is my first post and I don't know where to post this but I'm interested in seeing what other people think of this situation. 

Me (25, F) and my boyfriend (25, M) and our two pets have been in our first apartment since March 2018. Our first problem in this situation was that the landlord set us up to sign the lease before we even looked at the apartment. We were excited, excitement took over and we realize now how much of a mistake we made. Before we even expressed interest, I contacted the landlord and asked if it was okay that we had a rabbit, this was priority number 1 for me because at the time, I was living in a place where I was hiding the rabbit and I hated feeling guilty about it. He said it was no problem and that it would be fine. Terrific! We even made sure our superintendent knew we had the rabbit because again, I didn't want to be dishonest and cause an issue. 

The first day we moved in here, we found countless cigarette butts, loose weed and papers jammed underneath the radiators and even a small pipe and some pieces of a cut up straw used for snorting. This was whatever, we actually laughed about it because the tenant before us was a rough looking dude and we knew even though we were told it was ""professionally cleaned"" that it was probably a rush job and not done very well. We looked in the bathroom and the ceiling and walls were absolutely covered in nicotine. This is understandable because there's no bathroom fan so from the previous tenant, the nicotine stuck and continues to run down the walls. I'm a cigarette smoker but I haven't once smoked inside the apartment (boyfriend doesn't smoke) and every week since we moved in I literally have to scrub the nicotine off the walls. It's coated on the ceiling to the point where it literally drips on you and the floor after a shower. 

The first week in our apartment we found out we have silver fish. It's gross, we're still dealing with it but I'm just grateful it isn't spiders. Also, we have one working burner on the stove. I've been cooking on one burner for 10 months now and it's been a challenge to say the least. Because of the laid back people we are, we've just been making the best of this shithole. 

The summer time came and one day we ran into our superintendent, she informed us that everyone on our floor complained about the smell of our rabbit and that we'll need to get rid of her if we don't fix it. She also said that we ""never asked permission to have her in the first place"" and of course, my boyfriend and I got PISSED as this was mentioned before we had even signed anything. We apologized and I quickly pulled the email proof of our landlord saying it was fine, once they saw that, the superintendent and the landlord magically remembered us telling them and the problem disappeared. 

The next problem - the old lady that lives below us. About a month in to our lease, every night around 8/9pm the lady below us started blasting her music and singing at the top of her lungs. It was hilarious the first night, but then she started actually screaming and yelling as if she was arguing with someone, and it started happening every single night. It was 10:45pm one night and we finally had enough, it sounded like there was a serious domestic dispute about to happen so we called the super. She informed us a few mins later that the lady was actually hiding someone in the apartment for a while and that it was good that we called. The yelling stopped, then the next night it started up again, and the next night. We called the super about a week later to complain again and her response was ""oh, you mean Susan who lives below you? Well she's just one person down there, she's quiet?"" and we were extremely confused. It's like our super completely forgot she had literally kicked someone out of this ladys apartment a week ago. It's been 10 months here, and this lady below us causes a disturbance every single night from 9pm to sometimes 2am, drinking her face off and blasting music, singing, yelling, and screaming profanity. I'm talking calling people the N word and everything. I feel like if that was us causing that much of a disturbance, we'd be kicked out immediately. Every night she's drunk, angry and yelling, but she's just one lady who lives down there so it's apparently not a problem. We've been dealing with this for 10 months, we're chill people just trying to live our lives in peace so we'll just keep dealing with it until we move out hopefully soon.

The next problem. Cannabis was recently legalized, we're both smokers and even though we signed an agreement saying of course we won't just blaze up in the apartment like dummies, we do still smoke bowls outside off the balcony. We were just told today that the lady below us complained that were smoking weed. My brain honestly cannot comprehend the irony. I understand a lot of people don't smoke it, that's their choice and that's great, but the person who complained is literally a raging alcoholic who is always angry and screams at the top of her lungs every single night until 2am. So she's allowed to smoke cigarettes and get shit-faced in her apartment, singing, screaming at the top of her lungs and calling people cocksuckers and N words but I can't get high and do a puzzle? Really?

The super also told us that yes, people are allowed to smoke cigs in their apartment but my boyfriend would have to be careful about his vape because people might complain and it might damage the apartment..... 
So people won't complain about cigarettes but they'll complain about my boyfriends vape that smells like skittles? And there's no concern about the apartments including ours that are damaged by nicotine tar but the vape will cause damage to the apartment? 

She also told us we can't smoke weed because someone in the building has COPD and had to go to the hospital. I'm pretty sure this entire building has COPD because everyone chain smokes cigarettes in their apartments and the entire building stinks. She didn't even care about us smoking weed, but she said she would rather us go out for a drive and smoke weed than do it around the building. So she would rather we drive around high and risk getting a DUI then smoke a bowl off the balcony. Makes perfect sense.

Sorry this turned into such a rant. If anyone actually reads this entire thing and does want to offer their opinion - thank you, I truly appreciate it as this is the most frustrating situation I've ever been in. We are good people putting up with a lot in this building (I didn't even mention the laundry situation) and I need clarification whether we are shitty people or if we're just in a shitty place :)

So i liked this girl and kinda sent hints to her and then i went more direct. We flirted we laughed and here comes the new years eve. There she is more gorgeous than ever. In the table there we 2 couples our friends, and us. I started with the small talk to break the ice she followed. To the points she asked me if i liked her and ofc i said yes. WE made out we hugged oh that night it was the best. I felt complete for the first time in my life, because it was the first time actually that i let myself feel. I've been always about work and career...  
The next day she's quiet but my friends had talked to her and it was ok i mean. I was fearing the WE were too drunk part.

The second she didnt respond to me at all. I couldnt meet her because she was out of town with her family. I started to get frustated, paranoid etc.

Today i gather my courage and ask her did i do something wrong?  She said I was too drunk sorry its my fault i dint want you to make false hopes. Then i go to work and after a tiresomeday i ask her but it was more like a last card played i went fully open about my feelings. Her respond sorry X its totally my fault i dont want to upset you or anything but you are a super nice guy but, i dont want to dedicate on something that will be short lived. (she plans to go abroad). and i wish you find someone etc etc you know how it always goes.

The point is im not desperate for the girl. I took my shot it didn't work. The problem is i let her get into my heart  its not the same as being rejected is worse.

A little back story.  My wife and I moved to New York at the beginning of 2018.  We are living with family until we settle ourselves down with jobs and apartments.  I found a job in NYC as an Assistant Store Manager for a retail company.  I was let go because I wasn't connecting well with the team.  If I'm going to be perfectly honest, I wasn't connecting well with the Store Manager and put in no effort to try to rectify that; and I tried to do too much too early and made a bad impression.  I did like the job.  I did like the company.  I did like the sales.  But I feel like I managed myself poorly and worked too much with the ""Fake it until you make it"" mentality when I had no business faking it.  With backstory out of the way...

I am looking for a new job.  My wife and I agree that it would be ideal to get out of retail.  I am struggling with where to look.  I enjoy working with my hands more than talking to people but I have found myself doing jobs that are the opposite of that.  I have lots of 'management', sales, customer service, and operations experience. This post isn't a request of job offers.  It is exclusively advice driven.  Where could I look that I haven't thought of?  You may be asking, ""Where HAVE you thought of?""  The answer is, 'no where'.  I'm at a complete loss.  I have looked in to some of the companies my wife has followed.  But I'm really just looking for some ideas.  I hope this is clear and understandingable.  Thank you for your advice everyone.",03Jan2019,1

So, I'm a 16 year old socially akward kid and I have a ""friend"" That has been following me and my friends around for the last 2-3 years, He's a bit annoying but apparently he is also autistic but he's still alright, we don't really like him but we tolerate him. Lately our classes got split, and I ended up with him as the only person I know in my class, which kinda sucks because he hangs out with me the whole time now. There's this girl in the class that he likes, like **really** likes, He talks with her the entire time but she is obviously not interested in a relationship with her, she has been giving him multiple subtle signs and recently been a little more direct. (Piss off, I'm not interested kind of signs) but he fails to see them. I'm sorry if this comes off as offensive, but I think this might be a cause of his autism aswell, I don't know. The dude doesn't have a credit card to order shit online with so he constantly offers me cash so I can order stuff for him. It's annoying but whatever. So now, he wants me to order a €50(~$55) gift card for a very popular shoestore in here. He still thinks he has a chance to get into a relationship.

This isn't something I've been holding in per se, but I need to get this off my chest. I feel absolutely stupid, because of my kindness + desperation I fell for a really obvious scam. I like to think I'm pretty keen on these types of social situations, and I don't see myself as that naive but it happened.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been in debt and behind payments on loans for a couple months now but I am still sitting on a new financed car (bought when things were a little more stable). It's my commuter and one day pulling out of my apartment complex's garage I hit a pillar that was invisible to me. For a while I sat on the damages, but I am trying to sell my car now, so I've been meaning to fix it through insurance.

&amp;#x200B;

One day driving home in LA, a man in a red camaro gestures for me to roll down my window. He saw my damages and said he worked for a shop and if I'm interested we can pull over, he'll take a look and just throw me an offer to fix it. He seemed like a normal man, well spoken and so I obliged just to see what he'd say. He shows me some before after pics of his work, looks at my damage and says with confidence he can patch it up like new in a couple hours for $800 and at the shop he can do it but probably have to go through a middle man and pay more. (it was a completely torn in bumper and a snapped front grille). My insurance ded was $1000 and Honda gave me an estimate of about $3000 to fix without insurance, so I went for it.

&amp;#x200B;

When we get to my garage his 2 sons come out and they get to work, needing small tools here and there they were missing and I provided. They had heat involved to realign bent plastic and solder it back together. Then they got out this weird paste that looked like wall plaster they mixed in with another compound and spackled over. They mentioned it was a material to blend in holes and dents in carbon fiber. I asked about paint and they said since it was a common color so they would be able to mix it their. They walked me through the whole process and I watched pretty much the whole thing and it looked legit because I have little to no knowledge of cars.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh btw, I should've been thrown off when I told them I have no cash but could pay them with CC if they had a swiper. They said gift cards were cool. I didn't bat an eye. I was just excited to see what they could do and maybe learn for future situations where I might be able to do it myself.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end after all the red flags, I was still okay with it because their closing line was ""I need one thing from you. Don't wash your car for 48 hours, the paint and compound need to settle in. Usually at the shop.. blah blah blah convincing mechanic lingo"". I said alright. 48 hours pass. I go to wash my car so I can remove the white compound and take it to get an estimate to sell. Compound didn't come off as easy as he said it would. Okay... hm no problem I'll talk to a express detailing shop see if they can get it off. I take it to a second shop, he said he'll take a look. He comes outside.... slows down and looks at my car and grins as he knew something. ""Hey man, who did this?""... It started to dawn on me what was going on. ""You got scammed man, it's fake, think about it you really think this would work?""... He explained to me the gypsy community local here in LA, how they operate. I've only ever seen them do simple tricks like gas station, and family with cancer at the hospital tricks, but I've never seen them take it this far.

&amp;#x200B;

They did this job in front of all of my neighbors and even waved and talked with them, they answered all my questions with logically reasonable responses, they even let me watch the whole process, and get involved. I got screwed hard..... I do believe it is karma because 2018 was a rough year for me. But still I'm sitting here baffled how I fell for such an obvious scam with huge red flags so damn hard on the first day of the year. Happy freakin' near year to me, 2019 is gonna be greaaat hahaha.

i know my school blocks the wifi for snapchat, netlfix etc.. but if you use a VPN from the appstore you can go on whatever you want as long as it’s on. could i do that but to get wifi?

** i know this is a dumb question and i know wifi isn’t free but like.. i’m just wondering

I asked if she shaded me (shading means shit talking someone) and she said that she doesn't shade me but she tells people that i repress a lot of anger and that i'm gonna shoot up the school or be a serial killer.

I'm only 18, so I know that this shouldn't matter. But I've been dealing with this for way too long and nothing seems to help.

669,"So, I’ll do my best with explaining this, English is my second language.

I (F, 18 years) have been in a long-distance relationship for 2 years now. And the distance is pretty big, 19 000 kilometers. He (26 years) lives in New Zealand, I live in the little country called Belgium. Our relationship is really good, besides the distance of course. He tried moving over here, we failed, he had to start from scrap, get a new job, rent a house,.. We decided to switch it around so I’m moving over to NZ. Because Belgium's to difficult.

Now, the one decision I’ve been struggling with a little bit. I’m still in high school, I’m in my last year and in 6 months “should” be graduating. Apparently, in NZ, I can apply for some courses in university/College without a high school diploma. This is no bullshit, I’ve asked 2 universities/colleges over there and both of them confirmed. Even gave me courses I could do. And on another official site I read they do not assess/recognize overseas academic secondary school qualifications. For me to get a diploma here is almost useless and the chance of me actually passing is pretty low. 

I failed 4 of my Christmas exams. Failed 2 subjects so far, those 2 are my absolute worst subjects. If I can’t get those grades back up, I will fail the year (possibly). And trust me, I’m not sure if I can get them back up. 

Why? I’m extremely unmotivated and emotionally exhausted. I feel like fucking shit, I’m so unmotivated, not only for school but for many other things such as visiting family and friends, cleaning up, taking care of myself, whatever. There’s always this heavy weighting feeling on me, it’s always there, even when I think I’m feeling better. I haven’t told anyone about this part yet, but I’m even having suicidal thoughts. I’m sleeping worse, it’s harder to fall asleep, and when I wake up in the morning it just takes me so goddamn long to get out of bed (that part is more when I’m having a real bad day, the thought of having breakfast gets me out of bed mostly), but also on my bad days I seem to starve myself. So, there are bad days but that feeling I’m having is always there.

 No, I do not know where this is coming from, I do not know why I’m feeling like this. All I could say is that missing my boyfriend is a big factor and school is too. I don’t want to sound like a whiny bitchy kid, but I just do not like school, never did. And school puts me in a bad mood most of the time, that started about 3 years ago. There are some reasons why I don’t like it but If I’m going to get into that this post is going to get way too long, ha like it already isn’t (I am so sorry). 

School finishes in 6 months, I do **not** have the motivation and emotional energy to do much for it. Preferably I’d go to New Zealand, and study there in 2 years. Will I be motivated then? That’s a good question, my answer is I do not know. But I probably will, school in Belgium can be stressful, Belgium itself is just very stressful. I’ve heard that school in NZ is much more chill. And I like the thought of university/college more than high school because I can get to study something I actually want to. I’m almost certain I’ll be motivated. 

It sounds logical to me to quit since I’m very unhappy and actually can study over there without my diploma. But I’m afraid tbh. What if something goes wrong in my relationship? I’m not even sure what I want to study anymore. What if I won’t like NZ and want to return to Belgium? What if the qualifications I receive over there isn’t good enough for Belgium or won’t be accepted? 

Do you think It’s stupid to quit school and move over to NZ in a couple months (let’s say 3 months)?",03Jan2019,1

671,"So I know this has been asked many times before, but I’m at a stalemate with my mind here. Here’s the parameters-

 I’ve been at the same company for 5 years and have been promoted once, last year. When I took my original job with the company, I was young and ambitious and didn’t care about the salary (which was a pay bump from my previous job with a different company) and then when I was promoted to a position to manage the people in the position I was in, I realized I was underpaid. However, my salary increase with my promotion was based almost entirely on what was my previous salary,  not on the actual competitive basis of what other companys are paying. I’ve also had people working for me this year who have been demoted from my position into their position, so I see their salary change, and they were making WAY more than I was in my position. 

I beat all my goals, managed a good team, and I know my bosses are going to scoff at my raise request, thinking (it’s just all about money with you). But I’m a prideful employee, I love my job and I do a great job. I need to somehow explain to them and get them to understand that people are a commodity, and without painting a target on my back, get them to understand that I love my job and don’t plan to leave, but I want to get paid for what I think is fair ($18k increase... which is substantial for what I make now). How can I get them to understand this? I know if I was in the same position and was recruited by a competitor, I’d make much more. BUT I don’t want to have to reach out to competitors and interview and get offers to “prove” to my bosses that my pay isn’t competitive. I’ve kinda made my own bed here by laying down on salary negotiations before, so how can I right this wrong? I don’t want to leave the company, but I’m absolutely being taken advantage of. Some people that work for me even made more than I did last year. I can easily negotiate a cost of living increase, but I’m talking about wanting a 20% increase here. 

Thanks in advance to anyone that can help me make a game plan for negotiating this during my review!",03Jan2019,1

674,"I met John when I was 20 and he was 30 he was a very charming guy but at first I felt a little off. He was dating another girl the same age as me but he said she played games with him so he eventually broke it off with her. She became crazy she would text him constantly asking to hang out constantly eventually trying to commit suicide I don't know what was wrong with her.


John at first was super nice to me he would help me with all my issues, he would listen to me vent all day he would. He would give advice to all my problems. I finally felt like I had someone to confide in like I had a good guy. He said he was a feminist and he was super liberal he was super politically driven and he was super into the news. 



When I for First met him he did work a job he was a banker but later quit because he said that the work has been bugging him down. He became really depressed, once he became depressed now for months he hasn't done anything. He lives with his parents, he hasn't worked and he says that our society is is awful he blames this capitalistic society for not working.He says it's it's grueling and there is no point there is no point to anything he's a nihilist. 




He says that I'm immature because I talk about high school because I was bullied a lot. He says that I'm a liar because I tell little white lies because I get really anxious. He says that I am I'm emotionally unstable are crazy I feel like I'm a stable person I go to therapy often and I try to always work on myself. He refuses to go to therapy and he's he wants went to a residential treatment program and it turned out he said it was a scam he said therapy doesn't help at all. He’s been going to therapy for the last 10 years and it has done nothing it has only been a waste of money.




 I went on vacation to visit my best friend in Chicago I was So excited. Days before John was acting perfectly nice and perfectly fine but once when I got there and he wasn't there he was being very passive aggressive. I wanted to talk on my birthday with him and I wanted to FaceTime I kept asking and saying oh it's my birthday it's my birthday all excited just cause I want to see him. This happened often that things would be normal then he would get in a “mood” or ill be with friends and he’ll get super passive aggressive.




Then he said I was manipulative he said I'm in manipulative person and that we're not dating and that I shouldn't think we're dating and that and that he I'm confusing the relationship. He said I acted entitled. That no one was entitled to someones attention and that I was acting crazy. I said that he was a loser and needed to get his head out of his own ass. He would send these texts to our mutual friends trying to “vent” so a lot of my friends said I’m mean. I would never share private texts 


At that point we were on a break but still talking daily. He would say I’m manipulative in the relationship because if he was ignoring me I would send sexy pics. He would say I just use him so I don’t feel lonely or I use him as my punching bag. He said his last girlfriend was crazy. She would throw things and hit him.


I wasn’t talking to him after that. He sends me a ten page long email two weeks later. It’s very patronizing talking about himself, his illness, and how he struggles but really cares. It felt like someone was talking down to me. I deleted it and told him I didn’t read the whole thing. He was pissed saying that I couldn’t even be bothered to read it.

676,"I recently was offered a verbal job offer for an engineering position at the state of California. after having an amazing couple rounds of interviews. The guy said they were going to hire me and they were doing everything they could to expedite the process. While I should have waited for the official offer I actually planned around this and tentatively accepted the offer.

Unfortunately, during one of the reviews, they found that I had scored too low on one of the online examinations for the position. Despite having done so well on the interviews and having a verbal offer, this examination I’d taken 9 months prior had disqualified me for the position.

I was pretty bummed because I haven’t had much luck in the job hunt and I was preparing to accept an offer. The thing that made me most mad was that for some reason this examination (that they use to determine who to interview) somehow supersedes the actual interviews. If anything I shouldn’t have even qualified for an interview. 

Should I do anything about this or do I just forget it and move on? I had a couple people tell me to talk to one of their HR employees and let them know what happened. I’m not the kind of guy that likes to cause drama so I haven’t really done anything, but if something happened wrongfully to me I think they and others should know about it.

TL;DR Basically wasted two months of my life interviewing for a position where the guy didn’t even know how his own hiring process worked.

Fast forward to me trying to get a new Drivers License after moving to Oklahoma, and Oklahoma won’t issue me anything. 

Oklahoma says that the system shows that I have a current and Valid DL issued from Wisconsin. But because my physical DL says it expired in 2015, they can’t exchange it for one that works here.

I’m not a believer in the paranormal so this to me is my brain’s way of copeing with the loss. I am quite aware that death is something that happens to all of us and i even consider it a good thing for him.

He used to be pretty self sufficient until they babied him to the point where he's completely reliant on them to survive, but that's a whole other story.  Anyway, as things with my parents got worse, my dad left and my grandma stepped in to help with some bills and such.

683,"Hello, I need some advice. Most of my friends think I’m stupid or at least it feels like that. I come off clueless when it comes to lots of things. Despite the fact that I got honour roll in school and won an award in Art Class . When I disagree with them on something they say .. I can’t verbalize it because I don’t want a fight or cause a disagreement. Even when I know they’re absolutely wrong I just act like they’re right to avoid issues like hurting feelings. 

Im finding this difficult to change about myself. 

I like to think I know a lot about animals. I used to live on a hobby farm and was obsessed with animals for a long time. I also can sketch, do photography, watercolour paint and I try to have fashion sense. Those are areas I’m confident in. Not much else really interests me lol . So a lot of things are out of my comfort zone it seems. 

While most of my friends didn’t seem to think I was bright in high school I was still very well liked. 

An example of one of my friends thinking I’m clueless was yesterday we were hanging out and I was telling her how I made a list of priorities for 2019 one of them was getting a job. 

Her response  “you know your gonna need references for that right and a resume? You better get on that.” I had to explain to her yes I know and I have a resume. It just felt like I basically had to prove myself to her that I’m not stupid. I had to remind her that I had previous job experience too. 


I guess she thought because I was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder and on disability that all I did was sit on my ass. But I have only been diagnosed for a year and before that I had a life and she knows it. For grade 12 I was also very forgetful because I had issues sleeping  and it was really bad this was before I was diagnosed. It was very embarrassing how forgetful I was. Also once I was on medication for bipolar.  It got even worse I also gained weight, and had eyesight issues as side effects. I already had confidence issues from elementary school bullying. The side effects just made things a-lot worse and I was very depressed. I’m currently being weaned off medication so I can loose weight and get my thinking back. I feel strongly that the medications took away my motivation and creativity. My assigned nurse says this is a common feeling among people with bipolar disorder. Since my meds have been recently reduced a lot  I can say my creativity and motivation is slowly coming back. But I can only imagine what my friend this friend thinks of me with all the issues I’ve had going on.


That’s how it was on and off high school with her and a-lot of other friends. Now this friend graduated with me in 2017 . She hadn’t treated me this way for  a really long time now. I’m just afraid it’s going to start up again after yesterday. I was at her house so I felt like it would’ve been a bad decision to ask her where she gets off talking to me like I’m stupid. 
The friend who I hung out with yesterday happened  to also be in my art class and thought I only won the art award because the teacher liked me and I had patience when working on projects. Not because I was any good. 

I confronted someone I used to be friends with in high school once about treating me like I was stupid and belittling me. I told her I didn’t want to be her friend anymore. I ended up making her cry.  This individual also told me that art is an easy course when I told her how I had one of the highest marks in my class. And how happy I was. I’m just trying to provide another example for you guys. 

Just not sure how I should go about changing myself to stop this and also how to attract more people into my life that aren’t like this.

As I was typing this, I just realised that I am feeling sorry for myself. And I haven't done such a thing in a long time, it was one of the traits I tried my hardest to get rid of. 

But anyway, back on topic. I have no clue how to make more close friends. I am in college right now (UK), and I just know that nobody likes me really all that much. Every single one of our conversations are just boring, monotonous small talk. I am friends with people that get invited to parties, too, but I have never even gotten an invite. How, just how the fuck do I make some good friends? I try sometimes to liven up the conversation and encourage people to reach out when I do, but it never works. I am stuck at being **just friends** with my friends. I want a deeper connection than that, I just want somebody to talk to when I am down, and somebody who can talk to me when they are feeling down. 

I don't want just a person to talk to *when I am feeling down*, but somebody who I feel I can talk about anything with.

I only have literally one person who is there, but it feels like they are held hostage by me because I was an idiot and told them that I am literally their only close friend. This dude helped me out with a ton, too but I just feel like I am being a huge emotional drain on him and he is the only person I can talk to about this, and most times I don't, because our relationship is just me taking and him never asking for me to give.

Basically, i met this girl 2 years ago in high school.
It was love at first sight. FYI, I see myself as the type of guy who is very introvert, still has many friends but is terrible at flirting/interacting with girls in general. 
We started hanging out with common friends, started talking a bit. Very quickly, she became the person I would talk to 24/7. We both got very attached to each other, and I fell in love with her very fast. She was everything I could hope for, a fun, beautiful and smart woman.
I still think I could have made it work if I had handled things differently, but I screwed up. After only a few weeks of knowing her I confessed my love and she told me she didn’t feel the same way towards me.  

Now let me tell you, at this time we still had one year together in high school, and oh boy was this year horrible. To sum it up, I kept going back and forth with her, sometimes telling her I couldn’t stay friends with her and sometimes telling her I could because I really cared about her. I knew I was emotionally hurting her, and during these months it felt like I couldn’t feel happy anymore.

Eventually I screwed up extremely bad, she got fed up with my manners, didn’t « accept me back », we did not talk for a couple months and it felt like a part of me was missing.
Then I learnt she was dating a boy. As I was still thinking about her, I decided it was the right time to make some good apologies and prove her i was really ready to repair our friendship.
She accepted talking to me back. 

Fast forward a couple months, and here we are. I’m now slowly coming to the realisation that I still have feelings for her. I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t want to hurt her, I want to keep her near me but the heartbreak is killing me even a year after. It’s affecting me mentally, emotionally, physically. I can’t think of anything else. 
What do I do now ?

I have bleached them and let them sit for an hour and the stains have faded, however I was planning on wearing them tomorrow and I need them to be dry by then.

Is there anything that will help them dry by tomorrow? I have the urged to throw them into the tumble dryer but apparently heat from tumble dryers and radiators or any heat at all ruins and “warps the rubber.” 

I also thought about wrapping them in towels before I toss them in if that will help.

690,"Hi there, I'm a pretty direct and honest person and I told him countless times to take a fucking shower because he stinks, and not just me but everybody else complained. He also goes like 4-5 months without getting a haircut, combine this with the personal hygiene problem and you can imagine how greasy his hair is, I can't really give you a description about how unattractive he is. I didn't write this to be mean about him in any way, it's just that me as his friend I'm concerned about him. He dresses in the most unfashionable ways, strangely he has an older brother who's the complete opposite of him. He takes care of himself, decent haircut/clothes, talks to girls and he is exactly like every sane person shoud be. Anyways, my friend also has little to no social life as well, besides me and 2 other guys he doesn't hang out with anyone, doesn't want to meet new people and chase girls (We're both 16 btw ) all he does is play video games all day, everyday, it's fucking unhealthy, 0 social skills at all. Me, and those 2 that I mentioned earlier told him the exact same stuff in face and he doesn't seem to mind/care at all, he says that he just took a shower before meeting with us even though his smell and looks totally give him away. Don't say to me that it's his life and I should mind my own business, I want to get him help but I don't know how. Being 16 and to never have kissed a girl in your life is pretty concerning, and not just this but everything, EVERYTHING makes him a friends and people repeller. Please don't call me a toxic person, I simply want him to wake the fuck up, what he's gonna play video games non stop for the rest of his life?

We went out shopping yesterday and she immediately went to the kid/baby stuff while I wanted to look for her some stuff (she never really puts herself first and it's getting colder here so she needs some more long sleeve winter clothes). That kinda bummed me out. 

If we do talk, it's usually me talking about the days events in the kpop world, and her  just listening. You can tell she hates every moment of it but she still listens for my sake cuz I love it so much.

Or 

She usually talks about a bunch of laws and stuff regarding kids in the foster care system or the newest case that just come on the news or something. I also sit there listening but not enjoying it because it's just not my thing.

694,"Hi.

I have grown extremely tired of my household. It's a combination of constant arguing, a divorced and remarried mother, and my own mental health. I suspect that she is emotionally abusive as she has said many things that I question being right (insulting me, putting me down, putting unrealistic expectations on me) and seriously need a break.

I am not old enough to move out, and won't be for a little while.

Other than having an emotionally dysfunctional household, I have experienced a lot of things that have heavily affected my wellbeing. Due to repeated molestation, I have a lot of fear revolving around touch and I am currently being screened for PTSD. Panic attacks have been bothering me for a while, and can't seem to go away along with the memories replaying in my head.

In the past I have seriously considered suicide. I am glad to say that I do not wish that upon myself at the moment, but I cannot figure out how to get out of this situation. I have thought deeply about running away but I'm not sure how I would get along. I'm being plagued with these thoughts. I feel like I need to escape.

700,"So, I am 28, and for the past 10 years I have been searching for my biological father. I finally did an Ancestry DNA test and got my results back last Saturday. 

By Saturday night I found my biological fathers family and also found out that he was brutally murdered in 2000. 

My biological family had no idea that I even existed. They all are very loving and accepting and they want to be a part of my life. This is a very overwhelming feeling as I am one person, and there are many of them. 

Many of them are in shock, but they are not surprised. I just resurrected for them a person that has been dead for 18 years, a person that I had never met, and I am horrified by that. They have already started to make comparisons between me and him, and that’s terrifying! 

Due to this and a series of other things happening in my life, I feel not at all like myself. I feel that I am mourning the loss of what could have been, I am angry, I am numb, and I am in denial. I am experiencing all 5 stages of grief at the same time. 
My family is trying to be supportive, but none of them know how, which is understandable. 

It doesn’t help that I work a stressful job, I have two small children, and a husband deployed overseas. I don’t feel like me.

701,"My brother has gone down a dark path the last several months. He quit his job and became a recluse, claimed he was going to online classes but I'm 80% sure he didn't complete them or dropped out. He's become a druggie that smokes weed and had pills too. He's been withdrawn, acting strangely and doesn't want to to talk to any of us about it. He's been on his own unless he has secret friends.

He's an adult and is old enough to make his own decisions, so we can't stop him. We are afraid he's dealing drugs, as he frequently leaves the house for hours at a time with no message to anyone about where. It's not a job, and it's not school, and he has no friends that we know of...that sort of narrows the list down.

Sometimes I am scared of him, whereas I used to be close to him. He is shrouded in secrecy and this combined with a potential drug addiction I am truly worried for my brother.

He left today, telling us abruptly that he was leaving for a week. He had only a suitcase and was in a hurry. In short, nobody has a single clue as to where he went. He didn't take his valuable computer or other gear with him, only a phone which he never answers. 

There's basically two possibilities: either he really is going on a trip to treat himself (he never really travels anywhere) or he's doing something unknown and possibly shady. I say this only because of how he's been acting.

What can my family and I do, if anything? I don't want him to end up with a record for stupid decisions now at the start of his life. My brother is sometimes unstable, breaking things in the house and basically controlling how things are, and a lot of times we are scared of him.

709,"I don’t care if anyone reads this but I just needed to get it off my chest. This is the second time I’ve tried to write this post so let’s see how it goes lmao. I’m a freshman in college (just finished my first semester) and I don’t think I’ve ever felt this lonely. This is because of a couple reasons, but I think it’s mainly the fact that I’ve been single my whole life. To paint this picture for you, I’m 18 M and gay and I’ve gone to catholic school my whole life so there wasn’t a whole lot happening with the gay scene at any school I’ve gone to up until recently. I never usually get my hopes up with guys because it always ends not very well lol (I’ve had crushes tell me they hated gay people to my face). But I guess he was different. Let’s call him Dave. I met Dave on the day I moved in inside the lobby and I thought he was very attractive. He also lived on my floor in the same building so we became very good friends. Honestly one of the best friends I’ve ever had in my life. We had so much in common and he was everything I wanted in a friend, even more than that. Throughout our time together though I started to become more attracted to him (this doesn’t seem like a problem yet considering I haven’t mentioned he’s straight and has a girlfriend). Listen, I KNOW I’m stupid that’s like the #1 gay rule is to not fall in love with straight guys because it’s always messy but he was different. Dave flirted a shit ton. We were very affectionate from the start and honestly I don’t know if this is a normal thing because most of my friends are girls and I’m affectionate with all of them. But the stuff he said and did made me think that there was a possibility of something there. I’ll go in order of the times he flirted as this story progresses. The first time I really started to feel like he was into me was when his girlfriend and her friend came down to visit for a weekend. My roommate wasn’t there and I told them they could stay there for the night (the person they were supposed to stay with bailed). When we went to bed I told his gf and her friend they could sleep in my roomies bed while Dave and I slept in mine. We fell asleep no problem but when I woke up in the middle of the night we were spooning (I was sitting there like tf is happening bruh) and me moving caused him to wake up. I asked him “were we snuggling” and he said “I have no idea” and I was like “damn now I really want to snuggle” and he said “we can I don’t care” and I spooned him the whole night while his girlfriend slept a bed away from us. Once it was light out he heard a noise and moved away super quickly so I stopped spooning. There were other times where I’d talk low of myself like calling myself ugly and he’d tell me I was attractive. Okay at this point in the story it seems like he’s just being friendly but things started to escalate when we got drunk together. He would start to get super touchy, like stroking my legs and shit like that. When Dave gets drunk he cannot stay clean at all and he makes a huge mess when eating. This one time he was eating the Mac and cheese I made him and it spilled all over his shirt so I got up to wipe it off of him with a paper towel. I lifted up his shirt a bit to try and get the cheese of of his shirt and he said to me, in a fully serious voice, “when I thought you were going to suck my dick and I wanted you to” and a note to add, we weren’t even alone when he said this my other friend was there too and she looked at me like 😬 “tf is happening” and I was like “okay Dave, whatever” as I disregarded what he said and I kept cleaning up. He’d say gay shit all the time when he was drunk and I never initiated anything ever. Everything he did and said while with me was always unsolicited, him making the first move. He also said completely sober that if I was a girl that I’d suck his dick and that I had nice lips. Mind you the majority of this stuff happened after the fact that I came out to him. So he knew I was gay and he was completely okay with it. Sometimes when he’s drunk I’d put my legs on him (I guess that’s kind of solicited except I do that with all my friends and it’s not in a sexual way) and he’d stroke my legs and slap them and say “yeah give me that shit” and shit like that, I just let him do it because I’m not going to push him to do anything like this, everything I’m telling you was stuff he did by himself. At this point I was getting more and more depressed because the one thing I’ve wanted in life that I’ve never gotten is validation, and Dave gave that to me. But the fact that I couldn’t be with him and the fact that he was happy with his girlfriend (she’s insanely nice and a great person) really took a toll on me. I don’t know what I expected from it. But after months of attention and flirtation between Dave and I had to say something because I was sitting in bed feeling so alone that I didn’t want to do anything anymore. And I know he’s just a guy but I’ve never clicked with someone. The final night before I told him we were shitfaced again and he was being super touchy and at one point I got up (jokingly) and was like “do you want to fight” and all he did in response was press his head against mine and we sat like that for a good five seconds before I pulled away. The one thing that really hit me, and set off all of my unleashed emotion was the last thing he said to me that I remember clearly from that day was “I wish I was gay so I could help you”. I was devastated because that just confirmed the months of me already knowing he didn’t like me even though I tried to look past everything. The day after I didn’t talk to him at all and he messaged me asking if everything is okay and I told him that I’m fine I just needed space. The day after that, I decided to tell him. I didn’t want to tell him in person (I’m not a little bitch but the fact that I’ve had crushes tell me they hated gay people makes me scared of any confrontation with a guy like this) so I poured my heart out onto snap. I essentially told him I’ve had feelings for him for a long time and it’s been driving me crazy to not say anything, but I respect the fact that he has a girlfriend and that he’s straight and told him I’d try and move on. The only thing he said, deadass, (this makes me SO mad) was “I know”. YOU KNOW?? Tf you MEAN you knew?? He told me he knew the whole time. The fact that he knew I was into him and flirted as much as he did kind of makes me mad. I find it insanely weird that any straight guy would flirt as much as he did if 1. He knew I was gay and 2. He knew I liked him the whole time. So know I’m in a weird limbo if still liking him and still unsure of what to do in this situation. He said nothing has changed between us and that we’re still friends, but honestly I don’t even know if I can call him that at this point. Three times (which unfolded right before and during break) were advances that he made to ask me to hang out with him, (he invited ME) and flaked on all occasions. I try to keep talking to him over break and it seems like it’s just a chore. I’d like to think that something I said a while ago was really reflective of the situation I’m in, he is my world and I’m just apart of his. He’s never going to care about me as much as I care about him and it shows sometimes. He’s like my only real friend in college too because I’ve spent all my time with him and I’m rooming with him next year. I hope thing get better between us because honestly, this whole situation just makes me feel like a piece of shit sometimes. I don’t even know what to do with myself anymore. Does he like me? Did he ever like me? He basically told me to move on but I doubt I ever will. I need genuine opinions here please I know I’m a dumbass I don’t need someone else to tell me that.",03Jan2019,1

717,"So I just wanna preface this with a quick summary of my parental background. Long story short, my parents finalized their divorce when I was in 7th grade (I’m a senior in college now). I lived with my mom for the majority of my life until the end of my freshman year in college. She was a drug addict (crack, heroin.. you get it) and she eventually developed a drug-induced schizophrenia from the persistent use. So, it should go without saying that she is not an easy person to live with and many times chose asshole boyfriends/drugs/etc. over me or my sister. Frequently I had my possessions stolen from me, the heat turned off, electric turned off… but we don’t live in a poor neighborhood by any means, so her behavior was quickly noticed by the neighbors and my mother's house became truly isolated. 

Before anyone tells me that I’m wrong for leaving my mom in that state, I will just say that the countless hours of research, talking with her, trying to understand her, bringing her to rehabs, bringing her to psych wards, etc. all lead to no progress. I just couldn’t do it anymore; it was the straw that broke the camel’s back once she threatened me over the phone while I was away at school to take the stuff out of my room so I’d have no place to live. I try not to hold a grudge anymore, but I feel the need to justify why I left my moms and moved in with my dad, albeit the fact he lives 30 minutes away. 

Leaving the home I grew up in was tough, but living with my mother was almost like living with no parent at all.

This is why the move to my dad’s was so important for me… it was almost like a second chance. Maybe I could finally have that parental figure I always longed for, someone to care for me and provide that parental love that I’d really never felt. I know it sounds corny, but this is genuinely something that kept me hopeful. And to sweeten the deal, my step mother is an incredible person and natural mother. 

Everything seemed to be falling into place. 

However, the move to my dad’s wasn’t only difficult because of the distance… my Dad and I have also massively disagreed about things our entire lives. He’s always been very hands off with his parenting approach, offering great deals of advice and letting his opinion be constantly known without the actual physical action of any parenting. Therefore, I have a hard time respecting a lot of his opinions, because that’s all they ever really were to me: just words.

Therefore, my stepmom is typically our mediator. She’ll usually step in between our arguments and try to mend things. I always appreciated her for this. 

However, Christmas Eve this year showed another side that truly hurt me. 

My father and I got into a meaningless argument because he “didn’t like my tone” when answering one of his questions, to which he demanded I leave the house and go live with my mother. You know, *the same drug addict mother I moved away from* to find a safe haven in his abode. This isn’t the first time he has said this either; he’s said it in more heated arguments where I always justified the hurtfulness through assessing the fact that he was incredibly angry and probably said things he didn’t mean to say. 

But this? Because of my “tone?” On *Christmas Eve*? That hurt. So, I left, drove around for about an hour and change before my step mom called asking me to come back and mend things. However, she kept rationalizing his anger while continually telling me what I did wrong and why I need to apologize. Once again, no exaggeration, she wanted me to *apologize for my tone* and try to *understand my dad’s exclamation to “go back and live with my mother*.

That’s when it hit me. I finally realized that as much as she might be the perfect step mother at most times, as much as she fills in the void my biological mother left in me, as much as I try to pretend everything is normal… she’s still only around because of my father and will always care more about my father than me. A biological mom? 

In theory, she would love her child just as much, if not *more* than her husband. But I’ll never have that with her. Understandably so… but it still hurts to realize the only motherly figure in your life will never be the ideal mother you hope for.

This is what leads up to why I’m posting now. My father and I eventually hashed things out on Christmas morning through a long, arduous talk that went pretty much how I expected it to go (i explained why i was so hurt, he explained why what i did was wrong, I apologized, he deflected). Whatever, it’s Christmas, let’s just move past this. And I really thought we did. I’ve been trying so hard since then to make things as great as I can for them while I’m here. 

Then, just before, my Dad and I got into a disagreement about something so small it’s not even worth typing out. I went to the bathroom after the disagreement, which is when I heard my step mother say to my dad something that really hurt.

“Don’t worry, it’s only two more weeks.”

I go back to school in two weeks.

The only place I started to feel safe in again has now become the most uncomfortable living situation since my mother’s. I can’t wait to go back to school, but now I just feel awkward and annoying to even be here. I never do talk to reddit about personal shit but it’s a lot to explain to someone and I just need to vent to people I don’t know. 

If anyone has any advice, please throw it out there... I just feel lost. Thank you to anyone for making it through this encyclopedia-sized post lol.",03Jan2019,1
