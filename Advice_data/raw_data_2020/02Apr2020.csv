0,"I want to run for either class historian or vice president. Any suggestion to an indecisive junior for which to choose?

I really enjoy photography, which makes me want to run for historian. Especially since photography has been a huge passion of mine since middle school, and I do other photography related tasks in other clubs. I just feel as though I could get “burnt out” since it takes forever to go over every picture to edit it and send it to all the students in the photos.

In my school, all students basically have the same amount of responsibility and tasks. So being vice president would actually be a bit easier than historian as I wouldn’t have to go to every event to take photos. But I suppose colleges mostly assume VP would have more responsibility—which I want to demonstrate.

I’m pretty indecisive, so I thought it would be worth a shot asking on here. I genuinely do enjoy student council and photography, but Im not sure whether to run for historian or VP. I could definitely tie some of my essays in with photography, but would being vice president help my chances of getting into a t20 school a bit?

I would say my interests are all over the place as I love photography but want to major in biology on my way to medical school.

Any advice or suggestion would be incredible! Thank you!",02Apr2020,1
1,"I'm currently a junior in high school and my academics, while not the best, have not been bad. I'm an A  B student with a GPA hovering around a 3.7 while taking difficult classes. Due to the virus my school has switched to E - Learning. The district has told teachers to give out assignments but nothing that is major. I started off this semester on a really bad foot. I currently have a D in AP Computer science and a D in AP physics along with a C in pre-calculus. I'm doing great in every other class besides these three, and last semester I got a B in these three classes while also starting off that semester horribly. I was hoping to get my grade up throughout the semester but with the current situation holding my school out on until April 23rd (maybe longer), I doubt I will be able to make these grades into B's. I have a decent track record at my school with good Extra circulars and I'm aiming for a good ACT score but I can't have grades like this going down on my college transcript. I really don't know what to do right now ,and I seriously doubt my teachers would be nice enough to give me extra credit opportunities and I doubt they'll be giving out heavy assignments because the districts advised them against it. I was debating on emailing my counselor but it is too late to drop these courses. I have no where to turn too, so I'm asking for your advice Reddit.

2,"I work as a merchandiser for a soda company and I’m in and out of grocery stores everyday. My mother is very worried about me getting sick and blames my company for not providing gloves and masks. I have some masks I could wear but I can’t stand working with gloves on. My hands sweat like crazy and it’s very uncomfortable. I’m 27 years old and my mom is just getting on my nerves because I think she might be overreacting. I don’t know what she expects me or the company to do. I can’t just go to my boss and say “my mom is mad at this company because she feels you guys aren’t doing anything to protect us.” That sounds stupid. I guess I can start wearing a mask and gloves if it’ll make her feel better. My company is deemed “essential” and they’re not going to shut down. I will admit my company isn’t really treating this virus as a big deal and have done very little about it. They give us Lysol wipes to wipe down the inside of vehicles but that’s about it. 

Being in a grocery store I’m sure that’s a hot spot for a virus or to get sick in general, and it’s not like I haven’t seen workers wearing masks and gloves because I have. It’s just, at one point, she was blaming me for not protecting myself and then blamed my company. I think wearing a mask and gloves is a bit overkill. None of my coworkers are doing it and neither is my boss. She’s so scared and worried about me though since I’m in and out of grocery stores. I can’t do anything to make her feel better, except starting wearing a mask and gloves I guess. I think she might want me to quit but I need this job. I have rent and bills to pay. This also isn’t the best time to job hunt since most businesses are laying off and shutting down. 

She’s starting to drive me crazy.",02Apr2020,1
3,"So I just moved to anew town a few
Months again and I finally have reveled some friends after a long dry spell in my Hometown.I feel genuinely finally accepted by my peers except for one who keeps saying sly shit just to make me feel stupid he does it do passively he flies in under the radar and gets away with it because other are too stupid to notice.. His girl friend also also has a vendetta against me and took me Off of a group chat where  I was pulling myself out of a deep depression with...like I really finally felt like I had friends and BAM gone.And the reasoning behind why she doesn’t like me is kinda weird.She accuses me telling her to “shut the fuck up”  when is true..but I did it in like a kind of like “OMG SHUT UP NO WAY” like totally just excited over their cute puppy’s name.. who’s name I forget at the moment but I assure you it’s cute.Anyway the  other day they were unexpectedly at my friends house and both of them just sized me up and laughed It was humiliating.I Seriously felt like she was  Shooting angry laser beams through her eyes balls at me..



So could  you advise me on how to help dissolve the situation?Or insight into  a bully’s mind set? In the end I really want peace. Even if my ego really wants to make them Feel stupid..hell I can’t help it..bullying is a deeeeeeep trigger starting with my own father up to now...I’m mortified and angry..heh take care.",02Apr2020,1

7,"So long story short, recently I was ostracized by my group of friends kind of out of nowhere, and I've only kept contact with 2 of them(they weren't involved in the thing, but they're still friends with those who hurt me) Because of what happened, I'm now constantly scared that if I talk about a serious subject with any of those two they're going to get really mad at me and go tell the others I'm a horrible person and stop talking to me.

Recently, I brought up this suject to Friend 1, about how what happened gave me some intense trauma, and apparently the only answer he could muster was basically ""well, you learned to mind your own business so it's not that bad"" and uh ??

Honestly I was so hurt by what he said, but I don't know how to bring it up to him because, again, I feel like he's gonna get tired of me and stop talking to me, and I just feel so stuck: I feel like I can't express myself by fear of getting burned at the stake

10,"24 year old. Have a Bachelor's in Accounting. Working in the Suburbs outside a big city making 43k. 1140 take home every two weeks net after taxes and 401(k) contribution.

I guess I'm looking for some outside perspectives or some encouragement I guess but here are a list of things that are just kinda making life kinda depressing.

I've struggle with video games ( possibly addiction?), overeating and social anxiety for most of my life. I'm finally seeing a therapist but things are slow moving, he said that I may be a candidate for medication after i asked him about it but I'm afraid of the beginning  period when you start it and the potential side effects most drugs like Zoloft can have. He hasn't brought it up since then so I guess he feels like there is hope for me without it?  So this is problem one. I guess this isn't what I need advice on just some context.

Besides weight I also have allergies and sinus problems which cause congestion and headaches, trying to remedy them but that is also a slow process.... Need allergy shots and if that doesn't help the congestion then possibly surgery to fix my deviated septum and or surgery to improve the flow of my sinus passages..

So the real problem one is probably my job. I work long hours with a long commute. The People are great but the  work is so stressful. I've gotten my work load adjusted a bit but its still intense (at least for me in my current unhealthy state). To advance in pay I will need to test for my CPA (Accounting certification). This will take at least a year if not 18 months and tbh with my workload and schedule finding the 16-20 hours of studying required each week is pretty much impossible. I feel like even though the job is kinda squeezing me for time and money its a pretty decent first job if I try to be objective. My main problem is that my work life balance is shit and can only get worse if I stay because of the CPA testing and the new responsibility that comes with experience. I'm honestly torn between quitting to study for my CPA and find a new job or sticking with the current job. The pros are basically: Nice people, flexible schedule, getto work on a wide variety of different tasks, learned job skills are pretty practical, and one that doesn't really matter to me too much is that we have company outings a lot. The main negatives being the workload is stressful, long commute, and there's more customer service involved than my anxiety can handled right now.

**So should I quit or find a new job?** I fantasize about it. Have this plan to finally, organize all my childhood belongings and sell/donate/store them, Study and try doing some work from home or part time work. Exercise ( doing a little walking now with work from home), and maybe just do some other education and self improvement. I know if I do this there is a great risk I just fall into old habits like video games and fail to achieve my goals. I guess I could try and find another job that's less stressful but I feel like my resume will land me something shit especially since I feel like I don't have many references to call on anymore.

I live with my parents mostly rent free. My mom would probably be supportive (she's laid back) but my dad probably less so. He would probably just call b.s. and think that I'm just a quitter and that if I worked harder things would be better off.

My parents are nice individually to me in their own way. Dad likes to talk to me about the news and work and stuff and my mom will talk to me any excuse she gets but things aren't perfect. Since my dad is kinda uptight and a workaholic and my mom is lax they get into stupid arguments a lot. This his happened since I can remember. Honestly its a trigger for my anxiety. I just try to avoid them and even though I'm 24 I still react the same way I did as a scared kid (avoid them and be uncomfortable). Sometimes my mom will try to vent to me about my dad but I just tell her I don't want to hear the same shit over and over again and that I'm not a marriage counselor. I just try to stay neutral because I don't want either of them to feel like I have a favorite. I wouldn't really say one is more toxic than the other but my dad can be an asshole when he drinks. No violence though.

**Should i move out?** You are probably thinking dude you're a 24 year old grown ass man who isn't making poverty wages why don't you move out? Trust me its on my mind but its hard to say no to cheap living especially since a studio apartment near work is about 1k in a good neighborhood and 700-800 in a shittier part of town. It would save me valuable commuting time and some stress from home but I would rather save to by a place and pay down my student debt. Its hard to justify spending 40-50% of your take home on rent for a tiny place. Where I work isn't even the place I would like to live. I currently live with my parents 50 min to an hour away. The town I like is about 30 min away from work. I have enough savings to move out and rent. I could maybe buy a condo right now? But I feel like getting at least a town home would be a better investment. I have some friends that could potentially be roommates but the ones that need roommates aren't exactly the most financially responsible of my friend group so I don't really trust them if I'm being honest.

**So I guess some of my options are:**

Magically come to tolerate my home, work and commute till I can be successful and buy my own place.

Keep my job and rent an apartment closer to work, hopefully reducing stress from home and the commute. Learn to be independent even with the significant financial cost.

Find a new job and either move out or stay home?

Ask my parents if its ok for me to quit and stay with them while I resume education and work part time?

I don't know what to do I'm in a place in my life where I know vital decisions and changes to my life need to be made but I just feel like any choice I make will be wrong. Like I'm trapped and there's no way out.

Any help or words of encouragement are welcome.

11,"12 weeks ago I started working at place through a temporary employment agency. I was over qualified for the job, but it fit the hours I was looking for so I gave it a shot. I wanted a job that was easy, and in the afternoon/evening so I could attempt to start an online business at home in the morning. Just looking for something to give me a small paycheck every week that wasn't too stressful.

I made sure to make a good first impression and went into this with a lot of confidence. I am a 26 yr old college grad, tall, pretty good looking guy and have spent a lot of time in the past 4 years or so to be more confident, as I am naturally shy and a little insecure. So i went into this job very confidently with a carefree attitude. Within the first week I met someone who I would end up working around every day for the next 12 weeks. She is a woman from a country in South America who came to U.S. 10 years ago. Instantly we had a strong connection. I worked very hard and was pretty quiet, but she made an effort to help me out and I ended up getting to know her. I am not exaggerating when I say she is one of the most beautiful women I've ever met. The first time I noticed her from afar I thought she was younger then me, until I noticed up close she had a couple little gray hairs. She's actually 40 lol, but her body is that of a 21 year old and her accent makes me forget everything else in the world for a moment. Throughout this time I grew a strong attraction to her, physically and even more for who she is. I could go on a lot longer, but I will spare you. 

I tried my best to keep the feelings secret as I didn't want anyone to know that I am in love with her because it would make things weird, and maybe she would be more distant. So I don't give her too much attention, but when the times are right I would flirt with her, make her laugh, and we would always hold very strong eye contact. She often would smile and laugh at things I do and strike up conversations with me pretty regularly. We clearly had a connection. I'm sure most people knew that I like her just by the way I looked at her and clearly enjoyed interacting with her more than most people. But, I made sure I wasn't creepy or too puppy-dog like around her. And if I sensed that I was, I backed off for a while. I played it cool and over time we grew close. I look up to this woman, and I know she admires me. If I didn't give her attention for long enough she would end up coming and talking to me and even getting very close, putting her body on mine just to show me something on the computer. Not to sound arrogant, but I was definitely the tallest, most fit, best looking guy in this department so I stood out. And she is the hottest woman in the entire building in my opinion. I am confident 9 days out of 10 and I'm pretty positive she is attracted to me. Also, major point here, her husband passed away last year. She told me she is single, but we never talked about why. I found out through someone else. A lot of times we look at each other and just giggle. Throughout my time working there I made friends with just about everybody in the department (maybe 20 people) and am the center of attention in a lot of situations. She notices that for sure.

Now this is definitely weird, and I am aware of this, but the feeling is so strong I can't help it; she is the only reason I get up and go to work every day. I literally hate the weekends, I just get depressed and try to pass the time until Monday when I can go back to work, just to see her and have the possibility of having a couple minute conversation with her. Sad, I know. But it's true. I want to make it clear that I play it very cool at work because I want to keep her from losing interest; I don't pay attention to her until the right times. Now, I make more than my weekly paycheck from this job in 2 hours working at home, and have gotten 2 other job opportunities paying double what I make here, but turned them down without hesitation because I love being around this woman. She has brought me so much joy. I even finally hooked up with and started dating this girl who I have been head over heels for since high school, 8 years ago, during this time. But I have no feelings for her and don't talk to her because I am in love with this 40 year old goddess at a job I don't even need. Now that brings us to today.

I always planned on telling her that I admire her and want to stay in contact on the day I decide to leave this job. I played it out in my head all the time. I just didn't want to say anything while working with her because I don't want it to be weird...it's not the right work environment to have any awkwardness. So two days ago I had a great day at work, flirted with her a little and we talked about stuff for like 15 min. All was good. I was planning on continuing what we had talked about the next day. Then my employment agency calls me at 9pm and says the company laid off every temp worker. My work there was terminated and I could not even go to work the next day to say goodbye to anyone. And I don't have her phone number and she doesn't have social media. The pain I felt was more than any relationship I had ever been in. My heart physically felt heavy. I spent the entire next day staring at nothing. I wanted to cry so badly, but could not. The thought of not seeing her ever again, let alone keeping in contact, was excruciating. I went from loving every day of my life because i knew I got to go to work, to being blindsided. I realized this may happen with the virus deal, but I thought I would have a chance to say goodbye.

I have one contact from work who I have been texting. Today I asked them to do a favor for me and ask the woman if I could have her phone number because I didn't have a chance to say farewell. My contact said ok....then 5 hrs later said 'I'm so sorry I can't'. Apparently they are not friends and don't talk due to a past issue. My contact is also a little jealous because she is in love with me, but i asked for another woman's number through her. In any case, this is what I need advice with: On Friday, two days from now, the company will be laying off more people but the employees don't know who yet. So there is a chance that this woman gets fired and I really lose her forever. The workplace is 20 min from my house, so I want to go there at the time she gets off and meet her in the parking lot and just say something along the lines of ""I didn't get a chance to say goodbye"", then ask for her number to stay in contact. Is this a good idea or will it be creepy and needy? I'm leaning towards doing it because the worst case is she gets weirded out and I never see her again. But I'm pretty sure she will think it's sweet. You're probably thinking like ""what is your end game with this"" I'm 26, she's 40, i should just forget about it because nothing will ever come from this. But its not very often in life you meet someone who you have feelings for as strongly as this. Even if I never see her again, just to be able to shoot her a message once in a while and stay in contact is good with me. I really look up to this woman, I admire her and I care about her. I want to her to know this. So do I go to my ex-workplace and meet her at her car when she gets out? How do I do that and not look weird? Or do I start texting people to try and get someone else's number from work who can ask her for me? What if I can't and she gets laid off on Friday and she's gone forever? 

please help, thanks",02Apr2020,1
12,"I work in a factory in souther Iowa and since the covid 19 outbreak I have had two people cough on me thinking they were being funny. The first time was about 3 weeks ago and the incident was reported to HR by another person who was also coughed on. From what anyone knows nothing was done about it, not even a mention at our morning meetings. Fast forward to last Friday the second time I was coughed on by a different employee. This time I told HR personally, he looked furious when I told him and he went and had a meeting with my line manager and our production manager for my end of the shop. Nothing again was said to the two individuals. At this time I sent a message to our head of safety and got him involved. This was near the end of the day so he didn't get back to me until the morning of the following work day. He said they were both talked to but no write ups were handed out. To me this implies a small slap on the wrist with zero consequences which made myself and my other coworkers who knew about the incident feel unvalued. As the day went on it kept eating at me so I vented/blew up to my production manager. I told him if he or our head of safety was coughed on those people would not have a job and I that made me feel. He said the issue was being looked into but there are hoops they have to jump through to take actions. To me this sounds like bs as people are being arrested and charged with terrorism for the exact same thing.

13,"My hobbies are gaming. I love playing games, and some games I am very passionate about. The last few girls I dated/almost dated have not shared any interests in gaming at all, and it makes me feel uncomfortable.

It became a problem with my ex-fiance when we were together; whenever I wanted to play games she would end up just sitting on her phone or reading a book, and would almost completely ignore me until I was done. It made me feel ashamed to play and like playing games, and it was a terrible feeling. It made me feel like I shouldn't be who I was. 

I've dated a few girls after that, all of which didn't like games either. They ended up falling through, but it's just weird that I always end up dating girls that arent into games, even though I ideally would like to date someone who is at least a tiny bit interested or wouldn't mind watching me play some every so often.

I never want anyone to think that I believe they aren't smart, I realize English is a difficult language and totally emersing yourself in a foreign country has to be scary and a huge change. I want to be able to help, because if no one ever corrects you than you'll never learn, but I want to do it tactfully and respectfully.

I have been with my boyfriend for a fair few years now and were both very happy but someone has always been at the back of my mind to be honest, my boyfriend doesnt know about him.

Before I met my boyfriend I had a 'friend' that I had met theough work, but in all honesty he was more than a just friend. He was the first person I ever trusted enough to come out to, we loved spending time together and talking to eachother, we went out for drinks with eachother, I could just be my complete self with him, it fealt like there was always a little spark and yes we did share the bed and do a few things together but after all this he wasnt keen on persueing a relationship, mainly because I wasnt out (I believe) but I did really want to persue more with him and I believe that if he was up for it I would have forced myself to come out to my family.

Anyway skip forward and in a nutshell I found a guy who became my boyfriend and I finally came out to my family. I really loved my new boyfriend (who I am still with) so as a result of this I wanted to protect my relationship at all costs this was my chance for happiness! Selfishly I pushed aside my good friend from my life, he took a real interest in my boyfriend and wanted to meet him, I saw him as a threat so shrugged him off. I believe that I did this not only to protect my new relationship but also to attempt to fall out of love with my previous 'friend' and I believed that distancing myself was the only way.

Skip forward over 4 years and I have fealt increasing guilt for how I treated my friend and sometimes I think that I still even love him, which is crazy I know but I dont think I have ever fealt such butterflies in my stomach by simply spending time with someone before! About a year ago he organised drinks with me and a group of ex work colleagues we didnt really talk, but at one point I couldnt help but give him prolongued eye contact (almost as a way of telepathically letting him know I still love him) I then went to the toilets and he followed me not long after, I think he expected me to open my heart out to him which I wanted to do but I completely panicked and said stupid small talk then rushed out. I almost feel like theres unfinished business and I want to talk to him again and atleast explain myself. 


BUT 1. he now has a boyfriend as well which doesnt make it easy 2. The last time I saw him was over a year ago 3. I am worried how he would react if I opened my heart up to him (can it effect my relationship)

Its eating away at me to be honest, I cant tell my boyfriend about this after nearly 4 years!

Ask me any questions as well!

My dad does not like to be told what to do, he gets super annoyed if anyone tells him what to do. But this includes just doing simple stuff like helping my mum paint or fix the gate in our garden. I’m annoyed because I also have an uncle with MS meaning he can’t walk yet he seems to be the most positive guy I know. He seems like he does more stuff with his family and is more out going even with a bigger problem. So all my dad does is watch tv, go on Facebook, eat and work occasionally.

24,"Hello,

Recently my father's 2003 1500 Avalanche has basically blown its engine, he then bought a new truck and has been procrastinating on sending the old truck to the junk yard due to having the truck since day one and has put 300,000 miles on it.

I have looked up the engine and have a seller that would be able to give me the same engine for 450$ with the transmission and the rolling shell of a Tahoe which I am guessing I could sell to the junkyard for scrap. I would then put this new engine into the truck and thrash it around at the sand dunes or local ORV park nearby.

My question is, is there any way to get very temporary and inexpensive plates to be able to drive to these locations (45 minutes max to get there)? Or are there any special plates I can get for these specific situations?

Thanks for any advice

Note: Please do not suggest buying another truck, I am only considering this type of off-road fun vehicle because the truck has almost brand new aggressive tread tires on it and the transmission that is currently in it has been rebuilt and should last a while yet",02Apr2020,1

27,"Hello, I'm 25(m) years old and I just started my first relationship in Febuary.

Rather then drown you guys in back story, I'm going to make this tldr as possible.

I haven't been with 26(f) for very long, but we decided to spend quarantine half at my house, half at hers. But my roommate's decided to pull a really dumb move, and invited a hospital nurse over to my house because she was ""depressed"". I wasn't home for deciding this, and had no say in it. Well my SO didn't agree with it, and neither did I, so we decided to stay at her house.

The problem is her mood swings are crazy, she can't sleep, and everything I do seems to bug her. and I'm very much used to spending my time alone, so shes starting to drive me nuts, so I kind of want to go back to my house for awhile (it's been a week since the nurse has been there, and my roommate with asthma seems to be fine, no symptoms)

But I know my SO is going to be very depressed if I decide to go home for awhile, and I know she won't want me to come back due to the nurse situation. (I don't blame her) but I really feel like I can't take much more of this.

So I'm asking reddit, what should I do? Go home and look after my own mental state, or stay here and have us both be miserable and getting on each others nerves.

TL;DR My SO and I have been fighting at her house, I want to go back to my house, but because of quatine she doesn't want me to come back, but idk if I can take much more fighting.",02Apr2020,1

29,"Hi! Before I start, I know none of us know what his true intentions were except for him and unless I ask. I just wanted to know what you guys think.

We’ve been friends for 3 years. We met my freshman year of college and it was obvious he wanted to get to know me from the beginning. Long story short he became my first kiss, later got mad at him because he got hickies from another girl, he apologized, I initiated the talk about what his intentions were and he said he didn’t want a relationship at the time. We left off on good terms and remained good friends. Sophomore year happened, he made the effort to hangout here and there but we never hooked up or anything.

Summer going into this school year was when things started to change. We began to snap a lot and he tagged me in a lot of things on Facebook. When school started, he immediately asked to hang out with him which then became a consistent thing throughout the school year. He would always pay for my coffee, always try to hold my hand, cook for me (specifically bought me steak cause I asked for it), bought wine, asked to go to the city and FaceTime over winter break. We were at 2 parties together and he would always stay by my side and try to get with me which was unusual because the past 2 years he would be hooking up with other girls. One of those parties I was dancing pretty close with another guy and I knew he was mad but just didn’t say anything. He remembered my birthday and bought a bottle to my party after I jokingly asked for one too. I got kinda touchy with some of his friends cause I was so drunk and one of his friends the next day told me he looked stressed when I did that. Anyways, because of the coronavirus, our classes got moved to online. He asked to hang out with me the last day of college because he said “this might be the last time I see your face.” Once again, he pays for my coffee and holds my hand. We then go back to my room and we cuddle for a little bit. Finally he asks if I wanted him to kiss me and I say no. He asks why and I said I’m really nervous and bad at this stuff (I have no experience lmao). He ensures me that it’s fine but I say only on the cheek. So he basically kisses me cheek and goes for my neck and we then cuddle for 2 hours. Later that same night, I go to the bar with friends and I get a text from him saying he’s coming. I dance with my guy friends and then I see him hooking up with another girl.

I’m confused; did he just put all this effort throughout the year to just hookup with me? Or was he actually trying for a relationship? He has never had a girlfriend before if that makes a difference. What do you think? Do you think he thinks about this too?",02Apr2020,1

So I finally cut my “friend” off and things have been... difficult. I still have nightmares and unwanted memories of some of the shit that went down between us, I’m having trouble trusting the men in my life, and there’s not a day that goes by that I don’t think about everything that happened both during and after our relationship. 

I finally told my mom and my best friend what happened, and they’ve been really supportive, so that helps a little, but I can’t help feeling like I’m overreacting (so many people have been through worse, so in a way I’m lucky) and like it’s my own fault. For one thing, there were a ridiculous amount of red flags that I just ignored—I guess because I liked the attention? Like, multiple people pointed out how clingy, weird, and obsessed with me he was, but I just wouldn’t listen. I tried to express my frustration with this to my friend and she basically just said “I told you so” which hurt like hell, mostly because I can’t say it isn’t true. 

I also found out that he sexually harassed a sixteen year old girl we used to work with, to the point that she actually stopped coming into work because he freaked her out so much. And I just feel so stupid for not having seen it. I feel like I could have done something to stop it if I had only known. 

Because of all this, I can’t stand being sober anymore. Almost every day, I have to drink or get high in order to stop thinking about him. I even started using cough syrup to get high when I can’t get my hands on anything else. I’ve never been a drug user before, aside from marijuana, and I’m scared of getting hooked, because addiction runs in my family, but it’s hard to control myself when being sober just means obsessing over what happened, if I could have prevented it, if it was my fault... etc. 

Am I being overdramatic? Has anyone been through anything similar, and if so what helped you? (Sorry for the long post, I’m just tired of annoying my mom with all this bullshit)",02Apr2020,1

Every year around this time I feel a strong desire to have kids, as I get older it gets worse, I'm only 23(F) and I've only been with my partner for just about a year now.

37,"So i’m [18f] a college student who’s already been doing classes online for this semester and I live at home with my parents. I love online courses cause i can do the work sort of at my own pace, for example if an assignment is due at 11:59 pm i have the whole day to do it. I’m in my second semester now and it’s gotten a little bit more stressful because the classes are getting more difficult obviously and i had 8 and 12 week classes so it was more work at once.

Registration for summer classes is coming up though and my parents were asking me if i was going to register for 4 classes again. I replied to them with “i’m not sure yet, i might want to take a break this summer and take classes again in fall because i can do that.” Then my parents got mad at me saying i need to finish school as fast as possible and that if i don’t do it they won’t pay for my classes ($1,300 approximately per semester). Then i said that “i’m still going to graduate but if i don’t want to take classes over summer that’s not a big deal.” Then my dad says “it’s better than you sitting around at home on your ass doing nothing.” 

They assume i don’t do any work because i’m in my room with the door closed.... Door is closed because i want privacy and want to focus on my work without them barging in every 5 minutes. 

Anyways, my dad threatened not to pay for my classes anymore, like if it was a lot of money which it isn’t and they have tons of money to spare. So i said “fine don’t pay if you don’t want to i’ll just take out loans like other college students.” Then he yelled again saying “yeah yeah right cause you know everything. you went to college.” 

Now that last sentence is exactly my point for posting on here. My parents whole argument every time i don’t do what they want when it comes to MY schooling is “you think you know everything.” I’m pretty sure that i know how college works since i’m currently in college and working towards getting my degree. 

Some background on my dads “college” experience. He only went for 2 semesters and then dropped out. So yes he definitely knows what it takes to graduate college, be cause he definitely graduated (sarcasm). 
For my moms college experience she only went for 3 semesters and also didn’t graduate.

My point is they keep telling me how to do college and how to be successful but they didn’t even graduate so how are they supposed to know a right way. 
When i try to fight for my case and tell them that i’m still on track to graduate and that if it takes me longer than the stigma of 4 years, it’s okay. They call me disrespectful and say i’m talking back.

I don’t know but if i was a parent i would want my child to take their time on the classes to ensure they would understand the material and pass them instead of fail and make me lose money. 

I just don’t know what to do with them. I have to listen to what they want and stress myself out constantly to please them or they’ll hate me literally and won’t support me anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi everyone. This is sort of an urgent matter because this is happening right now and I have no idea what to do and I don't want to talk to people I know or people he knows about this.

My boyfriend of a few years was depressed about a year ago. It was bad, but it seemed to be situational because of the stuff he was going through at the time. I was worried about him, but I knew he wouldn't do anything bad. He just slept a lot and didn't want to talk much. I could understand where he was coming from, having mental health issues myself from past trauma and a depressed sister. A few months went by and he was doing better. He found new purpose in life after failing some important life endeavors and seemed to be good. We've been super happy and such. Well now this whole virus thing is around. We don't get to see each other. He's all alone without friends or family or me where he is right now. He told me he wanted to get a gun now. I was asking why and he said he had already taken all the classes and such and done practice a while back and wanted to just have one now. I chalked it up to being worried about the government or something somewhat reasonable (depending on who you are) I guess. Since other people are doing the same right now. Maybe reactionary. But he just told me last night he was really sad. Okay so I'm getting worried maybe he's feeling depressed again. I tried talking to him about why but feel asleep unfortunately. Today he didn't want to talk. I asked why and he just said ""just don't"". He posted to his facebook a few hours ago ""f\*ckin over it\*. I asked what that was about and then noticed he HAD replied to me earlier saying ""just feel like giving up on everything"". Now I said ""what is going on?"" and he hasn't replied. I'm really scared now knowing he has a gun in his possession. It never seemed like something he would do, I still don't know if he would. But I don't want to outright ask him for fear it could drive him to that. I'm just scared because I see myself marrying him and we've been trying to live together which I get is now halted and probably causing some of that sadness. But how do I approach this situation? I don't want to Baker act him or something, but I'm really scared. Do I just ask him if he's thinking about ending his life? I've had a friend try to before and I thought she was dead and the awful pain it caused was the worst I've ever felt in my life.

1. Let time do its work and hope the conflict resolves itself. (Unlikely)
2. Remove one of them from their position. (It would be a great pain in losing either of them as they carry equal levels of responsibility and importance to the community. Losing either would bring equal loss.
3. Punish both of them. (I have no idea how I will do this, this is just a thought and I probably won't go through with this.)
4. Continue to act as a 3rd person in their petty fights. (What I'm doing now, not showing any progress.)

47,"Okay, a little back story first.

First off, my dad is a republican. Not that there’s anything wrong with that it’s just important to the story. When I was younger and up until this whole virus thing my dad has always seemed to believed in equality and believed that everyone should be treated the same no matter what they look like or what they believe in. He’s told me this my whole life, I’m 17 currently. They’re have been some questionable things he has said and supported but I do not believe he meant it in a raciest way. He has never said anything racist to anyone’s face or anything like that. No blatant sign of benign a racist. 

My dad loves Fox News. It is one of the only things he watches on TV. It’s not the only news station he watches, some times CNN or ABC, but mostly Fox. He is  very easily persuaded by what is said by the hosts and quests on there. For example, he hated the whole idea of legalizing weed and weed products until they talked about CBD oil on Fox and now he’s all for it. Literally changed overnight. My dad is also a Trump supporter. He doesn’t love him, but he likes that he is president and back him 85-90% of the time. Not that there’s a problem with that, I just want to give as clear of a picture as I can. 

Ever since this virus, I’ve gotten worried. He’s taking it seriously and not being dumb in what he does. But not in what he says. Just recently he said that, and I quote “Chinese people lie and deceive, it’s in their nature.” Also that, “They created the virus and brought it over here on purpose.” Along with other things that are not as bad, but sound sketchy.

Do you think that he’s just scared and not thinking fully? Should I talk to him about it? I really don’t know what to do. And I honestly don’t know if I can bare with my dad being a racist.

50,"Right now I'm 13 and in seventh grade. I've got a handful of friends and very good grades. I have an A in every class but science. I'm one of, if not the, top student in my English class and I have a passion for economics, political science, ontology, and philosophy. However, I have a deep, deep secret that I haven't told anyone.

I'm a boy, but I love girly things: Makeup, unicorns, glitter, cupcakes, shopping, cooking, pink, etc. I have an overwhelming desire to wear leggings, high heels, makeup, skirts, denim shorts, dresses, pantyhose, overalls, tutus, thigh high stockings, Vans, skinny jeans, etc. But my hometown is really Conservative, so Conservative that I get harassed for being Jewish, so I can't act on these desires.

Seeing girls at my school freely wearing these clothes has nearly driven me to tears on too many occasions to count. I can't tell you how many times I've had to ""use the bathroom"" so I don't embarrass myself by sobbing in class over a girl's pantyhose. Hiding these desires genuinely makes me want to shoot myself.

like I said, I live in the darkest depths of Conservative rural America, so I can't give in to my desires. So I've constructed a plan to leave this shitty town:

1. Once I graduate high school, I'm planning on getting a job at a local newspaper, working there for 3 years.
2. I'll then move on to a statewide newspaper. I'll work there for 3 years, like the local newspaper.
3. After 3 years at the statewide newspaper, I'll move on to MSNBC, where I'll be unbiased, to create a contrast between myself and the Left-leaning MSNBC (that's not a condemnation, I myself am very Liberal)
4. Then, after 3 years at MSNBC, I'll leave MSNBC and move to Chicago, where I hope to live, and start my own news company, both making myself wealthy and free to be who I am.

Suppressing my desires to such this degree has also made me a horrible person. Me and my friend Peyton (boy, not girl) play obnoxious memes in the halls to annoy people. I get in fights, throw paper airplanes, insult teachers, shout in the middle of class, write nonsense on the white board while the teacher is out, etc. and I do it all to hide my true self, and to overwhelm my sweet, soft, and vivacious inner-self with a loud, brash, cycnical pessimist so I feel less miserable.

But until then I'll be fucking miserable. Because of this quarantine I can't spend time with my friends, leaving me stuck watching Family Guy, American Dad, and Beavis and Butthead in my underwear, in my room, gorging myself on potato chips and pretzels. I'm often in bed all day. I have fucking eye bags and am miserable all the time. My brother Adam collects guns and I really want to take one of his guns and shoot myself in the mouth to end my misery. If things go according to plan, I'll be free to be myself in 14 years or so, but what if things don't go according to plan?

What if I become successful but forget what I want in the process? What if I lose all motivation and become another office worker? What if the pain of suppressing my desires causes me to die or go insane before I get what I want?",02Apr2020,1

He asked where he went wrong in raising me. 
I told him he had no right to be mad at me for the choices I decided to make. He continued to belittle me. 

Upset, I called my mom because I had nobody else to talk to. My mom is more understanding than my father, so I was so positive that she’d at least LISTEN to me. 
She didn’t, and continued to tell me how disappointed she was in me.

I need advice. I’m in a good mental state, but if this continues, I don’t know how long I can take constant belittling from BOTH my parents. 

How can I ignore them? How could I make them understand and respect my choices? How can I prevent myself from falling back into depression? 

Please, any advice will help, from both Christians and non believers. I feel so horribly alone.",02Apr2020,1
58,"So, I've written about my girlfriend having confidence issues before, but I didn't know why as she never mentioned anything about being body shamed. Well, it turns out that she was bullied for the way she looked in high school. I'm not sure why she was bullied exactly or for how long as I didn't wanna go into too much detail because she said she doesn't think about it much anymore. But the thing is that it clearly affects the way she sees herself every time she looks in the mirror. Now I realise that the best way for her to deal with this would be to see a therapist but as we're both only 16 (I'm turning 17 this month), I don't think that's a viable option. I could try and see if she could talk to someone about it in college once it opens again but I'm not sure she would wanna do that. I keep reassuring her that there's nothing wrong with her and compliment her regularly but it hasn't really changed anything yet. I wish there was something else I could do to help.

However, I need some help in dealing with this myself, as every time I think about what could possibly have happened to her in most likely the past 5 years, my heart just breaks for her. I just wish i could be there in person to try to make her feel better about herself and have someone to talk to even if I'm not qualified. However, we can't be in private for several reasons: partly because of everything that's going on right now and partly because the house I live in isn't suitable as I sleep in the same room as my sister. As to why we can't be at her house... well she hasn't told her parents about us. So I need help in trying to get rid of this heart wrenching feeling that I have every time I think about it.

I got 27 on Asvab and study for a week then got a 50 on it. I choose my job and went to MEPS just like I said in beginning getting temporary Dq. Now I been having second thoughts about it.

61,"Hello there. A few weeks ago, I (17 F) went to see a nutritionist since I’m chubby and I want to lose weight. I’m on the overweight side of the scale. 
Long story short, he said he’d send me a diet made just for me. I received the diet a few hours later after our appointment and I was shocked! The portions (to me, at least) are little. I tried entering to the diet slowly since last week, by eating some of the foods he recommended. Since this Monday, I’ve been following the diet exactly like it is. The thing is, my head hurts A LOT. Sometimes I feel like I’m going to faint. My mom today bought junk food and I wanted to cry over how bad I wanted to eat the food, but I couldn’t. He also recommended excercise, and I try to do housework, since I’m afraid of actually fainting while working out. 
I keep tracking the food I eat on LoseIt, and it stresses me out whenever I go over the limit of my daily caloric intake. Sometimes I want to eat (a fruit, for example) and I remind myself that I can’t, since that would mean I’m not following the diet correctly. I even count the hours until my next meal. I try to get myself full by drinking water, but I still feel hungry, no matter what. What should I do?",02Apr2020,1
62,"Sorry this is kind of long. I wasn’t sure which subreddit this belonged on, but this seemed like the most appropriate one. Also, trigger warning for a brief mention of a sexual assault.
I (f16) have a younger sister (f14). Although I know our parents love both of us very much, they have always had higher expectations for me than they have for her. Throughout elementary and middle school, my grades were always much higher than hers. Probably because of this, and because I am their oldest child, my parents have held me to a higher standard. I am not allowed to get any grades lower than an A, although my sister is. My parents have gone so far as to tell both of us my future is likely brighter than hers. I can only imagine what that has done to her self esteem. I definitely think our parents should treat us more equally, not only for her sake, but also for mine. I feel constantly stressed from all the pressure my parents put on me.
We did not have a gifted program at my elementary and middle school, so my parents had me tested for my high school’s gifted program freshman year, and I got in with an IQ score of 129 (the lowest acceptable score in my school district is 128).
I got straight A+s freshman year. Over the summer, I was sexually assaulted by someone who I considered to be a good friend. I took a 0-7 hour schedule in the fall semester, with all advanced core classes and AP Euro. Juggling these classes with marching band, orchestra, my school choir, the traveling choir I’m a part of outside of school, and coming to terms with what happened to me over the summer proved to be too much for me to handle and I ended the semester with a B in not one, not two, but three classes. My parents were extremely disappointed.
Meanwhile, my sister has maintained straight As during her freshman year of high school. My parents had her tested for the gifted program, not thinking she would get in. Not even she thought she would get in. However, she did, with an IQ of 130. My younger sister, who has been treated as stupid by our parents her entire life, is smarter than me.
My sister is extremely excited, and I am very happy for her, but I would be lying if I said this does not hurt my self esteem. Besides being an extremely successful volleyball player, my sister is gorgeous (she’s recently started to get into modeling) and popular. My entire identity has always revolved around my intelligence, and I don’t know how to cope with the increasingly obvious fact that I am not that smart. Is there anything that can help me come to terms with this more easily?",02Apr2020,1
63," Dear Redditors, my girlfriend (20F) has recently moved to Australia for half a year because of her studies. This was however, cut short because of COVID-19. Because this was our first big time apart (we both live in Europe) I told her to take her plushie (toy) dog that she had since her birth, to at least have some home with her all the way across the world.

During her trip, her bags were searched multiple times at airport customs, and when she finally landed in Australia, she realised that she had lost the plushie dog. We have called all the airports where she had transfers or had been through customs, at least 3 times, but they couldn't help us..

Ever since this moment she has been devastated, since this toy had a the biggest emotional value to her as she had it since birth. I know that no other toy dog would ever replace the original, but that does not make me stop trying to find the closest version to her original plushie dog that I can possibly find. And I was hoping you could help me.

In the comments I will include a picture of the plushie dog, and if you know or have ever seen a retailer which sells this exact plushie dog, please contact me. I do not care about where in the world this is, I gladly pay for shipping if only there is a way to find a replacement.

Thank you kindly.

Looking for some advice - or 'what would you do' adult to adult.  I live in a moderately wealthy residential neighborhood.  The houses on my street range from 800k to 1.2M usd.  I live in a house with my wife and three elementary shcool children.  The majority of the families on my street are setup this way.  My neighbor has seven or eight adults (it changes daily) living at their house and parks upwards of 14 cars on the street and his driveway.  The hoa has some rules against overcrowding but are not well defined.  They have a hard rule, however, on no parking in front of mailboxes, and state cars will be towed immediately (although they recommend first talking to the neighbor).  The people from this house park in front of four other houses and block their mailboxes.  For the past two weeks, I've been receiving 'mailbox blocked' pick up your mail at the post office letters from the post man (he's gotten fed up with their parking).  I have posted a polite note on the car(s) that park in front of my mailbox, however, they continue to do so.   I have also gone to their door and they seemingly refuse to answer the door.  My wife believes they will take physical action against our  family if I tow their car.  Although the owner seems well educated and well off, the other adults living at the house hold are overtly trashy and scare my wife (walk around outside in boxer shorts, have very angry dogs that would attack if off leash, throw trash all over the yard for their maids to pick up).  Any advice from the Reddit community would be much appreciated.",02Apr2020,1

I live in Belgium so all the cheese is made from a cow not like America where it is made in a factory. All the cheese has been tested for the good bacteria and it's been bought in expensive shops.

77,"So, I've decided to post it here because it has giving me anxiety and it's been ruining my routine and I'm feeling a bit bad. Let me explain:

A couple days ago my friends and I decided to play RPG via Discord, because of the quarentene. They decided to choose a different system which they weren't used to play, but chosen it because I knew about the lore and I'm good with english (not my mother tongue). This didn't stressed me at all, because I've been meaning to play it with them. Let's call them GM, Player A and Player B.

One of my friends would narrate the story (GM) and he was reading about the rules of the game while I helped the other two players complete their character sheet's.

I usually create and edit the discord servers, adding bots and roles. Not only the discord, but in anything. This time wasn't different.

So I was trying to explain to them the classes and suddenly the GM started talking about it, but the was explaining it wrong to player A and I understood that he was not following up, so I asked to the GM to stop. ""Your talking shit, mate. Your mixing the classes."" But he kept talking, so I muted him and said ""bro, let me explain, please"". And everything goes as usual.

Another time this happens, but this time Player B jumped ahead and began to talk about another part of the game. Player A was having a hard time following up to everything and so I asked him to stop, he didn't, I muted him.

The second I muted player B, he quit the server. We tried to call him, but he got offline on everything. I explained to player A how to complete the character sheet and I got offline because I had to help my mom. We would play the next day. I tried to talk to player B after midnight, as we've always done, but he didn't answer me, just saw the messages

Next day comes up, player A and GM enter the call and we talk a bit, but player B doesn't answer. Suddenly he joins the room, but since he left before I unmute him the day before, he was still muted. I didn't noticed, because I was reading the book and talking to player A, so the GM tells me to unmute player B. When I put my mouse over him, he exits the server for real and sends my a message ""unmute my dick, you asshole"". So I explained to him what happened and he said ""I'll just play with you when you change your conduct"". I answer him ""ok"" and asked the GM if he still wanted to play. He said ""yeah, player B will calm up and ask to join, as usual. So we played a bit, but I had to get out.

Just before it, the GM tried to do something with the game and player A and I protested and said he were supposed to have read the rules, he got mad and left after awhile. Player A and I tried to understand how the rules worked, since nobody knew.

I spent the night reading about the rules and asking on reddit, when I finally understood it I talked on our group. ""Player A and GM, I have figured out how the rules work, tell me when we can have a call for me to explain to you"". Then player B left the group and the other friends didn't answer my message. That same day, player B removed me from his own Discord Server, in which we played Minecraft and other things. That day, neither GM nor player A could play RPG because they both were busy, but all of them were online on Discord. I don't know if theres a correlation or anything.

It happened some days ago and I'm having anxiety about it. I don't believe I've done something wrong, since I tried to help both players and the GM. I'm not mad at Player B, because we have a good friendship, but it seems overreacting. Should I talk to him? Or to GM and Player A? 

It's not the first time Player B closes completely to someone - it never happened to me. In fact, he's done it to both my other friends. He dislikes a bit player A aswell and he was really, really mad because he couldn't play with me a game (I was having problems creating a server).

So,  am I really wrong in this situation? I don't really know...

Also, while I was writing this, he removed me from every WhatsApp group of his I was. And blocked me.",02Apr2020,1
78,"A little context. My wife and I moved to Wisconsin about 3 years for a good Job, and a better life. So far I feel it has been going well. We just bought our first house home, and have our first baby in just over a month. We have both worked really hard to get were we are. We don't live in a big super wealth house or anything like. But what we have is nice and okay with us.

Here's where the trouble starts. My in-laws have helped us out a lot of the years, more then I would have liked them too. My father in-law (FIW) is an alcoholic kind of a bad one, and my Mother In-law (MIW) doesn't speak English very well. We have been saving our money bit by bit in order to find a home. A small bit a time, while living in a very small apartment. We were looking at house but never really serious about it, that was until the baby. We started looked for house in a price range that worked for us. Nothing super nice kind of fixer uppers, but nothing that would makes us go broke.

My wife told her parents about us looking, and they tried to talk us out of it at first. Saying things like ""You can't afford it"", ""It's to much work"", ""You don't know what you are doing."" etc. They wanted us to keep living in apartments and never buy a house. I want to give my family a home that is what I want. Still trying to talk us out of it. They offered to put up $50,000 as a down payment, to pay on the house but wanted us to wait. While they tried to talk us out of get a house. I didn't want the money and told my wife many times I didn't want anyone's help with this. I learn along time ago that there is no such thing as a free gift. After while of my MIW bugging my wife about it, and her bugging me. I gave in and said okay. Every time we looked at a house her my parents told us not to get it. They wanted us to get the house they wanted. So at least we found a house they were okay with, and we bought it. They put down the money and we took out the how loan.

We started getting ready to move in, but here mom and dad wanted to come up and help us. My wife and I stayed in our apartment and slowly started moving in. Her parents stayed in our house. They went trough the house fixing things I never asked them to and cleaning. Her dad was only going to stay for a few days but COVID-19 turned that into a few weeks. Finally we got all moved into the house and that is went it all started. They started telling us what to do, bossing us around and complaining about things we owed. We talked about making so upgrades to the house later on. They told us ""You don't need to do that"" or ""That is dumb"". I was planning to change the tires on my Truck, but her dad went and did it without asking me. I wanted to pay for it on my own, but they would not leave me alone about them paying for it. After about a week, it no long felt like the house was ours but theirs. Then they went onto buying food and stocking the house up. Like I said I never asked for it, and didn't want it.

My In-laws then start making remarks about the fact I still have to work with the pandemic going on. (I can say where I work, but I have a Degree in Microbiology; so I kind of have to work) They also started got upset about us going my wife's appointments with her OBGYN.

The boiling point finally comes when my FIW got drunk. I get home from work and decide that I need to clean the gutters out. My MIW wants to help so she does, my FIW decide he is going to set in the yard drunk while we work. He starts cussing and yell about stupid things, making my wife very upset, and she tells him to go inside. So he does, but once he gets inside he start yelling at her telling her to do this and do that. This is where I start to get upset, don't yell at my pregnant wife or act like you are going to hit her. I don't think he would hit her, but I don't want to take the chance. (If he did hit her I would be ask for a different kind of help). We finished cleaning out the gutters and raking the yard. I am a little tired and just want to set down. He then blows up and start storming around the house shouting ""I am fucking leaving they don't appreciate anything we do for them."" He start slamming door taking stuff out to his car. Telling his wife ""Lets Go!""

I keep my calm for as long as I can. He slams the front door and it shakes the house, and I lose it. At the top of my lungs I cuss him out. I tell he well not slam doors in my house. He then starts to mouth off to me. I just wanted him out of my house so bad at that point, but I didn't want him driving all the way back home, which is 15 hours away, drunk. I gave him a choose of going to bed or going to jail. He then get up in my face and starts to mouthing off at me again. I grab him and trow him on to the bed in the spare room. I was boiling mad, even my wife knew it. It takes a lot to get me upside, I don't have an anger problem. However when I am mad you know it. The next day he leaves my MIW stays behind that was 4 days ago. Once i had head back off to work my MIW starts bad mouth me to my wife. Telling her I had no right to cuss him out, and that she is no longer their daughter. My wife heard my FIW make threats on my life, over the phone, when he comes to get my MIW tomorrow. My wife has asked me not to call the cops, so I am not. But I do have away to defend myself. That is not the problem.

I feel really bad about what has happened and a little guilty. Before you say I need to have a set down talk with them about his drinking or get he some help. The man doesn't want help, and they will not reason they never have and never well. In their eyes they as always right, and self centered. Trust me we have tried it's doesn't work. We were even going give our little his name. That has now changed my wife choose to do that not me. So what should I do guys, was I in the wrong, and should I feel guilty.",02Apr2020,1

80,"Hey reddit. I created this account because my life is breaking apart and I need to rant. A bit of background: I (20F), my two sisters (19F S1, 12F S2) and brother (3M) lost our mum 3 (almost 4) years ago. It was a horrible time and everyone was a mess. My dad’s side of the family have had quite a few problems and are (for lack of a better word) nosey and get involved with other people’s problems.

Now on to the main event. About a year ago my dad (50M) decided to remarry. He talked about how we would come first and that our opinions mattered, but even though neither me nor S1 liked his new wife they got married anyway. Now I’ll admit that I wasn’t warm and welcoming, but I wasn’t rude. I mostly camped out in my room and for the first few months she only came on the weekends. That’s when the first incident happened. This women insisted that my brother call her mum and even said that she was his mum and my dad didn’t say a word against her, but S1 wouldn’t allow it so she finally relented and decided on something else (This something else happened to be mum is a different language). However during this time she left us without saying a word to me or my siblings. She was gone a few weeks. After this it was decided that she would be staying with us full time. She ran away once more about one month down the line and even during her time with us she didn’t contribute at all to the house (she had quit her job and moved quite far).

After this I just ignored her, but S1 was still courteous and the other two are still too young to know any different. At about October/November she left once again, but this time she was gone about a month. At this point I was pissed off. I’ll be honest and say I had a lot of nasty thoughts at this time (Even now I am) about everything. We finally sat down and talked about everything just before my 20th birthday and we worked something out. Me and my siblings would try to be nicer and we agreed that whilst it wouldn’t be immediate we would try to do more family oriented things. At this point I still hated her. There was a lot of tension in the house at this point and my depression was getting worse. I’ll say this now, but before this no one in my family knew just how screwed I was in the head (I haven’t bee diagnosed yet because my mum didn’t want those labels on me, but I think I might suffer from ADHD, depression, anxiety and might be a bit of a sociopath) and even now I think my dad is underestimating my problems. It also doesn’t help that I am terrified of talking to people in fear of being judged.

So my birthday rolls around and we invite people from both my late mum’s side and my dad’s side of the family to our house for cake. My mum’s side of the family don’t exactly like the step mother, but they hid their feelings and were nice to her the entire time. After the cake me, my siblings and mum’s family had decided to go out for an evening meal. Step mum was not invited and my dad had been told this but still invited her. I refused to have her there and my dad decided that he wouldn’t attend my birthday party if she wasn’t going. He went with us after S1 kicked him out of her room and yelled at him. That night she had a hissy fit and left the house again. This time she didn’t come back and we all decided that she was better off not coming back to the house. At this point my mental health was at its worse.

It’s been about three months and our relationship with my dad and my mental health has steadily improved, but this broke down yet again yesterday. My dad told us all to sit down and basically what we were told was either the step mum move back in or my dad would buy a different house and live with her there. I basically blew up at him and said that if he did this I wouldn’t forgive him and that if she could act so petty about my birthday then what would happen when I get married and don’t invite her. Would she run away again? What would my dad do? My dad said ‘Well I don’t know. I guess I have to go’. I mean what the hell? How could you say that? I was furious and cried so much because I could feel all the dark thoughts coming back. I feel as though the only reason he asked us was so solidify a decision he has already made.

Hell an aunt from my dad’s side went through S1’s phone and took photos of her messages and showed them to other people and my dad didn’t do anything.

81,"So i have these 2 childhood friends and we grew up playing games together. The one will really only play League (more on it later). Hes doesn't touch anything but his PC unless our other friend is on. The other only plays on ps4 but hardly plays any thing multiplayer or fun anymore. 

PC friend: he said (while talking about Warzone) ""league is more fun"". I pointed out we just spent the last 20 minutes in a game that was clearly over and he was tilted in. Which would have been about 4 warzone matches for us. He replied, ""it's not about the time"". I msorry but what If i have the option to spend 20 minutes in a game i cant win and he's unhappy or playing 4 games that could be over in 5 minutes with us losing but also have the option of us maybe winning I would pick that latter. 

My other friend finds Warzone boring because we suck and lose. I would rather lose games (that are short and not a fucking 20+ min time commitment to lose) with friends and enjoy it. I asked if he wanted to play Apex Legends (we were quite good at it ) he replied, its boring. 

PC guy bitches every time we end up playing COD because he has a 10+gb download to do (even when its been out multiple days and i tell him about it). Like what's so hard about spending 3 minutes to turn on your PlayStation start the download and then put your ps4 in rest mode.

83,"Context: I am a 13-year-old FtM transgender with, according to my therapist, symptoms of both anxiety and depression. I have a lot of crap bottled up and I have accustomed myself to seeming normal and happy and hiding behind laziness and personas. I don't talk about myself because it's terrifying when I do, even writing this much I had to stop because I started crying.

I've always hated therapy, the first time around I developed suicidal thoughts because it made me feel so wrong and broken and toxic. The second time around with a different therapist was the same way and it's seeming like this time around with yet another therapist isn't any different. I get that it's supposed to help me but when I actively have anxiety attacks and mental breakdowns on Wednesdays because I have therapy on Thursdays I think it's doing just the opposite, it's even worse because I don't have time to recover between sessions because it's every week. 

I desperately want to stop, I'd sooner jump off a bridge than keep letting a complete stranger rip at load-bearing neuroses and tear away the paperclips and glue I've been holding myself together with. The only way I can think to explain this is it's like I'm stranded in an ocean with no land in sight and I'm treading water, sometimes the water is rough and storms come and sometimes it's calm and quiet, coping mechanisms I've created are like a life preserver. Therapy is like someone has come along and is handing me all these things that are supposed to be helpful but it's just weighing me down and they're trying to rip my life preserver away from me. I'm barely keeping myself afloat this way in the calm water and once a storm comes I'm going to drown.

I can't stop, though, because drowning seems quick and painless compared to telling my parents all of this and they're the ones paying for it so I can't just stop. They put me back into therapy when I came out as transgender, that's all they think is wrong with me and I can't tell them that there's so much more because a lot of it is caused by them and I don't have anywhere to go to get away from them if they find out.

Hello,

I'm  currently a junior in college and I'm working towards declaring a  major. I was allowed an appeal to declare a major in which I had to  receive a 3.0 in all my classes and then I would be allowed to declare  the major.  This class all courses went to Pass/No Pass, so now the  department is forcing me to get a 3.0 in the fall semester of my senior  year.

My boyfriend of 1 month is staying with me for the virus. His mom kicked him out because she has a very low immune system (and is a shitty mom) and because I was working up until today she thinks I’m infected and won’t let him come home. So, he has no where to go but here. And I am NOT taking this well. 

We’re trying to have space. I’ll sit in my living room while he’s in my room and vise versa. But the thought that I can never be in my apartment alone is killing me. I sat in my bathroom and cried. And he feels terrible. He’s going to talk to his mom soon about us isolating for 2 weeks then him coming home but good god I’m not taking this well. I loved coming home from class and it being silent. I could poop in my own bathroom and not be self conscious. I could do whatever I wanted whenever I wanted. 

I do love him. He’s so sweet and kind and he didn’t ask for any of this but neither did I. I really need some help with coping with this. This just proves to me I’m not ready to live with anyone any time soon. I’m glad I figured that out now but I need help for the time being. 

Since I am stressed out by stomach has been in knots and I am very irritable. We’re only a month in and we should be in the honeymoon period right now. But we are not. We argue and bicker and it’s all my fault. I just need some coping mechanisms or something.

He’s “accepted” that I broke up with him but keeps harassing me and demanding answers from me. He keeps asking the same questions like, “was the sex good?” And “was I your favorite sex?” Just nasty shit like that. I’ve been ignoring him but it just makes him more and more angry. I block him, he finds a new way to contact me. And if you read through the hundreds of messages, you can continually see his emotions go from sad and begging me for these answers, to completely enraged calling me the worst names, and threatening me. I don’t even reply, unless it’s with a “stop contacting me” and he still keeps saying if I don’t answer his questions then he will message my elderly relatives. He didn’t say what exactly he would say, I didn’t ask I just told him to leave me alone, but I’m assuming his plan is to tell them that I am a liar and cheater who is not to be trusted.

The more I stand my ground, the more angry it makes him, and the more erratic he acts. He’s told me himself that he can’t control his emotions and that he very well could hurt me one day. And he is vaguely threatening me with things like “karma will get you” and what not. And then will say stuff like, “okay please don’t kill me” like I AM the one to be worried about? Even if all I said was “please stop contacting me” like what ?? Typical abusive behavior trying to turn it around on me.. 

I told him to stop or I’m going to the police but he said if I do then he will definitely “expose” me to everyone. I don’t want him harassing my elderly relatives. He’s already tarnished my name to so many people at this point. He told me he isn’t scared of the police. And I know it’s true.

Well, it turns out that she was bullied for the way she looked in high school. I'm not sure why she was bullied exactly or for how long as I didn't wanna go into too much detail because she said she doesn't think about it much anymore. But the thing is that it clearly affects the way she sees herself every time she looks in the mirror. Now I realise that the best way for her to deal with this would be to see a therapist but as we're both only 16 (I'm turning 17 this month), I don't think that's a viable option. I could try and see if she could talk to someone about it in college once it opens again but I'm not sure she would wanna do that. I keep reassuring her that there's nothing wrong with her and compliment her regularly but it hasn't really changed anything yet. I wish there was something else I could do to help.

However, I need some help in dealing with this myself, as every time I think about what could possibly have happened to her in most likely the past 5 years, my heart just breaks for her. I just wish i could be there in person to try to make her feel better about herself and have someone to talk to even if I'm not qualified. However, we can't be in private for several reasons: partly because of everything that's going on right now and partly because the house I live in isn't suitable as I sleep in the same room as my sister.

Let me start by saying my mom is generally a very sweet and nice person. I’m not gonna deny all the things she’s done for me, and I’m thankful for all of it. The issue is her temper and her mood swings. Whenever things are even a little tense, she lashes out at me or my older sister even if we weren’t doing anything wrong. This also happens whenever I make a mistake and she just so happens to be in a bad mood, like accidentally interrupting a show, forgetting to do things, etc etc. It’s honestly really annoying that I end up feeling bad for doing these things, but whenever my mom does it, it’s completely fine and if I get even a little annoyed I’m disrespectful or whatever.

One of the worst times was when she had called me out to help her with carrying drinks. I couldn’t go out exactly when she asked, so by the time I had gotten up was when she dropped most of them. So I guess my punishment was getting yelled at for being a brat (something that’s said time and time again) and having a starbucks pastry thrown at me. (I’ll admit, sounds ridiculous.) It’s gotten to a point where I’m a little afraid of asking her for things because she is so unpredictable and I end up feeling like this spoiled brat who only cares about themself.

I’ve played it cool for so long, but now I could lose contact with her forever. 

She is much older than me, yet extremely attractive and single. I don’t realistically see a relationship with her, but I look up to, admire, and truly care for her. I just went to be able to stay in contact every once in a while because it would mean a lot to me, and I care about her so much. We flirt a good amount at work, joke around, make strong eye contact, and I know she is attracted to me. If I don’t go do this in person, how do I get her number? I’m super depressed. I’ve completely lost feelings for any other girl. She’s been the main thing on my mind for weeks yada yada, you get the idea. 

What should I do??

120,"i'm 18 years old, and i only recently started wanting to live again. i never planned to live this long. for the past several years, i've been so consumed by sadness and trauma that i haven't wanted to work on any of my skills. i'm an artist, but i can never even finish anything anymore. i know i shouldn't compare myself to other people, but i see 13 year olds that are better at drawing than i am and i feel so discouraged. i could have been practicing my art at that age, but instead i was holed up in my room playing video games and wasting time waiting till the day i had the guts to finally off myself. i feel like i've wasted the best years of my life, and i'll never be good at art again. the thing is, it's the only thing i've ever been good at. but that's gone now. everything i make looks like trash to me, so i give up. what's worse is i feel like i'm all alone. everyone else seems to be able to push through and continue doing what they love. but i haven't enjoyed anything at all for a very long time. is it too late for me?",02Apr2020,1
121,"A 35M philosophy teacher is looking for serious, practical advice on how to choose an artistic craft that will allow to express himself in more creative ways

I have always been \* conceptually interested \* in the arts: when I was a kid, I drew, painted, danced, and was really into books, movies, and music. I won a few spoken word tournaments (reading poetry), but in general, any of these interests were never particularly cherished, either because I was not extraordinarily talented at any craft, or because when I was a (gay) kid my parents never found my ""sensitivities"" appropriate. Instead of producing art (i.e writing or playing an instrument), I relegated my need for beauty in more passive ways (i.e reading a lot, collecting music)

As I approach my late thirties, this underdeveloped side of myself existentially frustrates me. I know I am a creative person, and my friends think so too: they refer to me for advice on most things design, beauty, and sense-related, like perfume, interior design, music, movies, or fashion. They ask me to choose a playlist for their parties, to recommend them a movie, to choose their outfits. Thing is, I am aware I have a developed ""taste"" in all these art forms, but I do not have any concrete skills to cherish this sensitivity besides being a ""professional curator"".

Even though this situation is disappointing as I feel I will never be as good at anything in art (given my age and complete lack of formal experience), I am willing to embrace a humbler pursuit and engage with a craft just for myself––It's a debt I have with my life after accepting my homosexuality and new self, and after leaving my home-country where both of these things are culturally stigmatized.

I have a problem with patience, commitment, and enjoying the more ""manual side of things"", however. I actually would like to do everything and anything: i.e I would love to make music, but I have never played an instrument enough time for actually being good at it. Truth is, I never enjoyed playing the guitar either (tried it once): the learning curve is too steep for me to enjoy it, and I do not really enjoy the ""craft"" of moving my hands but rather the creation of musical ""concepts"" on my head. As I am not looking for becoming a Mozart, but expressing myself, I have the need for some more immediate gratification. That's why I have enjoyed already modifying my jewelry and clothing with small changes, as the product reflects my taste. But I haven't committed to any of these crafts as I am aware that it's a big-time commitment––and given my age, I don't have much time to get very good at something. I DO NOT KNOW WHICH CRAFT I SHOULD CHOOSE! Some ideas I've had:

\- Music: learn how to DJ/electronic music production? It seems more conceptual than manual, and friendlier to people with no musical experience.-

\- Singing: I think my voice isn't that bad and I enjoy singing...- Jewelry making: meditative and the skills are niche enough for me to be good at it (no much competition), and it can lead me to sculpture, maybe?

\- Fashion: I like making small adjustments to my clothes, I have a sense of style...- Drawing and painting: I like it but I'm not particularly good at it, and the learning curve seems just so intimidating

\- Graffiti: it seems more accessible than drawing and painting, and I like urban exploration- Ballet/contemporary dancing: I am relatively good at dancing and I was a competitive tennis player once, so I might be not too bad at this

\- Writing: I have tried it, I have things to say, but I lack so much discipline... make yourself to write is so hard, in contrast to drawing that just flows once you begin. I want a relaxing activity, and writing makes me tense.

Given my particular situation, I want to choose an art form that is accessible enough for a person of my age. Preferable, the gained skills would be transferable. It's been a few months that I have decided to commit myself to an activity and pursue it with discipline, but I do not know how to choose and how to start. Clock is ticking for me, I want to be tangibly good at something besides just thinking.

tldr; I have developed a curated taste in most art forms but I am not particularly talented at any. My approach (and source of enjoyment) has always been more intellectual than manual. I do not how choosing a craft and then committing to it in order to get better considering I am old and I do not have much time to waste.",02Apr2020,1
122,"I live in the lower part of a rental duplex. I’ve had to complain to the landlord about indoor smoking, basement leaks, and I’ve yelled up when they had one really loud furniture throwing fight (mother and teenage son). I felt kinda bad about that because it was a one time incident, they don’t seem to argue at all otherwise, (but my kids were napping at the time.)

It’s been really quiet in recent months, until quarantine... Now she’s doing high intensity jumps, stomping, &amp; running in place. No carpet, and squeaky floorboards. The sound is maddening, but also the obliviousness of how insanely rude it is as an upstairs neighbor makes me feel crazy. I go out of my way to search for low-impact exercises on you tube, and I live downstairs. 

Here’s the thing, I don’t want to create a neighbor feud. I want to get along so we can live harmoniously. I have kids and don’t want them to complain any time the little ones are playing. We are also strict about letting them run in the house, so we are highly aware of our noise disturbances, if any. 

I don’t like passive aggressiveness. I am also terrified of confrontation and have major social anxiety. I don’t want to have the landlord fight my fight either. What is the best way to resolve this with my hangups? Anyone else feeling this quarantine with noisy neighbors?

123,"So I've had 3 incidences in like a year span about ppl being racist to me I'm white tho, and I think that plays into why I'm asking the question. I'll explain the incidences too. The 1st time I met a girl off tinder we met in person for the 1st time and she asked me some political stuff (not getting into), but then she starts asking me about if I heard on the news how some democratic organization thing got attacked by some right wing radicals I said ""no"" then she kinda scoffed and looked away. This one is up for debate whether she was implying I had some involvement with it. That's the impression I got from her anyway, and I simply moved on without bringing it up again. Second time was about 6 months ago. I met this girl who was African American girl and with no context out of the blue she asked me ""are you apart of the KKK"" I said ""no"" in a clear and obvious disgusted tone (who wouldn't). She got her basis because some couple (white guy/African American woman) was on Oprah bc the guy was apart of the KKK.  Now I know things happen, but I told her that it's TV they either found the one situation or it's a setup for ratings. Now for the last incident I was at a coffee shop (before the closings) and I was talking to one of the employees Ina very light-handed manner. I told her ""I want to make an impact *ON* the world"" and she said ""that's what Hitler said"". Again I feel pretty hurt and told her ""you've taken about 25 steps away from reality"" she knows this bothers me and continues to call me Hitler. I had someone over the weekend tell me that what Hitler said in translating to English ""I want to impact *THE* world"" emphasizing the lack of the preposition insinuating a more sinister intent. Now fact check me (or really the person that told me the difference), but regardless it offends me. I saw her around school and she says ""hi Hitler"" (in a terrible attempt to joke with me) so I gave her what I thought she deserved and gave her the cold shoulder. It was something that nobody could have missed. I think she caught my hint. I was talking to some POC and they both were offended for me by what happened (with the last incident). They told me I should have reported her and had filed a title IX on her. But the first time she called me that it was off campus. The second the we were on the campus. 

Now I'm going to diverge a bit. At my last job I got harassed by a girl there every day (just about) and I would try and work at stations away from her. But I would take it saying to myself ""I've been through worse"". Most everyone thought this was seriously unprofessional of her and I was about to blow up. I knew this wasn't healthy she said some physically threatening things to me so my rebuttal was the same. That's when I knew I had to do something or else it would get ugly. Someone else ended up telling her boss and it was handled. What I took out of that was I need to set my boundaries out farther. My excuse I told myself wasn't good reasoning.

In typing this I feel like I'm complaining, but I'm really trying not to. I had quite a number of ppl get offended for me. My question is what would you have done?",02Apr2020,1

128,"This has to do with [an /r/LegalAdvice post I made today](https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ftd660/il_psychiatrists_office_has_gone_radio_silent_at/).

In brief:  

My father lives in Illinois, which is currently locked down by order of the Governor since March 21st.  He has Parkinson's Disease.  He requires frequent visits with the psychiatrist on his care team to have his prescriptions tweaked to minimize side effects.  His prescriptions are running out, and there are no refills allowed on the current set.  Without these, he will shortly experience withdrawal symptoms which can be quite severe, not to mention the return of all of his Parkinson's symptoms.

Unfortunately, the psychiatric practice he visits has, apparently, completely shut down:  

* Their website does not feature any notice that their offices will be closed, but when my folks drove by several branches, all were closed.  
* The website does provide a contact phone number, but even during normal business hours it features only a recorded message stating that their offices are ""currently"" closed and offering to record a voice mail.  
* My parents have left four voice mails over the past ~1.5 weeks, and none have been returned.  
* The website also lists an SMS number to be contacted for telemedicine services, however, no texts to this number have been answered in the past 24 hours.  

To complicate matters, he's on Medicare, so it can take months to see a psychiatrist for initial intake, without which I doubt any competent doctor will issue prescriptions.

Therefore, I'm going with the assumption that we *must* get ahold of someone at this practice ASAP.  I'm looking for any suggestions as to how to go about this; barring that, any alternative solutions for getting his prescriptions renewed.",02Apr2020,1

130,"My younger brother and I are very close. We talk every day and he calls me his dairy. I’ve held the title close to my chest over the years, hearing his every thought and adventure, supporting him through it all. One example being the get quick rich schemes he has a habit of getting into. I always cheered them on, listened encouragingly as he painted the bright future he had in store because of them. Despite their lack of success, I never spoke against them. 

Then the other night we did acid together and I was high out of my mind. Not thinking, I said like ‘even though your ideas always fail, your my brother and I’ll always cheer on your little adventures’. He immediately got quiet, then repeated the sentence back at me and hearing it again, in his voice, I realized how foul it had sounded. He broke down in tears and said I’m just like everyone else. That I see him as nothing. His business is his life and I shat all over it. I began to cry to and apologized profusely but I was so fucked from the drugs I could barely speak, only feel. And see the way he looked at me. 

He looked at me as if he hated me. Like the one person in the world he could trust broke his heart and had been seeing his dreams as a joke his whole life. Nothing I could say changed a thing and we went home. He told me to forget it even happened. There was not forgiveness, just broken acceptance. 

We spent the following day together and he acted like nothing happened. I know he didn’t forget. He will remember what I said forever. I can see it in the way he looks at me. In his eyes I used to be his best friend and a business partner, acting with him through his hustles, now I’m just like everyone else to him, another person looking down on him. 

Moving forward I’m gonna put serious effort in his ambitions. Teach myself to truly support it as a business as opposed to an adventure. But I don’t know what else to do. How can I make it up to him? How do I show him I’m still his supportive, loving sister, and not just another person dismissing his dreams? I need help. If I’m this tore up about it I know it’s killing him inside.",02Apr2020,1

133,"So I’m 27 with a degree in marketing, $74,000 in debt working at a job that I could care less about as a Search Analyst. I have a “passion” for photo/videography and am looking to see where that takes me but at this point, it’s an expensive hobby that makes me solid money from time to time. 

I recently moved back in with my parents to pay off debts(credit cards &amp; small loans) and am looking to go overseas to start anew. 

When I go, I do not want to touch Marketing again. I want to do my creative work full-time but that doesn’t seem realistic financially so I’m considering a coding bootcamp to learn some skills to build up capital fast while living somewhere cheap then going to where I can focus on my video work until my little fund runs out. 

But then I think that I’m trading one bullshit job for another; sacrificing my time &amp; energy for something that makes me money but not what I plan to do for the rest of my life...I’ve made progress financially, got my credit score up pretty high, automated my finances, etc but I still feel like money is holding me back from even trying things. I feel coding can give me the financial push I want and more mental stimulation as I really do enjoy computers but I’m really worried if I need to be focusing on this. 

Not to compare myself to others but I look at Christopher/ Jonathan Nolan; Absolute experts in their craft.  I think to myself, “how does one do that?” I don’t think that it’s through Majoring in minor tasks.

&lt;end of career issues&gt;

I grew up in a family that I can only describe as double-sided; My father came from poverty, drugs, war &amp; mental issues. My mother came from an upper middle-class family but she’s a bit of free-spirit. What they both have in common is myopia, addictive personalities and no respect for authority. I share that with them. My goal is to make that into something good. It’s just hard because short-term thinking can only take you so far, addiction can push you in the opposite direction or hold you still and a lack of respect bottlenecks your ability to learn new things; especially learning from your mistakes.

Over time, I’m more and more aware of this but as I get older, habits settle in. So I just feel like in a state of understanding myself more as I am but not in a state where I am becoming what I believe I could be because I spend so much time doing the former. Essentially, I’m spending so much time learning to drive myself that I can’t take the time to improve myself and it is frustrating. But I guess complaining on reddit doesn’t affect any change and maybe this is just a journal entry.

To give some context, I do painting as a hobby and during this whole quarantine thing, I’ve been painting some designs on some old shoes I haven’t worn in a while. My brother (14M) asked if I could paint his checkered Vans for him and I automatically assumed that this would be just a regular artist commission. You request me to paint something and I get something in return. He gets kind of pissed at me bc he doesn’t have any money and says “Well can’t you just do it for free?” And I usually charge people when they ask me to paint their water bottles/shoes etc unless it’s a friend’s birthday or something. I put a lot of effort into any art I do and it takes days for me to finish. Growing up, I only got money once or twice a year to spend on myself (Christmas/birthday money) so I admit I’m pretty frugal when it comes to money.

Anyway, my mom finds out that I want payment and screams at me over the dinner table saying that it’s my brother and I shouldn’t be charging him. Tbh, I feel guilty and I admit that maybe I shouldn’t have expected payment. I feel like a selfish person for having a mindset like this, but that’s literally how I think. I don’t expect things for free. If people do me favors, I’ll repay them somehow. I would never expect people to pay for me and I see it as a gift if they pay for my food/drink. I’m also always expected to share things with him too. All of my birthday giftcards and what not.

My mother is fine with it, but my dad will not let me work there because he thinks I will be robbed. I have showed my dad statistics from the bearou of labor, and the last time the locations I would work at were robbed was 20 years ago, but he remains adamant. How do I convince him?

TLDR; I want to work at a gas station and my dad thinks I'll get robbed. How do I convince him?",02Apr2020,1
144,"Hey, so for the past 2 months I’ve been a programmer for a small (about 7 people) game development group on the side of my actual job. I kind of just decided to help them with programming because I didn’t have anything to do with my spare time. Now, I have lost interest in developing it because of the way the game is turning out.

I want to leave, but without making anyone angry. I also don’t really want to seem childish. I like the type of people these guys are, with the exception of one.

Currently my coworkers don’t know I have any personal relations with our boss cause he’s stepdad. I don’t plan on revealing this as well.

But I’m currently having a hard time deciding if I should pass in my resignation now because I know my mother and her husband expect for me to stay in the company for years.

My mother knows that I have other goals in life, which I won’t achieve within the company. But she just says that I have to save up first so I can get them.

I have other opportunities outside the company, in an industry that I love. So I really want to but it feels like I’m trapped between what I love and my family’s expectations.

151,"I'll try to explain this situation the clearly and quickly.

My SO sister is being abused by her boyfriend. They have two children. A 4 year old and 6 month old. He is using crystal meth and is physically abusing her. 

We tried to remove her from the relationship before it became abusive,  but he knows where all of her relatives live and it made the situation worse. He beat on the doors, threatening to hurt himself and she ended up going back. 

This week she has expressed wanting to move across the country to North Carolina (we live in SoCal) and we are very willing to fly her out there by the end of the week. It's a very scary time, but it feels like our only option to finally get her out of this situation. 

My SIL boyfriend broke her phone so we're not able to communicate with her directly. I need to get her a phone so she can get in contact with us and the rest of the family. I'm looking into prepaid phones but I'm not sure what the best option is. I need an inexpensive option because I still need to buy her plane tickets and I would like to give her some money for the trip. 

I guess I'm just looking for general advice on what I need to get so she's prepared to leave him and how I can get her an affordable phone. I'm working less due to coronavirus, which means I have less money so any money saving tips would be greatly appreciated.

I find that the most important element is the atmosphere. Something about being in the midst of people talking and lots of movement in the background is very... relaxing, I suppose. I do have headphones on with some repetitive music to mask the louder noises, but the atmosphere definitely still has an effect. I've had most of my best ideas in that café.

Now, news of COVID has reached the town and everything, everywhere has shut down. Even my local library.

I don't question their motives for doing so. I think it's a great idea for the non-essential services. However, shutting down any and all places where one can sit down has had an effect on me.

I can't seem to get into the mood to write anymore.

For context: The relationship we have is casual and very new. Fun, largely sexual, not lots of emotional talk, and vague and undefined. we’ve gone to movies and dinner, and he’s taken me to gatherings with his friends and started to incorporate me into that. But it’s also very much based on sex and we don’t have a ton of great conversation otherwise.

Anyway, last night we got together and for the first time he let me stay the night (and morning) at his house and sleep in his bed with him. We had sex almost right away but then watched a lot of TV and talked. I had taken an extra adderall because I had gotten up early that morning and was afraid I’d be tired. I didn’t feel like I was that hyper or different but for the first time we were talking about stuff and joking and the convo seemed to flow (in my mind at least). It felt like we were bonding and in the morning he even offered to make pancakes (but I declined). Well in the morning I stayed and watched tv for an hour of so and more talking but eventually I got the hint to leave so he took me home and when he got out of the told me to text him. I interpreted it like he was eager for me to take the lead (because he usually initiated). Well I was way overconfident and impulsive because later that night I asked him out again, which I know is way to soon, but I thought he wanted me to for some reason.

Anyway he doesn’t reply for like fifteen minutes and then he’s like “I need to catch up on sleep.” And then he’s also like “lay off the adderall, watching tv is not the time to be sped up and talkative.” I rethink the night and realize he was probably annoyed the whole fucking time. So I start pathetically apologizing and for tbe first acting desperate and weird despite the fact that I don’t even like him that much or see much potential for a long term thing. I beg him to give me another chance and he replies that he will, as long as I don’t take adderall on weekdays.

i agree but feel tremendously embarrasses, insecure and confused and desperate for any reassurance that he likes me even a little bit (he is giving none whatsoever) so I cave and basically ask him “what are we? Is this just physical? if so that’s fine I just want to know” And he is like, “you’re overthinking things” and “I like going places and doing stuff with you but we don’t have to see each other all the time” and at this point I’m just so embarrassed and feeling rejected and it’s obvious he was annoyed because I was talking the whole time and asking questions. but I only kept going because I genuinely thought he was into it. and I know I’m making no sense I’m typing as fast as I can to just get it out but I’m very embarrassed and hurt even though he didn’t do anything really wrong. It’s just that I was trying so hard to be the cool, collected chill girl and to look my best and not act desperate and weird and I thought I was doing a good job being normal but apparently im a disaster. I can’t believe how I misread the conversation. I’m most of all worried that I have spent my life annoying everyone whilst I think I’m being bubbly and interesting and charming and inquisitive.",02Apr2020,1

157,"I'm a 28 year old guy from the US. I've been working for 5 years for my local health department. It's a great job for many reasons - low stress, great job/life balance, amazing benefits, and great pay for my specific job position. I've been there for 5 years and I am a respected employee.

A little over a year ago I started learning Spanish and became absolutely obsessed. It takes up all of my free time (in a good way). I've always been ""searching"" for my calling in life. I always had a sense that there is more to life than the 9/5. I got really into music for a period of time, and again with fitness. I'm still passionate for both but I couldn't sustain either lifestyle long enough to really make it apart of my life. 

Spanish has been different. I never had an interest in learning a second language. I originally began learning because I booked a trip to Spain by myself and wanted to be able to get around and not have to be catered to like a typical American by having everyone speak English to me. Little by little I began learning more and more and I was lucky to have a native-spanish speaking friend be my personal teacher. Within a year I reached a high-intermediate level. But I feel like in order to gain true fluency you need spend time immeresed in the culture and language by living elsewhere.

I made that leap in March. I took a 3 month leave of absence from work. I'm not getting paid right now but my office is holding my job position for me for when I return in June.

Here's my current issues:

1. 3 months isn't enough time to reach the level I want to be at
2. Coronavirus is fucking up my experience. Some would call this a once in a life time opportunity. Yes, my main objective is to better my spanish, and coronavirus isn't getting in the way of that because i am living with a spanish speaking family and I have class every day, so I am still bettering my spanish. But I am not able to experience any of the culture here. I can't go out to the bars and meet new people. I don't really have friends, just the family who I live with. I can't go to the beaches. I can't go climb a mountain. I can't do anything. I have class and then pass the day with my family.

Here are the pro's to my current living situation:

1. I call the family i'm living ""my family"", because they absolutely treat me like a son. They have already offered to let me stay for as much time as I need/want, they are a great support system, and provide me with anything and everything I need. I already love them.
2. I have enough money to hold me over for a year so finances aren't a problem.

&amp;#x200B;

So - do I quit my super secure and cozy job in order to pursue my passion of becoming fluent in Spanish? I already know achieving fluency will open a ton of doors and opportunities for me. And I know in my heart it is what I want. But frankly, it's scary giving up a very secure and cozy life I have built for myself already. Plus, who knows how the coronavirus is going to impact the economy in the coming months and years.

I could always move back home when I'm supposed to, continue on with life as usual and try my best to continue bettering my spanish from home. It won't be impossible. I live in a diverse city. It will just be a slower process and frankly I know in my heart I would be living with the regret of not staying here longer. And I'm already here in a different country.. I feel like I should just do it all now while i'm 28. 

I genuinely do not know what to do. I would go to my parents but they're going to obviously try to give me the smart, financially responsible answer of coming home and going to back to life as usual. I'd go to my friends but they're all going to tell me to live it up.

I need your unbiased advice.

160,"Hi. 

So me and a common group of friends (17/18 y/o) play online games together a lot, mostly CS:GO. A while ago I added someone I met in a game and since then he's been a part of the group.

Thing is, I cannot stand him. He's more than 2 years younger than us, so his humour and way he acts just doesn't sync up with me. He just annoys me no matter what he does. I sometimes can't help but lash out and tell him to STFU or whatever which I have apologised for but he never takes it seriously and keeps being annoying af.

Especially during quarantine, these games are a big part of my social life and to connect with friends I wouldn't otherwise see, and when he's there it is just hell. He rages, makes unfunny jokes, speaks over people. I know it's not only me that finds him annoying. 

Thing is, he definitely seems lonely and insecure and has opened up to me about school sucking and etc etc so I feel bad for him and wouldn't feel good about just ghosting him even though I've considered it multiple times.

I tried speaking to him and telling him that sometimes he acts annoying to me and that is why I was sometimes a dick to him, and apologised. I'd hoped it would make him mellow out a bit but nope. Still completely un self aware, injects himself in conversation that has nothing to do with him, etc.

So I’m a part of a group of 7 girls who have all been friends since about freshman year and are juniors now. But recently our group has had a falling out and it has spilt into a group of three and three (let’s say group A and B). I was closer with two girls in group A and closer to one girl in group B. But I had unintentionally been hanging out more with group B because they made the effort to hang out with me while group A had become more distant and harder to be with. 

But anyway the two girls i was close with in group A have always said they did not want to go to prom no matter what. Since the split they have basically molded into the same person? They hang out constantly, are planning to go to the same college with the same degree, have terrible self esteem, and share the same opinions about most things. They agreed they wouldn’t go to prom because they wouldn’t have fun (probably true seeing as they’ve never been to hoco and avoid all dances), it’s a waste of money, they don’t want to dress up(because of their self esteem issues), etc. I had tried unsuccessfully for years to convince them to go and had finally given up as prom was less than a month away. We were hanging out during one of our musical rehearsals and they said they kept letting it slip(i had not caught on what so ever) so they decided to tell me-they were going to prom and already had dresses picked out. I was so surprised and shocked in the moment that it didn’t even register until later that it really bothered me they hadn’t told me sooner. We could have gone dress shopping together, the ultimate bonding experience for high school girls. I understand that it was their decision and I just need to move on but I almost feel betrayed? Like they’ve said for years they weren’t going to go and that prom is stupid and just not their thing. But now when I had finally given up on them going (prom was going to be in April but now it’s been postponed/ possibly cancelled) they tell me barely a month before? I feel very upset but don’t know what I should do? Should I let it go? Or confront them? I feel if I did that it would be pushed aside, seen as me overreacting, and they would not take my feelings seriously. Advice please!

Help me understand the rules of engagement. As girls, what did you learn about handling bullies? If you had a daughter, would you teach them about bullies?",02Apr2020,1
182,"Like many of you guys are, I (F19) am stuck at home with my family. Social distancing has been going pretty well for us, until last night when my sister (17) violated our city's Stay-at-Home order last night to drive around for hours with a friend. This is frustrating, but our Dad's health issues take this to a whole other level. He's severely immunocompromised and, according to his doctors, COVID would be fatal for him. I've cried so many times over this possibility and have been wracked with anxiety and preemptive grief since the beginning of March. At only 55, my Dad isn't ready to go yet, and I'm nowhere near ready to let him.

&amp;#x200B;

Knowing the risks, I can't fathom how my sister could have done this. Corona is all over our city, so it's very plausible that she could have been exposed to it by this close contact with her friend. I don't know if I feel more confusion, anger, or terror. We still haven't talked about it, but I haven't been able to look at her the same way. How do I confront her about this? How do I not blame her if he gets it? Losing my Dad would be horrible enough; I couldn't stomach losing my relationship with my sister, too. That being said, all I feel now is disdain. I really need some advice and guidance here. Thank you all for reading, and stay safe.",02Apr2020,1

186,"I will give backstory when asked and necessary but I'm bad at forming proper sentences at times. Anyways, here's the current problem:

My online friend is in his 20's and is absolutely obsessed with me. This behaviour isn't anything new, and I told him time and time again that it makes me uncomfortable. Infact, I told him today, too! His reaction was that ""he started shaking and felt like crying"" (as he DM'd my friends who had nothing to do with this.) He relies too much on me, I feel like. I'm underage and he used to have a crush on me, too, when he was like 19 and I was 13. He apperantly talks about me all the time (as reported by friends of mine and his) and I think he may care too much about my opinion. He used to have suicidal tendencies and told me, a depressed teenager, as well. I don't want him to get back on this dark path, but if the reaction me telling him that he needs to back off because I get uncomfortable from time to time (like when he says way too flattering things) is anything to go by with, then I think I'm at a loss. I don't think he still has that crush on me (especially after I told him I was a lesbian) but he's still so relying on me, as if I were his guiding light or something. I cannot deal with this and I don't want to. He's a nice guy, he really is, but this is proving itself too much for me and with moment like these I sometimes wish I never met him.

He also seems to stalk my Twitter at times, making remarks under tweets to get my attention (which leads to me being uncomfortable again). I don't hate him, but again, it is becoming too much but I don't want to hurt him. How do I deal with this? 


(Also I left a lot of information out in case he may somehow find this (although I doubt it as we are both German and his English is miserable), but I can add everything needed if asked. We have a lot of past, it goes back to, I think 2015 or so. )

188,"I [19F] was in an eight month long relationship with a my ex [19M] and one of my friends who does improv with him told me recently that she thinks he has a new girlfriend. I am also in a new relationship, so I am not jealous he’s found someone new at all, but I am extremely worried for the girl.
I do not know the details of their relationship, and I don’t think I’ve ever even met the girl he’s dating, but I’m really scared he’s going to put her through the same shit he put me through just about a year ago. He cheated on me for eight months and lied about it (one of the girls he had sex with happened to be the girl who outted me as bisexual to all of my closest friends before I got the chance to tell them. He knew this.), was emotionally abusive, and was just overall not someone I think should be pursuing serious relationships. I devolved an eating disorder, cried nearly every night—in front of him often too, which he chose to ignore—and saw a severe decline in my grades and mental health throughout freshman year of college. Thankfully during the summer I worked up the courage to end our relationship, but the things he would say to me and how he made me feel sometimes still haunt me in my current relationship. I even quit my job because he worked with me and I couldn’t stand to see him anymore. I can’t really express just how terrible that relationship was.
Getting to my question: should I try to figure out who the girl is and reach out to her? I don’t even know if it’s for sure that they’re exclusively dating. I don’t know her name. I don’t know what he’s told her either. I just feel some sort of responsibility to let her know what he did to me, and warn her so that she can be aware of any red flags.
I’m not asserting that people can’t change, but it’s only been a year, and from what I’ve heard from other people on my campus, he has not changed and continues to defend his actions.
Should I try to tell her? What are my other alternatives? I’m really scared she’s going to get hurt, maybe even worse than I did.

TLDR: my abuser is in a new relationship, and I’m trying to figure out if I should let the girl know what he did to me.",02Apr2020,1

Then he texted me asking if he was a bad guy blah blah ... I told him no and I told him straight up that when he did stop talking to me that was pretty fucked up but i learned that we can ONLY BE FRIENDS after that day. He agreed and we left it at that. Towards the end of February One of his friends (guy b) posted something on his story so I responded. B and i started texting everyday since then. I enjoy talking to him. A couple weeks ago GUY A asked me to hang out. I said yeah. We hung out but he was being flirty. Later that day i told him i had a little crush on GUY B. And we left it at that. GUY A has been texting me a lot more now. We hang out. He’ll pick up food and come over. Or the other way around but I made it clear to him we are friends. Now the thing is I don’t know what to do. I really like B but I don’t know if he feels the same way I want things to work with B. And then guy A I don’t wanna lose our friendship.

When I see a  backsplash, I might be like, ""oh it's just blue"" not ""it's blue but it  has undertones of green in it."" Comparison is ugly, but I've been  letting it get to me a lot lately. I'm worried that with Covid-19 I  won't be able to find a interior design internship due to so many  businesses closing down even though I've been applying and calling  different businesses. My mom says I don't seem to be enjoying my major  right now, but that's a whole other story right there. Part of the  qualifications for graduating is having an internship within my field.  So that's why I may not seem like I'm enjoying it. I'm too far gone to  do anything. I try my hardest at school to make good grades and to do  well on projects.

206,"Little back story, basically my industry shut down 3 weeks ago (film industry in LA around March 13th was starting to go dark). Since I am mostly a 1099 worker unemployment benefits were gonna be a long shot. So, I looked up some jobs and a seasonal job at Amazon fresh appeared near me. I applied and got approved, did the online training and my first day is tomorrow morning. In that 2-3 time frame however....

600 bucks of top off in unemployment benefits weekly and including 1099/contractors who weren't eligible before. Now I am thinking wow I acted fast before all of this to secure some income and now I might be screwed cause I got a ""job"" and if I quit that would make me ineligible to collect. Though I could say I quit because I got scared of catching COVID-19 and after I applied and got the job warehouses started reporting COVID-19 outbreaks. 

Now I wonder if California will still give me the benefits because I am underemployed and it's a seasonal job technically....I decided to fill out an application online to apply for unemployment to see what they say because if I get denied I can appeal and explain my story in a letter and it's going to take forever to hear from them anyway. 

So I guess I am asking should I just jump off the Amazon job and then claim COVID-19 fears with reports of warehouses having break outs so then I can be eligible? Or just do the warehouse job for a bit and earn some money because who knows when benefits will get paid out and all of that.....Sorry if any of this is confusing.",02Apr2020,1

Me: Do you use it?

Ex: No, but I like the way the box looks on the shelf.

Me: Oh my god, you have a great tablet and don’t use it? What??!? Can I have it!?!

Ex: Mmmm I like it up there

Me: I swear you can keep the box

Him: I’ll give it to you next time I see you.

Me: okay. 

Time goes by. I ask him for it again. He said I kinda don’t want to give it up but I know you’ll use the hell out of it, but okay. You can pick it up at xyz. Okay. So I drive to get it. I get it. I haven’t even hooked it up yet as I have a smaller tablet I use at the moment. Then I get a text him.

Him: Hey, Rina wants the tablet back.

Me: Wtf...? Hasn’t even been a week.

Now Rina is the one of his friends. She gave him the tablet as a gift, then I ended up asking for it. Now I have I said no. Of course. You don’t gift something then ask for it back several months later. Wtf. Now my ex is telling me he never really meant to Permanently give it to me. He said he meant to say he was just lending it. And he didn’t. I made sure and confirmed with him that he never said that. He agreed he didn’t and miscommunicated but still wants me to give the tablet back. I’m a little irritated because I see it as mine now. And who tf (rina)ask for gifts back? He even offered to pay her whatever she paid for it. And she said no. Why? She apparently had gained feelings for him and he didn’t feel the same. I know he for sure said That  because he told me. And I went through this phone( This was nearly a year ago. Don’t judge me lol) she was asking why she wasn’t good enough. And he said you just aren’t my type. Maybe some of you can find some link with this info. I don’t care what they did or do now. I just want the tablet. So I asked again why she wanted it back. “She needs it for work with adobe” I asked him if she knew I had it... He said no. I haven’t told her you have it. But if you keep refusing to give it back I’m going to have to tell her why she can’t get it back. Now as I said. I’m his ex and me and this girl hung around each other in the past. She’s very funny. Not horrible at all. But idc Lol.

What should I do? He knows he didn’t tell me that he wanted it back. He acknowledges this, but wants me to give it back anyway. We are cool and I don’t want things to be weird. I also don’t think he should cave and give it back to her cuz like I said. Who tf ask for that gifts back??? Especially when you can get paid to buy a brand new one of the same thing. Now this is a huge Wacom tablet. Easy 400$ probably more. My ex is a super soft guy and doesn’t like confrontation... like a big teddy bear. I’m more alpha... and even if I give it back to him he shouldn’t let her take it back. Let me know your thoughts or questions! Thanks.",02Apr2020,1
209,"Hi all. 

A family friend is a bus operator for a university and given the obvious reasons (pandemic 😬), he is not going to work. During his time home, in order to retain his pay, he is assigned a topic at the start of the week on which he needs to write a 2500 words essay. Failure to meet the 2500 word limit results in cuts from his paycheck. He is a non-native English speaker and his writing proficiency is not very good; the thing is, I don’t think any of his colleagues are proficient English speakers or writers. 

I understand why they wouldn’t want the workers to get paid without actually working, but 2500 words seem excessive. It just seems wrong to me that given many of the bus operators’ low proficiency in English,  their supervisors are knowingly are making them write a five page essay...

That turned into me seeing the only value in myself as a person/partner as sexual. And believing that no relationship exists without the guy having sex with some other girl.

I'm TIRED of blaming myself for other people's choices.

213,"So my baby brother is a senior this year, super smart kid and has so much potential. He's got a great job already that he's had since he's 16 and hopefully can keep for several more years while he figures out adult life and whatnot. He's never been a trouble child and is actually way better than he needs to be to appease my parents... in most ways. He's failed several classes before, mostly english related. Luckily there's a packet system that helps students recover the credit. He's done four of 13 packets now (all are worth 1/4 of a full credit). The thing is, he's only got until april 30th to finish the other nine and can only have two out at a time. He's known that these packets have needed to get done for two years, and he's also probably going to fail three more classes for these last two terms of school. If this happens and he also doesn't get the packets done, he won't graduate. Here is where I need advice: how do I get him to finish the packets and also do his homework? He's smart, and when I can convince him to do homework and packets he gets it all done quickly and correctly, it just takes lots of yelling and he'll finish one thing and then not do any work for three months. It's infiuriating knowing that he could have all of his homework done and packets super quickly, but he just won't do it. I know he's struggled with depression on and off for some time, and I know the struggle well, but I just don't know how to tell him if he just finishes these few things then he can be done with school. Any advice on getting him to do the work or even just how the heck to make sure he graduates would be welcome. If I could do all of his homework for him I would, but obviously then he wouldn't learn anything.

Basically I feel like I fell into a crack in the system and I'm wondering if anyone knows how I can fix this. Is anyone in the same position?

218,"so i’m going to be a junior in high school next year and i’m thinking about doing the IB diploma. i’ve heard how stressful it is and i’ve also heard that it’s somewhat pointless. i’m also a dancer, so almost every day i will have dance anywhere from three to six hours each day. at my current school, i have basically no friends. i sit alone at lunch, and i’m very quiet in all of my classes. in elementary school and the beginning of middle school, i had lots of friends and i was very much an extroverted person. now that i have no friends (except for a few friends i have at my dance studio that don’t attend the same school as me), i feel very lonely and i feel like it’s affecting my mental health. in the future, i want to be an entrepreneur (that seems a little random to say but it’s an important part of my situation). entrepreneurship is a class that’s not offered at my current high school, but it’s offered at another high school near my house. i have lots of close friends that attend this other school. i was thinking about transferring there because it has the class that i’m wanting to take, and lots of my friends also go there. i talked to my counselor and she said that i can’t transfer because taking a class not offered at my current school is not a valid reason to move. on the school board website, it states that a student may apply to transfer schools if a class isn’t offered at your current school. my dad is very much supportive of me transferring, but my mom does not approve. my older brother graduated high school as an IB diploma candidate, and she wants me to follow in his footsteps. the IB diploma is not offered at the school that offers entrepreneurship, but i did tell my mom that if i transfer, i will take all AP classes, and go for the advanced diploma at this new school. i don’t know if i should contact my counselor again and ask to transfer, or if i should suck it up and go for the IB diploma at my current high school, even though i won’t have any friends and i will be forced to quit dance in order to maintain good grades (also i will be very stressed due to the hard classes i will be taking).",02Apr2020,1

223,"So for reasons I won't get into, I left my job early March, let's just say it was time to go. At the time I was woefully unaware of the virus, and I definitely wasn't ready for the state to go into lockdown later the same week I left my job. My plan was to just start applying, take what offer I can get, and keep it moving, but now I'm not sure what to do.

I'm in college, but moved back home for the lockdown, but this is not ideal. Home is the last place I want to be stuck inside for several months, I'm barely surviving the 2 weeks I've been here so far. 

But my distaste for home is nothing new and dorm life is getting costly, so for the last few months, me and my GF have been playing with the idea of finding an apartment, and now we both have the incentive of not wanting to be at home anymore pushing us to start seriously looking. But I can't do a thing without an income of some kind.

And now my question: is it smart to be looking for a job right now? I'd 100% be putting myself and everyone here at risk, since every job I qualify for would involve being out in public, interacting with people to some capacity. But I'm completely miserable at home, due in part to being isolated like this, but mostly due my living situation, so id like to get out of here asap. Even if I get a job, it would take a few weeks of saving to be able to pull the trigger on some of the places we're looking at, so I'm stuck here regardless. It feels Iike I'm damned if I go job hunting, I'm damned if I do nothing.

(I should mention that I'm not in any physical danger being at home. Reading through this before posting, I can see how some could interpret this as me going through some type of abuse, but rest assured that's not the case here. I'm just not comfortable, I'm stressed the hell out, and frankly I don't feel very welcome here anymore)",02Apr2020,1
224,"Slowly, over the past few years, I’ve developed several addictions. I binge eat gross amounts of food. I drink too much and too often. And I smoke as well. I play video games when I should be working and I stay up until late hours of the night watching YouTube or movies, anything to stay awake longer. Anything to distract myself. The thing is just a few years ago I was the self improvement guy. I’ve read countless self help nonfiction books. I know all about health and how habits work. I’ve been very into exercise and meditation. I understand exactly the things I’m doing wrong and I even have an idea of how to improve. But for some reason, I have a feeling of wanting to destroy any progress when I get a few days of productivity in. The sensation to experience all of my destructive vices at once. I used to tell myself I was being irreverent to life. Eating a lot was a satire of the seriousness of life. The high regard people have for their own life and self importance. These bad habits are me laughing at death and saying I’m living for the moment. At some point though, I couldn’t stop. I can physically stop and I’ll try to get back on track but I continually slip off track and I don’t know why anymore. I want to succeed and I know exactly what I need to do. I just don’t do it and that’s what bothers me. It’s not that I’m not motivated I just feel like I can’t control myself for long enough to make permanent changes. I feel like a slave to my emotions. Spending all of my time avoiding boredom. I’ve never been depressed before but how do you know what to call depression? I don’t want to end my life and I’m not a sad person even. I’m afraid calling this depression makes it more of a real problem than it is. Should I seek out professional help? Is that expensive?

227,"Hello everyone! Sorry I'm advance if this is very long. Here's some backstory;

I'm an 18 year old guy in my second semester in college. Ever since high school started, my motivation for anything has substantially dropped. School is one of the biggest things. Throughout my four years in highschool and this first year in college, I have cared less and less about my grades. This year, I have just started skipping classes and avoiding doing assignments. I know I should and I could, but I could not care any less about it. I've failed two of my college courses already, and as you'd expect me to say, I don't care at all. 

My parents aren't such a big help here. Both my mom and dad were insanely upset and angry with me that I failed, but didn't offer to help me. I was merely yelled at and told to do better this semester. Surprise, surprise, I'm not. I feel I've come way too far to tell them how I feel, because it's been so long now. I frequently lie to them about how my grades are, just so they're not upset. But I know when they finally see my grades at the end of the year, I will be in for hell all over again. Last time I did tell my dad I didn't care about school finally, and he didn't seem to want to help me. He yelled about how life is a b**** and I need to suck it up.

Truthfully, I don't think they will take my side. Every time I tell them I missed an assignment or something related, even if I have legitimate reason and it wasn't my fault, they blame me. I know it should be my responsibility for my school work, but even when things are out of my control I am yelled at. 

School is just one thing I've lost motivation for, but maybe the most important in my life right now. I had a job for about a year that I got fired from a month ago. Reason? I didn't care enough and I stopped showing up. I have not told my parents this either.

Honestly, I don't know what to do anymore. I don't care about college, I lost my job, and I have no idea what I want to do with myself in the future. I know I should care about my future, but I just... don't.  I don't know how to tell my parents without them just yelling and telling me to get over it. 

So I guess I just need advice on, anything really. Thank you :)",02Apr2020,1

229,"Warning: suicide reference and S/H

I'm keeping my friend alive
(Reposting incase no one sees it)

We have only been talking around two weeks but very consistently. It was clear we completely clicked on a lot of opinions and ideas. Though it's still interesting to talk. He began to open up maybe a few days in but very gently.

Last night he told me he asked me what was up I told him what I was doing. I asked what is he up to and he said he's writing his suicide note. I'm really scared he's going to kill himself. He has told me I'm the only one in his life. I feel this immense pressure all of a sudden. I'm still trying to recover from depression, a suicide attempt, an ED and PTSD and grieving my mother of which he knows some about and this is undoing all the work I've put into getting better. I don't think I'm ready to literally carry someone's life in my hands. I know that is selfish but our for this past week I've been getting worse and I'm slowly slipping it's scary but I feel awful how selfish that is.

He says I'm the best thing to ever happen to him. He only does things other than go to work and entertainment because I asked him to (like talk to his parents or shower etc) I'm keeping him alive. He says I'm the only reason he hasn't killed himself. I'm the only reason he's still here I'm so scared I can't just let him die but I'm getting more ill and loosing weight he keeps monologuing these thoughts that I've had for years and it's bringing everything back. I can't let myself get any worse.

234,"I care about her deeply, but i feel very unhappy. I feel incredibly lonely. I can't talk to anyone about my problems when they involve my relationship because absolutely nobody would understand what it's like to be in my shoes. 

We've been together for a long time. Since I was 14, I'm now 18. My friends used to go out drinking and clubbing, but I never did. I couldn't because my girlfriend would want me with her. It felt like the secrecy of my relationship got between me and my friends. My friends slowly distanced themselves after a while until I had very few remaining. More importantly though my relationship created friction between me and my family. They know I'm with a woman, but they don't know who. My dad actually found out I was dating a woman when I was 15, he promised to keep the secret from my mom and has never got involved since. I argued with my mom a lot over going out and night and not coming home though. She knows there is a girl involved, she just doesn't know how old she is.

I used to see my girlfriend a lot through her work as she is a teacher. It was exciting and new at first. Nobody really ever approached me like she had. At first I thought I was lucky and was really into her. I didn't give any thought about what it would be like long term or the bigger impacts on my life.

Because of the virus happening currently my girlfriend is spending a lot more time at home and I've moved in with her. The amount of time we spend together I guess has changed my perception of the situation. She is 110% devoted to me in every way, yet still i feel unhappy. I don't know what is wrong with me. She's so supportive and a really beautiful person inside and out. I just feel restless recently and like I need space. She sort of just strangles me. Constantly grabbing me, hugging me, aggressive flirting. I'm a pretty introverted guy and although I enjoy her attention, sometimes it gets way too much.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm horrible for feeling the way I do, because i have this great woman and i still don't feel happy. She's been there for me through a lot. I told her about how I was sexually abused in my childhood. She was understanding and supportive with my issues. She took the role of a therapist for me and helped me move on with my life. At first I couldn't even deal with touching people and the thought of sex made me feel really unsafe. She worked with me through that for years and helped me feel safe. She was like a therapist, best friend, girlfriend and parental figure combined. It sounds weird of course, but it wasn't to me.  I had a really rocky relationship with my parents and because of my past i had so many trust issues and always kept people at a distance. It felt like through my time with her I healed a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

I do pretty much nothing around the house, i play xbox all day and she makes all the meals. Anything I want within reason she pays for. I know all she wants is somebody to love her and i feel guilty that right now I don't feel as into her as I used to. I feel as though there is something wrong with me for even thinking about betraying her after all she has shown me is love and compassion. I have thought about leaving.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been thinking a lot. I don't want to still be with her when she gets old and wrinkly. I have very deep feelings for her and think she's a beautiful person, but I feel like she's sorta suffocating me recently. Maybe it's just the fact we're staying indoors so much because of the virus? I'm not sure. I have always felt attracted to her, but she is madly in love with me and that hasn't changed since the beginning. I'm not even kidding she told me she'd kill herself if i died. (i am vulnerable to the virus because of underlying health issues that's how that got brought up.)

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I need advice on what to do. I usually talk to her when I have problems, but i feel like I can't talk to her about this. I've thought about moving out, but i don't think my parents will take me back now. I feel awful and like this post itself is betraying her. I will probably delete this soon.",02Apr2020,1
235,"My roommate (28f) seems passive-aggressive to me (23f) and I’m unsure how to navigate this. I have not lived with her for long and I plan to get my own place soon anyway. I’ve known her for about 2 years and always loved her outgoing, uplifting personality. After living with her, naturally I notice her faults, as she probably notices mine. I have kept an open mind throughout but don’t want to step on any toes. I feel like I’m walking on eggshells. I live in her house that she owns so I know this is her safe space. 
I have been out of a job due to COVID-19, she works from home already, but only a few hours a day and she’s never home. She was FaceTiming our mutual friend and said to her, “it’s just really hard to be around people who aren’t working.” My instant thought was to be offended, but I stopped myself and said to myself “don’t take it personally.” She was obviously talking about me but I still considered her point of view. I do a lot during the day by the way, I don’t sit around at all. Well I started to get negative vibes after she got off the phone and she started to pack a bag to go stay with a friend. I still tried to remain calm and not say anything. Long story short, I actually ended up packing a bag also and going back home to see family. I was going to say bye, but she went to her room and closed the door. I honestly felt as if I was invading her space and didn’t want her to feel overwhelmed with everything going on. So I was gone for almost 2 weeks and I didn’t hear from her a single time. She constantly tells me she doesn’t like texting and that if I go somewhere she doesn’t reach out because she doesn’t like to be bothered so she doesn’t bother me. I don’t agree with that logic but it is what it is. I felt as if she was almost giving me the silent treatment but tried not to create false situations in my head. When I got back she said she was so excited to see my car in the driveway and she was very kind to me like everything was fine. So that was good!
But tonight, she started to talk about how our other roommate was constantly asking her about me and if she had heard from me. This other roommate actually did reach out to me several times and I always thanked her and let her know what I was up to. But the first roommate kept repeating the fact to me that she didn’t understand why she kept asking about me, that she just didn’t want to bother me and that several other people were asking about me. She said it got to her so badly that she just shut down. Why would she just shut down? It’s not a big deal if someone is asking how I’m doing? In the mix of her talking, I realized that she was actually putting our other roommate down in a way. As if it was wrong of her to be concerned for me. It seemed like she was trying to turn a situation maybe. I told her that I appreciated the other roommate reaching out to me and that it actually didn’t bother me at all. She was kind of beating around the bush and I felt like she was trying to get me to tell her if I left because of her. I was honestly uncomfortable and wanted to talk about it, but I wasn’t ready. 
Situations with her are uncomfortable and I always feel like she’s being passive. She’s constantly late, or just never shows up to places. Kind of claims that she just does what she wants, or plays dumb and acts like she forgot. She stays in her own home maybe 2 nights a week, self-isolates when she’s here. I understand having space and I’m the first person to admit that I need it also. I feel like she is such an emotional wreck and I love her and try to support her as much as I can without feeling exhausted. But it’s like she literally cannot cope with any conflict or feelings. How do I talk with her about how she did hurt my feelings when she said it was hard for her to be around people who don’t work? How it did hurt my feelings that she didn’t reach out, but I also didn’t either. How her being so angry that people ask her about my well being and her excuse to me is “I just know you need your space and I don’t want anyone to talk to me.” She claims to never have had girl friends because she can’t get along with girls and it seems like a red flag to me. Maybe it’s because she pushes them all away? I caught her whispering to someone when I walked away from another passive aggressive situation from her and it was so petty I didn’t even say anything. I just get the feeling she talks about me and tells things that I tell her in confidence, almost like she just has to voice her opinion on something always. I feel this way because I notice she talks about others to me, like our other roommate. Her comments come off concerning, but at the root of it, she has no place in saying some of the things she says. How do I handle someone like this?",02Apr2020,1
236,"Hi! Before I start, I know none of us know what his true intentions were except for him and unless I ask. I just wanted to know what you guys think.

We’ve been friends for 3 years. We met my freshman year of college and it was obvious he wanted to get to know me from the beginning. Long story short he became my first kiss, later got mad at him because he got hickies from another girl, he apologized, I initiated the talk about what his intentions were and he said he didn’t want a relationship at the time. We left off on good terms and remained good friends. Sophomore year happened, he made the effort to hangout here and there but we never hooked up or anything.

Summer going into this school year was when things started to change. We began to snap a lot and he tagged me in a lot of things on Facebook. When school started, he immediately asked to hang out with him which then became a consistent thing throughout the school year. He would always pay for my coffee, always try to hold my hand, cook for me (specifically bought me steak cause I asked for it), bought wine, asked to go to the city and FaceTime over winter break, invited me to his pregame with his friends (which he has never done before). We were at 2 parties together and he would always stay by my side and try to get with me which was unusual because the past 2 years he would be hooking up with other girls. One of those parties I was dancing pretty close with another guy and I knew he was mad but just didn’t say anything. He remembered my birthday and bought a bottle to my party after I jokingly asked for one too. I got kinda touchy with some of his friends cause I was so drunk and one of his friends the next day told me he looked stressed when I did that.

Anyways, because of the coronavirus, our classes got moved to online. He asked to hang out with me the last day of college because he said “this might be the last time I see your face.” Once again, he pays for my coffee and holds my hand. We then go back to my room and we cuddle for a little bit. Finally he asks if I wanted him to kiss me and I say no. He asks why and I said I’m really nervous and bad at this stuff (I have no experience lmao). He ensures me that it’s fine but I say only on the cheek. So he basically kisses me cheek and goes for my neck and we then cuddle for 2 hours. Later that same night, I go to the bar with friends and I get a text from him saying he’s coming. I dance with my guy friends and then I see him hooking up with another girl.

I’m confused; did he just put all this effort throughout the year to just hookup with me? Or was he actually trying for a relationship? He has never had a girlfriend before if that makes a difference. What do you think? Do you think he thinks about this too?",02Apr2020,1

However, instead of supporting me, my parents started to side with my sister, criticizing me for giving her advice that I've never done myself.  As an 18-year-old, I think my situation is very different here now. I'm not growing anymore. I explained to them that I didn't want her to end up like me. My parents do support the sleeping early part, but they reminded me that I don't have the right to give this advice because I have never done any...so why should my sister listen to me? They also gave me examples of drug addicts and how no one would listen to their advice and how people only pay to listen to successful people. In their context, they are looking down on me, and I just don't understand why they can't support a piece of positive advice that I'm trying to give. Furthermore, they used my other bad habits against me, that aren't even related to sleep and height. I'm frustrated, and at this point, I don't know how to communicate with parents...Any tips?",02Apr2020,1

Every year in India approximately  800000 students appear for an exam after high school graduation called  The ""NDA"" to join the prestigious National defense academy only 420  succeed.

I was also preparing for it after I graduated from high school which was 6 months later and I had only one chance to clear it.

I  didn't want to drop a year for the exam. So I joined a college and prepared for the exam side by side. Everything was going just great,  like, freaking amazing, I was under the guidance of an ex-army officer and all.

In college, I met a girl who was nice...We were a couple in the freshers' party (she was also my classmate). After the freshers' party (like a few days later) she approached me and we started to have fun little talks and after a few more days we were literally spending all of the time in college together.

after a month I kind of fell in love with her so I decided to tell her my secret(about the NDA)  and that I will like to have a relationship with her.

she  said, ""WOAH, I didn't know that was your aim, so, after you clear the  exam you will go to a Pune (another city far-far away where the NDA is  situated).""

I said "" yeah, guess so""

she replied ""I can't have a long-distance relationship with anyone it's just so tough""

So now I had to choose between My dream job and My dream girl.

I made an amateur mistake and chose her, stopped preparing for the exam and decided to be with her.

but still, I had to appear for the exam and I did and didn't succeed. My parents had really high hopes and I failed them. The ex-army officer who helped me prepare told me ""it's fine"" (the look on his face did not justify the ""it's fine"" reaction thou).

After  2 months of the exam, I found out that she was already dating 3 more guys at the same time(excluding me of course) and I was just so crushed.  I gave up on my dream to be with someone. I told her about this and she said: ""I never told you to give up on your dream, you made the choice"".  I hate to admit but she was right.

There is a thing in India, I do not have a specific word for it. let's call it ""Parental rivalry"".

Basically two parents bitching about how their children are better than the other.

My dad's rivals son made in the NDA while I failed. I just am so envious of him but he deserves to be there.

Now  I am stuck here In college for 4 years with to see her face every day  (which is not the problem anymore as I will get used to it with time).

but the problem is the guilt that I am carrying around my shoulder which is just too heavy to carry. I failed myself, I gave up on my dream job and there's no going back now.

I  tried to look up for some motivational quotes like "" you make mistakes and you grow, you learn, etc, etc"" but these quotes seemed just so  VAGUE.

I don't know what my question is but I just fell like telling my story or my question will be "" what should I do?""

And during the beginning of this school year, she sexted a boy who’s a sophomore and she has never met him. That boy also lives in a different country. And she was fwb with this boy but she eventually started crushing on him. So, as a result the boy blocked her. And then my friend told me about all this and I asked her to not send any nudes to anyone else. But, she didn’t listen to me. The sophomore’s friend who’s a junior dmed my friend. And he started crushing on her. So, my friend also sent him nudes. After that, she sexted a boy who she knew and that boy also lives in a different country. This boy blocked her after she sent him the nudes. And that boy immediately blocked her after receiving the nudes. And soon that boy’s friends started dming her for nudes. So, my friend contacted that sophomore for help and he helped her out and that boy’s friends didn’t bother her again. 

My friend then started crushing on this boy who goes to her school and he’s also a freshman. My friend told me this boy is really popular. So she dmed him that he’s cute and stuff and that she has a crush on him. My friend also ended up sending nudes to that boy. This boy kind of played her since he sent her a pic of a dick from google. And he blocked her immediately after sending that pic. He then told his friends about it.

A few weeks later, a boy from that friend group who’s also a freshman dmed my friend that he’s crushing on her. So, my friend ended up sending him nudes. And that boy showed the the nudes to another boy from that group. 

Today, another boy from that friend group dmed my friend. He sent her heart emojis and stuff. He was being really nice to her. My friend said that he wrote her paragraphs. And my friend ended up sending him nudes and the boy also sent her nudes. After receiving the nudes, the boy wrote a paragraph to my friend saying that he doesn’t want to get in trouble or something. And that boy blocked her on Snapchat and Instagram.

So, I told my friend repeatedly to stop sending nudes to any boys. Since those boys are playing with her and  this is also illegal. But, she never listened to me.

I experienced a sex drive for the first time in my life, and I desired a relationship. While my body is in a much better state, my mind is still very much stuck. In a lot of ways I feel like I am unworthy of love. I have had men show physical interest, but I can't allow myself to be vulnerable in that way/I lost my nerve.

Part of if was, I felt like I needed to trust the men, not just find them attractive (and I did find them attractive). Casual sex is incredibly intimidating and not really something that turns me on. I would prefer to get close to someone first before becoming intimate.

I prefer not to tell a new partner about my lack of experience due to the fact that I know it's strange, but at the same time I feel like I can't really relax around  anyone due to the fact I need to tell them ""I prefer to go slow, going fast complicates things for me"" stock phrases, etc etc. I feel like a freak right off the bat.

At this point, I just want advice on how to get out of this mindset of defeatism. Should I even bother? For people in my situation and got out of it, was it worth bothering?

I am known as the uplifting, happy, responsible, social and sensible one (I hate talking about myself— but this is important context for my dilemma). 

I have a friend whom I met my first year of college. We have been friend four years now. They are the complete opposite of me and I have always wondered how our friendship works, but it just does. They have severe mental healthy issues (for which they refuse to get help for), low self esteem, not very motivated— you get the picture. I have always been their number one supporter. Encouraging them to be better. Not to mention, i am the only friend they have. I am always the friend who checks in on people. 

This friend who I have become really close to doesn’t do the same for me. Now, I don’t ask for things in return— I am a giver and I have accepted that I may not always get the same energy back, but it would be nice to get asked “how are you?” Every once and a while. I am exhausted, I am drained and with everything that has been going on, even more so. 

This friend in particular, is falling on the list of people I no longer want to invest time into as they don’t pour into me. It’s always about them and the issues that they’re having with their partner. Not to mention, they have had a completely different upbringing than mine (very privileged, wealthy, you get the picture). 

I have decide that this is not someone I want to be associated with anymore but it’s a hard conclusion to come to— but I know I must put myself first. Do I cut the friendship off all together, do I have the conversation with them in hopes that things will change? If so, how should I have this conversation?

It should be noted that 1) we are currently ROOMMATES and 2) I haven’t talked to them in almost a week because they said something so disrespectful to me that just triggered me and I completely shut down.

277,"Hey Reddit!

I was thinking lately and reflecting on all my free time. I am still blessed enough to have a job, however, from 6:00pm to 2:30am working hours. However, my morning and afternoon schedule is now freed up due to my college being closed due to the COVID-19 virus.

I live near NYC, which is the known epicenter of the virus for practically the world. As as I drive through the streets, I see lots of older/elderly people walking around, naturally. They need their medication, food and other necessities. 

That concerns me in regards to their vulnerability to virus, as well as their potential to get mugged or robbed due to this time of desperation.

I have free time, I have a car, I am healthy, and I am willing.

What is the best method of helping the elderly during this time? I’d like to collectively help a large number of elderly people by getting their groceries, medication and other necessities throughout the week. 

If this can work, I’d possibly want to make this a trend, where we can prioritize helping and protecting the elderly during this time and get more people on board with this.

Any advice is appreciated, because I don’t know where to start.

Thanks Reddit!",02Apr2020,1
278,"Hi Reddit, I created a throwaway account, because I'd like to avoid sharing my potential plans with my ex. If you can't be bothered with the backstory, I'll add a tl;dr at the end of it.   


**The backstory**

To give a little backstory, I was in Australia doing an internship about 3 years ago, I absolutely LOVED it. The city was amazing and I felt at home within the first week. I met a guy there and we started dating. The second week after we had hooked up for the first time, I kissed another guy, which was really messed up and to this day I deeply regret it. However, we talked about it and decided to continue our relationship (which was mostly long distance). Throughout the entire relationship he'd have these switches between being really sweet and complimentary and being really, really mean. He'd judge me for my past before him a LOT, despite me having only slept with 2 people before him and him having a long list of which he lost count and if he wasn't in a good mood, he'd say the nastiest things to me with the only purpose to make me feel like shit, always justifying it with that slip-up I made at the beginning of our relationship. Honestly, I should've left way sooner. Looking back I realize a lot more things than I did during the relationship, he was manipulative, a compulsive liar and a racist. Needless to say, we've broken up now and the break-up did not go down well at all.   


The final things he said to me hurt me deeply, amongst which threatening to share private photos I gave to him (which frankly I never wanted to send to him, but he guilt tripped me into it). Overall he's just an incredibly unpredictable person. He even ended up mass ordering food to my house after we'd already stopped talking (for which you pay at the door in my country) and at one point I had three delivery men at the door from various food places and multiple angry owners calling me not believing my ex from Australia did this to me.   


tl;dr: went to australia for half a year, absolutely LOVED it, started dating a guy, things became nasty and we broke up. 

**The actual ""I need advice"" part**  
So now that that's all behind me, ideally I'd just continue my life here, away from him, away from Australia, but that's where my issue comes in. The place I had my internship at offered me a temporary work visa to come work for them for 2 years and potentially leading to more. After all that went down with my ex, I spoke with them and told them it'd be wiser not to go. My parents weren't too fond of the idea of me going back to that city, knowing my ex is around there too. Understandably, because I'm not too excited about that prospect either. 

However, it's now been almost a year since we broke up and I haven't heard from him since. I work full time in my own country but I just know it's not what I want. Everything in me screams that I want to go back to Australia, to that particular city, because it was perfect for me. Size-wise, temperature-wise and location-wise. The only thing keeping me back being him. 

I think if I were to go back, I'd be able to avoid him for a while and he might not even know I'm back in Australia for the first half year. However, I'm sure he'd find out one way or another eventually and I just have no idea how he would react or behave. I know the safe option is to just make different plans, but I can't seem to let it go.   


I don't really feel like I can talk to many people about this, my friends would all prefer it if I stayed and besides I don't think they fully understand why living abroad is so important to me. My parents are a definite no, considering how they want me to stay and definitely not go to the place where my ex (who they never *really* approved of) is.

I remembered I had been told one time that it was that but I wasn’t 100% sure and then it was a little unhappy with me and I said go ahead and it ran off and I felt dizzy and like I was going to pass out and then I went to the sink and washed my hands and then I felt really guilty and I thought I did something wrong and I thought about it for a little while and then I forgot about it until about a week or so ago.

I've never experienced this kind of loss myself, and I want to do the best I can for my friend as she goes through this. I didn't know her fiance very well, but as far as I can tell, she was my friend's rock while dealing with an abusive family. They lived together.

Her late fiance's family has taken her in for an undisclosed amount of time, which seems good, as I think grieving together is probably a good thing? But she keeps turning to me to talk about how she's feeling, and I'm doing my best, but wondering if my words are enough for her.

I try to remind her to take slow breaths and count the second on inhale and exhale, to stay hydrated, to eat. I offered to order meals for her. I suggested games and other media in case she needed a distraction. I said that I can't imagine her pain, but that it's okay for her to not feel okay right now.

She keeps talking about how she doesn't know what to do with herself, what to think, that she loves her. I'm struggling to say what feels like the kind of thing she needs to hear, but I want to help her if I can.

My decisions have come out and it is going to come down to 2 schools. One is Emory, which is my top choice, and the other is a small women’s liberal arts school that gave me a large scholarship. If I went to the small school I’d be roughly 40k in debt after grad. However, if I went to Emory I would end up with 80k in debt! I sent in an appeal asking for an extra 10k a year but I’ve heard appeals aren’t granted much so I don’t want to get my hopes up. Anyways, the reason I’m leaning towards Emory is because they have a good business school, which the smaller school doesn’t have (they don’t even have a business major), and although I’m not totally decided on what I want to study (maybe Econ, business with a focus in healthcare, or CS), I feel like Emory could give me more “options” since it has a strong business school and the smaller LAC doesn’t. At the same time, I know 80k debt sounds like a terrible idea and I’m not sure if I can justify it just because it’s a good school. If the appeal works I will go, but would you guys consider 80k debt to be worth attending a top school? I don’t get as excited thinking about the LAC but it is still a good school, just without a business major. They do have an econ major tho.

295,"Hi. So I’m a Highschool student who is going to have to pick a major for college pretty soon and I have a problem. I’m interested in two paths. Becoming a Doctor and hopefully a cardiologist or become a Astrobiologist with a doctorate. Just to be clear I find both topics interesting and think I would enjoy either field I choose. However, being a cardiologist comes with a huge financial pay off compared to being an astrobiologist (NASA pays smeh). And I wouldn’t be trying to become a doctor just for the money. I really do enjoy medicine and everything that I’ve done to prepare for it. But on the other hand being an astrobiologist has been a dream in the back of my mind since I was a little kid. Just the idea of space and life in space fascinated me. I just need some advice on how to choose. And if possible is there a way to experiment in college?

307,"Hi! Before I start, I know none of us know what his true intentions were except for him and unless I ask. I just wanted to know what you guys think.

We’ve been friends for 3 years. We met my freshman year of college and it was obvious he wanted to get to know me from the beginning. Long story short he became my first kiss, later got mad at him because he got hickies from another girl, he apologized, I initiated the talk about what his intentions were and he said he didn’t want a relationship at the time. We left off on good terms and remained good friends. Sophomore year happened, he made the effort to hangout here and there but we never hooked up or anything.

Summer going into this school year was when things started to change. We began to snap a lot and he tagged me in a lot of things on Facebook. When school started, he immediately asked to hang out with him which then became a consistent thing throughout the school year. He would always pay for my coffee, always try to hold my hand, cook for me (specifically bought me steak cause I asked for it), bought wine, asked to go to the city and FaceTime over winter break, invited me to his pregame with his friends (which he has never done before). We were at 2 parties together and he would always stay by my side and try to get with me which was unusual because the past 2 years he would be hooking up with other girls. One of those parties I was dancing pretty close with another guy and I knew he was mad but just didn’t say anything. He remembered my birthday and bought a bottle to my party after I jokingly asked for one too. I got kinda touchy with some of his friends cause I was so drunk and one of his friends the next day told me he looked stressed when I did that.

Anyways, because of the coronavirus, our classes got moved to online. He asked to hang out with me the last day of college because he said “this might be the last time I see your face.” Once again, he pays for my coffee and holds my hand. We then go back to my room and we cuddle for a little bit. Finally he asks if I wanted him to kiss me and I say no. He asks why and I said I’m really nervous and bad at this stuff (I have no experience lmao). He ensures me that it’s fine but I say only on the cheek. So he basically kisses me cheek and goes for my neck and we then cuddle for 2 hours. Later that same night, I go to the bar with friends and I get a text from him saying he’s coming. I dance with my guy friends and then I see him hooking up with another girl.

I’m confused; did he just put all this effort throughout the year to just hookup with me? Or was he actually trying for a relationship? He has never had a girlfriend before if that makes a difference. What do you think? Do you think he thinks about this too?",02Apr2020,1

I am fifteen- fourteen back then, and live in a very strict part of the world where you can’t properly openly date, kiss, be gay or even ‘show too much skin.’ Circumstances aren’t ideal, obviously, and normally I wouldn’t talk about it but this story needs context, like,, a LOT of context.

I’m also a girl, so that doesn’t help :/. 

The guy this is about was my crush around two years ago, we never dated at the time, which lead to something weird. He would flirt with me, I would do nothing to stop it. At first I liked it, but it kept progressing, he started saying things like ‘I’d make out with you’ and ‘we could easily make out’ and ‘people are open these days a fwb relationship isn’t far off for us.’ Keep in mind we were 13 at the time. It was kiddy stuff. Stupid stuff- I didn’t take it seriously.

We drifted for a year. Last summer it started again. ‘You glowed up so much I miss you.’ Me, not knowing any better and not wanting to be unkind (or me being insecure, partially afraid of the fact I’d already flirted with him to an embarrassing extent,) replied with compliments of the same kind and let it continue, for the most part I didn’t object to any of it. I thought there was no harm because it was all talk. That’s how he is. 

I never initiated things. I just shut up and hoped it didn’t happen again so I wouldn’t have to dig myself deeper. And every time it happened, I didn’t do anything to stop it. I knew it wasn’t right, but at this point I was too scared to go back. We flirted through September, October. But we’d agreed we’d only ever kiss/ initiate something if neither of us was in a relationship. I’m telling you, it was kiddy stuff.  But this was our first year of high school so of course shit had to hit the fan. 

In November, we went on a camping trip with our school, where, long story short, he kissed me. In a tent. My first kiss. I didn’t object, I didn’t know what I was doing. I was scared, I froze and I didn’t really feel anything for him. But I said nothing. 
When we got out of the tent his first words were ‘There. Just get it out of your system.’  He proceeded to tell me he that besides, he was going for someone and did I know who? And oh it was so and so, who was one of my close friends and at one point my absolute best friend. We’ll call her L. She’s quite a character. Popular, stubborn and dead set when she argues. My heart dropped a little bit. But never-mind. He told me not to tell anyone about what happened.

The first thing I did was tell my best friend. Who told my other best friend. I know now that while he lied and told me he told no one, he’d told two of his friends, maybe more, by daylight. On the bus to the airport after our trip, I told a very close friend who lives thousands of miles away. He was a mutual friend, and he basically knew everything and told no one. But when I told him about the situation, that he told me he was going for L, our mutual friend revealed to me that a WEEK prior to our trip, HE HAD KISSED HER... (it’s confirmed. I know from someone close to him.)

I didn’t tell L for fear of ruining something she wanted and liked. I was afraid she would be unforgiving or tell people or tell my parents or something. But the past couple months, I’ve been there for her- when her friend group left her, I was there for her. We’ve had ups and downs but we value each other so much. 

They broke up soon after- like a month and a half later. He flirted with me at a smaller scale towards the end, which I deflected and turned the convo towards their relationship. Afterwards, he went back to flirting with me, asking if he could grab my ass next time and bs like that (I said no.) I let it happen. In January, a rumor spread that he and I kissed. He asked if I told more people than my two best friends and I said no and that was a lie because I didn’t want to keep it from my closest friends. I messed up. I know. They didn’t tell a soul though. I haven’t spoken to him since early February.

But now I want to come clean. I want to change. I made so many mistakes after November that snowballed and lead me here. He betrayed my trust with things I shouldn’t have told anyone, about people close to me. I am now sad and under quarantine, thinking of how I want to improve. I want to live in light- so that I have nothing to hide. So I’m going to tell her. Should I involve him, if so, how?? How should I handle telling her?? Should I tell her at all?? Sorry for the long and boring monologue. I just need people who read this to be on the same page as me. I am complicit in all of this. Not telling her makes me complicit. At lots of points I told him I wasn’t sure, but then he’d go back to it a couple weeks later and I felt a little bit cornered. Please help❤️",02Apr2020,1

I liked working for them and was wondering if I should I re apply for an internship there when things cool down or move on to some other company ? Big 4 maybe ? I am thinking that if they let me go but kept her, chances are that they did not really value me. My reason being that there were other interns who worked better than her and even my performance was better than her so why not keep the better performer ?

I'm worried man. He must be hardcore addicted by now since he was literally doingit in the OPEN. I started in the bathroom and graduated to doing it in my room at night whehn I was alone.

Told me he loved me as a friend all this time and our marriage was a mistake.

And it's like this all the time.

319,"I will **try** to put out this long story as a short one.

I'm a gay guy, only dated girls until I was 24, even though I pretty much always knew (deep down in my heart) I was guy. I met him at 25, fell in love automatically, and started dating.

We are soul mates. We share so much things together, the same kind of movies, books, videogames... our perfect weekend is the same kind of weekend for the both of us. When we want to travel somewhere, we are always aligned, we always think similarly and also we have the same opinion on the important things that matter (Politics, social issues, etc.) But being soulmates isn't exactly a good thing always.

Being too similar also makes me see in him the things I hate from myself. Also, sometimes the smallest things about him bother me: the noises he makes when eating food, the fact that he farts (I know everyone farts, I also fart myself, but for some reason it bothers me when he does it) and when he does stupid jokes I get pissed at him, even though I also make stupid jokes at him sometimes!  
Yeah. I seem to have a problem.

So... at this point I don't know if I should get married with him or if I should try out other guys because I've never been with anyone else. I love him and I want him to be happy, but the fact that I sometimes hate the things he does, makes me wonder if maybe I don't love him enough?  
I don't know. I just don't know.

We've been together 7 years, so I am guessing maybe it's normal that after this time with someone, you have this minor issues. But since he is the only person I've seriously dated, I can't compare.",02Apr2020,1

!!SCROLL TO BOTTOM FOR POST - FIRST 5 PARAGRAPHS ARE CONTEXT!!

Hi everyone, I hope you are all doing well during this time of uncertainty. I will try to make this as short as possible while still giving all details so if what I am saying seems generalized that is why.

Since I am now back home 24/7 due to ongoing world circumstances after being away for 6 months due to college, I have had a lot more time at home with mom and dad. Like... a lot. Even more than before I went away.

During this time I have noticed that my mother's mental has been declining. She has had issues with her mental wellbeing long before I was born, so for her to have issues is not abnormal, although I have a feeling that this is just different.

For a little bit of context she was diagnosed with bipolar about a decade ago and has had issues with alchohol abuse, with a number of other things before that, according to my dad, although I didn't want to find out more information.

During the summer of 2018 she was abusing alchohol BAD. Up to the point where she became suicidal and had to go to rehab. During this time she was also taking some sort of medication, which with combined with alchohol made it so that she would pass out and start seizing. ON 3 SEPERATE OCCASIONS, I would come home from school (at the time I was a senior in HS) and I would find her sitting by the kitchen table, seizing, not responding to what I was saying, and having to call an ambulance.

Ever since that time her mental health has been on a decline, and it seems to have gotten worse recently.

She is constantly rambling and she will randomly say stuff that makes perfect sense to her but doesn't to myself or my dad. For example, she will start talking to me but will already be mid sentence, and what she says is something completely random and incoherent sometimes.

She is also very irritable, for example, recently she has been falling asleep while standing up, so to say she will just stand at the kitchen counter nodding off, and she will do this until somebody talks directly to her or taps her, and when my dad or I express concern, she gets very defensive and angry.

Just within the last few hours, she asked if she could use my computer to file tax returns, at 12 in the morning mind you. She is sitting there for about 2 hours, while 80% of the time she is either staring at the screen or going about her usual rambling, she seems incapable of having a strong enough thought structure to do work. Sometime between 2 and 3am I asked her when she would be done, and she got defensive again. Screaming and yelling at me, saying how she hates living in this house and that I dont even do anything lately so there is no reason I should want sleep.

I don't know what to do or where to even post this, I already posted this on r/MentalHealth to see if ai can get any advice but maybe I can try here as well. Thanks y'all, especially to those who read the whole thing and will comment. Much love.",02Apr2020,1

Hi reddit,

In a couple of days, I have to submit my PhD dissertation.

I worked on antibody therapy against cancer. In short, all the antibody therapies out there against cancer are of the IgG isotype (a group of antibodies with distinct properties).

We have investigated the use of antibodies of the IgA isotype, which work in a different way. These drugs can be used in the lab against the same types of cancer, but kill tumor cells by a different manner. We show that IgA antibodies recruit neutrophils against the tumor (which is inefficient with IgG antibodies). These cells are the most numerous white blood cell in our body and kill tumor cells by tearing them apart (literally, its called trogocytosis and is shown in this movie with a parasite infected cell [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W1D3Fbgqaw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W1D3Fbgqaw) ). We hope that this method can be used as a different method of attacking the tumor, so options are available when current therapies don't work.

I still have to make up a title for my thesis though.. and I can't come up with anything decent, so I figured I ask around here.

I'm thinking about something like: IgA antibody therapy against cancer: Using strength in numbers.

But that sounds quite dull. Something referring to the name IgA or to the strength in numbers would be nice.

Thanks in advance for the help!",02Apr2020,1
324,"From a very young age, I have for the most part had a lot of control over how I think and feel. I made decisions on how I wanted to think and feel about things, but the problem is that a lot of those decisions were subconscious, and at some point I decided that crying and expressing what I considered to be “extreme emotion” was unnecessary and illogical. I’m more mature now, and have recently been reconsidering how I prioritize emotion and logic, to some extent. I’ve found that I cannot allow myself to reach certain levels of emotion, including that which would cause/allow me to cry. Now my first idea was to dig into why I might’ve cut this off from myself initially, but after a lot of thinking and I’ve come to realize I don’t have any past trauma that I haven’t come to terms with or that still upsets me. My only guess is that maybe there is a piece of something I’ve buried so deep that I can’t even allow myself to see it.

She was mostly saying it to make us feel bad because shed yell ""im going to put a bullet in my head"" and we dont have a gun. 

like my sister and i do every single chore in the house and we clean and we cook but we also have school work that we HAVE to do. my mom never did a whole lot anyway around the house considering she hasnt had a job in over 20 years. and she always picks fights all the time.

her main objective is to make my sister and i feel bad for her it used to work with the crying and screaming but ive gotten used to it over the years. 

keep in mind i stopped a couple years ago starting fights and i did start looking closer at her arguing style here the format a lot of the time:

- my sister and i angry so we dont make an effort to talk to her bc we want to do our schoolwork and fun things
-mom gets mad and calls us mean and bully her
-i ask her how
-mom says its said how awful of a person i am and she feels bad for me bc im awful
-i ask for example
-she cant think of any but im still mean
- escalates
- calls my dad
-dad believes mom

327,"Hello, I am seeking advice to resolve my internal stress towards how I am judged by other people. I feel like I’ve been incorrectly judged by people my entire life, from my perspective it feels like people think they are better than me and from my experience I notice that it’s easy for others to disrespect me. As if they have nothing to lose from losing my respect. I don’t see myself as a bad person at all, I strive to not put myself above others and I’m rarely one to judge. I’m kind towards everyone and even people that I notice others dislike. The only times I judge other people or disrespect people is when I’m hit first. I never make the first strike(verbally). When I was a kid all I wanted to have was good friends. I had a hard time doing that because I was quiet and socially anxious as a child, and this built upon my reputation growing up at school. I made friends but it was only a small group, and even my own friends went with the flow to act like I’m some weirdo just cause I was quiet and socially awkward. My own view of my reputation(I don’t know what people truly thought of me from the outside) is what halted me from being socially confident. And there was judgement that followed, which always got me upset. As I’ve grown older I’ve been less blaming of myself for this, and it’s more turned into a hate towards the people that are constantly judging. I don’t want to hate people, I don’t want to have conflict. I just want to be understood and I feel like the social circle I’m with just has a wrong impression of me. Every time I think about it, I feel bad because how others view me is completely out of my control and I don’t make active efforts to change how they view me. I just don’t think I deserve bad judgement at all. I have more characteristics that of a saint than a “bad person”.

What should I do to at least feel better about this, and maybe even spark a better impression to my past relationships that would inspire them to change their mind and be more friendly towards me?",02Apr2020,1
328,"I really am at a lost on how to help me and my bfs sex life anymore and I need help. We are both in our early 20 and have been dating for 2 1/2 years. Ever since about  a year ago I can probably count on one hand how many times we've had sex. And all but 1 of those times he was drinking. Sex was never a problem for us in the past we were actually very sexually active and with multiple partners. Since then he expressed that he wasn't interested in messing around with other people anymore, which I was fine with. But also our sex life has drastically plummeted since. 
I tried to talk to him about it once but he dismissed it as stress and told me that he still found me attractive. And it's not like I'm not attractive, I cant go anywhere without guys/girls asking for my number, hitting on me, etc. So I know it's not a problem with how I look. However it really does feel like he doesnt even want to touch me anymore. He really only puts his hand on my tits or ass when I playfully ask him to, or when we are just being dumb. 
It gotten to the point now that hes become somewhat dismissive emotionally aswell. He plays games all day (which I dont have a problem with because I also love video games) and will go hours without even looking at me or acknowledging me.
I just feel so unwanted and deprived, but at the same time I feel like I'm being selfish. I understand that hes going through a hard time internally, and I've also been very patient with him. But the time in between sex get longer and longer. 
Objectively I know that most people think I'm very attractive but now when I look I'm the mirror I want to cry. When he does want to have sex sometimes I get so emotional that I feel like I've ruined the moment. I find myself borderline begging for attention (I dont mean strictly sexual attention I would never cheat) from him, friends and strangers. I just dont know what to do at this point and I feel alone.

TL;DR: I really am at a lost on how to help me and my bfs sex life anymore and I need help. We are both in our early 20 and have been dating for 2 1/2 years. Ever since about  a year ago I can probably count on one hand how many times we've had sex.",02Apr2020,1

331,"So I would like to start off with the fact that none of this is about me, unfortunately it is still one hell of a shit show. but before I get to that I would like to give you a background of the person this is about.

My brother (15), is a type 1 diabetic, he has been that way since he was 6 months old. This has definitely made his life hard, but it is not something that can heavily hold him back in life. However he has always acted like his diabetes is like paralysis, as if it keeps him from accomplishing things. He has always brought up how he always feels awful he feels because of how bad his blood sugar is, even though he is the one who fails to take care of himself. In addition to that, he also is supposed to have insomnia. However, when we spent THOUSANDS getting him doctor visits and tools to help him fix it, he immediately lost interest and eventually became pissed when things like no electronics were allowed past nine since that keeps people awake. This began to make me suspect that he simply liked being a victim, or maybe he found that people feeling pity for him allowed him to do more of what he wanted. Then things only got worse. He began claiming he had ADHD, something that I actually have. My mother is an extremely sweet person, however, that comes with the cost of being a complete pushover. And he ended up convincing her to do something that I am nothing short of livid about. She gave that fucker my Adhd meds at possibly the worst time I could ever imagine. He had been awake for 2 days straight, already not good, not only that but he is also very prone to getting violent when angry. For those of you who don't know, Adhd meds can make people much more aggressive, not only that but they also dull the need to sleep. No, he didn't stab or hit anyone, but he got enraged over very trivial things that day. Yes, I fucking grilled my mother about giving him that pill, as not only is it already super stupid to give somebody prescription medication on a simple hunch that it could help him, but my meds are SUPER strong. As in the max dosage is 70mg, and mine is 50mg. Well to just throw my luck out the window, not only did he feel amazing while he was on it, he got hella addicted, and sure enough, my mother gave that fucker more. (Don't worry I'm getting to the trans stuff soon). So I have hidden my meds from both of them and I can ensure neither will ever see one of the pills for the rest of their lives. Well before I did so, I informed my brother of what I was planning to do, and he said that he would die without those pills at least 10 times. Except it wasn't a desperate plea, it seemed once again, more like a victim thing, like he wasn't really looking for the pills, but just the ability to get me to give him what he wanted. It seemed like he was trying to manipulate me (something that doesn't really work on me due to my fun childhood). Well, now he popped one hell of a surprise today and announced to the family that he was a Bisexual trans. Now I would just like to start out saying that I have never cared about any of that stuff. Straight, gay, trans. I don't ""love"" the LGBT or anything, I just never really found a reason to care, people can do what they want to do, as long as it isn't forced on me, how would I benefit from acting on other's preferences. I only stated how I feel about this whole thing to prevent people from just saying that I didn't want to accept him or something. But let's get to what you came here for. He told me that he wanted to be a girl, like the surgery and all, right off the bat. This is a kid that has acted 1000% more manly than I ever have. Honestly, my parents thought I would be gay, they never even began to think he would be gay, much less trans. I say that because I have heard that most trans people always give pretty large hints, like disliking basically everything their biological gender is associated with. He has always like manly stuff, football, videogames, outdoor activities, hunting, camping. Never has he cross-dressed, or played with dolls, or done anything even remotely girly. And the worst part is that when he came out, he was nowhere near ashamed or worried, he actually looked hella proud. And even odder, when he told my sister (the first to know) he said that he had been thinking about it for months, but when he told me he said he had known it all his life. The most disturbing is one that I hope isn't true. My sister told me, as I was not present so I am not 100% certain this is entirely accurate, that when my brother had informed my mother of his sexuality and gender, as my mother was crying, that he saw my sister, smiled, and said: ""I finally told her!"". Which while I see how that could be relieving, being happy about it right next to a crying mother is nothing short of really fucking creepy. Now I am nowhere near knowledgeable of how trans people behave, hence why I am here. Please tell me if you think he is bullshitting it or not because this could cause some serious damage really quickly. I've only is known for about 10 hours, so any hints that he is lying are pretty scare as time hasn't given him time to mess up if he is. I am just questioning this hardcore because nothing about his life, personality, or behavior even hints that he would be transgender. And as for motive, I think he has the potential to be low enough to do all of this just so he doesn't have to catch up on his schoolwork while my parent's process this. Yeah I know, it's a VERY shitty thing to say about a person, but trust me you would suspect the same if you were in my position. This kid acts in ways that I will never be able to comprehend.

But of course, if he is actually trans, accepting that will be no problem for me and my sister, my parents may be another story, but as I said, I have no problem with the gay, les, trans stuff, so please don't berate me for being ""hateful"" to him. I am mostly terrified of how far he could take this and especially what it would do to my mother. He has never had a problem with causing her problems for his own gain.

333,"I'm 16 years old, so this may seem a little bit immature, but I'm not sure if my reasons for loving/dating my girlfriend are valid. My girlfriend says that she loves me because I do this, or because I have this personality trait (for example ""you always look out for other people, even if they are just strangers) etc.. the Same thing with my friends, they all have specifics that they love their girlfriend/boyfriend for.

But when I thought about it, I don't have specific reasons why I love my girlfriend. Of course, I notice these things, for example, she is the bravest person I have ever met, who in the face of controversy, despite being scared still continues to push forward as if there isn't a problem. But these reasons aren't the reason why I love her. For me, the reason why I love my girlfriend is simply that she makes me happy, and I can be myself around her while feeling happy and comfortable. Whenever I see her my heart warms up, and my problems don't seem as big anymore, which I feel is rather shallow since it's not unique to her.

335,"Hi! Before I start, I know none of us know what his true intentions were except for him and unless I ask. I just wanted to know what you guys think.

We’ve been friends for 3 years. We met my freshman year of college and it was obvious he wanted to get to know me from the beginning. Long story short he became my first kiss, later got mad at him because he got hickies from another girl, he apologized, I initiated the talk about what his intentions were and he said he didn’t want a relationship at the time. We left off on good terms and remained good friends. Sophomore year happened, he made the effort to hangout here and there but we never hooked up or anything.

Summer going into this school year was when things started to change. We began to snap a lot and he tagged me in a lot of things on Facebook. When school started, he immediately asked to hang out with him which then became a consistent thing throughout the school year. He would always pay for my coffee, always try to hold my hand, cook for me (specifically bought me steak cause I asked for it), bought wine, asked to go to the city and FaceTime over winter break, invited me to his pregame with his friends (which he has never done before). We were at 2 parties together and he would always stay by my side and try to get with me which was unusual because the past 2 years he would be hooking up with other girls. One of those parties I was dancing pretty close with another guy and I knew he was mad but just didn’t say anything. He remembered my birthday and bought a bottle to my party after I jokingly asked for one too. I got kinda touchy with some of his friends cause I was so drunk and one of his friends the next day told me he looked stressed when I did that.

Anyways, because of the coronavirus, our classes got moved to online. He asked to hang out with me the last day of college because he said “this might be the last time I see your face.” Once again, he pays for my coffee and holds my hand. We then go back to my room and we cuddle for a little bit. Finally he asks if I wanted him to kiss me and I say no. He asks why and I said I’m really nervous and bad at this stuff (I have no experience lmao). He ensures me that it’s fine but I say only on the cheek. So he basically kisses me cheek and goes for my neck and we then cuddle for 2 hours. Later that same night, I go to the bar with friends and I get a text from him saying he’s coming. I dance with my guy friends and then I see him hooking up with another girl.

I’m confused; did he just put all this effort throughout the year to just hookup with me? Or was he actually trying for a relationship? He has never had a girlfriend before if that makes a difference. What do you think? Do you think he thinks about this too?",02Apr2020,1
336,"We both know this one person (Ashley). I don’t like Ashley, so I cut her off. Ashley wants to know why, and I wrote out a long, bitter text. Before I send it, should I have our mutual friend read it first?

337,"I'm gay. A homo, a faggot, whatever. It's two in the morning and I'm sipping on a four lokos to help find the words that I normally wouldn't actually say to others. I made this account two minutes ago and I have no idea if this is actually going to reach an audience with the reddit algorithm. I was just bored, stumbled on reddit, and had an urge to scream into the void. I have no idea where to begin to unpack all of this.

My family is not abusive of any kind. However, I'm stuck in this pandemic inside a town with three Catholic Churches, a religion that is very important to my dad. He is an extremely rational and loving human being; I have not once in my life heard him raise his voice, but I have no idea what his takes are on gay marriage, let alone finding out that his own son is something that his church has a history of kicking people out of. I have no idea if he loves God more than he loves me, and I'm scared that if he kicks me out or cuts me off I'll be alone and have no place to go. (This is going to get very dark so if you're not prepared to handle this, don't read).

I remember in 2012 when I was in middle school I came home crying because all of the other kids were excluding me from their social groups and bullying me because they all realized that I was a faggot before I did. When I got to my dad, he looked pissed, said ""not my son,"" with hard conviction and rationalized their behavior to make me feel better. I remember in 2015 when my family was stuck in traffic he went on a very long rant on how he did not support the gay marriage law in the Supreme Court, and sided with the judges that ruled against it because ""It's not a federal issue, not a states issue"". As if it were an issue to begin with. I remember is 2016 I had no one, and on my birthday I almost flung myself from my bedroom window because none of my friends had shown up to my own party and I was completely humiliated in front of my family. I remember not being able to explain to my parents or the therapist they forced on me for a month the source of all of this pain. I felt unworthy of love, and I tried convincing myself that I wasn't defected, that I would grow out of this, that this was all just puberty and I could tell all of the guys I felt closest to me that I was bisexual so I could participate in guy talk (I'm actually a pretty masculine person and I tread fairly easily in these waters, it was not difficult at all to talk sports or play video games or talk about girls, and I'm a very easy going 'puppy dog' person so it wasn't hard for them to take me under their wing). I remember a year later my guy friends locked me in a room with one of them for a dare. I was ordered to strip down and suck my friends cock and have a picture taken of me with his dick pressed against my ass to make sure that the deed was done, while everyone else was outside giggling and listening through the door crack, to see if my friend would really fuck the fag. I remember them putting a girl in my house and was extremely disappointed the next day when I revealed I wouldn't have sex with her. I remember having no choice but to act enthusiastic for both of these situations, because hey - opportunities like this won't come to me for a while, I'm attractive, and I was told by my friend that if I said anything about what happened in his bed he would beat the living fuck out of me. I was traumatized to my core, and I never spoke a word. I never came out until I was late into my freshman year of college, early of sophomore year. Never thought twice about it, never felt the need to take that risk. I remember coming home to my dad that day I got raped and he joked about me needing to be prepared to have a wife and I needed a girlfriend. It's these offhand comments that I feel signal a terrible outcome of this situation. I've always struggled with being emotionally available and idk if this is too big of a bite for me to take.

He's a family-oriented person and I have a large family who I know some would accept and love me, but I also know they wouldn't stand against him if he told me to leave. This pandemic is getting to me, I'm stuck inside this house and I'm going a little stir crazy. I'm an outgoing, adventurous person and I'm so  bored that I might just take a chance, but I'm terrified that he'll kick me out. This isn't exactly a topic to open to my friends so anonymous strangers please help. I would ask the 'coming out' subreddit but its all ""safe space :)"" and I'm a little drunk and I don't need a safe space. I can operate just fine outside of one, and I need brutally honest opinions on if its wise for my mental state if I came out. The more brutal context y'all know = the better and more honest the answers I'm going to get. No safety nets.

(Don't worry about my mental health. I am fortunate to be strong enough to be able to cope with this healthily and I have no lasting damage. I'm happy, my friends can count on me for emotional support and I always practice self care. I've pulled myself out of the gutter before. I've learned not to move on, but to move forward with my experiences and make me a stronger person. I've just never actually spoken out loud these issues, I'm drunk on lokos, and being trapped in this house is digging up all of these memories and I don't know where else to put them or ask for help. I just want to be social and talk this all into the void. It's not like any of you know who I am, so it's not like there's any consequences lol.)",02Apr2020,1
338,"I choose to reject people before they ever could even get the chance to reject me. I have no expectations for anyone I meet and I feel I almost subconsciously plan to not know them for long anyway. I think my first love really messed me up. I was so infatuated but he played me like a fiddle and did some really horrible things after. I think the fact that everything I did towards him was so genuine that it hurt so much more when it ended badly.  That was three years ago and since then I can behave very outgoingly and I say for the most part what I want to say because I have no fears. No one can hurt me if I don’t care. I enjoy my relationships and make the most out of both friendships and sexual relationships, but I no longer have an all to put into them. I don’t care if they leave me, I don’t care if they try to screw me over, I don’t care what happens. I believe I fear that true genuine pain again. I don’t know how good or bad this response is. But when i’m up late at night and especially in quarantine I crave that kind of true love and innocence I was once able to feel for others.

I also know she is still in contact with this girl and the doors are open for this to happen again if she really wants it to.

343,"i apologize in advance if this sounds whiny, i am just super lost. i just turned 20 and i’m in my fourth semester of attending a community college for music recording. i know deep down that school is not and was never for me. i knew ever since high school, but the pressure from school counselors and parents to attend college after high school was super immense. but i know that music is my passion, and the only career path my brain is able to be interested in. i love to sing and i write songs and i know how to produce and play some instruments averagely. and i will say community college helped me find out that the music recording/engineering/mixing process is very interesting. i think what’s really stressing me out is all these extra classes that i simply do not care for, such as music theory and all of the gen eds that are required. i feel like all they do is set me back and keep me from actually wanting to attend school and learn what i need/want to. i know everyone has to do it but again i am not a school person at all, i’m only here because i don’t know what else to do. it’s basically a case of i love to learn but i hate school and how it operates. the thought of having assignments due and being expected to do certain tasks puts me in a very hopeless mood. 

i know i don’t necessarily need a college degree to pursue most music careers, but going about doing that outside of college is super hard. and i feel like i don’t have enough knowledge to do that. this is where i’m stuck, because the classes that i want to take are very informative and i want to continue taking them. but that comes with the burden of dealing with gen eds and just school in general. i’m now especially unmotivated due to all of this virus stuff and us having to stay at home 24/7. dropping out of school to pursue music would be so risky and i just don’t feel like i have the resources to do so. in fact i’m not even sure that i 100% know what i wanna do for a job. of course living off of making music is the dream, but that wouldnt happen any time soon unless i got very lucky. if anybody out there has any insight that would be greatly appreciated. thank you for reading this far.",02Apr2020,1

Since I'm still taking classes and have my jobs, plus my mom can be a bit much(loud, always wanting to talk) I decided to stay in my dorm. It's okay. I been using a rice cooker and my bathroom sink to feed myself,  so not ideal( I have the option of the community kitchen or dining hall, but it makes me nervous). Anyway, I sub lease in the summer and it's been difficult to figure out what would be the safest place. So, option A is a house with two or three girls who go out and smoke weed(in normal circumstances I would have no problem with that, in fact it'll be a plus), however I'll have my own bedroom and furniture in the basement and a bathroom close by( no word if the upstairs girls use that). 

Option b is an apt.  Currently there is no one else there, but the roommates are looking for people. In my experience,  I usually end up alone in such cases but I think more people (international) might be staying in town, so who knows. Own bathroom,  no bed(so I'll have to buy one). I typically like apts because I tend to feel ""safer"" but I heard rumors about the virus spreading within apt complexes.

I feel really selfish and irresponsible wanting to leave and stay with him for even a few days, as I’m very worried about his mental health. But, my dad is at home with my 2 brothers (14 and 17) and my mom is on a cruise ship who’s return/docking date seems to be pushed further every day, and obviously it’s not making my dad feel great either.

So this night i dreamed that i went to my grandparents cottage with my parents and brother.

And every time my brother and i would try to sleep this big animal looking person came into our room and TRY TO KILL US. Eventually my dad came to check on us and he found this huge animal man standing in our room throwing knives at us. He grabbed something and tried to kill the man but he just threatened with his knives. He finally left and i grabbed a saw, but my brother had nothing so protect himself so i told him to scream if he needed me and i wouldn't hesitate to kill the man. I went to collect our shampoo and some other  stuff so we could get home, then i heard my brother scream and then i woke up. 

I was gonna go that cottage and stay for a bit because of all this corona stuff, but now i kinda feel like is shouldn't go.

368,"My cousin and I went to the same Elementary school we had the same friends, same classes we used to do everything together. Although when middle school came we went our separate ways. We went to different schools we also grew apart because we didn’t spend time together as we used to, we got different group of friends etc. Now we are both in high school and we go to different high schools. I’m currently in 9th grade and it’s been tough making friends because I’m antisocial I joined a sport I thought I would make friends in the sport that I joined but I only made 1 out of 15 of them. Only one person from that sport that I joined talked to me I tried talking to the other kids that are in the sport but they barely talk to me, so I just stay quite during practice and do my own thing. While my cousin she joined band and soccer so she has plenty of opportunity’s to make friends. Whenever I see my cousin and she tells me about her drama, or show me pictures of her friends, I can’t help but feel jealous. Like I wish I was outgoing like she is. For example she be having this large group of friends and then there me with only 2 or 3 friends. I don’t mind having a little bit of friends but I just can’t help feel jealousy that my cousin has a big group of friends. I know it’s only my freshman year and I still have time to make more friends during my high school  year but I can’t help but feel jealousy.  My cousin would also be in her phone and be laughing at what her friends send her while there’s me whit a dry phone my friends barely texting me. Although when I see my friends in person we talk allot but we barely text. Am I jealous of my cousin or I’m I upset of her having more friends than me. ?

369,"So I’m currently a senior in high school. Wow class of 2020 am I right lmao. But there is this girl that over liked for 14 months now and it’s different because I genuinely like her. Being around her and just spending time with her is so great but that all stopped during the summer before senior year. We got close at the end of junior year but I put schedules never allowed us to hangout she was always at summer class and I was at football practice. Once school started again I was talking to her and things were ok but there was another guy who was talking to her as well. October rolls around and it’s time for Homecoming and so I plan this whole thing with her favorite drink and flowers and all this stuff and she said that she would say yes but the other guy had just asked her the day before in person without an asking so I didn’t know about it. I didn’t let this hit me that bad I thought it was just bad timing. In December there’s a holiday concert that our school does and she was in it while I was in the pit orchestra for it. After I confessed and asked her if there was a chance for us. The answer she gave me was that she didn’t want to keep leading me on and that she felt that she’s a very independent person and just isn’t looking for anything right now. Which I believe her since she’s never dated anyone and a lot of guys liked her. After that I was really sad and I tried to get my mind off of her but no other girls even compare in my opinion like of course there will be attractive women and such but none make me feel that way except her. With college decisions coming out there’s a high possibility we will either be going to the same school or really close to each other. So I really want to keep chasing her because there is just something different about her, she makes me feel just happy, safe, and comfortable. 


For the record as of now we are I would say friends leaning toward acquaintances. She added me on her private snap chat and instagram. And we occasionally talk and help each other out if need be. Like if I called her or texted she would pick up. She’s definitely not actively avoiding me or anything.",02Apr2020,1

Normally I’d never think to tell my parents that I smoke but in this recent climate I really just wanna be able to smoke without sneaking out at night... my parents are pretty anti it but now I’m 18 should I just tell them I’m gonna be smoking?

373,"I'm sorry I'm not familiar with posting on Reddit but I just moved and due to the shelter in place order, I haven't made any friends in my area and need some help. Here's what's happening. 

Last week around 1am I woke up to someone banging on my screen door. (I live alone in a one bedroom apartment) I panicked got my pepper spray and looked out the peep hole but saw no one. I sat by the door and listened for a couple minutes with a terrible feeling in my gut. I called my supervisor from work and asked him that even though I didn't work the next day to call me and check on me in the morning. I wanted someone local to be aware of what happened just in case then went to sleep with my pepper spray nearby. In the morning I felt silly like I'd overreacted. I thought maybe a neighbor slammed their door and in my sleepy panic I mistook it for someone banging on mine.

Tonight it happened again. 2:08am. This time it wasn't banging like before but knocking and most certainly my door. Again grabbed my pepper spray and while I was getting it I heard footsteps. I checked the peephole and saw nothing. This time I was more calm and collected and I thought for sure it was a neighbor and I'd solved the mystery. Then a car engine stared and I looked at the parking lot. Someone was backing out, but all the spots were still taken. That scared me. Someone had come in knocked on my door and gone back to their car? So I sat by the window watching. After the car was completely out of sight a woman came through the alley and walked up the stairs directly to my door. I rushed to my bedroom thinking it was the perfect chance to hear her open the neighbors door and compare it to the sounds I'd heard earlier. But she didn't go to the neighbors. She knocked on my door. I turned on the light and she knocked again. I have my door and a second metal screen door with a deadbolt so I opened the inner door with my pepper spray and asked what she wanted. She looked at me asked if Larry lives here. I said no and asked if she needed help which she said no and turned to walk away. 

Should I be worried? Am I completely paranoid to think someone might be testing how I respond to late night intruders and planning something bad? My friends from out of state are split on it's an accident/coincidence and it's malicious and I should call the police but I don't know what to think of any of it. I'm scared and just want to feel safe at night. Please if you have any advice or insight on what I can do I'd really appreciate it!",02Apr2020,1

375,"Okay so first of all, I understand my parents care about meand that they wish me best but the way they enforce it is ""old school"". I'm gonna start with my dad. He cares about us but I don't know if he is abusive to some extent or not. He makes a big deal out of everything, saying no will piss him off and talking back will just result inme either getting insulted, maybe beaten or physically harmed or he will just go on a huge rant about us. He broke my and my brother's phones twice. Both times was for minor inconveniences. I am also here to blame because I keep forgetting stuff they tell me and I don't know why. He is authoritan, only personality trait of his is rambling about politics and religion and being pissed. He does love us just his hot headedness makes him unreasonable. He is impossible to compromise with, beated me up once with umbrella after he beated ME up for losing it and calling him psycho because he was pissed at me over something minor (can't remember what). Also he beated me with a belt when I was playing 3 minutes longer than his 45 minutes. He is a good person, he bought us new phones after he was pissed and was sometimes apologetic. Here is another thing about him, he rambles about ""other kids"" like ""other kids don't have X"" ""other kids don't have Y"" ""I've had it worse, my father was way worse than I was"" etc. First of all, I did not ask for anything he bought, I was always modest and I understand why he says that but it's so annoying. Moving onto my mom. She is a total opposite of a karen, she was beating the everliving fuck out of me when I was very young (3-9) years but she really is a nice person. She used to blame me for everything but she changed. However her biggest problem is, when I mess up, she insults me and when I talk back enough times , she will physically harm me (no marks, usually something like hitting me with palm open, pulling my hair). On the good side I was always able to open up to her about certain stuff. Moving onto my siblings. I have a brother, who likes winding me up and my parents dont do shit about it. He always goofs around when with me in public places. He is also a horrible student and my online friends hate him. He also says weird ass stuff when online with friends to embarrass me. Not suprised why they hate him and in top of that, MY PARENTS DONT DO SHIT ABOUT HIM. Worst punishment he received was a few months ago when dad beated a fuck out of him cause he lied about grades (it left marks iirc) but that's about it. They may just tell on him and other than that, nothing. No restrictions and despite being a bad student and annoying as fuck they just don't fucking car. My sister almost always sides with my brother and if I ever hit her my dad would be pissed. One last thing is this weird feeling I had from within that told me there is people having it worse and shouldnt write this post, I don't know why I always had conflict from within when talking about this stuff and that same feeling from within tells me I am overreacting. For the record, I am M14, eldest child in the family, 4.23/5 student in middle school, with brother M12 dad M45 Mom F38 and sister F8.",02Apr2020,1

388,"TW: Sexual assault

So I have this close friend of mine (let’s call him Phil) who was sexually assaulted a couple years ago. At the time, he didn’t tell me who it was (because I also unknowingly knew and was casual friends with the guy). Their friendship ended after this event of course. But Phil never seemed bothered by it and never brought it up. Fast forward a year, and I find out who the person is (let’s call him Blane); Phil thought he saw Blane at the mall and this gave him a panic attack. This was the first time I found out who the person was and that Phil really was impacted by the sexual assault. From this point on, I knew it wasn’t nothing. 

A couple months later, Blane messaged me and essentially just wanted to hook up. For years, I’d thought Blane was kind of hot and I was so curious about what his naked body looked like. Through my weakness and hormones, I agreed to hook up, and Blane and I had sex. (Coincidentally the same day Phil had sexual with some other random person, but that’s just a random aside.) All the while, I KNEW Blane assaulted Phil. But I still went through with it. I even talked to my friends about whether or not I should do it. And still did it, because my friends weren’t terrible humans like me. A couple weeks passed and Phil was not doing so great mentally (he already struggled with depression and suicide), and I just wanted to do something for him. So I confronted Blane. I called him out on the assault. And no matter what Blane said, I just kept going at him because I wanted to say what Phil couldn’t. I love Phil like my little brother and Blane just wasn’t going to get away with this. I felt good about this and even told Phil that I confronted Blane (but I didn’t tell him anything else).

Now, it’s about 11 months later and for the time being, I didn’t feel guilty about what I’d done. I’d figured it was a secret, but Phil didn’t need to know about what Blane and I did. Especially because I confronted Blane. But recently, Phil has opened up. He talks about the assault openly. And how it’s affected him so much. He even shared with me that Blane was the 2nd time he had been assaulted by someone. I couldn’t believe that he had been through so much pain in his life. Phil has confided in me and has trusted me to be his big brother, to be his friend and mentor, to be a rock for him; to be the one man in his life that’s not a toxic a**hole. And for the first time, I feel incredibly guilty. 

I feel so guilty that I knowingly slept with the man who assaulted him. That I laid in bed with the man who brings him panic attacks, random crying fits, the constant feeling of being unsafe, all of these terrible things. It has been keeping me up at night (hence the 5am post). I’ve been dreaming about Phil everyday in this quarantine. Like literally every day I’ve had a dream about him, whether I’m in bed at night or it’s a 2pm nap. Tonight, I was so distraught over this, I woke up out of my sleep screaming. I’ve had stomachaches, headaches, and general body pains over all of this. (And I’m not even remotely ill.) It’s like this has been torturing me and now that I’m stuck at home, the internal screaming that I’ve apparently suppressed has come to the surface. And now I’m being tortured when I’m awake and when I sleep. 

So what do I do? How do I deal with this? Someone out there probably has a great idea and I’d love some guidance on this!

Hey guys, I'm just needing a bit of advice about this one. My (f26) partner's (m32) kids mother (f28) has been on Centrelink her whole life, she doesn't work, aside from a small stint YEARS ago, this put aside, I ignore it as it isn't my business. HOWEVER, she has a bit of a drug problem, she's given multiple half assed attempts and has had a ridiculous amount of support from her family to get clean.  She's not interested the slightest. Fast forward, everyone is pretty sure she's pregnant, the dad is a drop kick, in and out of jail, beats her, real controlling POS. We have the kids every second week and although the new bf is a prick, he's only a prick when the boys are at our house and although she's a lazy mum, they have a roof over their heads. We don't want to take them away from her completely as the boys love their mum. Now onto the issue, the oldest (7) has diabetes, were always the ones that follow up with appointments and his care, she's quite slack with this, plus there's been times where they go to school without even wearing underwear so they get to us and we're having to buy them new clothes, school stuff etc. Now, we pay child support, obviously, but that money goes to cigarettes and other shit, not for the boys, considering all they eat is crap at her house and to be honest they're at their grandmother's half the time (boys mums mum), we've just found out she's getting the new boyfriend a dirtbike for his birthday, she owes my partner over $600 for unpaid childcare bills and we didn't want them to miss out so he paid it on the condition shed pay it back. She didn't obviously. She gets a heck tonne from Centrelink plus the bf does too but they're not registered as being together so they get double the income, now being Australia they just received a huge bonus.

This cycle really de-motivates me, and I now have large spans of time where I don't make any music at all. It feels very overwhelming sometimes between all the things I want to do and the lack of anything getting done.

I eventually want to make something from this hobby, but I know for a fact that this cycle is not going to get me anywhere.

399,"So this is gonna be an odd one. I have a friend, who I've always known her mom has been very controlling. And recently I've been considering moving out soon and getting a house and bringing a few friends with me to split the expenses. And I asked her if she wanted to join and after having a talk with her and another friend who actually lived with them for a few years, they both told me they don't know if she can really survive not having her mom control her life. It sounds weird, yes. Her mom isn't abusive or anything. The worst thing her mom has done really has been not letting her access her own funds and forcing her to deposit her checks into her mother's account. Is that illegal? Possibly. That's not what I care about though. I just want to try and convince my friend to get out of that situation as I'm worried that what our friend said could be true and she couldn't survive without someone controlling her. 

Also sorry if it may have sounded like I rambled or didn't always make sense but I'm typing this at 6 AM after having slipping in and out of sleep and binge watching GoT.",02Apr2020,1
400,My boyfriend and I have been doing long distance for a month and half as I’ve been in uni. I got home last week due to the coronavirus and was planning on living with him for a while. We had two days that were incredible and everything was perfect and then on Friday he was slightly distant. On Saturday he told me he’s not sure he still loves me and I packed my stuff and left. He cried when we talked on Saturday and said some things that really concerned me such as that my ex boyfriend who he hates and who treated me badly would be better than him and that he wishes he could disappear. He says he has no emotions and can’t even feel love towards his mother. Apparently this started two weeks ago. In conversations on Sunday and Tuesday he’s repeated that he feels nothing for anything and all he thinks about is going to work and paying the bills. He also said he wants to disappear and he feels that he’s not good enough. Three weeks ago we were talking about the future and we were happy. There wasn’t any indication before Friday that he was unhappy although I had noticed that some of his behaviour was unusual. He’s usually a very active person but he was staying in bed a lot and said he was fatigued as well as not playing video game’s or other things he enjoys. As someone who struggles with depression it seems like he’s depressed but he doesn’t want to get professional helps. He says he’s used to being on his own and wants to fix this on his own. I’ve told him I’ll stay around as his friend and we’ve put the relationship on hold until he’s in a better place. I’m just not sure if I’m doing the right thing by trying to encourage him to talk and do things or if I’m pushing too much and projecting from my own experiences and I should give him space to handle it on his own.,02Apr2020,1
401,"I was supposed to graduate high school in 2016, but I dropped out due to a really poor living situation. I went back a few years later and graduated. I always told myself that I was never going to go to college, because I wasn’t good enough and that I couldn’t afford to. 

I told myself that I’m not smart enough to write letters for scholarships, that my single mother is below poverty level and isn’t going to care about helping out, and that I don’t want to be in student loan debt. 

I thought that I could get a decent job without college, and boy was I wrong. I am now $20,000 in credit card debt (I don’t even know how that accumulated, and please don’t push further or judge me), I don’t have a job, and I’m basically a deadbeat meanwhile all of my friends are graduating. 

As I hung out with an old friend awhile ago, she told me all about FASFA and how FASFA pays for her entire tuition and then some. She did mention that your parents can’t make a lot of money in order to qualify, to which I’m totally qualified on that part. 

I’m tired of feeling sorry for myself and how I “didn’t get a fair chance in life” due to emotionally and physically abusive parents. I want to get my life together, but I don’t know how to get started on college.

My grades weren’t the best in high school, so I figured that I’d go to a community college for 2 years, and then maybe transfer to a university. I’m also thinking about juggling a part time job in order to help out with my credit card debt while I’m in college. Does this sound attainable at all? Or am I just dreaming?",02Apr2020,1
403,"This lady works in a local shop that I use regularly. We got to know each other and we both like going for walks in the same area so for the past year, we’ve been meeting up most days to walk together. I live in a rural area and no one else likes her but I thought that was  just because she’s slightly eccentric. She seemed lovely to begin with but over time, she’s showing her true colors. She’s extremely controlling, bossy, interfering and nosy. She has reported people to various authorities for all sorts of nonsense eg: a neighbor who keeps one dog instead of two (My ‘friend’ thinks that’s cruel). Some of her opinions are quite disturbing eg: old people don’t deserve healthcare (for anything!). The final straw for me was when she told me how she had beaten the crap out of someone else’s dogs whilst she was working at their house. The dogs were just being a bit hyper. I’ve had enough and want to avoid her. The problem is I still need to use her shop. Also, she now expects to go out walking with me daily and knows what time I’m out at. She’s generally waiting there when I arrive. Is there any way I can get rid of her gradually, without a big confrontation? How do I tell her I think she’s obnoxious without causing more problems?

407,"My boyfriend of 3 yrs cheated on me a very long time ago with his ex girlfriend. It was almost 2 years ago and our relationship has healed for the most part. He has a lying issue, and he can be a bit rude and headstrong, but I do love him.

I recently stumbled across some old DM’s between him and his OTHER ex, we’ll call her B. They dated probably 4 years ago, but they had a serious on and off for quite a while when they did date. After he cheated on me with his other ex I asked him to block his ex girlfriends- I have no issue with him having female friends, but that was my request to help get my trust in him back. I don’t really believe *all* exes can stay friends without feelings still being there, so after he cheated with one of them, I wasn’t really comfortable with him conversing with either of his former girlfriends. 

Well, as it turns out, he continued to talk to her behind my back for about 5-6 months. As far as I can tell from the conversation, they didn’t kiss/have sex/ and she clearly was NOT interested in him. But he almost seemed like he was coming on to her. He would ask her to “accidentally bump into him” just about every other day. Then he asked to see her dance (she’s a dancer, for context) and said he thought she was great at it. I guess at some point they met up in a Walmart parking lot and “just talked” from what the convo says but I’ve got absolutely no idea what did it did not happen.

At some point he just stopped messaging and so did she I guess. All of this conversation ended in December 2018, with the exception of a meme she sent him a few days ago (which is how I discovered this conversation- he was logged in on my phone and when I got the notification I was concerned. I know it was wrong of me but I had a bad feeling when I saw her name).

Am I even valid in bringing any of this up considering it happened June-December of 2018? I’m incredibly upset and distressed that he voluntarily went behind my back like that for six months, but would it be better if I didn’t bring up old dirt? He’s changed a lot and become an incredibly lovely and loyal man from what I can tell so idk how I feel holding old stuff against him but considering I JUST found out, I’m having trouble with it.",02Apr2020,1

409,"First time posting, sensitive subject and I don’t know how I should be perceiving any of this.

I’m 26, and one day I was driving to work and my mother called and mentioned that she told me father she wanted a divorce completely out of the blue, just like she mentioned it to me, completely randomly. 

It’s whatever but unsettling for me because my father is 70 and my mother is 52. This makes it a little difficult as my father is retired and money is tight and his health is “just okay”. My mother on the other hand is perfectly fine, works a regular 9-5.

It was explained to me that nothing had happened between them. No fights no cheating no nothing, she was just unhappy and has been.

So shortly after this was all dropped on me, my mother began moving out and into an apartment she got “for cheap”.... I’ll explain that in a bit.... and she was taking everything. Like furniture, kitchen items, dining room table, hutches, everything she could. 

This left my retiree father with literally half furnished rooms, a nearly empty kitchen, and missing half his home.... which btw he can not afford to live in by himself. Now he has had to go out and buy items because she took even the simplest things like pots and pans and basic items with money he really doesn’t have. 

When I mentioned to my mother that it’s not really right that she is taking so much from my father when she is the one who wants to leave and that he has done nothing wrong to her so if she wants to leave then leave these basic items behind... she snapped at me and told me to stay out of it.

He applied for senior housing in town but is very stubborn and proud and will not leave town, he will also end up staying where he is until he has no more money because he has to wait and wait for the housing authority. He also accepts no help and always says that he doesn’t need anything and everything is fine.

Now my mother is out of his picture and seems to not talk or care about him.

She came to my house to take a couch I didn’t want for her apartment, she showed up with some guy and didn’t mention anything about a boyfriend or anything before coming or even after coming, just dropped hints and kept referring to things as “we”. 

When she came it was awkward because internally I’m standing there like uh wtf is going on right now.

When she was here for a grand total of 25 minutes, she dropped off a tote full of things like damn near every school assignment of mine from elementary school, report cards, school pics, certificates, my baby blanket, my favorite puzzle AND it also contained items from my fathers mother such as pictures of him and his brothers and family growing up in the 50’s to the 80’s and had so much cool stuff about my father that honestly I didn’t even know about before because he had me so late in his life. 

The box also had cards from my father with nothing but love and support for my mom for whatever she was doing.... including a giant financial mistake he begged her not to do 20 years ago but she did it anyways and it led to the loss of thousands of dollars and a house. 

After my mother left I called my girlfriend at work and told her everything, she did some snooping. My mother cheated on my dad like 10-12 years ago and I believe it was with the same man she showed up at my apartment with. This guy is also into realty and property management or something and that’s how she got this apartment “for cheap” because I know she can’t afford it if it was full price. Also this guy left his wife as recently as 30 days ago.

The time frame for these events is the last 60 days.

My question is, why is my mother doing this? 

Why did she give me that tote? It’s cool but I don’t have room for it and first grade journals from me are nostalgic but utterly useless to me. Sure I’ll give my kids the puzzle and I want the pics of my father and his family but why would she just drop that on me like that?

Why did she say nothing about this guy she showed up with?

I feel that it’s not okay to get married to someone 18 years older than you and to stay with them until you realize they’re older and you still have “life left” and to leave them randomly and take almost everything and leave them with almost nothing and not even give a shit

What do I do with this tote? Obviously I’m going to keep the stuff having to do with my father but what about my school stuff? Like is it wrong to throw out my elementary school scribbles and ramblings? If anyone in the world wants that stuff, why would she not want that stuff?

I just feel like she’s a piece of shit at this point. Even my girlfriend hates her.

The response I got back said they had not received anything...

I replied saying it had been taken out, and the contract was sent with the check. No response. It has again been over a week and no one has replied.

I can't talk to them about it since everytime I've done so so far I've lashed out, or been explained to why ""Your emotions are wrong"" and I nodded and fully accepted it until I went home and realized I still feel like shit.

Anyways, this isn't about that. Since I'm staying home for a while now, I decided to pick up some skills. Like drawing, another programming language. I wasn't really into it until I remembered who else wanted to learn to draw/another programming language and also tries to improve their skills and feels like shit when they don't since they have too much going on in their lives to commit as much time to it as they'd like.

I instantly knew I needed to be better than them at it.

I thought this energy would eventually go away, since this is a demanding course, but its been about a week, and it hasn't. Everytime I feel a little tired, I send an update about what I've been doing to my friend, listen to their disheartened appreciation (or 'Oh fuck you' depending on the mood) and it gives me the strength to carry on.

They want both time to dedicate to friends and time to acquire/improve skills that are necessary to thrive in the field we'll both eventually enter. I'm entirely content with staring at the group chat once a day. 

I'll outdo them in anything they can choose to commit to, not due to skill but due to the sheer amount of time.

I don't know if this is a good situation or not. I mean, I'm learning new things. I can draw semi-competently, and I know a new language. 

And I always wanted to do these things, I just never had the drive.

But I know what's driving this is the motivation to punish them for all the hurt thinking about them causes.

There isn't really anything else I could be doing right now. Can't leave house and our college is keeping quiet for some reason. I was pretty much just playing video games for a while, trying to do something productive but losing motivation.

Maybe they don't really care at all, and I'm just pushing myself on imaginary, but spendable energy. 

But I know they care a lot, since most of their friends have talent in something or another and bonding over being talentless was something we used to do.

419,"I work in a fairly large company but my team is a small team (&lt;10) that's on a client's site. We are all very committed professionals and we work very hard to deliver high quality projects on time. Unlike us, the management has an awful lot of issues, there's been an awful lot of micromanagement going on, project managers blaming us for their mishaps (a very common example is that they keep assigning projects to the wrong people and then blame them for not delivering on time!!). As a result the client keeps complaining to them about their management style and they keep changing or firing managers. We've had around 10 different managers in the last 6 months and right now for a team of less than ten, we have 2 project managers, one people manager and one other manager that these ones report to!   


The people manager was the new addition two months ago and the person was there only for two months. Now that person is gone and a new one has taken over since last week and due to the pandemic, we haven't met this person, except for a cliche welcome email.  


Yesterday we received an email for this \*people\* manager that had a very very spicy, arrogant tone about filling in our time sheet and there was absolutely no need for such an arrogant tone whatsoever. This is beyond my tolerance and I do not want to allow them to talk like that to me ever again. I wanted to escalate that but I thought I probably first have to discuss it with this person to follow the escalation procedures. There's going to be a 1-to-1 meeting soon and that's my chance to bring this up (first time talking to this person). How do I say this to them in a politically correct way?!

This is what their email is like, with a title all in caps, shouting: ""\[URGENT\]: LOG YOUR TIME""

\&gt;Hi guys,

\&gt;How are you getting on? I hope your week is going smoothly.

.If you are receiving this email is because you haven’t logged your time for yesterday and today.

\&gt;In  general, I don’t mind if you do it on a weekly basis at the end of the  week, but when it’s month end I need you to submit the last days of the  month pretty timely, because I need those hours to work on the billing for the client. 

\&gt;Please, do submit your hours ASAP today. 

\&gt;Also, I have noticed many of you haven’t registered for our 1:1. Are you having time constraint? 

\&gt;If you do, reach out to me and let me know what is going on, if you can actually join this week, please, book a slot asap.

\&gt;Thanks,

This happens sometimes when the month ends before Friday and it's normal that the manager in charge would send us a reminder to fill in the time and this one could have been said completely differently like: ""Hi guys, Can you please log your time today as we're approaching the end of the month?"" 

TL;DR: A new \*people manager\* has sent us an extremely arrogant email in a nasty commanding tone. It's beyond my tolerance while I'm committed to working professionally on an ongoing basis and I need to confront that, AKA provide feedback on this.

425,"This story is a bit long but I think you'll need the details to give me meaningful advice.

A few months ago my mom starting dating this fella. He seemed nice enough and she gave him the keys to her apartment, he installed his tv on her wall. They broke up a couple days ago. He called and wrote a million times and was quite aggressive so I told her to block him. He still had the key so I hired a guy to change the lock. 

He wanted his tv which is a reasonable request, so I uninstalled the tv and put it outside, after which I wrote to him that if he's not gonna come get it by next day, I would come and put the tv outside to the big trash area. He didn't come so that is exactly what I did, since I just wanted all of his possesions, and him out of my, and out of my mom's life. 

Here's the catch: she gave me a wrong number by mistake. All the messages I wrote to him went to an unused number. She gave me the real number so I called him and asked him to stop coming, ever. At some point I said that if he comes there again I'll come by with my buddy, and another guy took the phone from him and basically told me he is a gang member and if we don't give the tv back he's gonna cap me. The air flew out of me like a balloon.

So I went to check if the tv is still there where we left it... which it isn't. It's gone. If I had the right number at the start, or if the tv was still there this situation could have been resolved already. Unfortunately this is not the case. I am a little worried to call the police about this mess, because if somebody's threatening your life you should probably seriously consider your next move.

I am not terrified, merely anxious. But if somebody's gonna come knocking at the door I will be.  I do not have the money to buy a new tv, as I'm kind of living month to month.

426,"I just wanna say this is why I wish we were more educated on taxes and things like this in high school because I am lost here. i’m a 20 year old female if this matters (just hoping that’ll make me look at little less stupid and a little more naive if my suspicions are correct)

So there is the whole stimulus bill, where you can receive around $1,200 from the government depending on your income. My uncle (who has been the one claiming me as a dependent since i moved in with him and my aunt in junior year of high school) told me that college students were exempt from this so he’s going to claim me as a dependent on his taxes. 

Context: for some reason this man still hasn’t filed my taxes, even though I gave him my W-2s weeks ago. Before anyone says anything, I know, I fucked up giving them to him. I’m just so used to him taking care of that stuff. But I really should have filed for myself, as they (aunt and uncle) do not provide any financial support for me nor do I even live with them anymore. I moved into my own place in December. i’m my own adult and should have taken care of it myself.

I gave him the go ahead. Like whatever, sure, i won’t get any $$ from the stimulus bill anyways so why not. and then i told my boyfriend about this. Boyfriend tells me college students aren’t excluded unless they’re getting claimed as a dependent. Which is exact opposite what my uncle said. 

So.. is my uncle just trying to screw me? Is there some benefit for him in claiming me and now letting my receive my share of this stimulus check? He told me when he got his $500 from the stimulus check he’d split it with me.

It happened on January 25th (over 2 months ago)

It was very obvious he was drunk(by his bad spelling and bad grammar) and he asked her to come over but not bring me. She replied she wasn't interested and then left his ""it would be fun"" message on seen. Nobody ever told me until today.

I get that she was probably trying to protect my friendship and not making a awkward situation but I'm a little hurt that she wouldn't tell me.

He sends pick up lines memes at night (now stopped cuz I called him out on it) and oh and when I texted ""are u serious?"" to the pick up line, he goes ""hell naaaah"" but sends another one the next nighr. Anyways he calls often (which he already used to do before but now acctually a bit less). He always texts first, or calls first, I barely initiate. His excuse when calling me during the day is to help him with homework but we end up talking about tv shows and music and life.

Once it was silence on the phone so I shouted his name and he said ""sry there is a cute girl on my instagram feed. I zoned out"" 🤔
Also he once asked me to send him a HW thing and I said ""say the secret word"" (which is ""please"" and i always tell him that, he knows it) but this time he says ""please u cute (my name)"" and I go ""awww alright"" and he is then quick to hang up and says bye quickly.

2 days ago, I initiated text to ask him if he wants to meet up (I never asked him before) so he can pick up smthg that belongs to him. He replies 3 hours later, although i know he is on his phone cuz he is watching my instagram stories. He replies with like a joke about the thing that belongs to him but doesnt say if he wants to meet up or not. I reply back to his joke and then he hasnt replied since but keeps on watching my stories. He calls me yesterday and asks as if nthg and I dont mention the fact that he ignored me but im cold to him. Also calls this morning twice cuz I didnt answer and then I called him and asked what he wanted and he goes ""ohhh... ummm... i forgot why i called"" and then talks about homework and tv shows. Im kinda cold to him and say i have to to after about 4mins of talking. We usually talk for like 20+mins.

433,"Hi all

First off, let me just start with that here in South Africa the whole country is on lockdown. So no going out unless it is for food or a medical emergency etc.

A while ago my cousin told me that she and her husband is having spousal problems again (it happend a few years ago also) becaise she wanted me to know why she wasn't herself for a while. I am not gonna go into detail because that is her story to tell and not mine.

This morning she told me that she and my other cousin (my dad's other brother's son) and his friend has gone with her to her parents house to stay there because shit hit the fan and there was a massive fight. I know how her parents were the first time and constantly criticised her for wanting to leave her financially stable husband.

I have this gut feeling that I need to go to her and just hold and hug her. I have never had this intense gut feeling ever in my life. I am really really worried.
Also her parents house is less than half a mile away but with the lockdown I am conflicted. Also my parents doesn't know about that she and the others are there. It is none of their business but still I can't leave the house just because.

What should I do? I want to get my car and just go but with the whole lockdown I just don't know. We all have been staying inside except to go to the store twice in the last week...",02Apr2020,1

2. I don’t think I’d ever be able to call him his name without wanting to die and

441,"Okay, so the heading might be a bit of a cliché but hear me out. I’m 20 year old girl who never dated anyone before nor confessed my feelings towards someone, because 1.) I identify myself as pansexual and 2.) I never had any authentic attraction to someone and it takes time for me to feel the “feels”, not because I am picky but I crave the connection rather than the facade a person shows. That’s why I never had the chance to feel the feels towards someone. However, after meeting this girl everything just went south. Never would I thought that I’d like someone like her because our circle of friends are just different. Mines were more of the normies, the ones who submitted our requirements early and the ones who can balance partying and doing our responsibilities. I am not saying that she’s not responsible like I was, but her social circle is wider than I have. Moreover, she’s surrounded by rich kids who didn’t really care about how their money is spent. But fast forward to the current events, after ignoring each other in our first year of college we eventually became friends. I learned that when her friends are not around her facade fades, she becomes this really chill person who stays at home all day and watches netflix. Also, she’s kind of a weirdo like I am. We got along really well to the point that we were inseparable. She’s with me every day, sat next to me in class, we ate our lunch together, we sat on her car blasting off music as we chilled, I went over her house as if it was mines and sometimes even invited me to sleep at her house after watching a movie. Those things never bothered me before, I thought it was normal but I have to admit that my stagnant routine shifted into a more exciting one. She made things exciting, she made me feel needed and somewhat important because she told me things she never told anyone. Then one day, when I thought everything was normal- the feels hit me in the middle of the night when I saw a picture of her with another person (who had a crush on her and knew about it). I felt chills all over my body and I couldn’t stop cussing (mumbles only) and I literally felt my heart beating out of my chest. I was so angry and maybe a bit jealous? 

Okay, that was when it hit me. I knew that I liked her more than I thought I possibly could. But at first I was just denying it, and that maybe my fits of anger and jealousy was rooted from my loneliness. But months passed by, we became closer. CLOSER. She would sit next to me and hold my arm, she would put her legs on my legs, and then she’d look for me when I’m gone. Also, after being with each other all day we always talk and call each other during the evenings. I was hella confused and misinterpreted that maybe she liked me too. 

Then, when our friends had a small gathering where she happened to come along because I invited her. I found myself almost drunk, and there were thoughts on my head. Thoughts like: Maybe I should confess that she likes me too &amp; she probably likes me back and whatever. I hesitated of course, I don’t want to lose our friendship. I mean there’s no way this girl could like me back? She’s straight... Right?

So, I tried to avoid the confrontation and went to an empty cottage to sober up. I was literally praying that she won’t come to the empty cottage because I knew I had to confess, as if if she goes to the cottage it eventually means she likes me back. False.

But nope, she went to the cottage and I saw her walk her way to me. She even looked for me. Then boom, I confessed. I don’t want to say the cheesy bits but I basically told her that I really like her a lot and that I understand if she doesn’t like me back. She laughed and told me that she knew I liked her. Flabbergasted, I asked her “How? When?” then she said way back (this was before the picture incident). So it got me really confused because why did she try to cling on me too much when she KNEW I liked her like that? 

My hopes went up.

Then she also told me that sometimes she thinks that maybe she likes me too (she’s tipsy but I know she can handle alcohol better than anyone so yea) and even asked me if she’s bisexual? OOOF.

Anyways, that happened and we went home to our separate homes. It didn’t really matter to me that night but then all the shit happened on the morning after. She tweeted “Ahahahah fuck” and “Ajoke” and I knew that she was referring to me...",02Apr2020,1

I’ve recorded myself speaking on a few occasions since then and I DO pronounce certain words with an accent and I have no idea how or why. It sounds normal in my head (for example, teabag becomes tea “beg,” lamp becomes “leamp”)

444,"First let me start by saying, I’m working in a hostile environment, or was..(different shift now). I work security detail and I’m fairly new, just coming from high school. In said job I have a guy(ex marine) that acts hostile towards me, let’s call him (Pete). In this job all my coworkers are older then me.
    So, I started working close to 2 months ago. (Pete) has always had a little hostility towards me sense i started. (Jabs towards my age, looks, and personality). It was never something I couldn’t deal with. In my job there usually only two guards on site and I worked 2nd shift (2pm-10pm) with him.
    I guess someone started a rumor that I was talking bs behind his back. So he came in and “confronted” me about it. We start talking and it starts to get heated. He started to ask if I was gay, or sucked dičk on weekends. When I put my hand in the shape of a “knife” he got super angry and started saying I was not above him, he said stuff about my age and him being my upper, but him being ex marine I guess I upset him by “knife handing”. I got upset and told him he’s not a marine anymore. I told him he was a civilian with military background. So he was no high then me, we were both equals. I think I snapped him because he picked up a stapler and threatened me with it! He followed up with “I’ll give you two punch’s to knock me out, come at me like a civilian”. At that point I just left and went to a different office within the building.
   Our shift ends and I go home and distress with some war zone. Next day I come to work he’s off and I’m with a different person. I think I made a mistake not telling my supervisor that day. I felt like if I was to report the problem i would put my self at risk. So I didn’t report it till 2 days after. When my supervisor talked to me he just told me he’s switching my shift with 3rds (10pm-6am) which I told him I couldn’t do because of family matters. It doesn’t even matter in the first place because I still see (Pete) before my shift. We have to come in 30min before shift to ensure we have people to relieve the other officer.

445,"To keep it short and sweet, I have a part time job as a book keeper, and another job as a fashion model. I intentionally keep my BMI at about 17 - 17.5. 

Since I have been in quarantine for 2 weeks now, I've gained 2 kilos. Which may not seem like much but it's a lot for me considering I need to keep my figure slim as a part of my income. And it is noticeable on me. I do physically look bigger. So I'm shocked (but not really, let's be real) to discover I've put on 2kg and start thinking about how I'm going to quickly lose it again. But then I start wondering if the extra 2kg on me might be beneficial in a global pandemic?

I don't have any immune problems and I'm 21 so I'm not exactly high risk but the question is, if you're underweight, would it be wise to gain a few extra pounds to prepare for potentially contracting covid19, like how a bear gains weight to prepare for hibernation, in a way. I hope that makes sense.

I also recognise how vain this sounds, to be talking about weight in a crisis like the one we are facing. I want to note that I am also extremely worried about actually important things like my beloved elderly neighbours and my grandparents, but also some of my income depends on me worrying about vain things like weight.

TLDR: Half of my income (assuming we make it out of this mess and can return to normal life) depends on me being quite thin. In quarantine I gained 2kg. Is it wise to go on a diet and more intensive exercise to lose weight during a pandemic?",02Apr2020,1

448,"Background: 
I’ve been with my girlfriend for 4 years. Honestly, can say I love her. She says the same back. We are pretty open with our feelings and we even have our own lame language lol. I’m not perfect, but I’m always making an effort to improve myself. Whether it’s getting angry, or leaving the seat up and even staying in shape. I’m constantly working on improving.

Family is huge for me. So I make sure to prioritize her family just as much if not more. Her younger siblings have a different dad and he walked out on them so her mom and them moved in with us. I provided for all of them the best way I can. Wether it’s with the bills, repairing something in the home or even giving her younger brother some “manly advice”. I give it the best I can. I make sure to take them into consideration all the time and include them on vacations, trips, Theme parks, resorts, bowling alleys, arcade visits you name it we’ve done it. I love them just as much as I do my girlfriend. 

Things like anniversary’s or birthday are important as well. I’ll make sure to plan out things to do for them. Whether it’s out to eat, a trip or a home BBQ I make sure to try my best to make it memorable. 

I don’t do this cause I expect something in return, I do it cause I genuinely care. Despite all my efforts - our sex life could use some improvement in regards to quantity. We’ve done a ton of different things in the bedroom. Different speeds, positions, outfits, role playing, times of the day, locations etc. outside of this we both work out very regularly to stay in shape. Despite these effort we have sex very little. 

By little I mean we have sex once every 2 weeks. I’ve tried so many different approaches to this and I’m always being turned down. Asking gets shut down. Initiating gets turned down. Scheduling gets responses like “we’ll see” which eventually never happens. Overall if I try 10 times maybe I can get lucky once. 

Obviously, I’m not trying to force her. At this point my feelings are so hurt. I feel ugly. I feel like I’m terrible in bed. I feel very very insecure. I’ve tried to speak with her on several occasions regarding this and how it makes me feel but I always get the following responses: My sex drive is low, I don’t need it like guys, guys should be the one initiating, I’m older. Even though we aren’t far in age, I want her just as much I did when we first met. I’m 27 and she’s 29.

When we DO have sex she always says it’s amazing. I make sure to finish her off before I do myself because I honestly feel like an asshole if I don’t finish a woman. I’m a dude, lol I could turn on a switch at any second and get myself there so I make sure to take care of her first. She says it’s amazing and she’s never complained about our sex.

The reason I bring up all the things I do and our relationship dynamic is because I feel like I check off every box of what a great boyfriend should do - and although I’m not perfect I try my best to hit all those spots while being a good boyfriend and figure for her family. I feel like I’m making 100% of the effort here.",02Apr2020,1

452,"So, about one year ago I accepted a new job to work on implementing a new software product.  It's been challenging and a great learning experience, but at times I become so frustrated at unrealistic deadlines and absurd workloads.  I know this is fairly normal work working as a technical BA/systems analyst, but I think that something I need to overcome professionally is being able to take that kind of adversity in stride.  

We just went through a reorg., and I've been assigned several additional support duties that are MUCH more technical in nature than anything I've ever done before.  My role now requires some custom development work, as well as learning to maintain something that I have never even worked with before.  I just accidentally took down one of our test environments, which required me to ask another team for help.

This is just one relatively small setback, and yet I feel so defeated and frustrated.  This shouldn't be that hard, but I have had no opportunity to learn about these new pieces and I'm apparently expected to just figure it out overnight.  A former team member is helping me, and an actual developer offered to help with this as well - but I'm just having a hard time even focusing at work today due to these frustrations.

Recently, my (17M) girlfriend (17F) disclosed to me that her ex-boyfriend (17M) of two years was sexually and emotionally abusive. Eventually, this led to sexual assault. Rape.

I am not asking for legal advice. She does not want to take legal action; there are too many downsides to taking legal action (you can search up why yourself).

This POS’s actions have emotionally damaged my girlfriend in ways that I won’t even pretend to comprehend. She has bouts of feeling worthless because of him. I recently also found out that she has been self-harming too. 

This brings me back to my original question: should I take revenge? 

He’s not going to be facing the justice system and so I want to deliver that justice myself. I understand that it probably won’t help toward my girlfriend’s recovery (which is infinitely more important), but I cannot stand that a POS like him walks off scot-free.

457,"Listen: I know. I've been reading the news, listening to the radio, etc. This is mostly anxiety related and I just wanted some advice in this specific situation.

Since the quarantine first started (we live in Georgia, USA), I've been taking it pretty seriously. I'll admit that at first, I didn't think it was \*that\* serious. None of my coworkers did either. But then, I got laid off and I was stuck at home and I found out my nephew (who is 18 and has heart problems as well as asthma) had it. Over time, I began to read more and more about COVID-19 and started to understand that this was not nearly as small a deal as I initially considered it to be.

I started to get really cautious, and I told my mom that we should start stocking up. Then, we began to self-isolate. This is where it gets kind of annoying. My sister wanted to come over and grab something, so we told her to go through the back of the house where we rarely ever go and to try not to touch anything. Her and my little nephew (who is 6) went through the back, and my nephew started to cry because he didn't understand why he couldn't come see us. He kept saying, ""But I'm not sick! I promise!"" and we tried to explain to him why he couldn't come in. Eventually, he calmed down and my mom left him a bowl of ice cream to eat on this counter in the way back of the house and closed the door. They ate ice cream on either sides and talked to each other.

Well, the next day, my sister doesn't call to check up on my mom like usual. So, my mom, worried, calls my sister and come to find out that my sister was EXTREAMLY offended that we didn't let her into the house, even though my nephew was told he has the virus and had to be quarantined at home. My sister had been exposed to him, as well as her whole family. But none of them, it became clear, had been self-isolating or even kinda quarantining together and had been hanging out with friends, going out and playing around, having pool parties as usual. It started to make me more and more angry because she would constantly make fun of me for taking this seriously.

She made Lysol jokes and later joked around that she and my niece (15) licked the handles of my mom's car and got mad when we told her that she couldn't come over until the quarantine was over. After my mom invited a bunch of people over (bc she wasn't taking it seriously at first either), I ended up panicking and staying in my room until they left and then disinfecting everything afterward. 

I have several reasons for this:

\-My mom is 54.

\-She has lung problems.

\-She doesn't have insurance. 

\-We take groceries to the older people in our neighborhood so they don't have to go out. 

My sister told my mom (I could hear her on the phone) that I needed to stop worrying my mom with things she's already worried about anyways and that she's about ready to kick my ass for being so crazy about all this. But I'm literally just following CDC guidelines. I know I'm in the right, but everyone (except my mom) keeps telling me that I'm overreacting and making fun of me and just completely disregarding the situation. Now, my sister and my older niece and nephew are all mad at me and I don't understand why. People are dying, and while my sister and her family have medical coverage, my mom doesn't. 

Lastly, here's the biggest reason why this is important to me:

My mom tried to kill herself several years ago, and is still suicidal. I was the one who made her throw up the pills. She was dying on my bedroom floor, and I'm not gonna lie. I'm still traumatized. I was only 17 at the time (I'm 20 now). My mom explained this to my sister, and my sister still said that I was just worrying my mom too much for no reason. But I know my mom, and I've been with her throughout all her depressive episodes since I was a child. I know that her going out or inviting people over isn't her just having fun. It's an unconscious hope that she will catch this virus and die. I explained to my mom that I was just trying to watch out for her because I couldn't watch her almost die again. My mom promised me that she would take this seriously, and told me that she hadn't fully recognized that she really was being reckless. She told me that it wasn't fair to me that she does that and that she's going to try harder not to do it. 

I feel like my whole family thinks I'm the enabler with my mom but sometimes, I feel like my brother and I are the only ones who tell her the truth and force her to get help. The rest of my family thinks hiding things from her, avoiding telling her the truth, encouraging her to smoke put (which honestly, is probably the worst thing for her because it makes her anxiety worse---if it actually helped, I'd be all for it!), and telling her to get over it is helping her. 

I know that logically speaking I'm in the right. But growing up in such a manipulative and narcissistic family, it's hard for me to stand up for things I believe in because somehow I feel like if I really believe this then I have to be wrong because nobody else around me seems to.

Anyways, am I overreacting? If I am, please be honest.",02Apr2020,1

It was a pretty bizarre exam with questions that ranged from being visual based problems to number sequences. The entire exam was really just about recognizing patterns. :/

I had the most difficulty with some of the visual problems since there was just so much shit on the page.

Anyways, I scored 130. I don't feel like a 130 though, especially not after paying $20 to take an hour exam....

459,"My bf (22M) and I (23f) have been at odds all week and I miss my partner. We live together, have joint accounts and everything ! He’s been pissed off about something for the past week - I don’t know what the hell it is and it’s pissing me off.  It’s been easier over time to just express myself and say why I’m upset to him, and I struggle with expressing myself in general. We’ve been together for 1 year and 8 months - were about to have a baby in the next month or so and I’m sick of dealing with his brick wall. 

He snapped about using my charger after he lost his. I can’t afford to leave my charger in the car and just said “I don’t want to leave it in the car” a he got pissed off and wouldn’t take the charger (just childish !) He’s always dry humping me in bed and I couldn’t take it anymore so I just got up and moved to the couch (he got pissed off and refused to cuddle). I explained that it makes me feel like a piece of meat and it doesn’t turn me on at all - he just got pissy like a giant child -_-.  Im 8 months pregnant Im huge and I don’t want to grinded on like were dancing in a night club. 

I’m just tired of being ignored- I always try to open up and tell him what’s going on with me and he doesn’t do the same for me. Should I just resort to ignoring him fully ? I’m feeling like I need to give him the same treatment , Im tired of trying to be close to him when he doesn’t seem to want to do the same. He shares his stupid feelings with his big sister but he doesn’t share with me - I’m not jealous because I know siblings have a bond but I am his gf and I’ve been here for him for over a year I just think we would be close enough to share how we feel -_-. it just makes me feel like we’re nowhere near where I thought we were 🤦🏾‍♀️.

466,"Reposting this since my first post didn't get any help, I hope that's ok.

I'll put a tl;dr on the bottom, but I am looking for some insight into navigating a new/faded friendship. Some background to this story: I met a guy a few years ago. We only had the chance to hang out for one night, but we really had a good time together, hung out the whole time and had really good (friendship) chemistry. There was some alcohol involved, so I don't remember if we exchanged Instagrams at one point, but the next day, I saw he was following me, so I followed him back.

That was pretty much the end of that, was hoping we could somehow form a friendship out of it all, but it never happened. It's now been some years, we still follow each other on Instagram. He doesn't post often, but when he does, I like his posts. He watches my stories (which I have heard doesn't mean anything, but I know I only watch the stories of people I about care about in some way, so idk) and likes some of my posts.

I recently lost a friend who I hadn't had talked to in a few years and it got me thinking of all the people I don't talk to, but do care about. I wrote him a dumb message ""hey, what's up,"" and after a few days of no response, I felt like maybe I could have planned that better. I wrote a somewhat longer message with substance and that seemed to have sparked a response.

We ended up talking for a couple of weeks via Instagram. He'd write me a message one day, I'd respond the next, then he'd respond the day after, so it wasn't a quick back and forth, but he expressed to me that he was working multiple jobs and I'm not one to criticise if someone doesn't respond quickly. I know people are busy, life happens and sometimes I know I just don't feel like responding to people.

But I assumed it was a good conversation since he was writing longer responses, asking me questions. I thought, if he really didn't care, then he wouldn't ask me questions to continue the conversation. All in all, I thought it was going well. But then he stopped responding. It's been 5 weeks now and I just feel like I won't be getting a response back anymore. It's unfortunate and hurts a little because I know we have similar intrests and thought he's a cool person. Maybe he decided it wasn't worth his time because we live in different countries, maybe I'm boring, who knows. But I'm also confused because he doesn't follow many people on his account, so it's not like he ""friend collects."" I think I kind of get the short end of the stick because I was the one who initiated and wanted the friendship so it was ultimately up to him if he wanted it as well and it seems he decided it wasn't for him. But it's also frustrating because he still watches my stories and likes my posts. So I just feel like ""hey, what's up with that??"" We're also adults and not teenagers so I feel like an idiot for being caught up on this, haha.

I think I know the answer is just to drop it and accept he made his choice about it, but maybe I'm looking for someone else to confirm that. Or if anyone else has any insight, that would be helpful.

tl;dr - started writing with someone, all seemed good, they stopped all of a sudden and now I'm sad about it. But this person still likes my pictures and watches my stories. I just don't get it.",02Apr2020,1

468,"Around a week ago, a landscaping company had cut my internet cable by accident while they were working on the lawn around my complex.  Thus, our line was disconnected and we did not have service.  I went to Suddenlink to get it fixed and they came out around a week later and replaced the cord.  Later that night, my internet went out again and we were wondering why.  I went outside and a neighbor whom I don't really communicate with said that whoever replaced my cable had also disconnected his line.  Thus, he rectified the problem by disconnecting my line an plugging his back in.

Brief summary is that my has had depression since middleschool, but it has hit its peak this year as she is taking antidepressants, family problems, traumatic experiences, therapist sessions don’t have, and everything is haunting her.

It’s happening so often now because of the virus having everyone stay home and her having insomnia that she has a lot of time to think, and it gets bad. It’s such a hard topic to discuss to the point where she says she wants to die, and that breaks me. Her saying this is hard to hear because I love her so much, and I’m not enough to stop her from wanting to die, and a lot of the things she has tried aren’t helping.

491,"So I am a 22yo student, and I've been diagnosed with anxiety about two years ago, but had it for at least eight years (when looking at the symptoms and looking back and recognise what was actually going on). I have been in on-and-off therapy, but everytime I've had to find a new therapist, I'd get stuck in my head and not be able to actually reach out and find one.

Now on to my problem right now: Self-isolation and keeping up the daily routine.   
The last two years self-isolation hasn't been a problem for me, I used it to cope with stress from school, and to keep myself out of social situations, simply out of fear of not knowing what would happen.  
For the last 3 weeks we've had to study from home, and since the first day I've been avoiding it as much as I could without confrontations. Which has put me in kind of a never ending circle I can't get out of. I'm behind on assignments, and my teachers seem to be pretty understanding, but the fear of confrontation is still there.   
Everytime I pull up an assignment with the intent to get it done and turn it in, my heart starts racing, and it's almost like it's harder for me to just get it done than to not get it done and pretend i don't have to do it. Like I would rather be ignorant than stressed, but it still stresses me, because I know that the only solution is to just get it done.

I have struggled with social anxiety some, and lack confidence to talk to others.

However....

I feel like I have some narc traits.

I almost never accept blame, unless it’s something very apparent I have done wrong. But in more minor situations I always argue and even if I feel I could have done something better, I feel like I shouldn’t have to and the other person should be the one to fix themselves.
Kind of like “maybe if you weren’t annoying in the first place” or something like that.
I can be very condescending when arguing as well. Putting them down for arguing what they are are arguing.

The problem is I don’t care or feel like I should change, yea I’m not perfect, but I just blame the other person.

I am aware this seems very narcissistic.

Also, there is more.
Recently ppl have started to call me out for it. Now I am very bothered that they view me this way and have seen how I have acted. I want to manipulate them (basically) into thinking I didn’t meant to say this or that, it was a misunderstanding, and then say I will do better. And I will do better bc I want to be thought highly of. 

I feel I want to have the upper hand and have everyone like me. I almost get a kick out of feeling like I have successfully gotten them where I want them or got them to believe I am better and not a narc.

But at the same time most of the time I don’t really enjoy or try to manipulate people, I feel bad. I like to be honest. And I will admit some wrong.

I feel like I have a slight superiority complex, and also just a complex about having the upper hand. I hate the idea of an SO thinking I love them more than they love me. I get a kick out of then liking and wanting me, and only partly desire to show affection bc they like it and will think more positively of me.

Anyways I have rambled lol. 

But I hope someone has some insight. You can dm me or respond here.",02Apr2020,1
498,"So today my ""friend"" removed me as a ""friend"" on every social media, which i don't since i'm so angry at him... he was basically the only toxin in my life atm... A month ago i blocked him on facebook for a week since he did something i think was unacceptable, and put me in bad light in front of 4 people... Now after i unblocked him we didn't write at all and suddenly today he removed me. But the things... not only did he remove me but he also kicked and maybe blocked me on every common facebook group he could... I know this since all my past 3 years of reunion events from that group disappeared, i asked a friend if we had such a group and he said he was quite sure. I really like the other people in that group, but many of them are common friends so i don't know how to tackle the problem. Should a make a new group with all the people excluding him or? It also means i lost access to all the common pics we had, i've saved some but not all of them.

I started crying and I did shout and then I had to stop in my tracks and scream cry and a family (keeping their 2m distance) asked if I was ok, and I told them what happened but I still don’t know what to do.

501,"An issue I struggle with is achieving a consistent mindset or state of mind. 

What I mean is that some days I feel extremely intelligent, like ideas are flowing easily and my speech is articulate and insightful, completely in sync with my brain. Other days I feel like an imbecile, like my thoughts are slogging through the mud and there is a major uptick in ums, ahs, and general stammering. Most days, I feel somewhere in the middle, just kind of….meh. 

The most frustrating part is not just the inconsistency and inability to turn it off and on, as if I could flip a ‘smart switch’ and be good to go. There are plenty of people who have that, at least from an outside perspective it would appear that way. The big thing is that it’s difficult to cope with having seen those flashes of brilliance and to be completely unable to channel that all the time, or even on a consistent basis.

When I feel like my brain is running on peak performance, I feel not just smart and creative, but I feel thoughtful, methodical, empathetic to others, and overall pretty serene and in tune with the universe, or at least my own universe. These are the times when I can tell myself, “You know what, I’m a genuinely good and smart person.”

When I feel sluggish, I feel less thoughtful, generally displaced and out of tune, and almost as if I’m not present. To feel disconnected in this state brings things like irritability, anxiety, self-doubt, and other negative feelings that are extremely tough to fight off and shake. And when they’re there, they place themselves at the forefront, impossible to ignore. And of course, the middle ground is a mixed bag.

How does one achieve optimal mental performance on a consistent basis?",02Apr2020,1
502,"My parents got a cat when I was 11. According to my mom, my dad got the cat, which I really kinda doubt he would want a cat. Up until last night she always referred to it as her cat. The cats even under my moms name at the vet clinic. My mom has also been feeding it all these years. Fhe cats 15. About 6 months ago, the cat looked a bit thin, so I took it to the vet, were it was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. I wasnt just gonna put it down, or let it die, so I was able to convince my mom to pay for the meds. She also pays for the litter, and the food. I pay for the vet Bills theres been complications since shes been on the meds, and I've spent almost 2k dealing with it, because I felt obligated to, even though I dint think I am since I was 11 when we got the cat. Anyways, last night my mom got drunk, and started yelling saying that I shouldnt have treated the cat, and let it die a natural death, and that since I spent a lot of money on it, that the cat is mine now. I couldnt have spent nearly as much as she has on food for the past 15 years though. What she said terrified me though. I don't make much money, and cant mentally care for an elderly cat by myself. I wanted to shoot myself when she said that. If she really meant it, then I dont know what to do. I had a dog that died 5 months ago from cancer.

Tl;dr at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

I was a Fulbright Researcher in a country in Europe. I'll try not to dwell, but it was honestly an amazing experience for so many reasons. Suffice it to say I did not want to leave my country of assignment. 

Unfortunately, the State Department had other plans and recalled Fulbrighters and other grantees or volunteers across the globe. I am now back in the US (New Jersey) completely unprepared for the financial repercussions of returning unexpectedly. While I was having job interviews for my anticipated return in June, the place I was interviewing at issued a hiring freeze until the end of the fiscal year.

For several reasons, I am a bit panicked:

\- I am considered high-risk due to chronic illnesses, and cannot commit to any work requiring me to leave my house. 

\- I have committed to an amazing (albeit expensive) school for my masters. Still trying not to out myself too much, my acceptance into the job would have determined whether I was eligible for tuition benefits. I will no longer be eligible, meaning I must take additional student loans for my fall semester. 

\- For my masters I had planned to move. This is looking to be near impossible, but at least with unemployment I wouldn't have to live entirely off my savings.

\- I filed for unemployment in the state of New Jersey, but will likely not qualify. In the application portal there is no option to indicate out of country employment (I have been on my Fulbright since August). Therefore, I had to provide details of my employment prior to Fulbright-- which I left voluntarily in the summer...due to Fulbright... I am wondering if they use the 2019 tax return, in which case would show the drastic cut in pay from when I was working to when I left the country. Hopefully they would put two and two together. I have already filed (as of this morning) and I am now waiting to be rejected. (I have not received an email, but it's unclear how long it should take).

\- The place I HAD been working at actually shut down, but after I left. So there is no way for them to contact my previous place of employment anyway!

\-Debated on sharing this part but in case it helps context, I am actually even more unable to go and work because I am currently extremely sick (may or may not be Covid-19 related).

In light of everything, I am still extremely grateful for my situation. I have a place to stay where I am sharing the load of rent. I have some savings. I'm sick, but not ventilator-sick. But emotionally, it sucks. I am used to being in the thick of things and I feel very useless being at home with a health research background. Fulbright can't do much anyway, but I feel very left behind by them. They just sent us home, even when we wanted to stay... but didn't give resources to address the repercussions. -End Rant-

Basically, is there anything I could even do? Thank you for any help you could give me... stay safe and healthy everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr I was a health researcher in Europe under Fulbright, who was recalled home due to Covid-19. I ""don't qualify"" for unemployment because the NJ Unemployment online portal doesn't give an option to list overseas work. I cannot speak to a human being to explain my situation. I have already filed and am now waiting for the inevitable rejection.",02Apr2020,1

He believes he is a burden on me and that he doesn’t deserve me even though I constantly remind him that he’s not.

My boyfriend does the same thing all the time. I get that maybe we dont have the most similar tastes in music or similar interests but i never ask them to go out of their way to do anything its always a short youtube video,,literally less than 5 minutes or a song,, and i send them things bc

a. it reminds me of them or b. its something that i really enjoyed or found funny and i wanted to share with them 

the worst part is that i always listen to the music they send ,, ive watched entire tv shows bc they recommended it to me and i may not have even liked the things they recommended that much i just did it bc they asked me to and i value that as a friend and a girlfriend. 

Even in real life, there have been multiple occasions where i play a song or something and they literally say eww and turn it off. i know these are trivial things and im probably overthinking them but it still makes me feel like shit sometimes. i do have other friends that are interested in the same things i am but i just want the three main people in my life to be more involved? is that too much to ask for? there was this one time  when i sent my best friend a song to listen to ,, and she didnt listen to it but the same evening this boy she was talking to sent her the same thing and she listened to it immediately and told me about it and i was a little upset but i didnt bring it up . idk if im making this a bigger issue than it needs to be but what do i do? i feel like i just have terrible taste in things or they are terrible friends lmaoo",02Apr2020,1

So this is my first post on reddit... and I really need some solid advice. 

I was accepted into uni a year ago, and decided to take a gap year. School was a really toxic environment for me, and I was really looking forward to a fresh start. 

I found out today that someone who made my life hard in school, got into the same university as me and plans to attend. Last year, before he even applied, and I was just accepted, he told me it was such a bad school and I should be ashamed to go there, called me stupid many times...he even tried to create tension between me and my then boyfriend.

Said they need to test him for the coronavirus. 

They’ve been told he will more than likely die from either sepsis or the virus and will need life support but they refuse to give him it because he’s old and ill. They won’t allow any visitors and my friend and her family never got a chance to say goodbye. 

I told her about how my mum works in hospitals as a social worker to ensure disabled patients get the right treatment and are safe. I said I would ask my mum to make sure but if she can and she gets a chance to meet him she could pass on a few words?

521,"I’m 17 and I recently found out my dad has been cheating on my mom. I won’t go into detail about how I found out, but let’s just say there’s absolutely no doubt about it and this isn’t just an assumption. As far as I know, I’m the only one in the family (aside from him obviously) who knows about this right now. At first I wasn’t going to do anything about it because from their conversations he seems to be seeing her just for sex, but she’s been demanding more and more from him. More attention. More time away from his family. My mom is a doctor and so she has been isolating herself from us as much as possible, which makes it easy for him to continue the affair. We’ve also been having some financial issues lately (Dad was demoted from his formerly high-paying position a while ago) so she’s also been working longer hours, as well as doing extra part-time work at other hospitals. And what does my dad do? He spends all his money on this other woman who demands he take her to better hotels, fancier restaurants, take her on dates more often. I love my mom so much and she has been working herself to the bone to provide for our family. She’s also been the primary caregiver in my life, sacrificing all her time and even health for my sister, my father, and me. Honestly, as much as I love my dad I’d use him as a human shield to protect her from harm. 

He has made plans to go see this woman again tomorrow. I love him. A lot. He’s not a terrible dad, and to some degree I know he still loves his family. But I can’t stand that he is doing this to my mother. I want to say something, but I don’t know if I should. And if I do say something, what should I say? How should I go about it? I know I risk ruining my relationship with my father by doing this, but how can I stand idly by knowing that this terrible thing is happening? IDK I’m just very conflicted right now.

524," So I've had a roommate that's generally been pretty nice to my face, but I have noticed she's pretty messy/irresponsible. For example, she died a wig of hers a while ago and got the dye on the bathroom floor and walls, the living room floor, and my other roommates bed. She never cleaned up any of it, and my girlfriend freaked out and tried to get it out of the wall, but never could. Even after I told her this and asked her to clean the stain, she said she would but never did. There were a couple other minor incidents that happened, but every time anyone's asked her about things around the apartment, she's always played dumb.

The biggest thing recently is that I think she broke the oven door. She does this thing where she dances extremely loudly and violently in the dark in our narrow kitchen. I didn't mind before, but a couple of nights ago there was a pretty loud noise that accompanied her jumping. I didn't think much of it until a day or two later, when I noticed the oven door looking slightly slanted. Upon closer inspection, the oven door is completely broken on one side and came off the hinge. I asked her, ""what happened to the oven door?"" and she replied that she acted dumb once again, said she didn't know anything about the oven door, but that she'd put in a work order for maintenance. Now, I'm pretty sure she is the one who broke the oven door because of the vigorous dancing in the dark (she still does it multiple times a day), and she acted really suspicious when I confronted her - never said anything like ""wow how did that happen?"" or seeming upset that the door literally cannot close and is unattached on one side. There is a slight chance that our other roommate MAY have done it but she left our apartment the week before I noticed the broken door, so I'm not sure if it could've been her.

I'm scared the landlord is going to charge us for the oven door being broken, but as it stands, it doesn't seem like anyone can pin the possible charge on anyone. Does anyone know what the best way to navigate this might be? I was thinking that if our landlord charges us by taking the damage off our security deposit, then since I am the tenant in charge, I could just take my portion excluding the damage to the oven door and distribute the rest of the deposit to my other two roommates (or at least the one that shares a room with her). I'm not sure if that is allowed though, and I'm scared of what would happen if she has any room to threaten legal action?",02Apr2020,1

I’m a very forgetful person. Whenever I told to do something, I will 9/10 forget. If it has multiple parts I will do one part forget that I had to do the rest, run and do the next part, then forget again. Rinse and repeat. Most of the time, it’s more of a bother to me than to others, but with my friend it always bothers him.

Me and my friend are fairly close and we’ve known each other for years. He knows I forget stuff a lot. Even then, he still gets mad at me about it. Usually it’s when we call each other. We’d end the call because either I or both of us need to go do something. We’d then tell each other that we’d call later. Only for me to forget to come back and him having to remind me. 

Each time I do this he gets more and more mad, to the point where he stops believing that I’m being forgetful and thinks I don’t want to talk with him anymore. I do want to talk and I am being forgetful but he wants me to prove that I’m not doing this on purpose. But I can’t. He wants me to prove that I do want to fix this, but I can’t. He wants me to prove that I actually am sorry. But I can’t.

I feel like an asshole every time I do this, but even then I still do nothing to fix it, I want to, but I just don’t try. This is my first try at fixing this but it makes it worse how my first try is asking others to help.

He doesn’t really have any close friends besides me (he says im like a sister), and he’a not very open with his parents about his mental health. That being said, I’ve known that he’s depressed, a bit anorexic and doing self-harm for some months now. I’ve always tried to support him as much as I could, but I’m only 15 (he’s 14) and I can’t be his psychologist. I’ve tried to convince him to speak to someone proffesional, but he doesn’t want his parents to know how he’s feeling, and is to afraid to seek help to online-psychologists. Two days ago, he told me he’s planning on ending it all, since his life is just stressful torture. I’ve tried with all my might to convince him not to, but I’m not sure it’s working. I’m literally feeling ill of stress and worry (he doesn’t know this tho, I’m afraid if he realized what he’s putting me through he’ll stop talking to me and do something...bad, out of guilt). I’m here for advice for what I can do, but I also hope you redditors can write reasons to keep on fighting and live. I know he thinks of himself as nothing but a failure, and that no one cares about him, and I wanna get him to realise how much he’s worth.

531,"I'm currently 14, a male, and Filipino. 

So, where do I start? 

Basically ever since I've been birthed into this world I've been having trouble finding something I can actually enjoy and be passionate with. Something that I can have hours, days, years practicing at, but still be happy with the process of it. 

Currently, I'm in quarantine and all I'm doing at this point is binge-watching random videos on YouTube and fighting off my porn addiction.

Don't worry, I'm actually going pretty clean now and in a good mental condition. But I realized NoFap isn't the only thing that's gonna keep me happy. 

I have a lot of time in my hands. We all have a lot of time in my hands. I'm just looking for a way to atleast be productive with it. 

Most of my friends have something to do with all this time. Whether it's drawing, music, dancing, art, you name it. And I just feel super jealous and kinda disappointed in myself.

I hear a lot of stories about my dad being a basketball superstar back when he was my age. He was an all-time MVP and pretty famous in my town. But now, he had to end his career because of a foot injury and he's told that he shouldn't engage much in physical activity. Though I really want to follow in his footsteps, and continue what he started, I can't ball like MJ. 

Apparently, it didn't seem I got his athletic genes. I can't dribble a ball through my legs. I can't shoot a three pointer. I almost got my ankles broken because one of my friends forced me to get in a basketball game. Yeah sure, ""You miss 100% of the shots you don't take."" But I'm confident that the shots I DO take, can't even reach above 10%.

My older brother is a god on the guitar. He's been having this talent ever since he picked up one when he was 12. He's 19 now and is continuously developing his ultimate prowess. He's been producing beats in Fruity Loops, making songs. I could compare myself with him but I don't even bother at this point. I've tried music, and even that wasn't something that stuck on me.

I could go on and on with this. I can say I've tried everything. I can say not a single one of them has made me happy. But, nah. I really wanna feel passionate towards something. Something I could develop overtime. It could be of anything really. 

The question that I want to be answered is not ""What thing am I good at?"" The question that I want to be answered is how can I stay dedicated and truly passionate towards something. How can I inspire, motivate myself so that I can perfect my craft? 

I really wanna know how you guys discovered your passions and how you motivated yourselves to practice daily. Hoping you guys could fix this small dilemma of mine. Cheers.",02Apr2020,1

533,"So a few months ago I did a terrible thing. I helped one of my guy best friends (Nate) cheat on his girlfriend with me. Yes, it was VERY shitty of me and it’s my fault too. He and his girl friend broke up. She then turned into a friend of mine. She is an amazing person. I told her everything, apologised to her, she’s forgiven me. I feel more at peace now. 

Today his ex girlfriend blocked me everywhere, after a month of us not talking much to each other after I confessed. I understand. No one wants a reminder of the past. I wish her the very best of luck, she is a great person. 

Now, the shocking (maybe?) part. Nate’s Ex gf told me he had touched her breasts without consent, forcibly tried to kiss her. You know what, he was always just so pressurising whenever we sexted, sometimes it felt like he was using me. Maybe he was. Now that I read his messages again, he sounds like a psychopath. He emotionally manipulated me.

The problem is, Nate’s BEST girl friend is also a close friend of mine. She’s also another amazing person. I don’t want her to get hurt by Nate like me and his girlfriend were. But she’s also just so understanding of all her friends, she accepts them in every way. When I told her Nate cheated on his girlfriend (with my help too) she accepted both of us for who we are, didn’t judge us, said human relationships are complicated. 

But how am I supposed to warn her if she’ll forgive Nate for anything? She’s also just so close to him, I’m scared that if I say anything against him our friendship will get affected and she most probably will refuse to believe it. I can’t tell her that Nate sexually harassed his own gf cuz his gf asked me not to. But isn’t it my duty to warn my friend that Nate isn’t a good guy, actually? She thinks the world of him, but I don’t want her to get hurt. What do I do?",02Apr2020,1
534,"A few months ago, I was hired on with a company almost immediately after meeting with two people, one being the vice president of human resources for the regional area and the other who would become my supervisor. I'd like to say it was because I was such a flawless candidate, but I think it was my former experience that did seem to be in line with what this position was and the fact that I was going to be out of a job by the end of the week, so they felt compassionate towards me, which I am grateful for.

I love working here. I love just about every aspect of the job since starting but there are a few things about the way my supervisor supervises that cause me to feel frustrated.

During the interview, the man who would become my supervisor, asked me a question about how I would go about dealing with problems that arose in my work. I caught the vibe immediately that the question he was asking me was to determine whether or not I would be someone who would constantly come to him for help or if I would figure things out for myself and exhaust that until eventually coming to him.

So earlier this week, my coworker and I were working on something and trying to figure out what was causing this issue. It was more so my coworker than myself. This was a vital piece of equipment needed for daily work that we couldn't go without and it eventually got to the point where the manager of the office contacted me and my coworker's supervisor. My supervisor found that it was a very simple thing that needed changing and did it himself. He also sent out an email saying that we should have came to him first regarding this.

But the thing is, and it's not just from what I got in the interview, in other times when I've reached out to him for help, because I've exhausted everything else, I don't get a response most times. I'm not exaggerating on that because there were a few times where he did respond and did help me out when I needed it, but the times he hasn't outweigh those.

Which brings me to my next point...my supervisor is not always in the physical office, and this was even before all this virus stuff started happening. So every once in a while, he would email me and I guess my coworker and ask how things are going.

Most times, my answer is ""good, thank you for asking"" or something along the lines of that.

But there have been times where I was brutally honest about what was going on and would say, ""things are good. We've got a good handle on things except for this one item which..."" and I'd explain the issue.

Silence. He wouldn't respond.

A few days later, that message is still sitting there in the instant message queue and instead of replying to it, even days later, he asks the same question as a new topic ""how are things going?""

So our messages would kind of look like this in a chat

&gt;Him: Yesterday 2:00 p.m.: How are things going?

&gt;Me: Yesterday 2:02 p.m.: Things are going pretty well here, thanks for asking. But we're having an issue with this one car where we just can't seem to get this part off to get to this other part we need. We need this tool really badly; can you order one or bring one to us?

&gt;Him: Today 8:00 a.m.: How are things going?

The final thing that has frustrated me has been the lack of attention he's given the office I work in over the other office he also manages, which showed last week.

He sent out an email to both offices thanking all of us and listed us individually. Which was honestly really nice and cool to get individualized appreciation. However, it was apparent he didn't spend much time with us because he got a lot of things wrong between my coworker and I. He attributed things to my coworker that I had done and things to me that neither of us had done. It just showed a disconnect he has had since I started here and it is frustrating to me that this exists and I don't have as close of a professional relationship to him as the guys at the other office do. Their thanks and appreciation were long and more personalized. Ours were more generalized and seemed to just be included so we wouldn't have been left out.

I don't want to sound like a complainer and ungrateful because even though I'm frustrated in these areas, I'm overall happy and satisfied with this job and eternally grateful to him for the chance I've been given here, especially since I had waited so long to find a job like this which was exactly what I was looking for.

I've never been good at dealing with frustrations head on but I want to change and learn how to do it effectively and professionally and without letting my feelings get in the way of the truth of the situation. I don't want to exaggerate issues more than they really are or take too much time talking about them like I'm doing here (which I'm really doing more so to explain to complete strangers a situation they know nothing about).

Anyway, does anyone have any advice they can share with me about this?

Thank you!",02Apr2020,1

Since the pandemic my dad has refused to change much of his daily behavior, he won’t quit shaking hands, he goes into town every day, he wants to go to a nearby population center in another state that has been effected worse than we have to sell a car. His reasoning is completely faith-based he thinks that God won’t let anything happen to him or his family. He also believes that the media is distorting the situation to hurt Trump’s chance for re-election. We’ve gotten into some of the worst fights that we’ve ever had over me trying to convince him to just listen to the warnings, but he won’t. If it was just affecting him I would understand, but it’s going to affect our farm’s full staff, my whole family, me and my girlfriend.

me and my ex are on decent terms, so i decided to ask him about it, since i didn’t find him obsessive. he apologized that i was put into an uncomfortable situation and said that it was strange since he texts her because there’s nothing to do during self isolation and that they both apparently started “talking” so that’s why he complements her.

She made irresponsible choices with her money and messed up her credit. Fast forward and we are here; I’ve been living with her manipulation and emotional abuse for five years. I have tried many times to move out but she has manipulated me every time to stay, because of previously mentioned bad credit/lack of money. 
This isn’t my fault. I didn’t make those choices for her. And yet I have been paying for those mistakes since I was 19. She refuses to try to correct her mistakes or get a job that is better paying. 
I resent her. A lot of the time, she doesn’t treat me very well. I have the opportunity to get a place with my best friend/partner, and by god do I need to. I need to get away from this bad situation that I’ve been stuck in for years. I need to be free, away from the stress and anxiety she causes me. The place we live in is so cluttered with boxes upon boxes of things she refuses to part with. I never leave my room. 
I feel such guilt and anxiety over this situation. But I truly need to break away from her. She has never been concerned with how this situation affects my mental state; I have depression and anxiety and this does nothing but amplify both. She has never wanted me to go out on my own and be happy.

I’m currently in 9th grade and it’s been tough making friends because I’m antisocial I joined a sport I thought I would make friends in the sport that I joined but I only made 1 out of 15 of them. Only one person from that sport that I joined talked to me I tried talking to the other kids that are in the sport but they barely talk to me, so I just stay quite during practice and do my own thing. 

While my cousin she joined band and soccer so she has plenty of opportunity’s to make friends.

My cousin would also be in her phone and be laughing at what her friends send her while there’s me with a dry phone my friends barely texting me.

Basically, my now s/o, (let’s call them Skyler) was in a 2year relationship with a girl who was extremely emotionally dependent on him. Let’s call her Paris. Paris made Skyler her absolute everything; she wanted to marry Skyler after they graduated, she planned on moving countries together and building a life there, about adopting dogs, what their house would look like ect. At the beginning of their relationship, my s/o wanted that future with her, but so much changed this year. Also, all of this future talk is a lot to put on someone, and we’re all only 21, it’s not really realistic to make such plans. Basically, Skyler realized that they don’t share a lot of the same values and found himself compromising so much of what he believed in to suit Paris. For many reasons, Skyler fell out of love with Paris; they had a lot of relationship problems, especially towards the end of their relationship. So, my s/o broke up with Paris.
Paris was devastated. She kept saying how she had nothing to live for anymore, her future doesn’t make sense anymore, and that she wanted to die. Skyler was on the phone with her half the night trying to convince her not to kill herself. 
Eventually, Skyler decided that the best thing for the situation was to have distance between the two of them, so he told Paris not to message him anymore and that maybe they can be friends in the future. However, Paris messages Skyler every few days saying that she wants to make him happy and that Skyler is the only happiness in her life, but Skyler keeps asking for distance. Paris just can’t come to terms with the fact that Skyler is not going to be her future anymore. What do you think reddit, is this abuse? Is there anything we should do to help Paris?

So my girlfriend has some pretty serious trust/jealousy issues. I'm not 100% on the root cause of this, and to complicate the matter she's not exactly the best communicator either. I have had essentially zero success getting her to talk about it, and I have tried many different ways following the advice of several different forums online. 

She recognizes that her behavior is not normal, but is not interested in doing anything about it. I worry that it will lead to our relationship's demise, but she doesn't think it's a big deal. I'm a little older than her (26-21) and she's never been in a long term relationship. At first I thought she was just being selfish and was uninterested in being proactive about working on our relationship, but I think she really doesn't believe there's an issue that needs addressing and I can't convince her otherwise. 

I've even suggested to ""just humor me. Try it out, it's not like it can hurt anything."" And apparently she went once as a teenager to work out some feelings about her father who is in prison and the therapist just made things worse and she never went again.

Apparently, Arnold’s mom told Bernard that she has feelings for him and she was wondering if he maybe felt the same for her.

557,"24F here. If it’s a little lengthy I apologize in advance. My main question (with a few more at the bottom) is how to start living instead of existing? My entire childhood + adulthood I’ve sat on the sidelines...partly circumstance and partly my own mental health. 
Wasn’t allowed to have friends growing up. Grew up Jehovah’s Witness, who are very strict. Grew up very poor with strict mother. Molested. Bullied. While I don’t dwell on these things, I can’t help think it’s shaped me into who I am today. 

I’m so sick and tired of trying to appear happy but really not knowing what to do or what to say in most situations. So I remain silent. 

A routine day looks like this:
1) Go to work, stand in line and greet customers with standard greeting, finish job. Say minimum to coworkers. (Even though I want to.. some days a few sentences come out)

If I’m off I usually sleep all day and play games... I have 0 friends. (Back in the day they used to be mostly male, and then I realized it was for the sex and I don’t do that anymore, hence the no friends anymore).

2) Come home, play video games. Boyfriend comes home, eat dinner with his family, say absolutely nothing. 

3) Go to room with boyfriend, try to be sweet and have conversations- it’s a bit easier to let loose with him and chat randomly-he’s a natural at both- but on my end it’s very abrupt and I usually stutter am just 1000% unsure of myself. I also get irritated at a lot of dumb things. 
If having a better self image is my main goal, having a better relationship with my boyfriend is my second goal. 


Some people can see right through my insecurities which is unattractive, while to others I look like an asshole when I avoid people, which is just as bad. 


I just have no clue how to interact with humans. 
I wanna learn: 
•how to accept and give a little humor
•how to start random conversations AND keep them going 
•how to STOP CARING about what others may be thinking about me
•activities I can pursue to become more CONFIDENT and possibly meet more people
•how to stop dwelling inside my head all the time
•Just be less uptight and learn to enjoy things, the small things, I never got the chance to.",02Apr2020,1
558,"This is a question I've been struggling with my entire life. I lack motivation to do anything. I have diagnosed but untreated ADD. I'm taking Wellbutrin as an antidepressant, which has been known to treat ADD but my doctor isn't treating my ADD. I have troubles taking my meds consistently and my mind feels blank all the time. I'm extremely burnt out on school. I've been going for my entire life and my parents forced me to jump right into college. I almost failed last semester and I'm failing most of my classes this semester.

I want to be able to set and keep a schedule. I want to be organized and disciplined but no matter what happens I just don't seem to want to. I don't care, but I'm fed up with the aftermath of what happens if I don't but I've built these unhealthy habits my entire life that I can't help it.

I was thinking about writing a self-help book about anxiety based off my own experiences struggling with it, however I read that readers will not engage in the book if you aren't certified, hold a PhD in the subject matter, or have credentials. This discouraged me a lot. Any advice?

561,"Been living in this apartment for about 7 months now. The people who live above me are loud, all the time. From 6 am when they get up and start walking around and dropping who knows what, until 2 am when they are having super loud sex. 

So, I understand that living underneath someone means that they could be walking normally, but to me it sounds like stomping. Fine. If they drop their remote controller, it sounds like a bowling ball and rattles my windows. Fine. Being able to hear their TV every night over mine, having window rattling sex until 2 am three times a week, and slamming doors at all hours of the day, that's all apart of apartment living. 

However, I'm getting sick of them having screaming matches until 1 am every week. Slamming doors, throwing stuff, storming around fights that last until 1 in the morning. I get that this is a stressful time for most people, but this has been going on since January. 

I am a single woman living alone, so I do not feel comfortable confronting the 2 men and 1 woman who live in the apartment above me. Especially after listening to how intense these fights get. Should I ask property management to step in? Or is this just the reality of apartment living? I've lived in 2 other apartment complexes before, but I don't remember the noise being this consistent.

562,"(Copied and pasted from another group, since I really need advice) Recently, my mental health has admittedly taken a downturn. I have been honest with my friends about how I am feeling, and I have been taking steps to work on my depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts at my own pace. Other people knowing about my conditions makes everything a lot worse. However, I have put aside this anxiety to a degree and am now receiving online counselling, have an appointment for real life counselling, and have spoken to my GP so that I can try medication. My progress has been slow, but there has been progress. Today, I randomly got a call from social services. Apparently I had contacted 111, and now I had been referred to several different organisations in my area. I never called 111. I had to tell a complete stranger everything, and try to make her believe it wasn't me that called, which is the truth. In essence, my trust was completely violated and I am completely uncomfortable. Everything mentally just got a whole lot worse.

It turns out my so called friends arranged this behind my back. Even though I told them that I did not want safeguarding or them to call anyone for me, they violated my trust and consent. Now I am getting repeated calls from different organisations, and it's making my anxiety and suicidial thoughts so much worse. I was getting help and making my own path towards recovery. Now all that recovery feels like it's been halted. How can I get them to understand that im a human being and not a project? I just want to continue on my own path. And do they not understand that it's not okay to violate my consent like that? I want to know how to get them to understand that this is my own journey, and if there's anyway to cancel this safeguarding. Knowing my personal details, which they got from me through lying, are out there makes me way more anxious than I was before. Phone calls make me anxious anyway, and now they could be coming from anyone at anytime",02Apr2020,1

567,"Throwaway account for reasons. I’m going to try to be as honest as possible in this post.
So I finally got my first boyfriend, and everything is going great. I’m also his first girlfriend. I’m female, and I asked him out first. We’re both in our senior year of high school and prom is coming up soon. But the thing is, I feel like I should break up with him. We’ve only been dating for about a month and a half, and a couple days after being a month in, I broke up with him for a couple hours and then came back to him (I know, it’s dumb). We’ve kissed already but we haven’t had sex. His parents are also racist towards my race, and in the beginning of our relationship he had to keep me a secret from them.

But the thing is I don’t know. I don’t find him as attractive as when I first met him. He seems to lack confidence and just the general personality traits that makes me attracted to a guy. As we’re together, I see other guys around who I would like to talk to and get to know more. Being with him also made me realize that I don’t want to commit to just him, because I feel like I can do better. 

I don’t want to come off as rude, but in my eyes he’s ugly, but has a wonderful personality that I could definitely become great friends with. But I can’t see myself having sex with him or doing anything else like that. Kissing him doesn’t make me feel anything, and he’s told me that he loves me (this early into the relationship), but I really don’t feel the same way back. My friends all tell me that he’s a good guy, and we look cute together, and he really is, but I just feel like I can do better.

I’m actually kind of embarrassed to have him as my first boyfriend.

570,"Hey everyone,

I was wondering how I should go about telling my landlord that it's not technically my responsibility to mow my lawn. I read over my contract and it does not state that it's my job. 

There use to be a local company that did it, and then my neighbor tried strong arming me into paying her to do it for me. But she wanted more than the company and she mowed almost twice as frequently. She also just stopped mowing if I was a day late to pay her and charged me a dollar every day I was late on top of that.

Regardless, I don't have a mower. My neighbor probably wouldn't let me use hers and won't mow my half of the yard. (I live in a duplex).

However it just got be thinking and since my contract doesn't specify that it's my responsibility, I feel it's my landlord responsibility to take care of it. Since my landlord is 95, and in a nursing home now, I know she's not able to physically do it. I've been dealing with her son who's been managing her properties for her on her behalf. I'm which case, it should be her responsibility to find someone to do it for her. Either her son or another company.

Any advice would help. Any questions, I'll get back to as soon as I can. Thank you in advance.",02Apr2020,1

I needed to get my yearly birth control prescription, and my mom suggested that I make a physical appointment to get my physical for the year out of the way while also getting my prescription. 

When I scheduled an appointment with the secretary, I first mentioned that I needed to get my birth control filled and she said that they couldn't give me a prescription because I hadn't seen them in over a year. She suggested that I make an appointment which I naively assumed was a physical. She made no clarification about what kind of appointment it was.

Well I just got the bill back from insurance, and they charged me $150 for an office visit for snoring when I should have gotten a physical for free. 

For some background, I am a 20 year old college student so I am fairly new to scheduling my own appointments. At the doctor's visit, they checked my height, weight, temperature, and blood pressure (all of which I naively assumed was part of the 'physical'). My appointment started an hour late and my doctor came in and asked me about my prescription and if I have any other issues. Thinking it was a physical, I asked some questions about whether some of my sleeping habits and snoring was healthy. I know I should have suspected something when the doctor didn't check my eyes, ears, etc, but this was a new doctor and I thought she was getting around to it. 17 minutes later she tells me that it's all the time we have today and goes to lunch. When I was leaving, I was the last person in the office, the secretaries had left, and there was no one I could talk to. I saw the doctor again and she told me I'm free to leave. I just assumed that it was a bad physical and kept note that I wasn't going to see that doctor again. I know it was so naive of me to assume all this, but I just didn't know any better.

I called the doctor's office  today and all the secretary can say is that I didn't schedule a physical. I tried pressing it and all she tells me is that's not what she sees on the computer. 

What can I do to fix this? I just recently lost my part-time job because of COVID-19 and can't afford to pay the bill right.

I have recently noticed that he’s incredibly territorial about petty things. For example, I decorated around the apartment and cleaned a little bit and he was a little distraught about that. The apartment was not necessarily dirty but I added few paintings around and tidied up to make it look better and he just took offense to that. Who doesn’t like flowers around the apartment? 

Another thing, he’s always giving me VERY specific direction on how he likes things around the apartment. He doesn’t follow these directions but gets irritated when he notices the smallest things out of place. For example, I put a piece of recycling into the wrong bin and he felt the need to call me out and basically mansplain recycling to me. He just likes to take charge and direct everything. Maybe I came in a little aggressive and it’s his space but idk. I feel like that’s a pretty toxic trait. 

There isn’t any tension between us yet but I’m trying to get this under control before it gets any worse. I would really appreciate suggestions.",02Apr2020,1

The day I lost it, I went to a friends house to spend the night and didn't find out it was missing until I came home the next day. I searched high and low for the laptop but couldn't find it anywhere in the house so I figured maybe I left it there. I called the friend, she didn't see it and neither did any of my other friends that were there. I started thinking maybe someone stole it so I followed the right steps and made an insurance claim to buy another one because at this point, find my iPhone wasn't helping, I had assignments due, and I needed my laptop back. I finally bought another laptop and my sister, who isn't exactly struggling but has to care for 2 kids and is planning to move across the country pretty soon, has expressed that it would be great if I did find my old laptop in the house because then she could use it to work from home during the quarantine. I would always just give a sly smile and nod because I was certain someone stole it and erased the info before I could ping a location.

Also during this time, I've been looking for a car to buy because its become a burden to not have a car with how busy I am. I'm very close to purchasing one but I'm a couple $100 short and need to keep up with insurance when I do finally get it so some extra money would come in handy right now.

578,"Long story short, I'm pretty well-known on a Q&amp;A site, and recently, a troll and catfish has started to harass me really badly. 

I first came across one of their answers that contained a selfie of ""them"", but after Google-Reverse-Searching it, it was clear that it was not there. I left a small comment telling the person that catfishing was not okay and it could get you banned from the site. It was surprisingly nice. 

This person has terrible spelling and grammar, almost hilariously wrong, and then wrote another answer idolizing a popular catfish that had been called out on the website. I left a longer comment telling that this person had lied and tried to pass other's photos off as their own. 

I received a notification that I had been mentioned in someone's answer, so I clicked on it and it took me to this same troll's profile where I had made it to their shit list. This person had compiled a list of all the people who had called them out saying that they were ""meen"" and that she ""hat""s them. 

I didn't think much of it until they messaged me saying that I was ""a retarded fuck"", a ""bitch"", and a ""mistake"". I started to get angry, but I stayed calm in messages. 

Upon checking their profile, they had written more answers aimed at certain people: friends, acquaintances and fellow writers. 

They were each getting more and more insulting towards certain people, and one of them was blatantly transphobic, saying that a trans (FtM) friend of mine would never be a real boy and that he would burn in hell.

Then, I got an answer dedicated to me. 

Before I continue, let me remind you I have really bad depression and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, which was mainly caused by being severely bullied through my whole childhood. I can't deal with things like normal people would, and I get triggered easily. 

She said in that answer that I was a whore, slut, going to burn in hell (I'm queer), useless, no-one loves me, a mistake, a disappointment and that I should go kill myself. I received more messages from her saying I should kill myself before I blocked her. Then she asked other people to send messages to me to unblock her so she could send more messages. 

I was beyond angry. I spent the night with a nauseous feeling in my stomach. 

The next day, I found screenshots that others had taken during the night. One of them was parodying me, saying that I (them) had killed myself and was burning in hell. 

Miraculously, the website finally realized there was a problem after ll the targeted people reported her, but it didn't last long. 

I received another message, this time from a profile with the same name as the hater but with a different profile photo. It was laughing in my face about how the website could never get rid of them. 

I scrolled through their new profile only to find more answers aimed at me and my friends on the site, She was telling me I should kill myself more and more, saying that I deserved my depression and the world would be happier without me. 

(I have attempted suicide twice, and have suicidal thoughts a lot, which is why this one triggered me.)

I had a panic attack, but my brother helped calm me down, as he is on the site as well. 

I feel horrible. I reported all their content and their profile but I still feel like shit. I was the main target and all of the horrible memories of my past are coming back.

I have never dated and have a hard time making friends, I am very shy. Some people have asked me out but I didn’t like them or know them very well at that.

I met someone on a dating app who lives in the state next to me. We actually started out as just friends and played games together and texted all the time. 

Btw we have both never dated before.

Later things progressed. They had feelings for me and I started to have feelings for them.
We haven’t met yet but have video called.
We are just both busy and anxious about meeting. Last time I cancelled out planned meeting bc I was having a mental breakdown over college classes lol.

Anyways it’s been like two years. We are SUPER close. I have never been closer to someone. And we talk everyday. We care about each other a lot.

We aren’t officially dating though. We know we have feelings for each other like A LOT of feelings, and we know we aren’t pursuing other people. But I think bc we haven’t met you we are just taking it a bit slow. 
And we are both okay with that.

Now there are some issues. We argue A LOT. Not all the time, but we have had many bad arguments. Other times are better than others. Recently they have had a lot of sleep loss and we have been going through a bad arguing fit.

Now this is all over text. We don’t argue very much when talking over a voice chat.

I can’t help but feel it isn’t right for us to argue so much. And I feel bad for them, wondering why they should stay. But they say there is more good than bad and they are better off with me than without. 
And they think it’s mostly text so we can be okay if we really got together.

Also they are fairly depressed and are still working a minimum wage job with no plan. They want to do more but aren’t sure what to do. They are 24. Dropped out of college. I think they have a lot of anxiety about not being capable or making a wrong move. I tell them they just have to start somewhere.

I am in college and already have a high paying job offer. I am not bothered that they didn’t go to college. I just want them to be in a little better place, and have a little better job. They struggle with money a lot and I feel like it could be an issue if they don’t change in the future. I don’t want to feel like they rely on me on money. Not that they would try to, they hate taking charity. But I have concerns for the future. Like they are never gonna go anywhere and always struggling.

I want things to work. But sometimes I question if this is the wrong thing. Sometimes it feels toxic and wrong. And other times it feels great.

They don’t think it’s toxic. And think we can work things out. I am hopeful, but I have some doubts.

I also just don’t want to be involved with China in general anymore. Everybody on the internet hates China with a passion, I’m starting to feel like we’re the Jews of the 21st century, go outside of the country and you get spit on, beat up, discriminated, stay in China and you get endless brainwashing and propaganda, personally, I don’t care about politics, if you want to fight for Hong Kong or Taiwan’s independence, go you. I just wanna live my life without being so depressed all the time. 

I want to be able to ignore all of this, but people are more political now than ever before. 

Even though my life is so easy and, to an extent, privileged for a 23 yo, I can’t help but wonder if I gave it all up and went somewhere else with new people and culture, I would be much happier than I am now. 

The city that I live right now, Shanghai, is leagues ahead of what the jungle part of the China look and feels like, honestly I just don’t know what decision I should make, I’m not even sure where I want to go. I’m just so done with China. So, so done.",02Apr2020,1
581,"Hey everyone,

Ah, the wonderful world of social media. I'm 17 and I've been running a fairly active Discord server for a few TV shows for the past 5 months and it's been consuming my life and making me depressed, especially now that I'm in self-isolation with nothing else to think about. Everyone always tells me to just stop taking it so seriously but it's not that simple. It's turned into an obsession. There's always so dumb drama that needs to be dealt with and it's mentally exhausting.

Whenever a user leaves I can't help but take it personally, even if I had no part in them deciding to leave, and it hurts. The other day, a user called my server shit and left because he had an unpopular opinion about Breaking Bad and he didn't like being told he was wrong. Then, 2 users decided to follow him to another server and harass him. Suddenly, I'm the bad guy because I sent ""my guys"" after him, even though I had no part in the situation. To top it all off I hear he's active in a rival server.

Another user left because some of our users were promoting our server in the rival server. Again, nothing I can control, but I always end up looking like the bad guy. I'm also way too concerned with how active our server is, so losing members hurts in two ways.

There's this other Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul server that we're competing with and while we're more active than they are, they're the official server of those shows' subreddits and I'm always paranoid about them becoming more active, to the point where I had to leave the other server to make myself stop constantly checking how many messages were being sent.

In addition to being obsessed with how active the server is, a lot of times I feel the world is against me. We're pretty much barred from advertising on r/breakingbad and r/betterCallSaul because we're competing with the official server. We may be the more active server now, but if growth is so difficult and we can't even seem to keep the members we have, I have to wonder how sustainable this is.

I wish I could just take a step back sometimes but with how constant the drama is, I feel that I can't.

I know my problem isn't very serious but it's serious to me and I'd really appreciate any advice anyone could give me.",02Apr2020,1
582,"About 2 months ago I met the most amazing girl. We went out, had a couple of drinks, spent the whole night talking and by the end of the night we were making out like crazy. We continued seeing each other, mostly on weekly basis. One thing I've noticed is she takes ages to respond to a text. Even when she does it's not much to read. I've asked and she explained that she rarely uses social media and that she prefers in-person conversations etc. Keep that in mind.  


As weeks went on we continued going out, talked more, got to know each other pretty good. Now, both her and I have complicated histories as far as love and relationships go. We both have more than enough reasons to not trust people when it comes to relationships. That was the reason she asked me to take it slow. I sad no problem and told her she can have as much space as she needs. I've walked down that road, I know what's it like. But as we continued dating, she started distancing herself a lot. Wouldn't respond to texts for days, sometimes she wouldn't respond at all. She said multiple times that she's really glad she can talk about anything and everything openly with me. But when it comes to keeping in touch, she's not there. I've barely heard from her since all of this quarantine-corona-stay-at-home mess started. Last time we spoke was about a week ago, maybe a day or two more. She said she's going offline and removing herself from social media for some time but she keeps posting stories every now and then and I can see she looks at my stories so I know she's there.  


My dilemma is do I keep my patience and wait to see what happens or confront her about this and potentially end it?  
I honestly really like her. She is fantastic and all I would want in a girl but her passiveness is killing me. It's becoming too frustrating, despite my patience.",02Apr2020,1

However, my sister used to sell these things and raised almost 14k (she was a lot more serious about it and did a very big project) and gave it all to charity. Also, my aunt sells candles and is very good at it.

585,"So recently I was thrown out of my parents house and I moved in with my girlfriend who lives with her parents. I'm 23 and she's 25 and we've been together for over 2 and a half years. For most of our relationship, I had to keep a distance from her because she needed space due to a tramatic event that happened with her. Because of said event she has trust issues(especially with guys) and was afraid to tell me what happened to her. I was willing to give her the space she needed and for the first couple years we just went on a date about once a week or every other week depending on how she felt. However about 6 months ago she came out and told me what happened to her and why things were the way they were and I said it was fine and she was worth it. Since then she got attached to me and we started seeing eachother frequently and I can show her physical affection now that's more than a hug or kiss. I've been talking to her trying to make sure she's OK with me being with her as much as I am, especially now that we live together in a world that's shutdown for coronavirus. She said since she finally trust me she doesn't just tolerate my pressence but she actually wants me to be with her all the time. She used to have to lock herself in her room by herself if she was having a bad day or if she had a flashback, but now she tells me when it happens and she will lock us in her room away from her parents so I can brush her hair and play with earings to calm her down. I've been concerned because of how much space I used to have to give her and it seemed like it was overnight that I was able to see her more. I'm also concerned because I feel I am a bit clingy, but she has told me she likes it.

I was pretty comfortable with just asking her what she wants me to do with her and when she can handle this and when I need to give her space(granted she never ask for space anymore). But her mom keeps telling me to find new hobbies to give her room. My girlfriend has fought with her mom about it, stating that she's an adult and if she wants me there I will be there. She fought with her mom about it because I talked to her about it. I was worried I was smothering her and she needed space and her kind nature didn't want to tell me that. When we talked about it she said it's nothing like that and her mom is just worried because of the incident. The other day I wanted to go the doctor with her because it was a new doctor and she was scared so she wanted me to be with her because she's comfortable with me. Her mom absolutely hated it and said she would go instead of me if she needs someone to go. My girlfriend told her that it's only she gets to choose who goes to the doctor with her and took me with her against her moms wishes. 

I want to make it clear that I'm very grateful for her mom. She has no issue letting me live in the same house as her daughter and is only asking a few hundred for rent. She's also helped me get unemployment and medicaid. She also plans to help me get on disability when coronavirus winds down. I don't have any ill will tward her, in fact I am eternally grateful for what she's doing for me. I'm just afraid I'm either getting between her and her daughter or my girlfriend needs space and she's not telling me but her mom is.

TLDR: My girlfriend says I can cling to her and her mom is telling me to back off. How should I handle the situation?",02Apr2020,1
586,"I rent a room from Brian (M29). We've been roommates for about three years. I babysit his daughter Sara (F4) in the mornings until her mom gets off work. This morning I was sitting in the living room with Sara watching kids shows. She was playing with a doll. All of a sudden she said, 'Daddy licks my butt.' (For her, butt refers to front and back, the whole general area.) I responded with, 'Huh?' She said, 'Daddy licks my butt.' I said, 'Oh, when?' She said, 'This morning. Don't tell my mom.' I responded with, 'Did your dad say not to...' She interrupted me with, 'He said DON'T TELL ANYONE, it's a SECRET. So don't tell anyone, okay?' I said okay and changed the subject... I know that asking her questions isn't a good idea, that kids can be really suggestible. Now I am here asking for advice...

I feel a little sick. Her toddler bed is in his room, but I know she sleeps in his bed a lot. Do I think that he's the type of guy to do this? No. But like, who knows... I feel really guilty because a small part of me wants to say it's not a big deal, kids say things, and I don't really want to cause any chaos with false accusations. I live in a horrible area for renters and there's no way I could get another room for the same price... Then I feel extra super guilty because it would be so selfish of me to turn a blind eye to potential abuse just because it would inconvenience me. But I don't even know what's the first step I should even TAKE.

I know that she should probably talk to an actual child therapist. Someone trained to ask questions in the right way. Can I do an anonymous report to child protective services? I don't want to bring chaos into our lives, but I can't pretend she didn't say anything and let potential abuse continue... I feel so torn. I had to type this out because I can't even tell my bestfriend because if nothing really happened, if it's just a kid saying random things, I don't want it to get out and ruin my roommate's reputation.

Any advice?",02Apr2020,1
587,"I glanced at his phone a couple weeks ago and noticed he had a second Instagram account.

It kind of stressed me because he had started messaging someone and leaning away from me a few days before that.

I don't care that he's messaging people but the leaning away thing was really bothering me. I brought it up to him and he said he didn't even notice but he wasn't doing it for any reason other than it was comfy.

But it doesn't look comfortable...

And he's back to leaning away and I didn't even remember he had a second account but then he said he didn't get my message notification (because he was on the other account) and it reminded me of it.

And he never gets my messages because he's always on the other account. 

He tried to show me one day that he wasn't getting my messages and so I sent one and it showed up because he was on the account I know and he quickly took the phone and was like, ""oh... Well it worked that time.""

So I'm not sure what to do about this.

Should I try to find his account and guess the password? He's given me passwords to all his other accounts... voluntarily. I don't know if that's a red flag or not though.

Should I bring it up to him? He can just as easily lie to me and I'll just be stuck in the house with him pretending it's okay while I watch it all the behaviour slowly come back again.",02Apr2020,1

592,"I have CPTSD, Social Anxiety, GAD, and Depression. I also have a pretty shitty self-worth and self-love. I'm so fucking unsuccessful when it comes to relationships. I am 25F and the only relationship I've ever had was when I was 18 which only lasted about a few months. That is so fucking pathetic. I bet any guy that I do ever date may not want to ever date me because of my lack of experience.

I lost my dad at 15 and coupled with being raped at 21, I'm just so severely damaged. I don't trust anyone - I am in a mental prison. I do have a few friends fortunately, and my immediately family and I are close, but I suck so much at making new friends or finding someone to date. I either push them away from my lack of self confidence, negativity or insecurity, either due to being too afraid to speak or be myself when around them or once I do form a connection, I feel like they either secretly hate me, cant possibly like me or ever want me around. And sometimes it seems that this self-fulfilling prophecy keeps people away. it's horrible.

And dating is nightmare. Guy's either see me as a quick fuck or those who do get to know me for a bit eventually run off. I do think I'm kind, compassionate and intelligent but I guess my insecurity bleeds through which makes men run away. I know I need to go therapy but I definitely don't have the money for it now.

His 12-year old nephew, who he’s raising, is showing more and more signs of being a psychopath, and I’m not using the term lightly. I’ve known him since he was a baby so I’m pretty familiar with his life. He’s very hyper and has been diagnosed, and is being treated for, ADHD. He’s all the time chopping on trees and tearing stuff up. He does this on their property so I can’t say much about it, it just goes towards his personality. He’s been known to sneak alcohol and steal. A few weeks ago he showed up with an iPhone that was locked, claiming he had found it in the woods. The wallpaper picture was of a kid around his same age. My husband and I are convinced he stole it from a classmate. When he comes riding in the woods with us he’s very disrespectful of nature. He chops down trees and even caught a crawfish and chopped it’s head off. I had a comeapart and my husband scolded him the best he could. His uncle gets onto him but it makes no difference. He’s getting older now and I feel like discipline should have been put in place long ago. The kid hasn’t had a very stable life. His mother is a crackhead and the grandmother who took care of him when he was a baby passed away a few years ago. He bounced between other family members before being permanently placed with his uncle who he lives with now. A lot of this stuff I could write off as him just acting out but today my suspicions were confirmed. I ordered something online for the neighbor and after it arrived this morning I walked over to take it to him and the kid was in the backyard with a shovel. I asked him what he was doing and he said “burying an animal”. He then looked at me and made a finger gun and said “pow! I got him!”. I lost my shit and told him that it was really bad and he responded by saying it was his property. I didn’t ask him what kind of animal because I didn’t want to know. I called my husband and he’s gonna talk to the neighbor later but the neighbor was standing right there. He already knows. A few minutes later I could hear him telling his nephew that it wasn’t “his” property but he wasn’t yelling or scolding. I know he wants to see the best in the kid, we all have a hard time seeing evil in our own children, but evil is what he is. Sadly, I don’t know what, if anything, I can do about it. Usually, in cases like these, something tragic has to happen before the police will, or can, step in. Is there anything I can do?

The first time we were going to meet, she was late (by about 20 minutes, which was taken out of my session). She seemed very apologetic and honest, so I didn't mind as much.

The second time, she canceled due to having a migraine (I didn' t hold this against her either, it's a medical problem, things happen) and she rescheduled with me for another day/time.  Fast forward to the time we were supposed to meet, and she was late again (which was taken out of my session).

This week we were supposed to meet on a certain day at 3, and messaged me to reschedule at 2. That was okay with me, it wasn't a big deal.  We were supposed to meet today and I messaged her an hour before our appointment. Loe and behold, she said I was scheduled for tomorrow at that time (this is all documented in texts).

My Dad described it as a “catch” he would tell me to lay flat on my back and relax until I could breathe regularly again. It is a once or twice a month occurrence nowadays. 

In December I was diagnosed with Bronchitis and given an inhaler to treat that. It helped, but amidst all the chaos of the world my anxiety has doubled as well. Often times when I have anxiety attacks it causes a pain in tightness in my chest similar to these “catches” my Dad always explained. 

At 6am this morning however I woke up and it felt like my lungs had been encased in plastic wrap. I tried to cough and got little results and struggled for a few minutes before grabbing the inhaler that had been given to me in December. 

About 30 seconds after the two puffs I took my lungs suddenly felt relaxed and almost rubbery. I could cough up some phlegm afterwards. Now I’m left wondering if I need to see a doctor about possible asthma that does run in my family. Or if my anxiety has gotten worse with time.

So my ex and I dated for almost a year, and I can gladly say that I was in love with him. He was the first guy I’ve ever been with who treated me right, and he turned into my best friend. When he broke up with me about 4 months ago, it destroyed me. Although we were both young and we didn’t date for that long, I had never loved someone the way that I loved him. That being said, he never gave me a reason as to why he left. His only explanation was that he just wanted to be alone. I asked him multiple times if he wanted to get back together in the future, and he said no that I should move on. So my imagination went wild, and I started assuming that he was probably with another girl and that was why he left. It devastated me, and to cope I started drinking and going out. I ended up having sex with a few people since the break up, but I was drunk all 3 times. Well a couple weeks ago, I finally got him to agree to talk to me in person. We set a date and time and I was really looking forward to it in hopes that we might end up back together. Before we ever ended up meeting in person, I get a text from him asking if I had sex with anyone else. I told him yes and then he went crazy on me. He started sending me mean texts and was obviously upset. Turns out one of the people I had sex with he knew, and I had no idea that they knew eachother. I called him and talked to him about it, told him my side of things, but he didn’t care. All he cared about was the fact that I had sex with someone that he just so happened to know.

608,"Bit of context: I (26F) started working in an NHS laboratory four years ago, I struggle with depression and social anxiety for which I've been prescribed tablets. I have about six close friends who I'd trust with my life (and vice versa) so I'm not completely antisocial but I'm very careful who I let get close. They're all childhood or university friends so I feel very secure with them. 

I hide my anxiety well in work and have been described as 'sunshine', though internally the opposite is true and it's quite exhausting. 

About a year ago I could've said that I had 7 of these types of friend; a girl in work, let's call her J, who very quickly took me under her wing and showed me the ropes. I'd often help J through her relationship problems, health concerns, money worries, family dramas, etc., she was always very open with me about *everything*, even quite personal stuff. And she had a new issue every day that we could work through. I felt if she was being so open with me, I could at least try to do the same, and we quickly became friends. I'd go over to her house to help with art projects and DIY, and she'd come over to mine for food and TV, we had the same sense of humour and got along like a house on fire. 

J was also friends with a man in our department, we'll call him O, and the three of us began to socialise outside of work. We'd have movie nights and takeaways - it was great! J and O were very close and they'd message each other almost every day, they'd joke around in work, it was a lovely friendship and I was just grateful to be involved, to be honest. 

Just under a year ago, I started dating O, and ever since then, my friendship with J has gotten steadily worse. She instantly stopped messaging O and will often leave a room when he enters. She will pick fights with him in work and will give him the silent treatment for weeks on end. When they are in the middle of a disagreement, she will come to me and complain about how he won't apologise, even when there's no reason for him to. 

I feel like I'm stuck in the middle of them. She's more pleasant towards me than him but her behaviour towards me has clearly changed. She doesn't message me anymore, or offer to socialise outside of work like she used to, and she no longer seeks my advice on her ongoing issues. I feel completely abandoned and I'm not quite sure what went wrong. 

I tried politely bringing it up to her, ""I miss the good old days when the three of us used to hang out, I don't understand why things have changed"".

She said, ""things will change now that you and O have gotten together"". I'm not quite sure why. 
O and I have a fantastic relationship but my being upset about this is putting a strain on things. He says she's shown her true colours and isn't a very good friend, so I should just distance myself, but I'm really struggling to let it go. I've only ever lost one friend and it was incredibly painful. 

J has now gotten close with another girl in work,  H, who very much dislikes me (which doesn't bother me - you can't please everyone). H will shoot me stinking looks in the corridors and ignore me if I try to say hi, which I've now stopped bothering to do. I'm not quite sure why she doesn't like me, but as I said, you can't please everyone. 

Now whenever J is around me, she mentions all the fun things her and H get up to, and it makes me feel very left out. I'm not sure whether I should pursue something that's clearly broken, or let go entirely. 

Thank you in advance for any advice anyone can offer, I've actually found writing all of this down quite therapeutic in itself :)",02Apr2020,1
609,"My sister is my best friend, but she tends to walk all over me a lot. It’s nothing outright malicious but a lot of silly things that I don’t think about until after its happened. 

For example I had been house sitting for her and I’d forgotten to take my bottle of wine with me, it was a gift from someone special which she knows. Anyway she invites me over and when I get there, she and her friend were drinking my wine and it was all gone. I tried to express how annoyed I was but she just twisted it all back on me and told me it was house rules that anything I left was now hers, which included a pair of my shoes.

We had a bumpy upbringing and she was pretty abusive when we were kids, she was physically and emotionally abusive to me to the point where she even broke my nose so bad bone was sticking out of the bridge of my nose. 

Anyway, I try my hardest to stand up for myself but I always get this feeling of guilt. I’m worried I’m being too hard on her, she had some pretty horrible things happen to her as a kid and teenager. 

I want to learn how to tell her how I truly feel without feeling extremely guilty.",02Apr2020,1

This dude followed me to find out where I live and came over to visit. Obviously, I didn't answer. He cornered my dad when he was coming home and told him that I'm his friend, ""just so he knows"". My dad is really mad at me right now, calling what I did ""nonesense"" and that I'm causing drama in the neighbourhood by dealing with a drug addict.

So, as I said in the title, my mum is pressuring me into having a birthday party when my birthday comes, in about 6 months. She started saying things from late January early February about how I should orginise a birthday party, that it's not right to not invite people over for my birthday, that I am rude for doing that etc etc. I haven't had a birthday party for about 4 years, when I was in the military. In that particular party, I invited around 10-12 people, but only 1 person showed to my house and we ended up leaving and go for a walk. It was awkward for me. Plus because I had depression almost all my teen life (thankfully, after 6 years of psychotherapy I managed to overcome this), I always felt embarassed to invite people over in general, let alone for my birthday. the one time I did, even though nothing major happened, I felt bad most of the time untill all guests left. Also, the fact that most people forget that is my birthday even though they remember other people's birthdays (I know people are busy, so I don't complain about all the people in general here, but for the people I hang out since we were 12. They remember each other's birthday but mine? most of the time they forget or they get reminded by fb the last minute).

628,"When I was a kid, I was as introverted as they come.

I absolutely hated family gatherings. As I got older, I learned to tolerate them, but even then I never wanted to go. I never understood the point. When I was there, because I had no choice, I spent most of my time interacting with the adults. I felt safer hanging around the people who were the furthest from my age.

I did have one friend, and we spent lots of time together. Eventually we grew apart and I got turned into the third wheel outside him and another guy (who was kind of my friend, but not really). The three of us hung out a few times, but eventually, they just moved on without me.

I went into high school friendless, hoping to make some new ones. I did, after a while, and one guy from that group is still one of my closest friends today (although we don't speak that often). But for some reason my emotions just spiked at that period. The criticism from people my age, combined with ""jokes"", as well as my own natural tendency to be alone, all compounded into a huge weight that fell hard on my self-esteem. I worked jobs that I despised and I developed social anxiety disorder. I worked at McDonald's for a month before quitting in tears before my boss, who I remember looking at me like I was pathetic. In my third year of high school, I could feel the seed of depression blooming, and I avoided everyone. In my fourth year, I just wanted it to end. I never dated in that time; I never went to any parties; I didn't even go to prom.

In the following years, I was severely depressed. I was at college and I absolutely could not connect with anyone there. I tried to justify it as me not liking them, but the reality was that I felt like I couldn't connect with anyone my age. I was living in the city, too, and I never left my apartment except for groceries and to see movies by myself. I dropped out of college and moved back home after a year.

Around that time, I started working on myself, getting a little bit better. I rarely socialized, but I did online courses to get into university. I also began dating a girl purely out of the fact that she asked me out and I didn't want to be alone. I never really liked spending time with her. I distinctly remember her birthday party, her getting hammered, a bunch of her peers there, and me, sitting in silence, wanting to be in bed. I also worked a job that I enjoyed, but that was undoubtedly due to the fact that all of my coworkers were older than me.

Last September, I left that job, and began a Bachelor's degree at my local university. The first semester, I didn't talk to many people. I had a roommate and I avoided him like the plague. I did develop my social skills rather forcibly from being in a business class, and I asked a girl out for the first time then.

In February of this year, I turned 21. Over this semester, I've made two substantial relationships, and only one of them seems to consider me her friend. I went on a date with a girl from Tinder and it ended horribly because I overwhelmed her with my neediness.

Meanwhile, in the time all of this happened, every single one of my peers has been in and out of relationships, both romantic and platonic, like adults. And for some inexplicable reason, I cannot find the same natural tendency within me.

I know something's wrong with me, but I have no idea what it is.",02Apr2020,1

631,"

I’ll start of by saying that i love my best friend and i hate this feeling that makes me anxious when i’m with her. I want to know how to feel better about myself. I know this has nothing to do with her i just can’t help how i’m feeling.

The story starts when we went to this event a few months ago, there i saw a guy friend that i kind of liked he also brought his other friend along. The whole night he was talking to me and it was overall fun. He was giving me attention and i liked it. It all changed when i got home and started feeling something was off. I started getting really anxious thinking that he would start liking her. Then i could barely sleep just thinking about it. 

The next day at school he started talking to her alone. He walked to class with her and they were just talking through lunch. I felt like crap and thought it was because of my looks.
He got her number from his girl friend a few weeks later. I acted like everything was fine and i wasn’t hurt but she realised something was off.

I then got in a fight with her because she was acting like she was feeling sorry for me. I tried reassuring her i didn’t even like him and i just started saying how i hated how she was handling the situation. I blew up at her then things calmed down. Side note; I also told one of my friends about how i was feeling and then they told her because she was telling the story to her other friends. That’s how the fight started cause she brought up the friend i told that to.

Now every time i start liking someone i’m scared they will start liking her over me. I don’t know how to shake this anxiety away. Please tell me what you think i should do.

tldr; Guy i kind of liked started liking my friend and now i’m scared that every time i like a guy they will go to her.",02Apr2020,1

I'm only 30 and in high school and even college in 2009, it wasn't as heavily prevalent as it is now..

it just feels like teens are growing up too fast and feel like they grow up focusing so much on ""mental health"" when they're just kids.

Had a discussion with my bandmate (who’s the leader) if I could gig as this solo project. I asked him through messenger first and he said he was alright with it and then, when we meet up a few days later, I asked again just to make sure if he was alright with it. He says he’s alright with it but his face and tone said differently. I said my reasons as to why I want to gig as this solo project and then he asked me what my end goal was. I said I wanted to be a music producer and work with artists in the studio when I’m older. 

His tone was raised sorta angrily as he said “ Then you don’t to do that! You don’t need to do that” (meaning that I didn’t need to gig as this solo project). He went to say that “no one becomes famous alone and that’s why with my business smarts and your musical technicality, the band can grown and become famous”. He also mentioned that he was gonna set up a gig in the near future and I asked if it’s alright if my solo project can perform and he flat out said no because it was bad for business (meaning that if the band and my solo project performed together in a gig, it wouldn’t bring a lot of people to the gig).

I agreed that he was very good business-wise (cuz he’s very sociable) and he made good points in a sense, I just felt disrespected. Like there’s no sense of trust. It felt like I didn’t matter honestly. But I didn’t say anything. 

The conversation ended with both of us saying that whatever happens, there’s no bad blood, but I can’t help but think there is and will be bad blood coming from his side in all honesty.

There’s also the band’s manager, whom I’m angry at and at the same time, scared of. She has many connections and smarts about the music industry but is very toxic. There were times where she made me and the vocalist like we didn’t matter. She also says that she doesn’t know how to be “plastic” but a lot of the times, she is.

These things have been festering my mind a lot lately, especially since I have a bit of anxiety. I’m angry that I want to leave and pursue my dream but at the same time, I feel guilty because I consider the band to be family. I love and respect my bandmates. I see so much potential in the band. I respect the manager also. But I can’t take it anymore and I’m not sure on what to do.

637,"So I (25F) was in a relationship for quite a few years. That ended nearly a year ago and I found someone that I am pretty interested in. The thing is, I haven't ""talked"" to anyone in so long and now that I am older, I feel like it shouldn't be an every day thing. I got into my previous relationship when I was 19 so that is a big difference than getting back in the dating game at 25. The guy I like is 23, we go to the same gym. Normally I see him about three times a week there, but I haven't seen him in a few weeks. The thing about him is that we have flirted a bit, but both of us are quiet, shy people and I have been told by a mutual friend that he has a lot social anxiety. There were times at the gym where neither of us would say hi to each other or talk (I also have anxiety). At the same time, we have hung out with a friend group a few times and we always seem to gravitate towards each other and stick together in a way. Two days ago, I decided to add him on snapchat, and he added me back. A couple hours later he messaged me and we messaged each other back and forth for quite a few hours.  Neither of us messaged each other yesterday, and I don't know whether I should message him yet or not. 

Since he messaged me the first time, I feel like it is my turn to message him first. I was thinking maybe over the weekend, to give it a few days for things to happen so we would have something to talk about and keep things interesting. I feel like messaging someone every day could get boring, and even though I really want to talk to him, I want to play it cool and not rush/force anything. At the same time, I don't want to lose his interest and I also don't want him to think that I am not interested in him.

638,"I have a friend/roommate who was kicked out of his last place about 5 years ago. He was in a pinch so I let him stay at my place. I  tried to keep bills for roommates lower and include utilities to help my friends out. At the time 300 for the smaller room 400 for the bigger room. My girl friend and I never expected much from them. When we cook half the time we would include them and we let them have access to our snacks. They never picked up after themselves and never cleaned. In fact the one roommate I'm mad at right now (the reason is coming shortly) once told my girl friend he doesn't do dishes because he feels we don't do a good enough job at them anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forwards years of this I finally raised rent by a 100, asked for them to start doing their share of the cleaning (at the time everyone in the house started cooking a lot and using Tupperware so we were doing 15-20 loads of dishes a week and it was becoming too much for my girl friend and I). One roommate moved out and the other had his girl friend move in.

&amp;#x200B;

Keep in mind we still do majority of cleaning and continue to supply dinners from time to time, basic food and grocery, etc. I'm not going to sit here and tell you we are perfect, but I do actively try to make  living here easy (I'm a people pleaser and over the last few years I'm starting to HATE that about me).

The roommate I'm mad about has a rather big ego and has trouble looking at problems objectively because of it. He can be blind to his own faults and is controlling based on how I see him treat his girl friend. (He once invited a girl from his work over I'm fairly confident just to make his girl friend jealous)

Anyways  to the problem I'm having trouble shaking

Kind of TLDR:

A few days ago my roommate came downstairs to have a very serious conversation about my girl friend and I being irresponsible about not taking social distancing seriously. Our trips from the weekend include Safeway, Costco, Liqour store and hardware store for air filter. I feed the house several times a week and try to stay stocked up on basic grocery needs.

I have watched this same roommate recently go shooting, buy a car, take a trip to the dump as well as go grocery shopping. I tried to convince myself (which it wasn't working) that they are sitting at home most days stuck in their own bubble (they both were laid off weeks ago, my girl friend and I were not). 

&amp;#x200B;

Last night my girl friend had sent out a group text (I wished to god she hadn't included me in it) that she would be cutting down feeding the house to three nights a week at which the couple sent back a thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm pissed because I hate how blind they are to their own faults, how I assume they sit at home and pat each other on the back that they are doing such a good job that they feel the need to put us in our place.

&amp;#x200B;

The advice I need is I want to tell them after the Coronavirus stuff winds down I want them to start looking for their own place. I know that's irrational not sure how to handle this. I have been irrationally angry for days now.",02Apr2020,1
639,"My best friend has made me feel left to a side 

So, I [F24] have been best friends with Lily (pseudonym ) [F24] for about a 11 years. She’s the most solid friend I’ve had ever and I love her like a sister. 

We went to different universities after high school, and naturally, we both expanded our friend circle. Some of these new friends we’ve met and some haven’t. 

We both graduated university. I went to grad school and she got a full time job in her field. But we still let contact and always we’re there for each other. 

Particularly, about this time last year, she was having troubles with her other best friend whom she met in Uni (we’ll call her Nina) [22F]. I hadn’t  met Nina at this time. 

I would just listen to Lily and try to give her advice so she could make amends with her. I never told her what to do or not because it’s none of my business. 

Turns out, Nina had gotten jealous and thought I would steal Lily from her. (Yeah I know what you’re thinking). I know so because Lily sent me a voice message of Nina saying “you can just stay with Jen(my pseudonym), like how you call her”. I was BAFFLED. There wasn’t any reason for her to say that none sense. 

Fast forward, they made amends pretty quick. But for some reason I felt like I was left to a side. Like, I couldn’t enter that territory on being a super friend to Lily because it was Nina’s place, ya know? I’ve felt away it never let Lily know. 

Anyway, Lily was insisting on both of us meeting. When it finally happened, which was in February this year in a group outing, it didn’t go well. 

This girl didn’t even look at me. She kinda avoided eye contact with me and wouldn’t speak to me directly unless she had to. She would also look at me really badly. 

I told Lily this.l and that I felt really uncomfortable. Lily told Nina and pulled us apart to talk. Nina said she was having “anxiety” because there were many people together. (I’m not minimizing this btw, I have anxiety and I’m being tested for it). I said “okay sure no problem “ to not create a major issue. 

Thing is, Lily was una very tough position so I kept this all quiet. Nina “insist” on getting to know me better but that’s not the vibe I got from here. 

Anyway, ever since this, I’ve been holding back on talking to Lily and just keeping distance because I know Nina is very manipulative (other things have happened that I’ll keep them out of this post). 

I have to add, Lily is always making plans with Nina and doesn’t include me at all. She just goes like “I imagined you’d say no so” and I really bums me out. It’s like she doesn’t care about me anymore. 

Anyway, I just had to let this out. I don’t know what to do. What to say.",02Apr2020,1
640,"My son is 9 months old and he’s been babbling for a long time. He says mama baba dada. I don’t really count those as first words because he doesn’t know what they mean. The other day my boyfriend said while I was at work he was going to give him a bottle and he clearly said baba, but I kind of brushed it off and thought he was babbling and it was a coincidence. But today, he was playing in his exersaucer and having a good time and I figured he was getting hungry so I asked him if he was hungry for his baba yet and he said baba baba and then started crying. I got him out and made a bottle and when I came back he was standing up and said baba so clearly while reaching out his arms. I feel like he understands it.

Now I am getting hit with bank fees and bills that I just can't afford, but with COVID I can't find steady income.

642,"I have no way of paying my rent or coming up with the money for it so I'm already basically anticipating being evicted. My rent is due on Sunday. I talked to my landlord and their only advice or offer was to take a late fee but I'd still have to have it paid by Sunday to not get the eviction started. I'm at a total loss about what to do. I've been struggling since the beginning of the year when I lost one of my jobs and had to pay to get my car fixed so I could get to my another job. Well now thanks to the coronavirus, my second job is over and I don't know when it's starting back.

My friends can't help. I don't have a credit card. My parents are not an option. My credit is still recovering from co-signing on a loan for my ex-boyfriend and being on a credit card with my sister and both of them not paying on time (or at all). Payday loans are not legal in my state and personal finance loans aren't an option because my credit is shot. I'm making payments on my car so I have no title (but I would never want to do that no matter how desperate I am).

I tried the two charities listed in my area for rent assistance but they both said they have no money right now and I'd have to be on a list. I even resorted to trying basically begging on facebook for advice but nothing happened. The rent relief place basically told me I was too ""well off"" to qualify. I applied for temporary unemployment last week but that won't come in for a little while. I gave my landlord all this information but they basically said tough luck and for me to figure it out but Sunday. I checked with the courts in my area and they said they'd still be processing evictions during this time.

Do I have any other legal options here? My landlord is very firm that they will still be filing evictions and that rent is due. I'm legit terrified about all this and am just wondering what my options are and if anyone had any advice about some thing I could try? What should I expect to happen when being evicted? I don't know where am going to go or what this is going to be like, so any advice is welcome. Thanks.",02Apr2020,1
643,"This may seem like a silly question (hence why I'm posting here), but I'd like some more information please.

I get that our economy is under a lot of stress, billions of £ / $ lost and thousands are now unemployed.

But some of the statistics / information I've seen on this has only been based on the fact that everyone is under quarantine / lockdown.

My question is in relation to the future of the economy, I'm 19 and going to university to study CompSci. I'm worried sick, the sensationalist media hasn't helped, my university is not top 10/20, I'm worried I won't be able to find a job after uni. I'm doing 4 years (1 year in - industry, which should help).

I guess I'm just stressed. I'd like to get a good paying / top job one day. I'd like to eventually open my own business (long way away yet!)

How will the economy be (I'm from UK btw) come 3-4 years down the line. I read something like it'll take 18+ months to get a cure &amp; a further 2 years to get 'back to normal'. 

Any advice on what I can do to make myself more employable will be great!

So as you all know plenty of people have had to stay home and work during these trying times and for me it has been no different. I'm a busboy at a local winery and how I've been really fortunate is that the winery has offered to pay our expected wages while Cali has this shelter in place order.

The only issue is that I am planning to go on a month and a half road trip over the summer. I hadn't seen if my employer was willing to offer me that chunk of time off yet because I was waiting for permits to be accepted and reservations to go through before I told anyone. I've been at this establishment since sophomore year in high school (so three years now), I've never asked for a huge amount of time off, and I know of other employees who have taken multiple months off and still had their job waiting for them when they got home (albeit under different management), I'm just worried that if I tell them now that they might let me go since they'd now know that they'll be paying me to do nothing for the next couple of months only for me to use all of that money to go on a vacation a few weeks after we get back (assuming we go back to work around the beginning of June). What's also been a curve ball is that my first manager had gotten let go and we've had this new one for a couple months now. I genuinely want to like her but it has been more than difficult to build a relationship with her, she's fired a lot of people I love from the establishment and forced others to quit, I'm afraid she wouldn't be as okay with the idea of someone taking a month off (especially a busboy) as my other manager would've been in the past, and wouldn't think twice about letting me go the first opportunity she gets (I feel like the only reason she's kept me on versus the other 4 original bussers is because of the rapport I've developed with all the staff of the years).

I want to do the right thing and let my team know as soon as possible, but free money is free money and unfortunately I'm a dirty capitalist. I was thinking of telling them May 1st, I don't want to completely blindside them because the possibility still exists that they allow me to go on this trip and still have my job when I return. Is two months enough time from an employers standpoint to find a solution for this?

I know I'm probably over-thinking this but thanks anyways!

666,"Hey everyone. Lately I've been experiencing a weird phenomenon. I have struggled with food for a big part of my life, always having to think about what I eat. I'm not fat, 83kg at 190cm and I have a decent amount of muscle, but I feel like I can't stay like this forever unless I change my strategy.

I've been experiencing a very weird phenomenon where I feel kind of disconnected to what my body does. When I think whether I'm hungry or not and my mind thinks no, I (or rather my body) sometimes still chooses to eat food. Giving into this phenomenon only seems to make that part of me bigger. I really feel like a degenerate when it happens. How can I tackle life when I can't even give myself the proper nutrition (the thing is I don't even eat sugar).

I think it might have something to do with the type of food I eat. The thing I crave most are oats (finer type) with protein powder, peanut butter and some nuts. But it's anything, if I buy 200g of nuts sometimes I just keep eating with the excuse: ""When I'm eating healthy, my body should tell me when to stop eating."" But I don't know anymore what that signal is I feel like.

I don't know what it is. It feels like there is a part of me that is addicted to eating and the nice feeling it gives me while doing it. But if I give in to it too much I know I will be fat in a couple of years, especially now with the quarantaine, while I do less sports. My father and uncle both are really fat, and I want to prevent that. Does anybody have experience with this?

I was not there to see how or which site she was on but as she told me later, she did call the number on the screen. And as usually the scammers do, they instructed her to install some software so they could connect to her computer and control it remotely. 

When she did all they said, they connected and started ""fixing"" the issue. It looked like they were loading something or downloading something from her PC for a good 30 minutes. That's when she called me and I instructed her to shut down the computer. When she couldn't do it, I told her to just unplug it and wait until I came over. 

The ""company"" tried to call her later and figure out why they got disconnected, but I told her not to talk to them. They later sent her an invoice to her email for $480. The invoice had and address and a company name and even a BBB page which I am assuming all of it is fake. 

Later that evening I came over and ran Malwarebytes on the computer which found nothing. Then I changed the router login info, wifi password, wiped the iMac clean and re-installed the OS. Then changed all her online billing website, email, utilities, etc. passwords and set a credit freeze in all three major credit card bureaus. Also, had her change her bank account number. 

Is there anything else I am missing or should do? Should she even open emails from the scammers and what are the chances that they stole her info and will use it in some way? She did have her bank account open and logged in when the scammers connected to her computer.

669,"    This is my friends post and I want to keep it anonymous to keep her safe but here's a little backstory...
     My friend is in the process of being adopted for the next five years. Her mom usually doesnt let her have things like social media, so she let my friend get pinterest. Due to recent world events she has been very bored, especially since she is a very social person. She int used to this lifestyle, so she texted some people to find somebody to talk to during quarantine. She has caught her mom and her friends talking and complaining about their kids. These convos arent exact as I'm not my friend but it pretty much summarizes the story.

     To the story

     My friend will be T and her mom will be L. T is still texting people, and she tells them about things her moms do like give her no privacy and force her to share a room with her sister...shes ok with it she just sometimes needs a vent. Anyway, one day, L decides to look through T's phone because she doesn't trust her, and finds one message convo with Y (one of T's messaging buddies). She calls down T and this convo goes down.
L: ""T, do u want to tell me something""
T: ""yeah..I've been texting a girl named J"" (another friend)
L: ""oh, so theres another one""
T: ""what?""
L: ""i know about your little texts""
T: ""I'm sorry""
L: ""I'm disappointed you didn't trust me enough to tell me your feelings""
T: ""I'm sorry but you didnt trust me either""
L: ""well, K (other mom) and I have decided to not let you have a phone once you are adopted""
T: ""that's for FIVE YEARS what do you mean?""
L: ""you heard me. Now go upstairs, you're grounded""

     This is summarized so I'm sorry it's so short haha. Anyway, T told me all of this and is looking for advice. They don't know about her email account so we use google hangouts (messaging app) to text via email, and her parents cant access it. I've been trying to help her but its hard, and I thought maybe a bunch of internet strangers could help...
So...what should T do In this situation??",02Apr2020,1
670,"Basically the title, more info below for context. I tend to lurk most of the time, but I really need to figure out how to move forward. Sorry in advance if this is wordy.

I've probably needed therapy for a long time, but I didn't really realize it until there was a traumatic event in my family a few months back and I had no idea how to deal with it. Still don't. Even though I'd been advised against it (quality of professionals on staff is apparently pretty low?), I'd planned on visiting the counseling center at my university upon return from spring break, but got slightly derailed because of COVID. Now that the university is closed, I'm needing a different option. Problem is, I'm still a student. I don't have a ton of money saved, and online therapy, while cheaper, is still a bit out of my price range. Big advantage of the university center - covered with tuition, parents need never know.

I say that because there's a big stigma in my family around mental health. Basically, poor mental health = weakness, and I just need to get over it. I really think this is something that I need, but I'm scared of my parents reacting poorly to my asking them to help pay and making me feel worse than I already do.

I'd really appreciate any advice on how to approach the situation.

Does anyone know if I should worry about this? I was planning on leaving next week. I'm being as safe as I can, I have been staying at my parents house since I got here, we only go out for groceries. Thanks!",02Apr2020,1
673,"So some back story:

Normally school has provided me a necessary stress which in return allows me to fall asleep very easily, the second I get home, finish homework, eat dinner, and go to sleep I have no issue. Then Corona cancelled school for me for most likely the rest school year. Which at first wasn't a big deal, I have enjoyed the time off, allowing me to explore new hobbies and play through lots of video games I never got a chance to get to. However, recently staying home has affected my sleep schedule. About 1-2 weeks ago was when it started becoming a major issue. I would go to bed at around 9-10 PM which is pretty early compared to people who are about my age (15-17 for a general range of how old I am). However I never ended up falling asleep until about 12 AM - 1 AM and only 2-3 days ago was the only time it has not happened. Last night I didn't sleep at all, and I ended up sleeping about 7ish  hours ago (7 AM for me) and only got about 5 hours of sleep, when I woke up around 12:30 in the afternoon. 

I've tried lots of different strategies including cutting of my caffeine intake around 4-5 PM and not using any blue screen electronics and if I do I use night mode and/or my gaming glasses ([reference ](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/Ky9wlWF2o5HOmoUWseucl9P1vDr3UcGBhxjv2IVBl4_sdBiwCMCxExIAhfHK1v-GmmBYdQGd1HWm9tEDW31tyBDZxsmZBkqjiggEkbxwpiMVDtSa_5qKb8ZFJl3bjIRZC2TL-5HB8_cfOpdUD9OE61nxtIhYjSKLsfjKJMx88LrBwVK29bqAeT8Y7-kvNOYCpX6Qey1aypDSQ_0HtiM))

I've even tried some sleeping medicine that I've used in the past (melatonin) and have had tried some other over the counter medicine I'm not going to state here.

The other problems I've had would be that I've been extremely hot when ever I'm about to go to sleep, I have a ceiling fan on at the highest speed it will go and a small floor fan at its top speed as well, however I'm still sweating. I've stopped using a comforter while sleeping as that doesn't make my situation any better and have resorted to using a thin cotton like blanket along with my bed sheet blanket. I've also used a Spotify playlist (I use the sleep genre on spotify) through my laptop which I can use without having the screen on, as without any background noise I can't stop thinking or will try to process thoughts that keep me awake.

I keep having issues and it has been affecting me quite a bit. I need help, and I don't know what to do at this point. I've done a sleep study in the past as well, but nothing really came of it. So I don't know if I should do another one soon. If anyone can help at the slightest with some advice that would be hepful.

TL;DR: I've had trouble sleeping lately and recently had done a semi all nighter not going to sleep until 7 AM. I've tried different strategies but nothing seems to help.",02Apr2020,1

675,"Hey everyone, I am looking for unbiased advice on this subject. I think that there are no solutions in which all of the parts are happy, so I would like to understand which would be the best option. And also, I'd like to know if I'm being to unreasonable or emotional about it.

I (26F) live in the capital city of my country, six hours away from where my boyfriend (23M) lives. We've been in a LDR for two years and three weeks ago he came to visit. This was the same weekend that the corona virus blew up in our country, so instead of going back home, he stayed with me until now.

We are doing well on our own, we have a great relationship, have fun, take care of the apartment and our cat together. I love that he is here, I'm really happy that we are together since we usually see each other for a couple of days at a time.

However, I know that things are not black and white. I can understand he misses home. His parents are worried that he's away in case anything happens to them or him. They constantly ask him for when he is going back, send him information regarding travel tickets, and generally express how much they wish he was with them. I completely understand this, I understand that they are his parents and must be really anxious of being far away in case anything should happen.

This has affected my boyfriend, he also misses them and I understand that their messages also put pressure on him. He has been tweeting about missing his mother and wanting to be back at his city. I really try to not take this personally. If I were in his situation I'd probably feel the same, no matter how much I liked being with my SO. I understand that he wants his parents to be calm, and that he misses his pets, his room, and friends.

The problem is the following: I've been diagnosed with major depressive episodes. Just last night I was triggered by a phone called and cried for at least an hour. It was really hard to overcome, and the fact that he was there with me really helped me and comforted me. I am currently on a psychiatric medical leave for a month, so I have a lot of free time. Since we are on lockdown I'm afraid that being all alone will affect me emotionally. I'm not proud about this, feeling that 'I need' someone in order to be okay makes me feel terrible, but it's also the reality I'm in right now. 

We've been contemplating different solutions, but none of them seem to leave everyone involved satisfied:

1. He stays with me in my city. This would make me very happy, but I know that it would create a strain between my bf and his parents, who really want him to go home. Also, I know he misses his place and wants to be with his family and pets.

2. He leaves for his home. This would make him and his parents happy, but leaves me dealing with myself all alone. The thing about this is that he won't be able to return for God knows how long. We usually see each other 2-3 times a month but I don't think that we'll be able to do that now. I don't know when we'll be able to be together again.

3. We both leave and stay at his house. For me, going to my mom's house is not a choice. We have different ways of seeing the world and she kind of believes that my depression is mostly for lack of praying. I don't want to be in lockdown with that kind of pressure. My father's house is not an option either because he has two babies and virtually no space for another person (plus he hates cats). So going to my bf's parents is the only option for us being in the same city. The problem is that he lives in a very crowded house, and I feel that eventually I would feel choked there. His mom knows of my mental problems, and she worries a lot. I know this, so I would try my hardest to seem okay, even if I'm not. I have a really messed up sleeping and eating schedule, and I know that she would be very worried and trying to force me to eat/sleep. I appreciate so much that she does this, she's really nice, but it's again a lot of pressure to try to pretend that I'm doing okay to make her feel calmer.

Am I being completely unreasonable about this? What do you think is the best option here? Should he stay? If he does, should I feel guilty about it? Should he leave? If he does, do you have any advice for me being by myself? Should we both leave? Any advice on the relationship with my MIL?

I'd really appreciate your input, whatever it is or however tough truth it is. I am really biased and need an impartial opinion. Thank you in advance.",02Apr2020,1
676,"My town has started undergoing social isolation, and everything but essential businesses have been shut down. My parents are split up, and I have to live with my dad indefinitely, as my mum is an intensive care nurse who deals directly with covid patients, and my step-dad just got back from working abroad and is self quarantining. Shortly before all these safety measures really set in, my dad started seeing someone new, and had her over fairly regularly. He disregarded my feelings and boundaries right from the get go, as the first time he had her over he told me twenty minutes before she arrived, just as I got out of bed. I freaked and went over to my mums house for a while, as this was before the pandemic. 
Now, with social distancing in full swing in our town, he has her over nearly constantly. They drive to hardware stores as they’re redoing the kitchen, and take walks to gas stations. Today, she brought her two young children over from her ex’s, and brought them to McDonald’s and back. This makes me very uncomfortable, as I don’t know where his girlfriend or her kids have been, and they pose a potential risk to our health. I’m also concerned because I work in a grocery store and deal with the general public, so I also pose a risk to them. I don’t think they should be coming over here for the time being.

678,"My sister is in her early 20s and lives in NYC. A few weeks ago, when covid19 started becoming a much bigger concern, she came down to South Florida to stay with our parents, at my mothers' insistence.  

For the last two weeks, she's been here working remotely from their house and has stayed with my wife and I at our house a few times for a change of scenery. My parents live in large 6 bedroom house with a pool, dogs, plenty of food and booze. She's stayed in our guest room and we grilled together in our private courtyard and played games...It's boring because obviously we're all house-bound, but a far better situation than most folks are in.  

Now she wants to go back to NYC, and we're all at our wits end trying to get her to stay here where she'll be safer, or at a minimum, more comfortable. NYC has, unfortunately, become ""the heart of the pandemic"", she'll be alone in her two-bedroom apartment because her roommate went to stay with family in South Carolina, and we don't have any family nearby in case god forbid she gets sick. She says she ""misses her things"", and ""could use the alone time and some privacy"" but I'm 90% sure a big part of the reason she wants to go back is because this guy she's been casually seeing is still in NYC, and he's walking distance from her apartment. 

It's absolutely devastated my mother - who has yelled and cried and even had family members call her to tell her she's making a bad decision. My brother and I have tried talking to her but she just shuts down and says she wants to go back. 

 I know she's an adult and we can't make her stay but it just seems insane to me to choose to go back. I worry that if she gets sick, nobody will be around to help her. And if she gets *really* sick, nobody can vouch for her care. 

Any advice? Words of comfort if you're in NYC?",02Apr2020,1

680,"This quarantine is hitting me hard. I’m not a responsible person when I don’t have accountability to anyone else. I’ve been going to sleep at around 3am and getting out bed around 1pm. This is possible because my company has us working from home during the quarantine and business has been slow. I’ve been watching a some Netflix and browsing reddit and things to try and kill my mind. I know I need to get out and see the sun but I feel obligated to try and work for 8hrs which is more than the sun is out when I’m awake. 

To add to this, I sort of messed up with a girl I was casually seeing but wanted more with. Like to the point where she’s blocked my number and I don’t know if I’ll ever see her again. 

And so I’m stuck inside with nothing engaging to work on to keep my mind off all of this and my sleep schedule is messed up to where I never see the sun except for through my window.

681,"Hi. I am a 18 year old mom living in Northern Ontario. I have a 1 year old daughter (20 months). Her dad and I split in mid October. Her dad lives in a different community, you have to fly to get there.
So anyways, I want to return to high school and finish off my last year so I can graduate. And I want to send my daughter to live with her dad during this time. And once I am finished, she comes back to me and I will continue college once she's in kindergarten. My mom (who I live with) flipped out on me for wanting to go back. Saying things like ""You are abandoning her"" and ""If you take her away now, I don't ever want to see her again"". 
I want to do this for me, so I can have a better education. Better education equals better job. Which will mean better life for my daughter and I. 
Her dad and I are trying to co-parent. He says he has no problem with her living with him while I finish school. Which would be about 8 months. I obviously would always go drive over to see her whenever I can, spend holidays together (thanksgiving, christmas, march break). It's not like I am dumping her and leaving for good. She has a loving family on her dads side (they don't get to see her often as well). 

Am I selfish for wanting to do something for myself with the best interest in mind?

685,"We've started talking since late 2019 because we started having PE class together. Our conversations were mostly through text because of school break, but every single conversation was started by him. Once, I took a week break off social media and I came back to about 6 messages from him saying:
""Hi.""
""Hey.""
""Yo""
""Sup""
""Yo?""
""Are you playing vid games rn?""
""Are you dead lol?""
(Not word for word, but I'm quoting the last 3 lines for sure.)

He's always wanted to do face cam calls that last about an hour or two of mostly me trying to find an excuse to leave. 

A couple months ago, he confessed to me (through text) and I rejected him. I explain that I don't think I'm ready to be in a relationship because I still need to work on self-improvement and my really bad mental state. He insisted that he can carry my low self-esteem and that I'm not a burden. It took awhile until he finally gave up... It freaks me out a bit when people come on too strong because I have a really hard time trusting people, and he really tried hard to befriend me too quickly. At this point of the confession, we've only really started to talk to each other for about 2 months.

A week or so after that, our class just ended and as I was stressing about the test a bit, he offers to help me study. That's nice of him and I said ""thanks but it's all good I'm just a little worried like usual."" He said ""you'll be ok"" and reaches his arm out to pat my head and I jolted backwards so quickly and so hard that I could hear the cracking sound of my back bending. It was just an instinctual reaction and I stepped back a bit, then he just awkwardly laughs...

He does this thing where he'll point at me, but he doesn't just point at me like normal, he instead almost just shoves his whole index finger at my face and leans his whole body into the pointing. It's so uncomfortable and so many times during class I physically lean back and often take steps BACKWARDS just to distance myself. But guess what? He will STILL try to get physically closer. I don't know what to do at that point because my back is pushed to the wall so I just have to wait until he finishes whatever he's saying.

During the most recent class we had before covid-19 made us stay home, we played basketball, and he kept following me. It would be ok I guess if he was just trying to stop me from getting the ball, but no, he would only follow me around to repeat these stupid meme references or something. I think that's his attempt at being funny, but it gets extremely old when he repeats it 4 times in a row. I've been trying to hint it at him by saying ""uh, haha, yeah, I heard you the first 3 times..."" But he will say it again...! 
I've stopped laughing at anything he says.

Once school starts again, what do I do?
It was just annoying when he made me socially uncomfortable, but now it's getting to the point where I physically try to escape.

691,"I'll try to give as much information as possible without putting the privacy of the people in this situation at risk for losing their career. Sorry in advance for the length - I'll try to be concise, but it's not cut and dry.

I live with my mom and dad \[late 40s\] who have been together for 25 years. My mom is a private psychologist and we are very close. My dad runs a business of his own. They used to be in love, I'm sure of that, but they haven't been in a 'relationship' for at least 5 years. They have completely disassociated  from their relationship: they've had separate bedrooms for almost 10 years; don't touch each other even in times of grief, and interact as if they are awkward co-workers at best. Yet publicly and to their friends and family, they are devoted husband and wife.  It doesn't surprise me that they don't love each other anymore; they do not share any of the same values or goals in life, and disapprove of the other's views. I won't go into specifics of their disfunction and issues. I just need advice about the unfolding situation with my mom's affair.

For the past couple month's I've believed my mom is cheating, or at the very least, an extremely unprofessional and unethical friendship with a client behind her husband's back. 

The client \[let's call him C\] is a widow and single father with cancer who sees her on a weekly basis for therapy. He's overly charismatic and very social. He's an authority figure and well known in his community. My mom has no professional boundaries with him (not an issue she's had in all of her 10 years of practice) and he takes advantage of that. It started with asking about her personal life and make off-side jokes, to chatting for over an hour in her office after the session is over, to following each other on social media, to texting, to unpaid social phone calls at home. I hear her talking to C at home, and she uses a different tone of voice while speaking, along with giggling and teasing - like a crush. Because we are close, I am constantly  inundated  with talk about C; multiple times a day she shows me videos, memes, or texts he sends her.

She has always been extremely responsive but over the last three weeks she has become very attached to her phone to the point where she doesn't pay attention to anything else at home. I was already unsettled by that, suddenly ignoring everyone and everything around her because she's constantly texting a client. But now when she shows me funny texts or pictures he sends her,  the interface of the app is KIK instead of texting. Her only contact / conversation on the app is with C. I noticed her taking selfies (something she never does) and when I asked why, she flippantly told me she's ""sending a photo back"" to C. 

Professionally, everything she's done is more than enough to lose her job and possibly have her license taken away, ending her career. Ethically, I don't know what the right thing to do is. Should I tell my dad? He's a useless husband and a bit of a prick, but no one deserves to be cheated on or stay in a joyless marriage. I'm not sure what will happen if I confront my mom, and more importantly I've absolutely got no idea how to and what to say. Especially now that I can't seem to unglue her from her phone.

695,"I  24 (F) work as an assistant manager at a corporation where everything is generally a dollar. I started as a cashier and worked my way up and love my customers. I was held up at gunpoint at work and never thought about leaving or quitting but this situation has me on the brink of just leaving what I worked so hard for.

In August of 2019 I was working on a reset of an area at the back of the store. My coworker who we will call J (M) came up to me and laughing me told me that our drink (red soda can company) vendor driver who we will call Asshole was a real perv... I was confused and asked what he meant.. J said that he was just saying hello and doing small talk before they started to check in the drinks when he asked him who was working that day. Jay told him about our cashier and then me.. he looked confused and was like Tufted?? Which one is that... J then described me as short brunette with glasses and Assholes eyes lit up saying ohhh her and non chalantly asked J if he had gotten a chance to grab them yet.. then made a breast squeezing motion. J said um no I haven't and gave him a disgusted look. 

Next day Me, J, Boss, and another employee T were conversing while putting up stock and J brought it up and I made a point to say that my boss or J should call Vendor HR because I didn't feel comfortable having to check in someone who who was making comments like that about me.

Jay said he didn't want to do it 

Boss told me that since she wasn't there and so ahe wasn't going to do it. That I needed to call Vendor HR that they would handle it but I had to do it.

I didn't want to because I have had a terrible experience in school where I was assaulted and told by the school to just let it go and I knew I couldn't handle that again

Every Saturday the delivery would come and I would dread having to deal with him but we would have different drivers so it hadn't been a problem and if he came and another shift lead was there they could check him in for me. 

Well September 14th I was working with Boss so she checked him in but he kept trying to flirt with me and I kept shooting him down. ""Are you buying those chips for me?"" He asked and I told him ""Nope"" and walked away and got in my car for my lunch break.. he went out to his truck and on his way back came up to my window and smacked his hand on my window and it was so loud.. I honked my horn at him and gave him the most pissed look I could muster and he laughed and went back into the store.. sadly for me Boss had gone home so I had to sign his paper work but he was looking pissed because I kept rejecting him.
 Boss told me to call our HR since she didn't know how to contact the Vendor HR.. I called and they couldn't give me a number and he said to look it up online.. asked Boss if we should call our District Manager and she told me No

Tried discussing with my boss again and again over a few weeks about how I needed her to call  Vendor HR and get this resolved eventually it came to a head one day.
 she told me I had to do it since I was there... I told her that she should then make J do it since he was there and she said he didn't have to if he didn't want to and she wouldn't make him. I told her that it was rediculous that he didn't have to but I had to that this had gone too far. She uttered the sentence ""well tufted welcome to the big girl world"" and I immediately shut down.. i told her ""I have been dealing with sexual harassment since I was 11 this is not new to me I know what your job is and you are supposed to protect me and tell our District Manager and go to Vendor HR"". She still wouldn't listen to me.

October 11th I decided I had dealt with enough and I called my HR and told them what was goingnon and they were so confused why my manager didnt call my District manager and that i should call him immediately and if i got any resistance to call her back and they would deal with it.

I called my District Manager and just broke down told him everything. He couldn't believe that I had dealt with it this long that Boss hadn't told him.

Next day had to work with her. I recorded her ""apologizing"" to me which was her saying she had never been harassed so she didn't know what to do and that now she knows and that she was sorry and I never for a second accepted her apology even to this day. I told her what to do she didn't listen and I suffered for it 

District Manager for weeks did what he could.. but the Vendor kept sending him to the store until eventually he was banned from the store except there is a catch.. well for some reason they couldn't suddenly move his route so they told him he couldn't come in but another driver would come and unload his cargo. 

But they never told him why so we had every driver asking me and my boss why and I kept telling them to ask their boss. And that has been my life almost every Saturday I have worked since then..

Until March 14th when he thought he could come in the store and help unload his cargo... while I was there as the only lead who could check him in. Luckily the other driver came in to do the check in but of course kept bitching about why he had to be there and if I know why.. 

Called my DM and he said he was talking to the Vendor higher ups. I then asked my boss that I never work a Saturday again and she agreed to that .

Monday of last week I was on my first day of vacation and was told that Assholes bosses boss came into the store to apologise to my boss about all of this. My boss tried to tell him that it involved me and he never asked for my contact info to call me and say he was sorry. All he told her was that they would be disciplined and that Assholes boss never told him at all.

I do not know how to feel by the end of this i have been living this nightmare for 7 months and I can never look at my job without being terrible angry and hurt by everyone involved.

I don't know if I should go to higher ups or HR to make a complaint about everyone involved? I just don't want this to happen to anyone again.",02Apr2020,1

 The school store isn't doing much and is more of nothing si certain she's given out one thing.

On one we have to write a 250 word paper about a photoshop tutorial video(how do you even do this, like seriously) and then the ok there is a 750 word about any photographer, this week any documentary photographer, and one of their photos and why they took it and all that.

698,"Good day everyone,

I am a second year student who is 15 Credits behind. I feel like after my first two years of university, I have found nothing I care to major in, which is a problem considering I have already invested $40K into my post secondary education. I went to university with a criminology major in mind, however I was never able to get into any introductory classes for the program until this upcoming however I still remain unsure if its even the right choice to pursuit something new this late into my degree.

I am unsure in what to do with regards to careers after university at this point... If it helps, I am at a liberal arts university. Some area's I have taken interest in are Philosophy, Political Science, and history.

At the end of this semester I would have 45/120 credits. A major requires 36 credit hours.

700,"So about an hour ago, I was cleaning my bathroom (gotta keep busy during this lock down somehow) and I accidentally dropped my iPhone 6S in the toilet. It was half submerged for maybe 4 seconds tops, but regardless it won't charge, volume doesn't work, display and buttons are super laggy, and camera isn't working. I turned it off and put it in rice right away (because apparently that's a thing?) so maybe there's still hope for me if I give it a chance to dry out, but I've had this phone for 3.5 years and I think this is a sign she should be laid to rest.

My question for you is what iPhone model (or Android I guess) would you recommend? I liked the size and feel of my 6S, liked the 3D touch, enjoyed the fingerprint scanner and having a home button. Wouldn't mind a better camera but it isn't essential, not crazy about facial recognition but I'm sure I'd grow to like it.

701,"\[Posted for a friend\] I've been part of a joint masters and credential program for almost a year now at an accredited university. I was dropped from that program after not meeting their requirements (which have shifted and become unclear over time), leaving me in a position where I've spent excessive time and money on a program with nothing to show for it an no clarity on what to do next.

Ongoing communication for clarity, resolution, and alternate options with them have been slow, unclear, misguiding, and downright frustrating. Incase it's of note, the university is now going through the process of reviewing their accreditation as it seems they are at risk of losing it.

**To Summarize**

* I was provided misinformation on the requirements and process of my masters + credential program - part of which led to me being dropped from that program.
* There is a pattern of mistreatment of students, from extremely unequal standards and feedback to unclear expectations and program guidance and requirements.

I'm feeling stonewalled by the university at this point, and wish to present a legal case of some sort - whether as a resolution to my mistreatment, or simply to return the funds I've spent on this program over the past year.

Then my mother tells me it's because I didn't thank her for the stuff she sent down for my mom a few weeks ago and she says that my auntie said that she knows my mother would have brought me some of it so I'm guessing her point was that I was being ungrateful for that food.

706,"Hi, over a month ago I had my wisdom tooth removed (it was an emergency, huge infection was caused by it), because of that I had a swollen lymph whatever (English isn't my native language, I don't know how to call it properly), the first day already I was in a huge panic. Some weeks ago I went to the dentist again (for the wound of the wisdom tooth) and I mentioned the lymph, I was still freaking out **bad** over that thing, she said I should keep an eye on it. It doesn't hurt, didn't get bigger, I can move it as well but it's still there. My stupid ass, before Covid-19, Googled it. Cancer was the first (and only, I freaked out too much) thing I found could be the cause. So for these weeks I have been more scared than ever. Since I think October I've been having a huge fear of the doctor, I had to get a vaccination and I was in tears. I have some other health problems and I'm in panic every time I feel pain or I feel like something is wrong. But this lymph lump thingy made everything 1000% worse. Could this be a phobia? I don't know how to deal with the stress or panic, I get literal breakdowns over my health, to the point my partner has to do research for me and explain everything to me because I can't stop panicking. My partner also calms me down about it, but that takes a long time and usually I just sleep to get rid of the panic (it happens most in the morning/evening). I can't live like this, I'm only 17 and I feel like everything will kill me. I can't get therapy because my parents always say nothing is wrong (also about the lymph, I know something is wrong, I feel like it will be the cause of my death, like that I will develop cancer).

707,"So I'm in a situation and I need advice on how to tackle my parents (around age of 60). Sorry for formatting I'm on my phone. My girlfriend and I (who live by ourselves in a tiny apartment) have been feeling sick and have been under quarantine because of it. 

In the meantime my parents have been bringing food and taking out trash for my grandma. Couple of days ago I found out that my parents apparently have been going on a trip in the forest with some family friends. My mom said they kept safe distance but come on... and then afterwards taken my grandma out for a drive in the car because ""they felt sorry for her just sitting inside alone"". I told my mom on the phone that I thought it was stupid and a big mistake as they should not go on trips with friends and not be more exposed to my grandma than absolutely needed. My mom didn't take too kindly to that and after some arguing she hung up.

Today my father called my and said I should talk to my mom about it because she was sad. I said that I wouldn't apologize because it was a really stupid thing to do. He then started guilt tripping me by saying that they have to take care of my grandma and heavenly implied that my measly call asking how things went weren't gonna keep her alive. I told him that they should be limiting contact with anyone including my grandma (of cause not abandoning her but maybe not hang out) and then he hung up.

I feel so angry and frustrated right now because it's not the first time my parents do stupid things and I end up having to apologize just to get peace. I know I'm right in this situation and it frustrates me that apparently they have to know someone that dies before they follow directions. Suddenly I'm the problem in my family not the corona virus just for telling them the truth. This also affect my girlfriend alot because her mother is in the critical health department at the capitals hospital and we both feel my parents are contributing to the wrong side of that battle.

So ... If anyone have some insight into how to handle this or advice I would greatly appreciate it. I just want peace and not having to deal with guilt tripping stupid parents. I have trouble enough keeping my economy afloat while I write my master thesis and my job is in hiatus.

708,"When I say 'weird', I mean it in a good way. Like quirky.
Also, this probably goes on for too long. I didn't realise how much I had to talk about before I did this. Sorry for wasting your time.

Okay, so, I'm a girl in lower high school years (uk). I think it's 7th grade in American schools. I'm shy and awkward and I've always been 'weird'. I'm the nerd- I'm top set and hate sports. Some people don't even know who I am, and it's quite a small school (about 130 people in a school year).

 In primary school, it was always just me and my best friend. I didn't need to hang out with other people but everyone was friends in primary because it was 30 people in a year. Then came high school, and she went somewhere else. I had no close friend to hang around with, so I talked to a girl in my form who was also kinda weird. We made friends and I settled with the same attitude of only needing one person. 

This didn't work though, because her primary school best friend came to high school with her and whenever I hung out with them (so all the time) they just constantly talked about them and all the fun stuff they did in primary. I asked them to stop sometimes and they said sorry but then the next day it would be the same thing:

""Hey, remember that time I ......... and you ......... so we .......... !""
*cue endless giggling while I stand there staring at the ground*

She also kind of dumped all of her problems on me. She's had an unlucky life and she has every right to want someone to talk to about it, but I could never talk to her about what *I* was going through. It was kinda emotionally draining. It was all ""Oh, ......... been texting me some crap about ......... "" or ""I'm really annoyed with ......... "". Every dam  day. It was never about what I was going through, and she knew I was having trouble with stuff. At the time, I was trying to figure out my sexuality and 'the closet' is apparently not a nice place to live.

I also had this girl I'd known since basically when I was born- our birthdays are a day apart and we live near eachother. She's a bit (a lot) of a drama queen though. More recently, she joined the rugby team and got super popular so I don't talk to her in school. We'll call her M. I walk to school with M and one day we see my school friend I just talked about (let's call her H). We start talking to and from school with her too. All is going well until the arguments start.

I could talk about that for a couple of paragraphs but this is too long anyway and it happened a year ago so I'm fine with it. Basically, they argue with eachother, I argue with them, bla bla bla... One day they ignore me completely while walking home so I run off and go by myself. When I get home, I basically break down in my room and cry (probably over reacting).

I spent a long time not speaking to them, instead hanging out with a girl I knew from primary who had also had an argument with H. It was okay, but for the whole year, I didn't have friends in my class. Who I had 90% of my lessons with. 

We would have to do stuff in groups a lot, mainly in English, and I would either go with this girl I knew from primary (name = N) or the teacher would put me in someone's group. N probably only talked/ talks to me because she's super nice (she's that one perfect person who you just can't hate because they're so happy and kind). I only remember working with a partner once, and she was put with me because she was in a group of three with her friends and I was alone.

710,"So yesterday was my move in day at the off campus housing complex. Get there, get my keys, go up to the apartment and when my best friend and I walk in we find all these sticky rectangular things on the kitchen floor. Some are by the bathroom/hall way in the apartment. Apartment looks completely empty, as if there isn’t anyone living there. Mind you, I asked about my roommates and was told that I had some and they emailed them about me moving in. Upon my best friend and I looking around, we open the kitchen cabinets and there’s stuff that looks like it’s been purposely forgotten because it’s not stuff people would take with them upon moving out. I.e. plastic disposable food containers, plastic bags, other little things. So at this point I’m getting a bad feeling about the unit..We go into my room(it’s a 4bedroom/2bath apt) and it looks fine and I find a roach on the wall by the door. We start looking through the bathrooms and they are basically empty. Trash left in the trash can, left over toothpaste, no towels to indicate anyone is there. At this point we put things in my room, best friend and I tell each other the other roommates are probably out somewhere so we leave to get groceries for myself and get some food. We come back in the evening to still not find anyone even out of the rooms. We start going to each room to see if they’re unlocked, to our surprise 2 of them are. The first one is empty besides the furniture the complex provides and tapped on the door is an orkin sign from February of this year. So we think that the sticky things on the floor are for bugs now and no one cleaned anything up before I moved in. I’m getting even more bad feelings and by this point I’ve cried already. We move on to the next room and it has some persons bed comforter, lamp, rug, some clothes in the dresser etc but no one at all. So I’m thinking whoever is living in that room, probably left with some of their things and left the rest behind. The last room is locked so we can’t get in. So we came to the possible conclusion that they left the apartment since college is now all online due to the virus situation.
My best friend tells me to keep calm and not get overthinking but I’m past that point now. 
We start trying to put my groceries away, I open the refrigerator and there’s few food products left inside, milk from March 8th, some veggies with mold and that brown juice veggies get when it’s bad, the freezer has food too but something doesn’t smell that great when I opened it. So now we definitely think these roommates haven’t been there in a month or so even though I was told they were there. 
I cried so much at this point that I lost my appetite and my friend told me he wasn’t going to let me stay there with the disgusting conditions the apartment was in.

So now, I need advice. I emailed the property manager this morning and haven’t gotten any reply. I explained what I saw and how it made me to uncomfortable that I didn’t sleep there and how the property has already given me a terrible impression. I asked if it was possible to get a different unit altogether even if it’s a smaller one. I asked if they contacted the other roommates and if they knew that they could’ve left without warning with everything going on. It’s possible they did leave and the property doesn’t know because they’re still getting their money. 
If them helping me doesn’t workout, I may decide to just to break my lease because I refuse to clean up that dirty place that was said to be ready. I don’t think the others would come back if they went home either. 
My lease is supposed to end July 2012. Yes, it’s long and I figured it wouldn’t be terrible since things were going fine before all the virus stuff happened and I was planning to go back to school anyways. I had to get a place because my ex-bf, who is also my best friend and I, aren’t dating anymore. (We’re on good terms and he’s still being my rock through all this). All in all, I need advice on what is the best way to handle this. I’m so stressed and I’ve cried so much that I get nauseous. I need advice.",02Apr2020,1

715,"Original Post - https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/fdlfmn/someone_has_accessed_all_of_my_personal/

Hello again! So about a month ago I made a post about someone accessing my Gmail account and my Snapchat and I was unsure what I should do. Well, I actually found the guy. 

I know that no one is probably going to care very much but it's such a huge relief to know that my private information is safe again. 

I just really wanted to get this off of my chest because I'm so happy about the outcome. I'll try to summarise everything.

So, after this all happened, I looked into my Google account and looked into all of the devices I was logged in on - My Phone, My tablet, My Laptop, My Work Computer and My College Computer.

I'm not sure if I mentioned in my previous post but I'm doing an Apprenticeship so I have to attend college one day a week.

It showed that my college computer had been logged in on the exact same day at the exact same time to when all of this went down.

There is no possible way that I could have been logged into my college computer because I was at work.

I also did a bit of research and traced the IP address and it was located at my college. Everything started adding up and it was obviously someone from my college.

The next time I was there, I let my tutor know what I found out. He's a really cool guy who I have a lot of respect for and he said he would investigate. 

I've been in lockdown so now all of the days I would have been at college, are now in an online lesson. 

My tutor spoke to me in private and all of the snooping I had been doing in my account had paid off. 

Some little prick from another course in my college saw my account and decided to log in and mess around with me. I still don't know why he decided to do this. 

My tutor, his tutor and their manager took him aside and according to what my tutor told me, the guy got absolutely hounded. He was all apologetic saying stuff like ""I'm so sorry"" and ""But, it was just a joke""

They also investigated to see if this person knew me in case they did this to be malicious by looking at Facebook and other Social Media. So, yeah. I don't even know this person. That just makes it creepy as fuck. 

Anyway he's on his last warning with the college, as well as his job. If he fucks up again, he gets sacked and kicked off his course. At least I know who did this to me. 

I'm also quite happy because a lot of people, like family and friends were telling me to just let it go and forget about it. Yeah well, justice served. 

Unfortunately, my tutor wasn't allowed to tell me who this person was but that's okay with me because as long as he got what he deserved and I don't get hacked again then I'm happy. 

Sorry if this is all jumbled. I just wanted to update the kind few people who offered their advice to me before in case anyone was interested. Hooray for me! 

TLDR - I caught the guy that accessed all of my personal information and impersonated me and apparently he got absolutely destroyed.",02Apr2020,1

I'm considered an essential worker during these crazy times, but I do not work in the medical field.  My work has taken some drastic steps to try  to quarantine our staff to limit overlap and minimize the effect someone going down sick would have.  As such, my department is short staffed, since they changed our schedules and divided our team.  To ""help"" us during this time, they have assigned a lot of the non-essential departments' employees to work in our areas to be trained on easy tasks to make up for the loss of trained staff.

We work in extremely close proximity to each other - we are trying very hard to maintain the 6ft distance, but it is a challenge to do this and complete our necessary tasks.  We are in the same rooms as each other for much of the day - which is now 10+ hours.  Additionally, with these ""helper"" staff, we are spending a lot of time giving them instructions and showing them how to do things, which means that we can't be in different rooms or super far away.  This past week, we were assigned someone (different than the previous week - which was dumb in and of itself).  By day 4 of our week we learned that they live in a house with 3 roommates.  For us, that is already a fairly nerve wracking amount of exposure risk.  We then learned that 1 of the roommates is a nurse at the local hospital.  At present, they work in a surgical area, but are either now or soon being cross trained to work with COVID patients, since their surgical area does not have much work since they are cancelling all elective procedures.

As they just told this to myself and my immediate coworkers, I feel I am in an uncomfortable position.  I feel that with such a direct line of contact with someone who has a very high potential risk of exposure, this coworker poses a significant risk to myself, my teammates, and anyone else in our department.  I personally do not feel safe working with this person in my area, knowing how closely we work with one another.  My work does not have masks that could protect us - so that's not an option.  We only have distancing.  Due to unrelated reasons, we have already asked that this person not be placed with us again, but I feel they are a risk to any area at my work, since all of the areas work closely together.  

My question is: do I tell HR or another supervisor?  I feel that this could be considered giving out their personal information, but I feel that they pose a potential risk to all of us.  While I feel they may feel somewhat betrayed by leaking personal information to higher ups or HR, I do not believe that they would not have their job put in jeopardy.  They would probably be either assigned to work alone in an office, or paid but told to stay home.  At least that is my belief - my work does not yet have a formal policy on what to do if you are in direct contact with someone who COULD be exposed.

Let me know what you think is the best course of action Reddit!

TL;DR: Coworker just confided they live with with a nurse who will likely be working with COVID patients very soon.  I and my other coworkers feel unsafe around them now as we are essential workers but not sure we can take this private information to HR or otherwise report it, and not sure this is grounds enough we can ask that this person not be allowed to work in our area with us (where distancing is hard and there are no masks to be had).",02Apr2020,1
724,"Now I am not sure what to do with this information. He is my grandfather, my father's father. My father and mother do NOT know these details, and actually were lied to their entire lives about it. I only bring this up, because I planned to take the secrets to the grave but my dad has been asking me about Grandpa. You see, I was his caretaker in his last days I lived with the man. 

Growing up, I know I was German. (I live in USA) Now, Grandfather served in the US Airforce for many years then became postal worker, then retired. His relationship with my father was strained to say the least. Grandpa was abusive, a alcoholic, would lock my dad in a closet as a child. My Dad never became close to his father because of this. 

However, Grandpa and Grandma regretted everything. They did stop drinking, became active in church and completely changed who they were. It never made sense to be growing up, they always said they never would go to heaven. Grandma died, Grandpa was alone. Grandpa then fell one day, and from then on went downhill. I as the youngest grandchild that wasn't married and was still in town became his caretaker. It wasn't until I was there for his nightmares of him screaming in German did I start to wonder. 

He told me one day. He was forced to become a Nazi, because back then Hitler killed entire family trees if you didn't join him. Grandma was pregnant with my aunt at the time, and so he had no choice. It haunted him, and he was able to defect to the US, bringing Grandma with him. He had scientific knowledge as well as was able to read Doppler radar, a skill that wasn't well known back then. Now by the time my dad was born, war was over and things were looking better. My dad was the last child they had, and they had already decided they would lie about the past. Yes we are german, we lived in Germany for a while BUT it wasn't during war, and it was in service to america. American soldier through and through! 

Grandpa died. He died with regrets, the terrible nightmares. I know he regrets what happened, and that's not my issue. My dad keeps asking me things, and he can tell I'm not saying everything and keeps asking why. But, IS this something I should tell my Dad? I have no proof, would he even believe me? What ever proof there would have been caught fire. While fleeing the country, Grandpa had two moving trucks. One with all their things, and the second one empty they drove. The first truck caught fire mysteriously, and burned everything inside. 

Do I say anything? I have no proof other then what was told to me, and Dad is a proud German guy. He is proud to be so, I don't want to ruin that you know? I don't want to make whatever image he has of grandpa worse, because Grandpa was a different person than he was back then. He deserved redemption. But....at the same time, do I even have a right to NOT tell? Is that my call? 

And what if I do tell, but then it's assumed I lied. What if I get kicked out? (Living with mom and dad again now...middle of divorce blah blah)

But this information has been haunting me too. He told me all the details, the stories the people killed...the things he saw...I almost wish he didn't tell me. I feel like I'm protecting my family, but at the same time I feel like I have no right. 

What do you guys think?",02Apr2020,1

730," (Virginia, US)

I  was sitting in my room today and overheard a someone talking fairly  loudly outside and went to the window to see what was doing. I missed  the first part of the conversation, but some guy with a notebook was  talking to my neighbor and what I caught was something along the lines  of ""do you know the young men that live next door, about 22 years old?  Have you ever had any problems with them or police coming to the door?""  and then got a quote from him where he stated he has never had an issue  with us. I've emailed my landlord to ask if everything is alright as we barely ever talk. We just pay the rent on time every month and stay out of each others lives. 

\- Could this be my landlord or the HOA trying to make a case against us? 

\- Why would we not be notified if they were? 

\- Why would they talk to our neighbors and not talk to us directly?

\- Does anyone have experience with something like this?

FYI:  I dont know who the guy was, did not talk to him, he was carrying like a  notebook with some legal pad in it, seemed to just ask our neighbor  about us and then leave.

736,"We had an argument and he went to take a shower and said we could talk after he “cools off” in the shower.

So I wait and when he comes out he just says “we need to take a break”. Because were incompatible. He said I need too much attention, and he has school to focus on. But I have school as well, just like I have a job.

This all started because I ask him if he wanted to go hiking on our days off. I wanted to go hiking because the quarantine is killing me and we haven’t gone on a date in forever because of it. I was trying to be creative and think of ways on how we can spend quality time together.

So he said we need a break and when I asked him how long he said, “ I don’t know, a week, a month, maybe forever.” What the hell is that supposed to mean? He told me to just go see other people, and I said I didn’t want to and I still love him and care about him. And he said, “Well I don’t care about you.”

Okay RED FLAG??? Usually when people take “breaks” it’s because they’re unsure about their relationship, but he said he doesn’t even care?? Seriously? How am I supposed to live with him still and sleep in the same bed as him? I don’t have anywhere to go. No friends or family. I told him that since he’s the one that wants a break then he can leave and go to his parents or something and he said “okay so I’ll just be homeless then.”

If this was truly a break, he would still care. This came out of nowhere. In order for a break to even be effective you have to actually be physically and emotionally separated from them. If we just statin the same house all it’s going to do is cause more issues.

I’m sure I saw this person on her mutual friends list. My mum was a really friendly person and stayed at my house so she knew this friend because they were my housemate once. 

After the news was announced, I didn’t hear anything from this friend. I checked my mums Facebook friends, this person wasn’t a friend.

I'm really interested in biology, anatomy &amp; physiology, and marine science, but I'm am really bad at math and constantly need to ask my boyfriend for help explaining topics, so there is no way I would last in that. It's the only subject where I've only barely managed to keep a B. I know business is a generally good area to go for, but I'm not very good at managing things. I'm not good at writing and only draw the occassional doodle. Computer science seems fun, but I know it also requires a lot of math. I will try programming this summer though, before ap computer science a.

761,"Hi Reddit - obligatory using a throwaway. (I'm 30, btw.)

I'm in America where the pandemic wasn't taken seriously until it was too late - luckily the state I live in was quicker than most to adopt a stay-at-home order, and I've personally been home with my husband save for one grocery trip the past three weeks.

My parents live in a state that has yet to issue any stay-at-home orders. It's a red state, and they're still believing the propaganda that it's not much worse than the flu. I blame this on the president, of course, and the governor of their state for being a moron (well, also lack of testing and data in that state to point to for evidence.)

My dad has been ill for about a year and a half. We thought it was a manageable illness, but he went to the hospital last week and they told him he'd been misdiagnosed, so he's had cancer running rampant in his body for the past x years and it's nearing the end now. He's at home with at-home hospice and getting weaker and weaker by the day. 

I adore my dad. Anyone who knows me knows how much I love him, and I'm devastated by this. I would LOVE to be able to be there to help him and spend time with him during these last days/weeks, but this fucking pandemic couldn't have come at a worse time for our family. My mom says it's up to me, of course, whether I come or not, but she still errs on the side of trying to get me to come. I mean, she wears masks and gloves everywhere but she still has people over to visit my dad, so I honestly can't tell how seriously she's taking this. 

Sans pandemic, I would've been there a week ago. Maybe that's when I should've gone. But it just seems to get worse and worse, and so does my dad. 

So, Reddit - what would you do? I would hate myself if I went and then got my mom sick and she went to the hospital or, god forbid, died, and I lose both parents. I would also feel guilty for not being there to see my dad and give him one last hug and help keep him comfortable and feeling loved. 

I change my mind every five minutes and it's eating me alive. 

I know many more people are having to make impossible decisions during this time, and I truly feel for you. Love to you all, and thank you in advance.",02Apr2020,1

766,"I'm so sorry for writing an essay

I care about my family. I would do anything for them and I mean that wholeheartedly. It's not out of love though but a sense of duty. My parents raised me and my siblings and it is my duty as the oldest member to take care of all their needs because that is how I was raised.

I was recently diagnosed with ADD so bear this in mind as well because I'm still trying to piece together a life dealing with this knowledge and with it, it makes sense why I am so emotionally unbalanced. To the outside world, there is nothing but serenity, but inside there is a multitude of different emotions all swirling together throughout the day. 

I learned quite young to keep my life private from my parents. Simply put as much as they love me, they can't handle certain things because they are fragile beings themselves. I've always resented this aspect about them. There were many points in my life when I needed them to be emotionally there for  me but they didn't have the capabilities to offer that. Money, verbal advice, everything external they provided for me, but emotionally they just didn't know how. Which really sucks because I'm an introverted and emotional person. I sense people's emotional needs, moods and it is how I make sense of everything around me. I also know how to make people feel something because it is the one form of communication that I'm most attuned to. I'm spaced out for verbal and hearing, but feeling and touch my mind can snap to instantly. 

Anyhow because I could not rely on my parents for emotional support, it is something I've had to learn to deal with on my own. There is so much that they don't know about me even if I live with them still but it's just something I've learned to accept. What throws me off however is the few times when I let something slip or they voice concern for me about my well-being and I get angry. I don't mean to get angry or snap at them but I've set a rigid structure of a relationship with them in my mind. One where I provide them with everything they need, and take care of their emotions and well-being and when that structure is deviated from like when they voice concern for my well-being it wells up emotions I don't want to deal with because I know if I even shared a small tiny part, they wouldn't know how to handle it so I don't share anything with them. This doesn't just mean for them though, it's also for everyone I know. 

I deeply resent the fact that for everyone around me, friends, family, and strangers that I can understand their emotional state, be the support that they need but that in turn I can't rely on them and it's not even their fault. They just don't have the capacity to understand. So yeah, I think it's wrong that I feel this way even if I know why I feel this way. Some insight would be appreciated.",02Apr2020,1

Grocery stores can’t close, they’re an essential business. I’ve tried to tell them they can do fine with buying a few extra things, but stocking up for two months is a little insane IMO.

Well now it’s crossed the line. I’ve been ordering some personal care items online as the deals are good, and I’ve run out of a few things so I do need them. Well, my dad won’t let me bring anything into the house and forces me to keep them in the garage for at least a week before bringing them in.

Bit of a long backstory:

I have 2 daughters, my stepdaughter (8) and my bio daughter (1). I've been in SD's life since her 5th birthday and her bio mom hasn't been a part of her life since her dad got full custody when SD was 2. No calls, no texts, no visitations. She had the right to it all, but never used them and likely never will. I have been mom since SD started calling me mom, which was shortly after coming into her life. Her bio mom didn't give her a good first couple years. While under bio mom's care, SD was severely neglected, witness to multiple fights (and things often got physical), and she was constantly sick and hardly changed. Her dad fought tooth and nail for custody and won. He got her into therapy for some anger issues and a couple years later, met me. 

Since I met her, I knew she had potty issues. Her dad was said it started when his brother and sister-in-law moved out, before they met me. SD didn't take the change well. She started reverting and was constantly peeing her pants, during the day, at night, out at the store, at home, just all the time. Then her dad met me, we moved, we moved back, we got married, we had a baby, All through this, I'm trying to help her but every change makes her rebel in some way. Usually peeing her pants. At 8 years old, she still does this. We've done everything from taking her to therapy (the therapist was a money-grabbing quack and the only one in our area), to taking her to specialists, vitamins, punishment, reward, ignoring it, putting her in diapers, literally everything under the sun. The specialists weren't much help. They started her on exercises (sit on the potty for two minutes, do a jumping jack, then sit back down for two minutes) and it literally made her worse. 

On top of all of this, she constantly has UTIs (Urinary tract infections, very common in girls/women, very easy to get, and can get pretty painful) because she'd pee and just sit in it all day, either not changing her clothes or not changing her pad. We can't keep giving her antibiotics so we just take all the preventative measures we can and try to treat at home. We can usually make it go away with ridiculous amounts of water and cranberry supplements. 

Now all of these appointments, holding her accountable, everything has been handled by me. I don't mind since I'm a stay at home mom and her dad works, it's literally part of my job to handle all of this. But I'm the only one that cares. My daughter purposely pees her pants, sneaks food (she can't have sugar until she is potty trained because sugar, caffeine, citrus, etc irritates the urinary tract), has eaten medicine, scratched herself, and lied A LOT. Like more than the average kid. She was diagnosed with dysfunctional voiding, meaning she doesn't empty her bladder all the way when she goes potty.

Now I know what most of you are going to say: she needs therapy and/or to continue being seen by a specialist. I agree BUT we recently moved, and this is where it gets sticky. We were kind of forced to move so we decided that since we had to move anyways, we would move out of CA (because we hate it) and move to UT where I have family. We had to move before we had a place because my husband needed to start work. Me and the girls were going to stay with my grandparents in AZ but this was when the coronavirus was getting really serious so we decided not to put them at risk and to just get a motel room as my family doesn't have room. 

Anyways, this means that she can't be in therapy and she can't see her usual specialist. They have better-rated therapists and specialists here in UT but we're still on state aid through CA and I can't call and get it transferred because we don't have proof of address yet (not to mention all of the unemployment stuff the offices are dealing with right now) and my husband now makes too much. He can get coverage through his work but that's after 60 days. We're on day 17. So as much as I want to take her to multiple therapists and specialists, we don't have the coverage right now. As soon as we do, I will continue that road with her.

But for now, we're not covered and we're not even in a house yet. We're still here at the motel and I told my daughter that this would be a good time to really work on going potty. She has been doing a little better. For a couple months now, to save my sanity on her ever-growing pile of laundry, she's been wearing pads. Not quite a diaper, but still saves her from changing her outfit 5 times a day. 

Well we get to today and I find out that not only has she been lying about staying dry, about changing her pad when she needs to, AND she has been sneaking food. For the past two months, I thought she had stopped. But nope, if it has sugar, she sneaks it. We feed her plenty, big meals, AND snacks nearly on demand. But none of them have sugar, caffeine, or citrus. So she sneaks stuff that does (though it's not much since we stay as close to completely organic and naturally nutritious diet as we can) and she never stopped. If we hadn't have moved the medicine after two ER trips, she would have been sneaking that too.

When I find this out, I see red. Now I've had breakdowns about this before, and I've yelled and pleaded and begged and cursed and everything to try and get through to her, but nothing I say has worked. I put in ALL of the effort, and she doesn't. I'm constantly reminding her to go to the bathroom, change her pad, shower, wash her hands, everything hygienic I have to remind her to do. She has literally no interest in doing it herself. No effort at all ever. And she's not mean about it, she's not dumb, she knows that she should, but she still doesn't. This girl is beyond lazy, like to the point that she didn't want to clean out the litter box (one of her usual chores when we had cats) so she shut the door to their box for the entire two days we were gone and they just went elsewhere. She ended up cleaning that but her reasoning was that they just wouldn't go and she wouldn't have to clean it. And she did this multiple times. 

But I'm really getting to the point where being the only one putting in effort and being around my girls 24/7 and not seeing my husband even half as much as we're used to (he's my only support through all of this and does what he can when he's here) it's all really taking a big toll on me and my mental health. I understand that my daughter is going through a big change and the move is probably having more of an effect on me than I'm willing to admit, especially since I've been around both of my girls 24/7 for the past month, with not even my own room to separate myself from them for a second. This is a hard time on all of us, I know that, but I'm coming to my wit's end.

It's made me think that I should just give up trying to fix her, or at least give up on the potty issue. I've done it before and it just led to a really bad UTI so I morally don't want to go there but mentally, I'm ready to give up. I'm to the point where I'm ready to send SD to my MIL (who is SD's favorite person and vise versa, and also still lives in our old town that SD misses a lot). My MIL has always been critical of how I handle SD and her issues and tries to be sympathetic since she knows I'm doing my best, but she's also always on SD's side on everything. That's to be expected with a relationship like their's and MIL has mostly stuck with what I've said because I'm the parent, but has a habit of making her opinion clear, even in front of SD. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, if you read it all, bless your heart. I know this is partially me venting but I also need advice because I don't feel like I'm thinking clearly. My question is: should I give up the potty issue? Should I send her to live with her grandma? She may not get the care she needs right away but SD would be happier, as would MIL, even if its just until we get settled in the new house. Should I just cry for a minute then get back on the saddle and keep going with the way things are? Should I wait until we're settled and try and think of something else? I'm beyond lost right now and I don't see an end to it all.",02Apr2020,1
775,"I had a friend in 3rd grade that lasted till about 7th grade and they were really something. I’ve been questioning lately if my friendship with them was not only a bad one, but abusive as well. And I guess I just need some second opinions because I keep questioning if that’s just how kids are and I’m just over reacting, but I’m too scared to talk to people I know about it so I’ve come here. 

So I guess the first thing is that I was scared to do something that would make them mad at me. I was always scared I would say something to make them mad. And I guess the reason was I didn’t want them to ignore me. And I mean we all need time to cool of when we get mad but sometimes they would ignore me for days or even one time they didn’t talk to me for a whole summer brake. And I would even try to apologize to them multiple times for what I did, and sometimes I wouldn’t even know what I was apologizing for. And when she hurt my feelings I wasn’t aloud to tell her or she turns it around and says it my fault. 

Also I never felt like I could say no to her or she would get mad. One time I told her I needed to stop texting her because I was using data and she started calling me bitch or other things I can’t remember. It was so sudden and I was shocked, so I told my dad and I guess my dad told her mom and the next day she told me I wasn’t a good friend for telling on her and saying “that’s not what friends do” and then I believed her and I apologize, but she still ignore me for a couple days.

She would also get mad at me when I mentioned my old friends or if I went to go talk to a friend from kindergarten she would say stuff like I was talking behind her back or stuff like that and she would say I wasn’t being a very good friend even though I tried to explain to her that I wasn’t talking behind her back. But the thing is I know she would go behind my back and pull aside the other girl in our friend group to talk about me. That’s why I was talking to other people in the first place was because they left me alone.

We did have fun together it was just when we were both being sill and playing together but even then I was still scared I would say something to make her mad. So yeah I don’t know if I was just being stupid and not standing up for myself or what.",02Apr2020,1

The pain is from one break up(4 years with her) and from my decisions in my life.I really dont know what to do with my life and started to live miserable to get weight to get very unhealthy and anxiety started to come.When we were dating we were just kids and was ok until the college started and she started to be different.
She is more grownup than me she started to say that in 2 years she wants to get married and in other 2 years wants a baby but this take time and effort and is something that u dont plan..
I wanted to marry her but we never stayed together.I live with my parents and she lives with her parents too...
She never slept at my home in 4 years because her parents are very hard but I know them.Her father always wants to know her at home when is night.She just slept one night on new year's eve now in 2020...ok
When we had 2 years together we were ok she was loving me but the love started to leave.She didnt wanted to kiss me to love me to do things with me.She always complaining about me that im a mess i cant do nothing and im a loser.I ignored all these things because I said to my self that she is right and is all my fault and she is the one that will help me to get up.I ve started to be anxious because I didn't know what to do with my life professionally...
I never knew what to do my life and thats why today i wanted to take my life but i stopped and started to think this is not the option.I always helped her financially and mentally and told her that she can do it but she was always complaining about me and didnt saw the many things i ve done to her and mostly she didn't say thank you.
If i was late by 5 minutes she would scream at me and i would have apologize.If she was late with half an hour I wouldn't say anything.And she had an obsession with all female in my life that were our age.I wasnt allowed to have connections with girls from highschool or college because she was jealous and started to say that is not normal...
I dont know how to give up on her and continue my life and to start doing something and stop complaining...
And i want to do something i dont care about money so much i want to something to enjoy...

783,"This post has contents that may offend you, if you are sensitive then please avoid. 

So, this happened over a few days ago, and let me just give some context. My best friend and i have a humor, mostly creepy pictures and her saying stuff that people would get offended about, we keep it to ourselves and never really ran into any problems doing so, it was our own little personal thing if you get me. We have had arguments simply over things that she has overreacted on, which she admits to.

Right, 6 days ago she messages me, listing each sexuality and asking if i’m any one of those sexualities, she asks one by one, after a few minutes she asks me if i am straight, i say yes, she replies “why are you lying? I know you like taking 450 degree celsius metal dildos up your anus” i was actually kind of disgusted to that so i replied “ummm ew”. Thats when she started flipping out.

She quotes what i say, and asks “are you serious”, i joke around to avoid an argument, and she starts saying how disgusting i am, and that i am a horrible person. I was starting to get so angry because she has said things in the past that most people would be just.. horrified. I wrote her a long paragraph that says she has no right to be disgusted with me and screenshots of her being anti-semitic, transphobic, racist etc, all you can think of.

She then tells me “i’m not even going to fucking argue” i then keep sending her reasons of why she is being pathetic because i said “ummm ew” because i was actually disgusted by the things she has said, we do have weird and dark humor, but mine never crossed the borders of hell unlike hers, when she says those things i ignore or change the subject, but honestly i was pissed, she got unrightfully (is that a word?) mad and left, and after 20 minutes of me ranting to her, she came back said she isn’t going to talk to me, and i wrote her a paragraph that i don’t fucking care Because she of all people has said truly disgusting things. 

And that was the last thing I actually sent, she opened but never replied. Im kind of hurt and betrayed, she has been a relatively good friend for a year, and when she overreacted she apologized. I really don’t know
What to do, shes a hypocrite and it pissed me off, i have done a lot for her and she doesn’t even have it in her to say sorry.

I want to sort out our friendship, i feel like a complete idiot saying that but she meant a lot to me.

785,I’m in second year of university and I haven’t been regular at all with exams. Part of it being living away from family and being too distracted and other times just the fear of failing would mean I don’t take an exam. I’ve been studying a lot for an exam in two days. I know I’m ready but it’s an online exam with a professor and about 7 classmates also listening. I’m scared I’m going to be too anxious and not be able to do justice to all the work I’ve done.

786,"Hi! So I have a problem. I will point out it might sound childish! In February, this Guy I liked in High School texted me on Snapchat. He was very sweet (as he always was) and I was astounded by his glow up (he looked good in High School but now he‘s outright HOT). We started texting and flirting and met a few days later to hang and started flirting more and then we were together. I was his first Girlfriend (cause he‘s shy and doesnt realize when someone’s into him, apparently).

We werent dating for long, two weeks or so but he was the first guy I genuinely trusted after finally getting over my mentally and physically abusive ex. Now it has been more than one and a half month, maybe even two idk. And I‘m still not over him. I miss leaning onto him, I miss holding his hands, gosh I even miss going to McDonalds with him. I know this all sounds dumb and childish but I really dont know what to do at this point. 

How do I get over him?",02Apr2020,1

Even if you aren't attracted to them?",02Apr2020,1
789,"I started a job little more than a month ago and since day one my manager has made me feel incompetent and stupid. 

At my previous job I was a manager for Remittance department and got promoted about 6 months after I started. I had to practically audit all the remittance that happened while I was just an associate and also had to come up with a whole new process that actually ended up saving the company more than a quarter million. I decided to give my 2 weeks because I didnt agree with the salary I was making and finding out that I was only making .50 cents more than my subordinate was the last straw. 

When I went to the interview with this new company I do not think that I represented myself in a falsely manner and in fact stated that I did not have much experience with Reconciliation and only had a little experience. I took a pay cut because I needed a job and was excited to start working. 

From day one I was given 65 accounts to reconcile and each day has been a headache. I started towards the end of the month, so anyone that works in accounting knows that its the BUSIEST TIME. I was practically thrown into a pool full of sharks with no life vest. I believe that I am progressing at a normal pace and in fact a lot of times I hold back because I am scared that if I don't run it by my manager he will have some snide comments to make. From day one he explain things to me as if I knew exactly what he was talking about and knew where to go and how to do things. A lot of the reports that I was doing was just catching up from 3 months back as if no one had been doing it. I cannot ask him a question because he will not give me a straight answer, he is always vaguely and leaves me feel more lost than I already was. About 2 weeks after I started I got an email to send a copy of check. I didn't know who this was or the company and so I asked him if he had a log in and where to go, he in turn asks another person about the email and comes back to me saying that it's actually one of my accounts and laughs in my face saying wow I can't believe you didn't even know...uhm in my head I am thinking I have 65 accounts in total and we are in the middle of closing the previous month and not to mention that I have only been here 2 weeks. How the hell was I supposed to remember that? A lot of times he often would tell me to do something the incorrect way but because he was sitting next to me and wanted to get it done it was fine but then when I would run into the same scenario by myself he would direct me to do it differently. One time I sent am email to the incorrect person even though i ask specifically asked him if it was ok and said yes. Once he saw the email he states to me to not send emails anymore and that if I need to email someone to let him know and he will email. His instructions are always vague and too often I feel like he just doesn't want to deal with me. 

I just dont see how a manager can be like this and I want him to take away some the accounts that I work on because it seems like they are very important and require special care and I feel like I am making constant mistakes and do not thing the new person is the most adequate person to be handling such a company. At the same time by me stating these things would make me seem like I am incompetent and wish to not have so much work when that it not the case when I am working on other companies that he is not as involved as he is with this one. 

Once I have more experience I am more than open in working on that company again but I think that he relies so much in my previous title that he seems to forget that while it is related it is not the same thing and also forgets that I am new so of course I am going to make mistakes. I am trying my best but I'm always wary of asking for his help.",02Apr2020,1

793,"I’m 21F and my boyfriend is 26M, we’ve been trying to openly date for the past 2 and a half years. The entirety of our relationship, my father has not approved of my boyfriend. I still live at home and I’m in nursing school at the moment, so I’ve tried my best to respect my dads rules and boundaries. Things were progressing with my dad within the past year, but within the past 3 months, things got bad and my father began calling my bf a predator and saying he was going to cheat on me, leave me pregnant and alone, and that he only wants to use me.

Recently, my bf bought an engagement ring and we’ve been thinking of getting married this summer. I’m over the moon ecstatic to spend my life with him and I’ve never felt more in love with him. My bf informed my mom yesterday that he has the ring and he’s planning on proposing soon.  She came home and was upset and said that we didn’t know each other well enough and that I’m not thinking straight and I should be with someone else. She got better as the day went on, but she’s been upset that I’m wanting “to leave her.” 

Today my bf was going to tell my dad. My mom asked him not to. When he called to ask why, she said she wanted to talk to my dad first. Now, she’s asking if I want to talk to him with her. When I asked what she thinks I should do, she said “This isn’t about me, you’re the one who wants to make adult decisions.” I know I should be an adult and talk to my dad about it and face him, even though I know how much he dislikes my bf. I just don’t know what to say or tell him.

My question is: How do I tell my dad I want to marry the man he hates without being disrespectful?",02Apr2020,1
794,"So I’ve been dating my boyfriend (both in high school) for 8 months now and it is currently day 6 of a month-long break. The break happened for a lot of reasons that I’d rather not go over but the intent is to try starting over as friends and working things back up after the break if all is going well. 

Everything has been going as expected with the break, I’ve been pretty sad and missing him but I’ve been pulling myself together and spending more time with my friends (through only calls because of quarantine). But I had a realization last night that has been weighing down on me since. I think he sexually assaulted me. We’ve done some pretty sexual things that I have consented to and enjoyed like him groping me and seeing my bare chest and some pretty intense making out. 

But one thing that is bothering me is the fact that he had pushed me to let him do more with my chest when I wasn’t all for it. I only halfheartedly agreed to him touching that area with his hands and mouth, but wanted to do it at his house on the weekend because his grandparents don’t check in on us often. But a couple days before that weekend he went to my house after school and kept on pushing for us to try it there, where I felt very at risk of being caught and was super uncomfortable. I gave in of course and he did his thing. It wasn’t even that pleasurable and the stress and fear of my mom coming in made the experience way worse. That was a month or two ago and he’s done stuff with my chest multiple times since but in places where I felt comfortable, and he was starting to get more careful about asking. Even then I still wasn’t all for it because I didn’t get much sensation from it and I felt exposed and in danger like that, but he really enjoyed doing it. It felt like he cared about doing stuff with my chest more than just hanging out with me eventually. We talked about it and he stopped trying to do that stuff so much, and then a couple weeks later school was cancelled and we went on a break. 

His past relationship was very sex-driven and he didn’t have much of an emotional connection to his partner. They mostly did sexual stuff when they hung out so I understand that that’s what he’s kind of used to. He has always been pretty pushy about stuff like that and he asked me when I think I’d want to do sexual stuff and have sex a lot. That caused a lot of arguments because I had a lot of conflicting answers trying to please him but also say what I want. Those kind of conversations turned into planning on what we’d do when that day arrived which fed into his anticipation more. I enjoyed talking about that kind of stuff for obvious hormonal teenager reasons but it started to go too far until we had to stop it completely because it caused problems. Overall I think I let things get too sexual too quickly and I should’ve stopped those conversations instead of being horny and dumb which just egged him on. 

I really wanted to start things fresh with him after our break but now I have a lot of conflicted feeling about how he had pushed me to do that and writing all of this out has just made me more conflicted. I regret not being more firm with him in that situation and many others. I’m not even sure if he’s aware that it was sexual assault and I can’t reach out and ask. We talked about how pushy he is in general and how he made me do stuff I didn’t want to do before the break and he’s aware of that and plans to fix it, but now I’m starting to be unsure if I should give the relationship another try. I still have a long time before the break is over to think about it and I’m not trying to make a decision right now, but I’m worried that it’s unfair to him to say that he gets another shot and then to take it away before he could try. I genuinely care about him and love him and that’s why I wanted to take this break in the first place. We really got along and made each other happy before we started dating and he even became my best friend. We would talk non stop and I enjoyed every second of it. Unfortunately relationships and all the expectations and drama that comes with it ruins that kind of good friendship, and that’s why we want to go back to that when the break it over, to see if we still make each other happy without the conflicts of relationship stuff. 

I don’t know if I should let the sexual assault change everything or even how to react to it. I can’t believe it took me so long to realize what happened but now I just don’t know what to do. I almost feel like I should reach out to him to talk about it but I don’t know what I’d say or if that would even help or make things worse. I can’t even tell my mom (we’re very close) because she has strict rules on what we could do physically and I’ve done a lot of stuff to break those rules that I’d have to mention to fully explain this. The last thing I need right now is to upset her. I already feel guilty about holding the things we’ve done from her because I usually tell her everything. I just want to get this weight off my chest and get some advice or comfort from someone.",02Apr2020,1

She is never straight out rude or anything but it comes off very subtle. For example, whenever i dont take the kids out, she'll comment on how bored they must be at home and that she likes to get out of the house. Which is completely fine, but i also need to get house work done. I could go on but i dont care that much. My partner has said also she does have a bit of an ego about her so he is aware.

802,"Me (21M) and my girlfriend (20F) have been together for about 2.5 years now. I'm her first ""real"" boyfriend or serious relationship I should mention. We got together about 2 months into her freshman year at our college. Things have been really smooth since then, time has flown by. We live together this year and are set to live together next year as well. She dropped a bomb on me last night saying she's unsure of what she wants in the future and feels like she doesn't know who she is. This stems from our plans to move close to my home town for my job after college. She never seemed super hesitant towards it, but that may not be the case. It always seemed like logical step forward after college for us as we graduate at the same time. A while back she mentioned she wants to stay where we are currently longer as she has finally made friends here and doesn't want to leave them. I have no issue with this and support it 100% as she'd be continuing school as well. Last night though she mentioned she's worried that us being long distance during that time might not end up working. We've spent summers away from each other and of course it's tough but we've made it. Aside from the moving part she mentioned she almost feels like things are moving too fast. We got together pretty soon after she came to college and she said she's worried she hasn't found who she is yet. She came to this college because a friend was, I guess hung out with me more since her friend said I seemed nice, and stayed here at school since I was here. She said she feels like she hasn't made many decisions for herself and doesn't know if these decisions are what she really wants. She couldn't give me any examples of things she was missing from herself, just said she doesn't know but it's how she feels. Now I don't know exactly how she feels but I've felt similar in a previous relationship of mine. I was younger but I felt trapped by the commitment and time left in a relationship. It was scary when I was young and I felt like I'd miss out on life. I didn't know what life I'd miss but made me feel scared anyways. That relationship ended up falling apart. This scares me because I love this girl more than anything and I don't want to lose her. She's the one where I can see a future and a life together until the end. I already told her multiple times that I'd do anything to help her work through this and find out how to find herself. I told her I can work around anything to do with future living situations, whether it be finding a new job or possible remote work. I have no issue with any of that. I just don't know where I fit into the finding herself part. She of course says she still loves me and wants to be with me, but has also slipped in words like ""I don't want us to be fully apart"".

I guess I'm asking if someone can help me to understand what she's feeling. What does it mean to find out who she is and where I can fit into this. The more I think about it, the faster I'm losing hope. I just want to know if I should start preparing for the inevitable or start preparing myself for some change. I feel like alot of what she said is there to hide the thought that she doesn't know if she wants to be with me. Like she's trying to soften the blow. Our conversation started with the move and gradually deepened to the stuff about not knowing herself so makes me feel like the beginning stuff was just a cover. Any advise is greatly, greatly appreciate here.",02Apr2020,1
803,"My best friend is dating another close friend of mine. Previously, I've had feelings for my best friend (we'll call him friend A) and then I became with his current girlfriend (friend B) before they were together. (I don't have feelings for friend A anymore)

I confided my feelings for friend A in friend B, and even though I told friend B I wouldn't stop her from going after friend A, I just wanted to know what was happening. Despite this, she would constantly wear his clothes to school (we're in high school) and when I'd ask her about it, she just said 'oh sorry, it was the closest thing to my bed this morning' and that they were 'nothing more than friends' even though that was clearly not true, and I later found out that plently of people knew of their relationship and she made it a specific point not to tell me so I ""wouldn't get hurt"".

For context, friend B has had something with about four guys in the last four months and slept with on of friend A's closest friends before she started liking friend A. I don't know if I still have feelings for friend A, or I'm just scared he's going to get hurt. I know the best thing to do would be to talk to him about it, but they're still in the honeymoon phase so I feel like that wouldn't go over very well at the moment. 

Friend A and Friend B's relationship makes me uncomfortable, so I have three questions that I need advice on. Feel free to respond to one or all of them:

**1.)** How can I let go of my anomosity towards friend A for going behind my back? Did she even go behind my back? Should I even be mad?

**2.)** How long do you think their relationship will last? It kind of is driving me nuts, and I just need some advice.

**3.)** I've never been in a relationship before and I've been looking around to try and find something to take my mind off friend A. Is this cruel, or is it okay to be doing this? Should I just find someone to make out with and then never talk to again? Does that really help?

I have been at the company in a non-technical job for over a year. My question is, how do raises usually work? Does the employee ask for a percentage or dollar amount, or does the employer just come in with the offer? Is there a negotiation stage? What’s a good percentage raise to ask for, and what is out of reason?

In the past at a previous company, I had a manager that gave me a 7% raise but then the next year a new manager gave me a 2% raise; neither of those were negotiated and only came about when I talked to them about wanting to revisit negotiation around the annual mark.

The first manager was a big advocate for me, and the second wasn’t. This time around, my manager is pretty hands off but knows I’m doing good work and getting things done. With all this stay-at-home stuff, I’m a little wary about asking for a raise but know it’s been long overdue and if I don’t ask I’m never going to get it.

I felt a little used but whatever we talked through that and we were fine. Things were good but that broke us though the honey moon phase. Then we had an amazing night where we just watched Disney movies and ate hummus and carrots and talked and he would make me laugh really hard etc. The next day he left his Apple Watch in my room and there was a text from his ex. He had picked her up from a party and the texts were basically asking what house she was at etc. This happened in February, after that the trust was pretty much gone as he was planning on never telling me. I would not have cared if it had been literally any other person. This girl and him were each others firsts, they were together for two years so it doesn’t feel like it was nothing. She still has all the pictures of them still up on Twitter and Instagram which is also really hard to see.

This place is about 50% of our current income in rent. We can afford it and afford to get moved in but it will be very tight for the first month or two. 

He's afraid of having less in savings and things being so tight and unsure. I'm afraid of passing up an unheard of living opportunity.

So i work a a family resturaunt bar, we have moslty older people coming in who are regulars. I really do care alot about most of them, two in specific i see as grandparent figures, they have never been creepy in anyway to me like alot of people are and have always shut down sexual comments from other creepy people. they are both late 70s. The one is so thoughtful always, he knew i had a migrane on christmas and stayed up all night waiting for this migrane comercial to come on then wrote down for me what it was called. Anyway in january when one of our regulars died i was extremely sad, i felt like i lost a grandparent or something, his son even said he always talked about me and invited me to the funeral, i felt partially to blame but i was also just very sad because i loved when he came in. i got the other guys number, also late 70s to tell him the news, as he was also involved but i wont go into it. anyway I text him today asking him if he needs any help with groceries or the other guy to please let me know, he texts  back the sweetest message saying how it was thoughtful and he misses me and thinks about his ""bartender buddies' often. My friend thinks its weird i genuinly really care for these guys. Im 22f and i know they have no bad intentions. My boyfriend thinks its sweet and doesnt mind , no competition obviously. but everyone at work thinks im crazy for caring so muchb about these people, is this weird of me? I was originally going to get into taking care of old people when i finish school but i really dont think i could handle it if someone passed, as i get attatched to people! would you feel weird about this if you were my boyfriend or not cause they are older?",02Apr2020,1
816,"Hi everyone. I’m at my wits end with my co worker. I love my job but I hate it because of her. The issue I am having is I am fairly still new to this job. July will be my one year. She has been here for 5 years. I’m going to try and keep this short and simple. She is very manipulative. She is the type to say or do something and I say anything to her about it she turns it around and says she never said that and I’m lying. I work in a WIC department so I work for the state. I give benefits to low income parents who are pregnant, or have a baby or child. Every phone call is recorded so I am just going to list some things below that she has done. She has yelled at me while I was on the phone with a client. She has made clients very uncomfortable to the point where they didn’t want to have their appointment with her because she was so rude to them. Everything is on her time. If it doesn’t fit her schedule then fuck the person they can wait. We are here to help these mothers and children. Which she doesn’t seem to understand. She has seen her sister as a client which is against the rules as conflict of interest. Which is a big deal. She had told me to my face “i want to know the glasses off your face” and has told me that she wanted to knock my supervisor “skinny ass to the floor” as well as share personal information about my supervisor to me and my other co worker. She claims I have committed benefit fraud by faking their income to get people in the system for wic which is a federal offense all because I whispered to a client on the phone for a second because it was of personal nature. She has threaded to call the feds on me and report me to the state. For something I have not done. She has so many friends here and everyone loves her. She can do whatever she wants and people will take her side. We just got into a argument because I looked away for a second while she was saying something to me and screamed at me because of it starting a argument where again I’m committing fraud and she’s going to report me. I told her that I have a book of everything she has said to me and when she has said to me and she said that’s not going to do shit because it’s a lie. She bullies me and plays psychological games. I don’t know what to do. Since she has so many friends here even with HR I’m screwed. She will just tell them I’m lying so she can get her way. I just don’t know what to do I’m sorry if I’m not typing well I am very very upset and I feel trapped. I need this job I have no other source of income and am trapped with bills. I just don’t know what to do.",02Apr2020,1
817," this is a repost but I'm really for searching for some advice since I don,t get any answers in relationship advice

.....................................

Alright for set a background about my sister, she always being crazy about boys in general, she always has this idea she will fall in love in a romantic movie like way, when she was a fan of twilight she will wait for her perfect vampire guy to appear out of nowhere, in her phase of 50 shades of gray she legit though she will marry a rich man that will take her to travel around the world, she always we all up to any romantic book or series out there lately she being relly hard into the Netflix movie ""To all the boys I loved before ""the thing its this movie has made her think in reconnecting with all the guys she had crushes on trough high school.

This wouldn't be that bad if it wasn't because my sister never had any real relationship with any of these boys most of them don,t even know her or had any class with her. My sister will just kinda chose a random boy of other class to have huge crushes on them without even say hi ever in her life. I Remember she will do weird stuff like get to know where they had activities or where they usually hang out for take them pictures and spy them, no in an ultra stalker way more in the weird teen being dumb way. My mom usually will find cute that my sister was such a romantic teen so she will just talk to her hours and hours about this guy without really have any interaction with them. Normally she will find a new crush in one year or two she is planing in contact around 5 guys.

Another thing about my sister is she is not as attractive as she sees herself, she always wants to date ultra-hot popular guys when she relly don,t have nothing going for her, at this point of her life she still living at home with our parents, she went to college but struggles to find stable work and refuse to leave the city for search it anywhere else, her only hobbies are binge-watch a bunch of romantic movies, again and again, she a bit chubby and even if she takes care of herself and I think she looks good she will be an average girl, she dons,t hangout much or go out and can't have a normal conversation that doesn't revolve around her fandoms. So she has nothing going for her to pursue these guys. She also pushes away lots of good possible boyfriends because they never fit her perfect standard of an Instagram model sensitive guy, this is getting especially creepy now that she is getting closer to her 30s but all her ideal boys are still around 18 and 23.

So back to the issue that breaks the camel bags, she chose that the best way to contact these guys will be to stalk them on Facebook and Instagram, my mom joined her idea happily and help her find them all and snoop in their timelines, my sister choose the ones that were still the ""hottest"" what left her with 3 guys, then she proceeds to write 3 of them extremely passionate (and kinda creepy in my opinion) ""letters"" that she will send them to trough DMS. I was pretty much just ignoring the whole deal but I notice that one of the guys was recently engaged with one of their last pictures being his GF sharing a pic of the ring. I told my sister so she did,t send him anything awkward, she just responded ""oh well I'm just informing him of my feeling who knows he might rethink his proposal "" my automatic response was huge yikes, who just declare their love for a stranger that just got engaged? how selfish you have to be for don,t care about the other girl that probably being dating him for years?. I already found this whole letter thing ridiculous but now my sister was being straight up disrespectful to this random girl, my mom just laugh it off and say its always relly romantic when a guy about to marry reliance he actually was still in love with an old highschool sweetheart.

I was cringing so hard to the whole delusion that was going on with my sister and my mom just playing along, so I just drop the topic and left to my room for don,t have to know nothing more about the topic. Well apparently my sister was broken-hearted I don't just blindly supported her in her daring love move, and she came to nag me about how I need to support her because this could help her find her real love, at this point, I just was having future visions of my sister forever single in my parent's house until they die so I came clean to her, I told her how creepy her behavior around guys is, how she has unreasonable expectations with guys out of her league and push away any good guy that has ever approach her, how she needs to do something more for her life that daydream about hot guys coming to rescue her. I might have been a bit harsh but all I tried to explain to her my best. She ended getting up and living room saying I don't get it because I'm a lesbian and to young to understand adult love. ( i have to clear up that my sister wasn't calling me lesbian as an insult, I'm a lesbian, I have a girlfriend of 2 years and I will probably move out with her once I end colleague so its a serious relationship) after this my mom and dad called me out for don't be supportive of my sister, my dad pretty much follows what my mo says and my mom just don,t see nothing wrong about my sister behavior. Right now I don,t know-how move on from there, should just drop the topic? how I make my mom and sister understand this is not normal behavior? I'm also kinda annoyed my sister don't see my relationship as ""Adult love"" when she has not even dated someone once,

tl;dr: sister it's delusional about dating and do relly weird stuff, my parents just enable her, tried to explain her the issue but she calls me immature and says my relationship it's not serious enough to understand adult love",02Apr2020,1
818,"Hello, using a throwaway cause people know my main account. So for about the first 10 years of my adult life, from 18-28, I had sort of a normal life. I was finishing up my English degree and working part time. After I finished, I continued to work; I tried a few different vocations, the usual. Around two years ago, I started having panic attacks at work. Then, they came before work. Eventually, I missed a few shifts. I would wake up, get ready for work, drive there, and turn around at a gas station and start shaking and crying and I would go back to my room and turn off the lights and get super paranoid and look out my blinds for people. It made no sense. Eventually, I got fired (for good reason). Since then, for the past two years, I've gone through about 40 or so jobs. I have tried everything. Easier jobs. Less hours. Therapy. Medication. 


At this point, I'm not oblivious to how I should proceed mentally. I'm reaching out to all the right people, trying different techniques involving therapy, medications, and exercise, etc.. however, my finances are a complete disaster. Luckily, I was very good about my finances while I was employed and payed off all my student loans, so at this point it's just day to day type stuff. I can barely afford food and rent. I've never had to go on Government assistance and I don't want to but at this point I don't have any other choice. Is there something I can do? Simple jobs from home? I really only need like 150 bucks a week. I just had a job that was labeled essential and I really really loved it, but I had two days in a row of panic attacks and now I'm just mentally broken. I don't know what to do. Unemployed and quarantined with barely enough money for food but I'm gonna get my Internet shut off next month if I can't get a source of income. 

I'm trying so hard. I don't know what to do.",02Apr2020,1

My mom bought a fabric freshener and I figured it'd be cool if my boyfriend and I's bedroom smelled like ~fresh lavender~ so I sprayed it on the mattress, bed sheets, pillows, and a little in the air for the added aroma. Kind of stupid, I know, but I've never used it before and got a little too excited. 

But then very quickly after we had gotten into bed he started coughing, wheezing like mad, and even had a whistling sound coming from his throat when he breathed. We immediately stripped the pillow cases off and moved to the couch in the living room and slept there without blankets and with the naked pillows. He continued to wheeze and the coughing got so bad that he threw up several times. Nothing would help, but with hot tea, the window opened, and staying in an upright position, he barely managed a few hours of sleep.

Obviously this was a very horrible experience so while he is at work I've set out on a mission to make the room safe again. All of the sheets and pillow shams are in the wash, and I've flipped the mattress, scrubbed it with detergent and water, and sprinkled baking soda all over it. I also tried to clean the pillows in a similar way. 

Is this enough? I don't know how to fully rid them of the freshener and I don't want to find out through a test run that results in the same allergic reaction.

As the title says, I lost my job due to COVID. I just got my final paycheck - way less than I expected (just miscommunication on my part) but now I need to find another job. 

I’ve been applying to places but have had no luck even getting interviews, I’ve called places and they are just too busy so they say they will call me back but I haven’t heard anything.

I was a debt collector in the past for a big credit card company - it took such a bad toll on me mentally and physically (to the point where I was puking on my way to work, multiple times when I got to work, and literally even thinking about work would make me start to feel nauseous), I took anti-nausea pills and would go see the nurse almost everyday for about a week to get more before work and then I would just throw it up; and I tried to switch departments but since I was the top on my team they wouldn’t let me so eventually I had to quit to (quite literally) keep my sanity. 

Now, I have PTSD from that job. I tried other call centers but any job that was even REMOTELY similar to the other job I would start getting the same symptoms from when I worked at that card place.

BUT I know if I applied there with my references I would get hired immediately and it would be double what I was getting - plus it wouldn’t be the collections department, either. I just don’t know if I should.. it’s basically a guaranteed job, and it would be good because I’m planning to move so I could just transfer when I’m leaving.

833,"This is a bit of a long story, but here goes (context is important for the final question): Long ago when I (29M) was a teenager I met a girl, who we will call Marie, through a mutual friend, who we will call Sharon. At the time, I was attracted to and flirting with Sharon—but Marie had a bit of a crush on me. I was a typical douchey-teenager and would flirt with Marie on occasion (though I was never dating Sharon either). It never led to much beyond flirty texts. Anyway, I started to drift away from either of them when I started actually dating a girl (not important to this story) but I stayed friends with them. Marie started to talk to me less and less, and if I asked why she would say she didn't want to talk about it. 

  
Now at this point I asked Sharon what was up with Marie, to which Sharon told me she was just a drama queen and making up lies. I didn't 100% believe Sharon, but Marie wouldn't exactly talk to me either at the time. We stopped talking for the most part. 

  
  Cut to a few years later, I'm in college and one day get a text out of the blue from Marie. We start to catch up and hit it off, but only in a friend sense at first. I was in a rocky relationship at the time and didn't want to drag her into the drama. Anyway, cut to a few months later, my rocky relationship is ended and Marie and I start to get really flirty. Unfortunately, Marie was in a place where she was sending mixed signals. We would flirt and have a dirty chat, and then the next day she would feel bad about it because she was trying to change things in her life. I, admittedly, kept flirting and thought she was resistant to the idea or thought I was still the non-committal teenager I used to be. So, after one particularly intense night of flirting and dirty texts, I decided I needed to ask her to be my girlfriend the next day so there was no more question or unease. Except when I contacted her, she screamed at me to fuck off and never talk to her again. In the moment, I panicked and respected her wish (which in many ways I regret not asking her what happened, but I also think I was bullheaded enough it would have went over my head anyway). 

  
  Anyway, what followed was several months of trying to leave it alone, but honestly I couldn't. It gnawed at me; I spent many sleepless nights trying to figure out what happened when I had been so ready to ask her out (this is not what I need advice on, by the way, hindsight is a hell of a thing). I tried to email her as a safe option, with no response. I tried to text, but she'd changed her number. So, I tried to give up. 

  
  But every year, around her birthday, that itch would come back. More so wondering what had happened to her, hoping she was happy, the typical sappy stuff that we use as an excuse when we're selfishly thinking about someone. Anyway, during this time, since I'd never sleep, I would spend a few hours doing simple google searches, personfinder, that sort of thing to see if I could find her. 

  
  Slowly I found details, little crumbs that she still existed at least, but I'd never go further than just sending a birthday wish with a variety of messages (that matured from sappy, I need you back bs to actual, mature apologies). 

  
  But today, I found her on LinkedIn. I damn near fell out of my chair when I saw her profile picture and that it was actually her. I was tempted to send a message, but I stopped myself. Maybe I should just let sleeping dogs lie. 

  
  Now we've reached the point of why I am asking advice: what do I do? I don't want to message her for anything seedy or some long held belief that we could still be a thing, I'm happily in a relationship and own a house with my partner of 5 years now. I simply want to reach out to properly apologize for my early douchebag years, as well as for not respecting her during a time when she needed me to, and for selfish reasons of just wanting to know that she is doing well.   

  
  But even the best intentions can stir up the worst demons, so maybe I should just leave it alone. Plus I feel a bit like a creep thinking that I've spent the last eight years between January to march looking for small snippets of information on her in the hopes to find out she was alright with very little luck in terms of a way to contact her. Now I found a way, but it feels like a creep thing to even reach out. 

  
  Anyway, I've rambled too long. Might delete this later, but I guess I was curious to see if I'm crazy for wanting to reach out to her, or if there is someone who thinks she might actually like the apology, even if that is as far as reconnecting goes?

  
  Thanks.",02Apr2020,1
834,"Apologies in advance for the long post, I don't usually talk with anyone so I think I just needed to ramble this one out. I realise before even writing this that this whole things seems like no big deal or that I'm overreacting / overthinking it but if you have the time, I'd really appreciate your advice.

Backstory: I'm a 22F and dealing with people and social situations has never really been my thing and that has made it hard for me to make any friends over the years, I've had ""school friends"" that are only close during school days and then the rest of the year or even the weekends we don't talk or hang out. I had kinda accepted the fact that I'm never going to have any real friends until a couple of years ago I met the girl I'm writing this whole post about. When I first started college I started getting into voluntary work / civil society stuff as an attempt to get out of my comfort zone and do something I love. Along the way we needed to team up for managing different projects' teams. I thought it's probably never going to work no matter who I partner with because everyone else were friends with each other while I always worked alone, especially not with her because we have totally different personalities , at least that's what it seemed like, only to find out later that she wanted to specifically work with me (because she liked my work), she even made it a condition that we have to be partners or she wasn't going to follow through. This was huge for me at the time when I thought no one would want to deal with my personality or my work that she wanted that. As we kept working together we got closer and I realised we actually make a good team and even after the project was done she was the only one who would talk to me, ask how i am doing or just talk to me about things. Even though I suck at communicating I would text to check up on her or send her something nice just like she does for me, I tried as much as I could to balance between being a good friend to her and not being clingy.

Up until last year we were talking and working together from time to time and it was all fine, she one day called to invite me for her engagement party (first time I am ever invited to anything), said it wouldn't be the same without me and that she would send me all the details. I was excited, waited but got nothing, I figured she must've forgotten or thought she did send me the address. I texted her the day before just to see if there's anything wrong or she needs anything, she replied back a couple of times and then stopped, before I even got to ask her. So the next day I just texted again that I didn't get the address from her and that she seemed busy last night as she didn't keep talking, sent her my best wishes and that was it. This is one of many social situations that make me hate my entire existence, something as simple as a phone call asking about the info could've saved me all the trouble. But my anxiety and overthinking make every single little situation turn into a big spiral of insecurities. After this I got off social media for a while because I didn't want to have to talk again with anybody or deal with it (stupid decision on my end). She even sent me a voice note after and to this day I have not listened to it. About a month later there was a memory of something nice I did (you know how fb, instagram show you stuff from a year ago) she sent it to me with a nice text so I thought it was cool, replied back, and we started talking again. We even met after that at a reunion with our team and we were totally cool. 

After a while she was having a tough time, got off social media without saying anything, so I texted asking if she was okay, she talked a little bit and a few days after I checked up on her without being too pushy. When she started feeling a little better we were talking and I said that it would be great to meet some time because it's been a while, she said she really wanted to see me and would love to ""just pick a day and let's do it"" I told her that I would finish my college deadlines for the week and talk to her again, which I did, asked her when she was free to meet up.

It's been three months. She never replied back, left me on delivered, I thought she was busy or doesn't feel like texting (I always have no problem with that and I myself take time to reply) but as months went by she never even texted to ask how I am doing or anything like that, which makes me certain she is trying not to open my message at all. At this point I felt like an idiot for allowing all of this to happen I mean I never ask people to hang out because I'm almost certain they would not want to or that I would get rejected somehow, this was the only time I was feeling okay making plans with someone I actually love and know they can love me back. Even during Christmas time I sent people in our group chat wishes for the new year and as they replied she opened the group texts and started talking to them like she has no problem texting anyone. She's also posting on social media all the time which makes it seem like she has no problem talking with anyone. I'm just confused as to what did I do wrong? She could've just said no and moved on instead of ignoring me like that. I'm also confused because she sees and reacts to my stories (shallow social media problems, well aware) so does that mean she is not mad for any particular reason? if not then why is she not talking to me?

I keep thinking right now is a tough time for everyone anyway with what's going on, so should I try to be nice and text asking how she is doing or ask her if we're okay?  But then again if she keeps ignoring me I'll look like even more of an idiot and hate myself for it. But I also don't want a year to go by and find myself feeling guilty because I let it all fade away, I'm already constantly wondering about it everyday. I forgot to mention she actually has a lot of friends and is much more sociable than I am so I would imagine this is not bugging her as much, understandingly. Any advice?? Thanks.",02Apr2020,1
835,"My ex boyfriend(19) and I(F, 18) broke up a week or so after our first anniversary which was 3 months ago. It’s his mom’s birthday today and over the course of our relationship, she was so welcoming, and kind towards me. Even bought a present for me last Christmas. 

Ever since we broke up, his mom hasn’t liked nor commented on my pictures but she comments on my ex-bf’s brother’s girlfriend’s every post (It’s not that I stalk her, it just pops up whenever I go on instagram). I know it’s self explanatory bc that’s also her son’s gf and she obvi wouldn’t comment/like mine cause I broke up with her son (Reason why was because we needed our own separate time to grow as a person bc our future together didn’t seem bright)

Should I still greet her a happy birthday? ☹️ I really adore her because she was so kind to me when we were still dating but idk about now. I need your advices:((( thank you so much. Idk if it would be awkward to do so or not

He's in the worst possible position for this outbreak. If he gets it, it's fair to say he's as good as dead.

As much as I'd love to do that, I don't wanna risk giving it to him.

I don't have any symptoms and I haven't left the house since the stay at home order. However, my dad works and it's possible he could have gotten it and given it to me, and we just aren't showing symptoms. Also, there's a slight chance we could have gotten it through the mail via Amazon packages.

844,"TLDR: Transporter @ a hospital. I like my job, but now they’re having us transport COVID patients, I have a really weak immune system. I only make 12$ an hour, is the job security/pay worth staying?

I work as a transporter at the hospital. I transport and assist in moving patients to and from their rooms, appointments/surgeries within the hospital, cleaning medical equipment, and even moving deceased pts to the morgue. Lots and lots of patient contact. More so than nurses I’d say, because we move from one patient to the next. Average for me is 15 different patients per day. 
I actually like my job. It’s independent work, you get stuff done and move onto the next task. It’s not really stressful other than nurses being really REALLY rude/rushed sometimes which can put me and my coworkers in unsafe working conditions. 
The only reason I am really contemplating quitting is due to COVID-19. Originally when this started getting big, they had designated transporters taking COVID pts where they needed to go. Now that’s it’s gotten big, we ALL take COVID patients where they need to go, and all we have are COVID patients. 
I am really worried, I have a terrible immune system, I had a COVID scare just last week and my dr ordered me to get tested. Came back negative. But I know if i end up contracting this virus I probably wouldn’t be able to make it. 
Also, while you hear about nurses and other healthcare workers making sometimes up to 150$ or more an hour, I am only making minimum wage to be here and possibly put my life on the line.. I’m just an entry level worker. I don’t know if I should just keep on working, or quit?

849,"Let me start off by apologizing for the bad formatting, I’m on mobile... (+ the somewhat messy grammar, I hope you can read through it.)

I am a 20-something guy from Sweden, where I lived my whole life. I’m currently staying with my family during the quarantine &amp; living in my old bedroom. I love my family a whole bunch, we have fights, but it never ends up with any violence, it stays verbal and emotional.

Ever since I was a child I used to have tantrums that exceeded the normal. I grew up to become a bully in middle school to high school, I was always in trouble. In and out of the principal’s office, teachers calling home ratting me out for whatever shitty thing I had just pulled. I was the kid who pushed people into lockers, tore their hair out. In preschool I managed to kick my friends baby tooth in so that a teacher had to help pull it out. Also threw a rock into the same girls head from the top of a slide once. My motive? Who knows.
To be brief, I was a devil since the beginning. And yet, I never got proper help. 
I did get pulled out of class every day to sit down and do some type of ‘journaling’ with a teacher who was worried about my health, though. She tried to help me put down my emotions on paper and describe what I was feeling. It felt nice to have someone help me try limit my outbursts. Not to mention the journal has stickers and cool illustrations, which the young aspiring artist-me was into.

Fast forward to 3-4 years ago when I was at my absolute worst. 
I would lash out out of nowhere, break things I love. Gifts I’ve gotten from family, anything I could get my hands on, anything lying around. I think I’ve smashed 3 phones in rage, so far. 
I used to hit walls, scream... It got to a point where I was so sensitive and emotional I started to contemplate taking my own life, I couldn’t take it. Every day felt far too overwhelming and the therapist I was seeing just didn’t seem to care for me, at all. I’d mention how livid I’d get, how I was planning on overdosing on heroin, and all she answered with was “well! let’s talk about your OCD tendencies!” (as a tl;dr, I’ve had tendencies since I was a kid, rituals, urges, etc. that really mess me up at times til this day, some rituals which I’ve practiced every single day for the past decade) - it broke me apart. I somehow managed to get through the suicidal thoughts &amp; moved on. But, as expected, my inner rage stayed put...
I never got any proper help since that teacher and her journaling. I had a bunch of different therapists and they all either ignored my cries for help, or they told me I need a fair balance between diet, exercise and sleep, which is a great tip, sure, but definitely won’t solve my anger. Nor am I motivated enough to work hard on achieving all of that at once... but! Believe me, I’m trying.

I’ve always had a tendency of hurting those around me and my pets. Our late dog used to receive frequent beatings as soon as he pissed me off, he got so afraid of me in the end that he would wet himself when I approached him. That is one example.
I’m aware the abuse is wrong, absolutely putrid, in fact- but I can’t hinder it.

I’ve tried to learn ways to cope with my anger, ways to reach out, finding hobbies to practice, finding peace by walking around in nature relieving my stress, but nothing is working in the long run. 
I’m a creative person &amp; focus much on painting, I went to art school for a couple of years, which is when I was at my worst. Still, art is important to me and a great outlet for ventilating.

Now I’m starting to doubt myself once again. If I deserve to continue this life or not, wrongfully blessed with some really fucked up brain that can’t stop ordering my submissive fuck of a body to follow with as I swing punches and kicks at those I love.
With a new puppy and other pets in the house, I’m having a hard time not getting riled up several times a day. 

Any help and advice is greatly appreciated, I really need to get out of this horrible circle of pain. I truly hate living this way.
I would do anything to stop hurting myself and others. 

Tl;dr: I’m someone who has had anger issues my entire life &amp; can’t stop acting out on people I love and care for, I’m starting to doubt myself and if my life is worth living &amp; am reaching out for any help / advice I can get.",02Apr2020,1

I am 17 and i have panic attacks because of thanatophobia. So lets start from the beginning.
I was a little kid first class of primary school or a bit younger(6-8) when i first thought of death. I strongly remember that i was like 'ok i will probably won't remember this when i die'. And this is the whole point. It kicks in whenever i think of an event and suddenly i think that i won't remember it when i die. I used to experience it once a year or idk once every 6 months. The panic attack lasted a few seconds and with the help of heavy breathing and happy thoughts it went away.
Until a few days ago.
I was at my bed at night and thought of a conversation i had, then i thought that i will forget it after my death and then i realized that i don't remember anything prior my birth because i wasn't existing. I got a panic attack that lasted more than usual. I got off the bed and almost started crying. Couldn't sleep so i watched a comedy series on Netflix to forget about the event and laugh a bit.
After that day during night time i start having thoughts about death and i avoid the panic attack at the last second because i change my thought.
I know that i must ask the help of a psychologist. But i am in house lock down so i can't.
I want to hear anything advices, thoughts or experiences from people who went through it.

858,"I have lived in a small duplex for quite awhile now. Tenants on the other side were our age when I moved in, very nice guys that we would hangout with often. After awhile, they moved out and the property on that side was renovated. A new property manager was hired by the landlord who we used to deal with directly and pay rent through. 

&amp;#x200B;

This new property manager is an older lady who runs her own business and is almost impossible to get a hold of. She brought in a lady who has a disabled son (can't think for himself, talk, etc.) On the 2nd or 3rd night they were here, the police were called because they thought they smelled marijuana. They came and didn't smell anything and then left. We tried to talk to the new lady and she was extremely hostile with us stating that we would make her nurse fail a drug test and cut us off every time we tried to talk with her reasonably. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is : there is a common stairwell separating the two sides of the duplex. The stairwell leads to the second half of the property for both sides so it is very essential for both tenants. After complaining that their son came into our side because our door was cracked open, we made sure to keep the doors shut at all times. He has wandered in 4 times now by opening the door with the knob. It is not ideal to have to constantly lock the property from the inside as leaving your keys upstairs by accident one time would leave you screwed. You wouldn't have access to your vehicle or half the property. 

The mother of this child has no idea when this happens which means he is wandering around without supervision in a common area of the house and obviously trespassing multiple times. A couple of times, I tried to direct him back to their side and they were nowhere in sight. 

The property manager is extremely rude when we try to talk to her and when I called today to explain this, she stated ""lock your doors if you don't want people coming into your house"" and on a previous call a month earlier she stated, loudly, ""It's not trespassing if the door's open!"" (3x) 

The landlord is upset to hear all of this and tries to talk to her about it, but we are moving out soon and we want this property manager to face consequences for her negligence so far (including 15 days to fix a dryer, being unreachable, ignoring messages that she clearly reads, sending us a 14 day till eviction notice letter over the next door neighbors reporting that our door was cracked open one day) 

&amp;#x200B;

What can be done about this? I know it can't be justified for a property manager to explain trespassing is OK unless they literally pick/break the locks. I don't want to get the landlord involved as she just owns the place and none of this is her fault, but a simple google review is not just for such terrible business practice.

861,"So, dear people, hello there. How are you doing in these God-forsaken times? I hope you're all well. I'm in need of some advice or a kind voice to lift me up. I'm about to get fired from my job, where I've been working since last summer, because I suck at it. Let me give you a bit of a backstory about myself. 

I always failed in life in about every aspect. Even the things I used to like and was good at, they became uninteresting and was quickly surpassed by others. I hate competition and am not a competitive person AT ALL even if I know I might be better at certain things compared to others. When I was a kid I was some kind of a semi-prodigy. Then, as I grew older I started to do worse and worse in school but still maintained a pretty good position for a while. I just can't pull myself to learn or work on what I need to do. Even if I have to study for an easy exam, I just sit with the papers in front of me and I end up doing something else. Obviously I dropped out of college after I started it because of my poor results and having other stupid activities besides studying.

I think I might have other problems than just acute laziness. Trust me, folks, people, that love me, sacrificed time, money, emotions, sweat for me and still, I repaid them by sabotaging myself and ending up doing nothing and letting their sacrifices be in vain. I hate myself for this but I just don't know what to do. I just cand find any ambition and motivation to do anything. It's like sometimes I just don't want to put my brain to work. If actually start doing/working on something I get bored in a couple of minutes and I find reasons to take a break and never come back to work.  I'm becoming a vegetable and the irony is that I don't live a healthy life either. This curse haunts me for over 15 years....

I have a little risk-free business idea that it's almost set up. I just need to kickstart it and work a little bit on it but I just postpone it for tomorrow and the day after and the day after that... and that ""tomorrow"" actually never comes. This is the problem with my current job too. I just try to make every day as simple as possible, taking simple tasks or no tasks at all, I never try to learn from everything this experience can offer me.  

I have strong principles that I respect and live by them, but I just can't get past this inability to actually DO something with my life. I'm so sorry and I apologize to the people who read this and aren't as lucky as I am and maybe don't have the resources that they wish they had and I have them (health, friends, family, support...). I'm ashamed of myself. My dream is to change the world and make it a better place for everyone, that is one of the reasons I hate working in an office and send emails every day because that amounts to nothing. That doesn't help society, animals, nature or people in need.  

Please, ladies and gents, give me some advice, share your experience and wisdom with me, boost me up!  Help me be a better human being. Help me to actually make myself useful and give my life some meaning.

PS. I can not afford a therapist and I don't really think it would be of much help in my situation.

Thank you for reading this, wish you the best and please stay safe!",02Apr2020,1
862,"So just a little bit of background here, and I thank you all in advance because I am not sure how to go about this: 

I work in the public sector
I am the only male in my department
I’ve been in this agency for over five years, current department two years

I consider myself to be very good at my job, even by government worker standards, and I have a great relationship with my peers and have always been willing to help out when needed. I am focused on my work, but I do walk around to say hi to my co-workers and check in with them to see if they need any help. I am also a senior in my position, so I have certain access and abilities that allow me to stand in for complex situations or deal with customer complaints in absence of my supervisor.

I was also selected to work on a sensitive project to troubleshoot and identify issues that affected the entire county, not just my workplace, and I went off site for five months and got glowing reviews from some of the top people in my agency. 

With that being said, my supervisor often passes over me when she needs projects done, often giving them to someone who has a busy workload and ignores me altogether. I have had to find my own work assignments since returning from my project and I spent a large chunk of my days just working on whatever I find for myself when I am not supporting the other members of my office.

If I don’t approach my supervisor, I am practically invisible.

This is extremely debilitating to me, because I don’t want to transfer locations and I actually enjoy the work when I get it. 

Last week, we were recommended to telework and my supervisor walked past me to give everyone their assignments, but I had to walk to her office for her to say “Oh, here you go.”

865,"I never go out. I don’t like to be social. It makes me feel uncomfortable. I went to soccer some years ago but decided to quit cause lack of motivation. And i was active and was going out and everything until some year ago after i changed school. It was not fun anymore. 
My dad works all day. He didn’t get a great education so we have some financial problems. Thats atleast what i think. I hear my parents conversations but they never tell me anything. When he comes home, i am at my computer or phone. 
Yes, i play alot, yes i am antisocial. I don’t go to sports or go out with friends. The ones in my neighbourhood area is not my friends anymore cause i changed schools and i don’t like them anymore. They cause problem. The ones at my new school. 30 min with buss is my friends but they don’t care/bother enough to take contact with me in weekends. So i have no friends to go out with. I think i am depressed and i am tired of life but my depression never got confirmed because i haven’t told anyone. 
Back to the problem. My dad wants me to go to sports or go out in someway, but i don’t want to. He and my mom complains everyday. The only reason for going out is ’being healthy’ and i train my body at home. I take breathers and get fresh air very often. But stepping outside my house i don’t. Not just cause of the Corona virus. I have been like this a long time. I am just tired of everything. I don’t care about school or anything anymore but i still work the best i can but it is killing me inside. 

Some of this is off topic, yes but it is why i won’t go out and i need to tell my dad to stop asking me it. I don’t have to go out cause i am healthy already. I don’t need to go out and i don’t want to. 

So, Reddit, any suggestion on how to make my dad realise this?",02Apr2020,1
866,"Hey. I’m a M between the age(es) of 17-20 and a situation happened today with my friend who is also a M and a year younger than me. Earlier, I went into our dms and seen a screenshot of one of my sister’s posts on Instagram. He sent the screenshot with the words “Haha, who’s this?” and I told him it was one of my sisters. Before I continue on with this, I’d like to give out some information because it has to do with what I’m going to say afterwards. In middle school, I was mentally abused by both of my only sisters who are older than me which greatly depleted my mental health. They still fuck with me but not a lot because I give them shit right back. They still nitpick 24/7 though. The friend, who I will call “Bitch”, knew this because we have known each other since middle school. I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety in my freshman year of high school. While I am used to depression and I no longer wish to off myself, I still suffer from anxiety. Anyways, I told him it was my sister and told him he was a weirdo for following her private account. I proceeded to tell him to unfollow her because it made me extremely uncomfortable since he sometimes makes jokes about my sisters being hot and how he wants their numbers. There’s multiple reasons why I want(ed) him to unfollow her. It felt like my privacy was being invaded in a way and the whole situation gave me extreme anxiety. What fueled the fire even more, was the fact that he claimed he didn’t do anything wrong and that him following my sister does not affect me. He also thinks I attacked him because I explained how it made me feel. As far as I know, he will not be unfollowing my sister. I don’t even care about that anymore. I care about how he thinks of the situation. I told him if I were in his shoes, I would’ve done it for him- which I would. I don’t want to make my friends uncomfortable over something I can easily fix. Bitch thinks it’s not his fault that I was close to an anxiety attack and that I’m uncomfortable for no reason. Instead of trying to calm me down, he just said stuff like “Chill out lmao” which only made things worse. I’m not saying it’s his job to cater to me or some shit but if you don’t like it when someone is being a certain way, why say things that would make it worse? He disregards everything I say unless it’s something he can use or unless it’s something not really related to the situation (so he can try to change the subject.) Dude has a habit of disregarding people’s feelings if he thinks the person feels a certain way for nothing or if he can’t see why they feel the way they do.

He says that because I’m not his girlfriend, he doesn’t have to listen to me. He also said he doesn’t like being told what to do. I also don’t like being told what to do. While it’s true that he doesn’t have to listen to me.. wouldn’t you think that if someone was doing something that caused their friend discomfort and anxiety, they’d want to fix that instead of trying to justify their actions and downplay the situation? Bitch has history of doing things that discomforts me. He has told people (I’m unsure if it was multiple people or just his girlfriend) that I have something for the sake of a story from middle school. I won’t be mentioning what that “something” is but everyone who knows of it, knows it is incredibly fucked up to tell others about it if the person hasn’t stated they are okay with it. Bitch also tried to say “Your mom follows her.” which blew my mind because my mom and my sister are obviously family while my sister doesn’t even know Bitch exists. Our convo ended with me telling him that I’m in the wrong and that what I felt was nothing but an illusion. I also apologized to him. (All of that was sarcasm, which he didn’t like.) I called him selfish and entitled which only resulted in him saying that he isn’t any of those and that I seem like I’m the one who’s entitled. I ask that dude for NOTHING. Only asked him of that one thing because of how it made me feel. He always bugs me when I don’t reply to his texts and always asks me to play video games with him. We’re good friends, but I don’t know. I’m not saying I didn’t do anything wrong in the situation, I think I could’ve reacted better but yeah.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask. The situation happened about an hour or two ago so I’m still chillin out from it, which means I probably left some things out.

TLDR: My friend did something that caused me to feel extremely uncomfortable and almost caused an anxiety attack. He thinks he didn’t do anything wrong at all and doesn’t plan to do anything to fix the situation. He only added more fuel to the fire and changed the subject.",02Apr2020,1

A couple days after me blocking their number, I got an email from PayPal saying they wanted $75 of the $195 they paid me. I sold them services, no items, and they claimed I sold them damaged goods. I had 2 things of theirs that I had boxed up, ready to send to them, but they wanted them ASAP, thus the claim. There was no receipt for the items they were claiming, I gave PayPal the invoice for my services, and they ultimately sided with me because he wrote out what he paid me for, which was a service.

I then sent out the items he wanted and they were delivered. Thought this was over until today I get ANOTHER email from PayPal saying they want the whole $195.

875,"Sorry in advance for the lengthy post!

So to start off, here's some backstory. I (26F) have been living with my boyfriend (BF - 30M) and his roommate (R - 31M) for a long while, but I don't pay rent because my BF covers it (currently laid off due to covid, and I only paid utilities last month). R doesn't pay rent either because he hasn't had a job, and his parents paid it even when he did. This causes me to feel like I have no say in household matters, even though I'm the one who cleans and shops for essentials and pretty much does everything around the house. BF and I split the grocery bill for our food, while R takes food from his parents' house, so on top of what I'm about to get into, he sneak-eats our food without asking or replacing any of it. It normally irked me a little, but with the virus going around, I am trying to stay out of grocery stores as much as possible right now AND save what little money I have!

Anyway, the main problem is that I am practicing self-isolation and social distancing, whereas R is not. (BF is as much as possible, but his job was deemed essential.) R is going out EVERY SINGLE DAY for hours, sometimes overnight. Like I said before, he doesn't have a job, so what's the point of taking the unneccessary risk every day?? He is mostly visiting several friends, who I know aren't following any safety guidelines, and his parents when he goes to get supplies. I know he's also gone to a park a couple of times. This is freaking me the HELL out because I have a terrible immune system, asthma/lung issues in general, and Crohn's disease, among other health and anxiety problems. He's not washing his hands at all or sanitizing/disinfecting anything, keeps asking to use our stuff, just all around paying no mind to this pandemic. I tried to breech the subject once in a light teasing manner, but he laughed and said it was being blown way out of proportion. I have nowhere else to go because my brother and sister have special needs and my mom has a wide array of health problems. All of my friends are extra-isolating due to working healthcare professions or living with someone who does. In the grand scheme of things, though, I want us ALL to be protected in the house. BF already heightens our chances of getting it just by interacting with customers every day, and I just want us all to take this seriously.

So how should I tackle this subject? I asked BF if we could all sit down and discuss it tonight, and he said we could but R is gonna do what he wants to do regardless, which makes me wish I had a little more support from BF on this honestly. I just want to come off as nice and non-judgmental yet firm, and while I'm typically pretty good at these things, since R is not technically ""my"" roommate and is actually BF's, I don't know how to even approach it. Am I being an asshole here since I am technically just a live-in girlfriend and not a rent-paying roommate? I just want us all to stay healthy!",02Apr2020,1

My brothers just told us (accidentally) that he went to get weed earlier and his dealer got into my brothers car and they hung out for a couple minutes. On top of this, my bro went to the shop earlier and didn’t wash his hands. He’s not taking this seriously at all and our parents are in their 50’s and my mum smoked for 30 years (recently quit). 
I’m worrying so much about this because I’m putting so much effort into being careful. I am only leaving the house to walk the dog, I wash my hands even if I take things to the outside bin, I ensure my family wear gloves to the shop and wash their hands.

I grew up in a mostly 75% black community (20% Hispanic-I am Hispanic)but most interestingly my family was scared, they where here illegally in the US so they made it clear to me that The Anything to do with the government and School where out to get us and send us to our deaths. Knowing this I was scared I felt as if the world was not safe and I feared everyone. Due to this same reasons 1-8th grade I did not leave my house at all. I had no friends because the black kids said I couldn’t hang out because I was Mexican and that same group of Black kids would throw rocks at me after school everyday until 6th grade, the Hispanic kids didn’t like me because I was too Mexican (I was basically a outcast). Despite all of this I survived elementary and middle school. My parents later on obtain their green cards a month before I graduated school and let me know that I was going to attend a private high school (they got better jobs). I was scared of the kids who bullied me due to previous negative encounters with them(Same ones who threw rocks at me). I spoke with a Mexican accent I had been in constant fear. Well nevertheless I go to this rich high school. I started to get things I had never thought I would get (a phone, brand name clothing etc) (and my parents expected me to walk in as if i had nothing to fear).Well I was very hostile because I wanted to avoid every one because I was expecting them to hurt me(freshmen-sophomore years).

COVID-19 had fast and serious impact on the company. More than 90% of office staff are on furough. I’m furloughed of 3/27/20. 

The whole process of this happened in less than a week. There was so much going on I didn’t get a chance to get print/digital samples or anything (stupid, I know, I’ll be getting nasty comments about it). I always meant to build a portfolio in the past couple of years, but just didn't. I was distracted by medical issues and life in general.

 I was planning to replace it this summer. I didn’t ever do work at home to begin with. I do have a laptop I can use for the moment though.

HR suggested my work is proprietary, but says I’d have to ask one if the owner’s children (who was my boss).

Some of the other graphic designers have kept samples of their work (I think) and I'm betting they're using those samples they kept to find work. I have not used this argument with my company, yet.

Julius(the dog) is mistreated by Brutus(the owner) (both fake names on the off chance he uses reddit) Brutus works night shifts which are 12 hours long. When he isn’t working he’s sleeping and in his room, but Julius is either running around peeing and pooping all over the house or put in his cage, which is way too small for him. He has to hunch when just sitting down in there. If Julius is making too much noise when Brutus is awake he gets a muzzle put on him. A muzzle that is wayyyy too tight. Julius isn’t trained either, he jumps on tables and on people. He doesn’t play with Julius at all. The most attention he gets is when he gets taken outside to go to the bathroom. 

Now when Brutus and the boyfriend are at work I dog sit for as long as I can stay awake so he isn’t locked in a cage all night.

If their debt gets high enough to be worthwhile, I was planning on taking them to small claims court, but with our bill lowering each month, I’m uncertain it’ll top $200, so maybe not worth it. 

I offered during extended periods away they pay half their usual share; they’re not personally using electricity/gas, but they still pay something to contribute to unavoidable costs. Both roommates ignored it and later insisted they’ll pay nothing while away. 

Should I charge them their usual 1/4 share next bill? Or charge the reduced amount I offered? Does it matter given their refusal to pay?

Is there anything you folks suggest I do to improve the situation with my roommates? 

Assuming in the end I don’t get paid fully, I wouldn’t want my 3rd roommate to have to pay for them, but it’s not like I want to either, and someone has to pay. It’s not unreasonable to ask to share the cost, is it?

899,"I had a friend I was close to since second grade. We were really close but when going to her house, I found she lived in a disgusting environment.  
 She had over twenty dogs, and didn't potty train or bathe any of them. She said it was too much work to train so many dogs and they didn't like baths so they just didn't give them any.  
 Eventually, the neighbors reported the number of animals and they rehomed them until they had 12.  
At the time, it still wasn't a dealbreaker, she cleaned up their mess when it happened and a few smelly dogs wasn't a big deal.  
 I started staying the night and that's when I found another issue, bedbugs to be exact. I would wake up in the middle of the night with multiple bites and even found bedbugs nestled in my clothes when getting up to use the restroom.  
 After years of nothing being done about them, I became hesitant to spend the night so I let her stay at my house a few months, where yet another issue happened.  
 It turns out she stopped bathing too. Her hair was thick with grease and being near her, my eyes wanted to water with the smell. I tried to be nice about it, asking if she would like to use the shower before dinner, or even if she wants to go swimming, but she always refused and wouldn't say why.  
The same night this happened, I was making her dinner and asked what she wanted. At first, I offered turkey sandwiches, but she said she was a vegan. So I offered to make up a salad, but then she said she only eats junk food.  
 So she ended up only eating a bag of chips the whole time she was there. I began to worry about her health.  
 About a year later I moved out of state and didn't see her for about three years. When I returned for vacation, she asked if I wanted to stay the night, and said she moved houses. I was a little excited about it, thinking the issues may have been fixed but I was so wrong.  
 First, they carried the bedbugs over, so I was up all night just trying not to become a bug feast, and they still managed to get into my clothes and bite me.   
My friend was so overweight, greasy, and unbathed that it was difficult to be near her. Not just for the smell, but for the way she's been living, the way she was treating her health hurt me, I didn't exactly like seeing a friend like that.   
 Along with dogs, she also had cats, and no litterboxes, so the animals but pooped all over the house whenever they wanted, and this time she didn't bother to clean it up for some time later if she saw it.   
 On my way back to where I was staying, I had pulled a bedbug off the lining up my underwear and ended up changing and leaving all my clothes outside for the remainder of the trip.  
 At that point, I stopped contacting her, I just couldn't do it any longer.  
 She still tries to contact me and I often ignore or, or keep my messages short. I don't want to get her hopes up that I'm going back for vacation again and being pressured into staying over again, after so many years, I just can't anymore.  
 But I still feel bad for just cutting off contact, for no longer being friends with someone for their hygiene and living, and I just need some advice and input from people that aren't me.  
 Did I do the right thing, is there something I could have done instead? She keeps contacting me, and I don't know what to do.",02Apr2020,1
900,"Hello Reddit!

My GF (24F) and I (23F) live together in Southwest, MI. We have been seriously following all social distancing mandates (only leaving our apartment for groceries / no parties or company/ ect) for over 2 weeks, as have my GF's parents who live in the Chicago area.

My GF wants to go to her home and visit her parents for the weekend (for her Father's birthday!), and then return back to our apartment. Her parents want her to come, but some people we have spoken to seem a little offended that my GF would go home during this time of 'social distancing'.

Would most people consider this 'acceptable' during this time? We have been doing some research on the different measures both MI and IL are placing on travel, and we have not gotten a clear indication of whether or not this is frowned upon...

Thanks for the help!",02Apr2020,1
901,"Tried posting this on AITA but it was removed. Just to explain some of the abbreviations I used!
I’m writing on my phone- obligatory apology for any formatting issues.

Here’s some background to understand the situation: I (17f) have divorced parents with 50/50 joint custody. I spend one week at my dad’s house, then one week at my mom’s. When I’m with my dad it’s just us two that live in his house; at my mom’s it is me, my mom, a roommate (20f) and my younger sister (8). My younger sister has a different father than me; my mom is also divorced with him. They are on good terms and have 50/50 custody so that my sister and I are both with our mom during the same week.

With everything that’s been happening, my school has been closed for the remainder of the year (I’m a high school senior). Because of social distancing recommendations from my state government, I haven’t seen any friends for about a month. I’ve been taking social distancing pretty seriously, and have only been around my family and whoever they invite over. However, this has been taking a toll on me. I’m undoubtedly an extrovert, and get most of my energy and fulfillment from being around other people. Usually I would get this fulfillment from going to school, hanging out with friends, or going to work (I work at a fast-food restaurant). With everything going on, that hasn’t been happening. My mom has forbidden me from seeing any friends or going to work. 

For the first couple of weeks, I felt relatively fine. I stayed in contact with my friends through text, call, and FaceTime. I did homework, cleaned, read, and went on frequent runs and hikes to keep myself busy. I’ve still been doing these things, but I can feel my mental state declining. I have diagnosed depression (I’m on medication) and sometimes have triggers that can cause me to have a sort of relapse or short depressive episode. Usually these last a few days and I’m fine again. However, the stress of everything going on, along with not being allowed to see anyone outside of a handful of people, has had me feeling really bad. I really REALLY miss seeing people, and not being able to do so is driving me crazy! I know a lot of people feel this way, though.

So, I asked my parents if I could go back to work. I understand not being allowed to see friends, but since I work at a place serving food they’re still open. At first my parents both said no, with my mom stating that I couldn’t go back “over [her] dead body.” In the last couple of weeks though, my dad has changed his mind, and thinks going to work would be fine for me. There are safety precautions in place, we serve customers from behind a glass screen, and I wouldn’t be directly touching anybody. He thinks that having more of a schedule and being able to interact with people would be good for me.

My mom still disagrees. She told me that my sister’s father has been very adamant about limiting social contact, and that if I go to work he will not allow me to see her or my my mom by association. Although I’m sure he’s taking the situation seriously, my mom is known to exaggerate what people say, so I’m not sure if he really said that and stands by it. My mom also has damaged lungs from years of second-hand smoke inhalation when she was younger, and very occasionally she’ll use an inhaler.

Our social circles aren’t completely limited. My dad still has to go to work two times a week, where he’s around other people. He invites his girlfriend over, who also has to go to work. Until two weeks ago my mom was inviting her friend and the friend’s two young children over. She also picked up our roommate from the airport, where she had been around dozens of people, just a week ago.

I feel as if my mom is being kind of unreasonable, but at the same time I understand why she doesn’t want me to work. I’m of the belief that almost everybody is going to get this virus anyway. I won’t be around any high-risk individuals. I just really want to go back to work, as I can feel my mental-state declining pretty badly and I believe this would help. I want to tell my mom that on the weeks I’m with my dad I will be going to work, as he’s fine with it and has authority over what I’m allowed to do when I’m with him. Would I be TA if I did this?",02Apr2020,1

After his parents left his mom threatened to kill him if the cops ever came again. I’ve only known Fish for a couple weeks and he’s mentioned that his parents hit him and hinted to his dad breaking his thumb. Fish is pretending like everything is fine now and not talking to me and acting weird.

905,"My best friend is 29 I'm 27 about to be 28 this weekend. Because or the coronacrisis we can't go out so we talked about just drinking and getting pizza at his place and spending the night. I was down for this but not so much anymore. 

My best friend has a long time GF who has a 14 year old brother that lives with them. The grandma had custody of the kid but due to her health issues my friend GF had him move in with her and my friend. 

This kid has ADHD. I think he has something more severe but idk. I love my friend but due to schools being shut down the kid is home 24/7. And since the gyms are closed me and my friend lift weights in his living room. Well the kid is severely overweight and weighs more then even we do. He says he wants to workout but is just messing around the whole time. 
Usually our workouts are like 2 hours between talking working out and all that. After maybe 45 minutes I got irritated and went home. 


The kid is constantly in the way. Asking really bad and dumb questions. Interrupting. And just fucking around while we're trying to workout. 

I can't have anyone at my place. So I'm honestly torn between going there for my birthday or just staying home. 
I don't wanna be a dick because I know the kid has issues but it does get annoying after a while. My friend gets annoyed with the kid too and is always having issues with his GF due to her brother being there. 

I don't really want to be an asshole. Me and my friend don't have many chances to drink and do fun stuff because we both work so much. And my birthday turned out to be a time that works where we can drink and chill but this kid is so annoying. 

I'm thinking if I go I'll just take an uber over there and then uber back home if I get irritated instead of driving over and staying the night if I get too drunk to drive. 

Am I being an asshole for being irritated with this kid?

He's not in special ed classes. He just has 3 million questions a day. He doesn't like to shower. Overweight. Plays video games and is really lazy. He has Adhd and I think he might have something else idk. We've tried motivating him to workout, to clean, pick up an instrument, and to just be clean and productive. He gets upset and then tells his sister we were bullying him which isn't true. 

I almost want to stop being friends with all of them just because of this dude. Idk I'm just so irritated right now.",02Apr2020,1
906,So I(15M) am a Korean male i was born in Korea and lived there from birth to 5. I am now 15 and when I was 5 I was adopted by my family that I love dearly. The only problem is my family is white. My siblings are 17F 21F and 23F. I kind of feel left out I feel like I dont hold the same amount of value in my family as my sisters and it sucks.  I just want to feel valued its nothing anyone can help with they never do anything  to make me feel unwanted HELL they even paid for me to know Korean and before covid 19 happened we were planning on going to Korea for a week over the summer. I am fluent in my home language thanks to them. I knew how to speak it always but only at like a 5 year olds level but I feel connected with my country even though I haven't been there in 10 years.

907,"   
First of all, I want to exclame that I am using Google translator to make this post, and even if I know how to speak English,  I am at a time when I cannot translate manually. Basically my brother and I are 16 years old (we are not identical twins) , we are in a time that is  difficult ,we have to study pretty hard to take an exam to determine if we can go to the colleges that we want, so students usually are pretty anxious and stressed. I study  every day,passing hours at school at afternoon. So when  I get  at home,I just wanna rest (usually playing TF2, programming, sleeping, etc.), but when I get home my brother appears to irritate me. My brother is the same age as me, but we are totally different persons, while I study and do my  responsibilities , he stays asleep all day, listens to music and plays video-games. This is not my problem, he does what he wants in his life, but his habits start to affect when he doesn’t do his chores, like sharing the house cleaning, cleaning his dishes, even feeding his own bird. So to prevent the house to rot down and his bird to not die, I have to do everything ,and that’s not even the worst problem, he still  complains about everything I do, if I leave any stains on a plate or anywhere he hits me and curses , as if he doesn't even live in the house and is only a guest. You may be thinking that he has to be  a very strong person and for that reason I cannot defend myself, in fact he can't even hurt a single fly, while I am a( little) overweight person who is much bigger than him and could easily knock him out. But I don't like violence, I never liked hitting anyone and he knows that,and because he doesn't hurt me either,he uses psychological violence, which works pretty well to be honest,he offends me until my self-esteem falls completely.I cannot eat or drink anything he likes, which are usually caloric foods (Coca-Cola, Pizzas, Nugguets, etc.) because he calls me fat and says I am obese, even if I eat a lot  healthier  than he eats(the last time I saw him eating a fruit was months ago). Another problem is that we are not rich, we are from the middle middle class, even though we have a good life we ​​still need to moderate in relation to spending, but he likes a specific way of life (very specific), specifically the way of life of basketball players  and some rappers, so he always want to have, eat and drink the same things that these people do, so he spends a lot of money on  unnecessary things , harming my mother who works almost all day to support our family. A while ago my mother noticed that there were some expenses on her credit card and talked to us about it, at first my brother lied saying that he didn't know anything, but my mother managed to find out that he was buying some things with her credit card and demanded he removed the card from his cell phone. But even though she thought he had removed the card, he had saved the credit card's information, and he continued to use her card to usually buy fast foods, but in quantities where the price was much more expensive than normal. I already confronted  him about it and he said that I am cheap and that I would regret not spending lots of money like him, and even though I warned about our financial situation, he said that he once saw my mother's bank account and he said she had a large amount of money and  for that reason he could spend as much as he wanted (he had looked at the amount  years ago).The only people who really heard me were my grandparents(I didn't even talk about it but they knew my brother was a pain in our asses) and they basically said that I should stop caring too much about him,that if I didn't he would turn me mentally insane  .At the beginning ,I  thought that they were  exaggerating ,but now I know that they were speaking the truth,I changed a lot because of him,I stopped drinking soda(which I loved!) and doing other things in my house and pretty much I spend a lot of time with my bedroom door closed to avoid him,because everytime I see him,he doesn't say anything good to me,only  criticizes the way I am.I once was a kid who smiled everytime and was just happy,but now I am a person who just stopped caring too much about other people,just faking being okay when i am not(i am not saying that I am depressed,I just can't hold my problems anymore),it's like I wanna thrown up all the problems I am just  swallowing.",02Apr2020,1
908,"I think the big problem with many people, myself included, is that life can be really meager in what you achieve.

I want to be able to ask myself at the end of any given day, if I were to die tomorrow, would I have made a difference?

Honestly, if I were to die tomorrow, my friends and family would feel really sad, but the world would not have lost all that much. My book club might start feeling really empty, but the world would not take such a big hit.

When coronavirus calms down, I am thinking of becoming a nurse. The caveat to that is how society views nurses on a micro-level.

This might be because I grew up in a toxically elitist part of the country, but the way society views nurses is not favorable. If you ask someone what they think of nurses and teachers as a whole, that person would probably say “I love them.” If you ask someone what they think of their own child becoming a nurse, that person would probably be opposed.

Also, the dating game is completely different for respectable people who don't make a lot of money.

My parents didn’t want me to go into nursing, since they are both physicians, and if I went into healthcare at all, they wanted me to be a physician too. Realistically, I do not have it in me to be a doctor. I cannot study my ass off as an undergrad, go to medical school for four long tiring years, and then go through who-knows-how-many years of residency. That’s not me. I don’t feel bad about it. I’m just not that ambitious.

I’m almost done with college, and I have just had this epiphany. It's difficult to tell my parents that I'm throwing away my undergrad degree and going to nursing school.

I might be approaching this unreasonably. I'm kind of frustrated overall though right now. During this time, I could have been on the front lines saving lives if I had not been discouraged from going into a career like nursing.

I think a possible means of going about this is starting off by working part time, and attending an associates of nursing program.",02Apr2020,1

918,"I'm 19 this year, I'm supposed to write external exams in May. The government does not want to postpone any exams due to the pandemic - if they cancel exams it means that they also should cancel presidential election, which is the ruling party's priority atm (even though 80% of citizens don't want any elections right now because THE PANDEMIC). So right now I'm set to take finals starting on May 4th. 

It's dangerous, risky, hazardous, any word you can pick. There are more and more people getting sick every day. It's just not a good idea to gather so many young people at this time. So I'm considering not going if the exams are not postponed. My reasons:

1) THE PANDEMIC. No university in my country is worth risking so much damage to my community and even to myself, since there are more and more healthy young people dying from COVID-19. If they want to gather us in schools in early May like nothing happens we could've been going to schools all this time and save everybody the headache of ""online schools"". 

2) Honestly, fuck this government. They're basically holding hundreds of thousands of young people hostage, having us wait for ANY information whether the exams are postponed or if we have to choose between health or ""future"". It's been two weeks, if not more, of this bullshit. We haven't been to schools in almost a month, studying at home is proving to be a challenge for almost everybody, especially when THE WORLD IS ON FIRE, e-learning is a miserable joke that only makes everyone (teachers, students, principals) lose their minds. And I feel like I'm dying and I want to rebel. 

3) I honestly don't see myself pursuing higher education without being absolutely miserable. I can't pick just one area of interest to focus on because that one area I'd thrive in doesn't exist. After 12 years of compulsory education I'm fed up with the system, I just want to go my own way for once.

What are your thoughts?   
Tbh I'm hoping they'll just cancel the thing altogether but you can't tell under dictatorship.

However, I tried to tell him that I was very worried about the consequences, and he told me to calm down and that he's putting in more effort into our relationship because he's the one who's flying over here, spending his money, and I don't even want to try. He has this idea that I don't want to meet him because I brought up how things would be difficult for us if he comes during this time. 
How should I approach this issue? I want to be straightforward about him not coming this month but I'm nervous about him thinking that I don't want to meet him.",02Apr2020,1

921,"I’m female, 20 nearly 21.

I’ve been with my boyfriend 3 and a half years, we’re really in love and I truly believe this will be the man I’ll spend the rest of my life with.

When I was 9 I was sexually abused by my father on three occasions. He knows this.

For the first year or so, our sex was really often and really passionate. After that, I went through a long phase of just crying every time we’d start having sex, and I’d cry so much each time that I’d have a panic attack. I couldn’t get into it at all and every time we went to have intercourse, every memory came flooding back. Over and over.

Then our sex picked up again after about 6 months; we’d have it say once a week and it was nice. This lasted about another 6 months.

Since then, I don’t want sex at all anymore. We get to it and I have to say I need to stop, and I’ll go to the bathroom and just cry my eyes out.

My boyfriend is a really sexual person, and would have sex a million times a week if it were possible. One thing that really drags me down is that he always tries to talk about sex through text, like three or four times a day. I’ve told him so many times the feeling that this gives me, like the same pressure I felt when I was young. He’s always been so so understanding about everything in my past, but the attempting to sext never seems to go away after saying he won’t do it. I sent him a text today saying I’ve had enough of him not listening to me and he pleaded with me and repeated over and over that he is so sorry and didn’t mean to hurt me, and that he can’t help the way he is.

Please can someone be honest with me and tell me if this will ruin my relationship. I know I’m not normal and I don’t know what to do. I trust him with everything and I know he’s obsessed with me, but I’m just waiting to be cheated on because I’m clearly fucked in the head.

Thanks all x",02Apr2020,1
922,"im sick an tired of keeping it inside! i need to let it out and i heard somewere that writing it down helps. so im going to try that and its propably the only thing im ever going to try to make it better.

My heart hurts alltho ive never loved before. i feel lost in my own room nowere to hide nowere to hold on. im just falling. u cant run from urself, from all of that heavy pain in ur chest, that awful feeling in ur throat right before u cry. it feels like suffecating on toxic black gue, like falling into a deep deep pit of it. all edges far away nowere to pull urself out. as u slowly start to lose all hope and ur head goes under gue aswell and u cant hold ur breath anymore-
what happens then?

u die. or so i thought but no. no dieing wasnt the thing i was afraid of. no, it was rather what followed:
 the sticky gue filling ur lungs the endless heavy pain in ur chest, the longing to just throw it up and get it out but what if, what if u were to afraid to let it out. to afraid to let people see whats inside of u .

too afraid to let them know.

i know i need help.i really do.

but i dont know why im not telling, all i know is that its the last thing i want to do right now.

well maybe some part of me wants to tell but its weak, it only managed to make me write and draw sad things.like this. but its no use. i know. in a few days, heck maybe even tomorrow. i will look at this and think: wow im dumb and being so dramatic. its not even that bad! ur just a child! ur 14 its normal to feel that way, and think ur special. theres nothing intresting about me. im just a dramatic 14 year old that doesnt know what im talking about.

or maybe im just telling myself that, so i wont need to hear it from other people.

u see thats the problem:  I DONT FUCKING KNOW ANYMORE

there are so many opinions in my head and i dont know wich one to listen to.",02Apr2020,1

925,"So I’m 26 years old, I have a beautiful fiancé who I am marrying in November, and I still live in my parents house. We planned on getting an apartment a few months before our wedding and I would live there/ set it up and then we would move in together after wedding.. now, my sister moved back into my parents house because they sold theirs, they were to stay here as they searched for a new home.. now; the tides have changed, my parents had always said they were going to sell the house after my wedding.. but now my sister is going to buy the house and my parents are moving out next month..the only agreement my parents made was that they had to let me live her rent free till my wedding. 

So now I’ll be living in my sisters house technically with her husband and 3 kids.. and we do not get along well.. her and her husband are both very bitter people and it’s their way or the high way.. very straight edge with no hobbies.. 

Therefore even tho I wouldn’t have to pay rent, due to my non existent relationship with them,  I decided to find an apartment and move out now, this is upsetting my mom and dad because they say they feel guilty because now I’m going to be wasting money on rent, when if they weren’t to have sold house I would have just stayed home.. it’s true; but I’m ready.. but their making me feel bad about it and I wanted someone else’s opinion from the outside 

I just don’t want to live in this house anymore knowing it’s their house.. 

I am afraid for the bills but I know I will make it work.. I feel like this will light a fire under my butt",02Apr2020,1

927,"So that covid bs going on and all I can think about is ez we've got it. Sure it's deadly but it's far from a worse case scenario. Trump said their would be a vaccine in 2 weeks, but honestly I believe humanity could make a vaccine in a day maybe a few hours. Humanity has landed on the moon. On. The. Moon. We've developed weapons that can incinerate whole cities. We've built the electric grid and eradicated small pox. You can't look me in the eyes and tell me it's not possible. I don't think covid19 is some conspiracy. I honestly think humanity is just to much of a failure to handle the situation correctly.

I’ve been getting multiple emails from ‘Instagram’ tonight, (quite literally 7) over the span of about 2 hours, all saying they’ve ‘noticed a login from a device you don’t normally use.’ All the locations of these supposed logins are places like Iraq, Iran etc. 

Now, Instagram has a feature that allows you to see what emails they’ve sent you to ensure you don’t fall into any phishing traps so I checked it and lo and behold, Instagram themselves said they’ve sent nothing. 

I’m just wondering, at this point, what I can do about these emails and if I should be worried about anything?

I had already called in once yesterday just to be safe because now's not the time to be sucking it up and going to work. My next shift is tomorrow and I haven't improved.

931,"For backstory my mum tends to be overprotective, sometimes it’s justified sometimes it’s not, she believed if I had any social media I’d automatically get groomed and that if I walked more than a mile away from home I’d probably get kidnapped. To her credit, she did save me from an awful relationship in which I was being emotionally blackmailed but only through invading my privacy by going through my entire phone. Anyway 

It is me and my significant others 1 year anniversary next week and I want to see him, we had big plans and it was the only thing I had been looking forward to recently. I have not seen him in weeks aside from delivering him a birthday cake wherein my mum watched from the car to ensure I did not touch him and we stayed apart , this is because of Covid 19. And yes, his mother did get it. However the 2 week period of their self isolation has now ended and non of them have any symptoms. Now, since I have not seen him I wanted to go to his, as the pandemic has disrupted our plans. FYI this would involve only being in contact with him, barely any contact with his mother and sister as we generally stay far away anyway. My mother has screamed and shouted at me after asking reading out loud articles to me about how if anyone leaves their houses they’ll automatically infect everyone. I haven’t been outside in weeks the only person that could have come into contact with the virus is HER. I have asthma and I have been separating myself from her due to this fact. 

Yes I understand there is a pandemic going on, no I don’t think there would be a risk when it comes to me going to see him, no one is elderly involved and no one would be at risk as his family has already had it and have come out of the 2 week period. I myself am a cautious person and I want to avoid it but I also believe that I would not be at risk going to see him.

My anniversary was very important to me, I missed his birthday too. And no , to the people reading this thinking “can’t
You just wait and celebrate some other time” IT WILL NOT BE THE SAME. To me dates are very important, some other random day in which I will see him months from now will not be the same as the day I have been planning for months as a celebration, it will be just another day, and while I will cherish it, I will not remember it. As for my mother I understand her anger towards me for wanting to go, she is worried for herself and me, she says it is too risky to go  but, surely it would be safer going someplace where no one is continuing to go to work and already had immunity. 

Most of you probably think
I’m selfish... and that’s why I’m asking for others opinions, I’m going back and fourth about this. I have never been able to go to his without asking first and I don’t think I should have to ask when it comes to my relationship. We’ve been fighting a lot due to not having seen eachother and his anger about me not just telling my mother I’m going and it’s not her choice has become a big issue. I don’t want to lose him. I love him and he loves me, it’s tearing us apart we can’t see eachother. Everyone else gets happy celebrations, why can’t we",02Apr2020,1
